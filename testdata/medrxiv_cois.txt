"Competing Interest Statement Harvard University has filed patent applications regarding this technology on behalf of the inventors. Harvard believes strongly that while intellectual property rights serve to incentivize creation of new products, such rights should not become a barrier to addressing urgent and essential health-related needs. To address the global COVID-19 pandemic, Harvard is implementing technology transfer strategies to allow for rapid utilization of available technologies that may be useful for preventing, diagnosing and treating COVID-19 infection. More information can be found at otd.harvard.edu. Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. We are grateful for the sharing of ideas and reagents with Nathan Tanner of NEB. Helpful discussions with Michael Springer of the Systems Biology Department of HMS are also gratefully acknowledged, particularly regarding the suggestion to use TCEP rather than DTT for the inactivation step. We were also guided in the development of these assays through helpful discussions with our colleagues, Melis Anahtar and Graham McGrath, of the Clinical Microbiology Department at the Massachusetts General Hospital. We would like to thank Jenne Etter, HMS Genetics Department Research Operation Manager, as well as HMS security, facilities, and delivery personnel for supporting our work during this challenging time.

"Competing Interest Statement ID has been filed based on the methods used in this paper Acknowledgments We would like to thank members of the genome engineering and synthetic biology laboratory for insightful discussions and technical support. We thank Professor Andrew Ellington for providing the RTx and BstI clones. This work was supported, in part, by the Smart Health Initiative at KAUST and the IAF grant from the KAUST IED to MM. The samples were collected from patients providing verbal consent to the treating doctor after they read the patient consent form, or the doctor explained the content of consent form to the patient. Hence, as per the approved protocol, the doctors took samples only after receiving verbal consent from a concerned patient (due to infection hazard and no family member being available next to the patients due to infection control guidelines) and the treating doctor signed on the consent form on behalf of the patient before any sample collection took place. We have obtained the necessary ethical approval from the Saudi-MOH and the Mass Gathering directorate in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for the collection of the samples (Saudi MOH Approval #: H-02-K-076-0420-285, dated 13.04.2020; KAUST Approval #: 20IBEC14).

Extended Data Fig. 1. Meta-analysis of respiratory viral loads of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 during the infectious period. Random-effects meta-analyses comparing the expected rVLs for COVID-19, SARS and A(H1N1)pdm09 cases during the infectious period. Quantitative specimen measurements were used to estimate rVLs, which refer to virus concentrations in the respiratory tract. Case types: hospitalized (H), not admitted (N), community (C), adult (A), pediatric (P), symptomatic (S), presymptomatic (Ps) and asymptomatic (As). Specimen types: endotracheal aspirate (ETA), nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), posterior oropharyngeal saliva (POS) and sputum (Spu). Studies after ref. 35 are listed in Methods. Dashes denote case numbers that were not obtained. Box sizes are proportional to weighting in the overall estimates. Two-sided Welch’s t -test (relative to SARS-CoV-2), non-significance ( p >0.05). Extended Data Fig. 2.

These categories included only rVL data from positive (above the detection limit) qRT-PCR measurements. The p -values were determined using the modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the goodness of fit of the distributions. When the null hypothesis is accepted (NS at p >0.05), the probability density function cannot be rejected to describe the distribution of the data. Blue circles, black lines and red lines represent individual sample data, expected distributions and 95% CIs, respectively. m-o , Histograms and fitted Weibull distributions of the above data for SARS-CoV-2 ( m ), SARS-CoV-1 ( n ) and A(H1N1)pdm09 ( o ).
