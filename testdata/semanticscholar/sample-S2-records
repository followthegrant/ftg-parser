Randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of antipsychotics in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and disruptive behavior disorders (DBD). Areas covered: The authors systematically analyze the results of randomized controlled trials of second and third generation antipsychotics for irritability in ASD and aggressive and disruptive behavior in DBD with or without low IQ and ADHD. The aim of the review is to assist healthcare professionals to optimize therapy in this population. Expert opinion: There is evidence to support the short-term efficacy of risperidone and aripiprazole for irritability in ASD, and short-term efficacy of risperidone for aggressive and disruptive behavior in DBD, although the benefits are closely balanced with an increased risk of metabolic, hormonal and extrapyramidal adverse effects. The use of antipsychotics in children with these disorders should be reserved for those refractory to first and second-line therapies, and in whom there is a persistent and serious risk of harm to self or others. Antipsychotics should be considered a short-term strategy while psychosocial and behavioral therapies are continuously employed.","authors":[{"name":"Samreen  Shafiq","ids":["2066347761"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Tamara  Pringsheim","ids":["5208695"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":["3121349fcfe83cea52518725c933800fdde97483","db7ffb6349e7027822b3110a5b699c1ebe39302d","3818f5e05cee10d52f24ffed946e1d851f3571e7","36faa4f0521c604506ae02a23442ed258334e7ca","89c354eec643c20982914c0a850165b17a9a4781","7eb72d8bb19975728b36bc99311cd9fd904173a8","91aed1ff25aa40de2ed244e4d984134407799388","06b4c4dd85a64536a4bb6b6cebb860eb53953b77","6e4da910aa64766e96c484e1cfd04d7dc00e06ed","e3382019ccbd1a66d3ce94a11749209183844ea6","a9232e94009d32ec5a83f4870e49f32b60a36f31"],"outCitations":["01df78fbaa2c474e3bd5e33a9abfa42124c03a45","3930bbc7ed49164ded113c1cd6c20e507efefcb6","931e269b19887aeeccc9e22daa19d5f233742759","ed2518404ed4bc9e9a9917ae23c74e404441052d","c16d508eeec8b1632eb2fdeb5fc9ac4d47d6df24","9e2ae14a739ace6d3983a346cdf9a230762b6cea","4361beeb8b902fbc99e1b1ad863960f4b29a1083","6aa85f0e041573fcbaa28ad5a296316a9b3be264","468879514fbcaa729ec034109e989e1a99b3057e","cf7bd4cc2bed992d6ea39bc3c3bf6bf540a5eec4","27d999d66f830a9145371a17acb3b056949ac515","22265a2ab1b264ffc40b48d15ce74ffac355860b","f3873fe8a2445a35bdb4dd28ca5493a55cbbe6e8","68d6b0e76f66891f6dae709baee532eb247f4079","59227be90b990835b22f2c2aee87c97c1e36031d","511a2db452853d925ed507b96c61c2372adf02cd","64146ec71ce05db573cd02bd5f8c8d51c042a9d8","1c889abfc08a3676e00f1fee4d144b6704dd2074","a149edaf8537c414bfa757c6b7bc9fb1318efd34","f876ebea0173ec80d6279bcd7ec41ee31cabeb52","1612aafd531bc6f136dc7f202b98d6a49f5149da","2f46365c008965dcd41306da44dd8b65a0d3ada4","49301cdf37e51eab6efee7c7b48644e87d868e42","accc6e4642ae0b313823c4d6fe1e9af283f91aef","7fbb6c0f06508bac974f47cda75e0e90dcae16c8","af2c106069ff60e1549244b2f00929e08e5b3b88","0ec7800581425ce8662fec80dcf4e75812b077df","7cbfc004762bfc8cb126db70a8ac878dc0e98f98","5dda0f3622228dbff5ac786af5c39eb7e3d7c380","8eb1379b8a52910015a98602ef040a1e2839ed89","94383a0e88ffc7ffa0fc2c637cdf8f752ab7df6f","94b26de7c2b5bdc736132c34dbd133e923eabe68","1d51855389c7aeae2000155915e18634a1f3609f","9fcab3c9e36d5b41df18bfd9414dfdc3acfa0732","d8870b4871b5b4ac2bd3b4c170b911f4b4d8394a","3d8270085df0be2cbf9d2e7388a646f229b885c7","962c22e06a6b9b43e55063368aacb03f2e023050","2c7c36219ef657ce80ba816d96630d89847a5c59","8cd0283da079e60168fe3c259485ffd3fa8a6d2c","3b0dc6b2e3c8baa9101d37566d41e13698d01487","53edfaea55481003a16ca87c2b5bfae66007d039","2494294303492cc662a2c30def642c4826a98107","510e2fd4af7c32c9427ecebee3ab44f6ac8f1608","9e743892d98d6e774c407f87f81286525ce140c8","d7d985b6ab89873d58d2bb05dffeb39d90c3a30f","5cb02ee6c3aaa993beaf5ce1379539f54d9d5d61","d268d8828761b480517624d4e2911974af06719d","1d382fdc690929b11eb1918e1d80fc5608a02365","835b1148fed6a6905a37da1a2d552f6a53d38c11","594596f02313d57f93d22a87af533b862138ff20","a9d5c11f0124cd00d33a5bd2a1beb749d44655d8","e19cba0200090a1c2fcb84686cdfcb945079d6b2","d532235813cd4a4ac1f02bfefe1157fc13c94947","6c59acdea9918fc1946264a625de468dead003b7","c29a2cd1c895fb79534fadcf1b478803d780d687","7da042a989dbf68ebbc0dfb2e9bf22f76a00fc3a","3ff1ceef958c43200c17043608459d344435d77a","5e66e24995bc61aa1fd32020c0ccb64d296002a3","67c80808fa129e880eef3280c225d6058d54633f","84e1555b995d8343bf9803b5384d5f8891cd7d8f","4bd615d66d11003af6c4f5d790422499156d9e5a","54b8e548e48e4fe877a58b97551922736df669ab","6e5bdedfbb4d2eedf814cd58d9eb772c9b5b4382"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/de3b76509ef412ed878a9e6a334c4ea53259c47c","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy","journalName":"Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy","journalVolume":"19","journalPages":"1475 - 1488","doi":"10.1080/14656566.2018.1509069","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2018.1509069","pmid":"30102079","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"magId":"2886325734","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

{"id":"de123b703440d802168329f9f952dfcacac96494","title":"1 Background : Information Diffusion in Village Networks","paperAbstract":"Several recent research initiatives in the field of Development Economics have studied and provided substantial insight into the mechanics of information diffusal in small village social networks, in particular those without formal mass communication infrastructure in place (i.e., email, television). This research aims to further explore the dynamics of communication in these networks, focusing on the possibility that village households share and withold information strategically, only sharing with neighbors exhibiting certain characteristics, in an individually rational manner. A model of probabilistic information diffusion is developed, the parameters of which are estimated via the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and tested with empirical data. 1 Background: Information Diffusion in Village Networks Banerjee, et al. (2013) studied the way in which the spread of information about microfinance programs is affected by whom in the community the information is given to initially (the “information injection point”), finding that giving the information to more central figures in the community significantly increases the diffusal of the information throughout the village [1]. Conley and Udry (2008) studied the adoption of new agricultural technology in Ghana from a social network standpoint, and concluded that “information has value in these villages, as do the network connections through which that information flows” [4]. Most recently, Breza and Chandrasekhar (2013) explored the possibility that microloan recipients in rural villages of Karnataka, India can be influenced to save and invest these loans more efficiently if they are paired with a peer monitor who is influential in the village, and indeed found that “randomly assigned central monitors generate considerably larger increases in savings attainment” [2]. 2 Generalized Method of Moments Estimation Before presenting the model, we describe the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) Estimation framework, as this is the crucial statistical (and CS229-related) tool used in this work. GMM is a generalization of Maximum Likelihood Estimation, which is used primarily in econometrics to learn optimal model parameter estimates when the probability distribution of the data is not fully specified or completely unknown and thus MLE is not feasible. We will see, however, that if this distribution is specified we can recover the maximum likelihood estimator from within the GMM framework. The efficacy of a particular GMM estimation depends upon the specification of informative moment conditions, characteristics of the data which will be used to “match up” the data generated by the model","authors":[{"name":"Jeff  Jacobs","ids":["144435054"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["864370e652f3e287f317ea889124ca2582c73cf5","045f9f5baee3c1f4e6089e4b073dd84d6624c77a","b2d5fe5f9930965e14d9a3ad2cf38feb8eae3767","cbed0014ac5ff4338d6a2b237a7402d6e57cfcc9","4e03ce407b7488dd92cfc7c50c357c0331b49d22"],"year":2013,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/de123b703440d802168329f9f952dfcacac96494","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2013/Jacobs-ModelingStrategicInformationDiffusal.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":[],"magId":"","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

Actual design work was started after defining the objectives and the design environment. A bottom-up approach to design was adopted. Starting at the base level, a clear understanding of the format and contents of CA SEARCH was obtained. The design objectives were than encompassed by gradually moving upwards in the design work. The specific design steps are: analysis and definition of CA SEARCH format, study, of information content, decision on database access elements and search strategy, generating quantitative data for file design, file structure design, batch and online search system design. These steps were then followed by implementing the production system.","authors":[{"name":"Tb  Rajashekar","ids":["145551505"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"K. T.

Ice crystals of 3 “traditional” (milk proteins and stabilisers) and 2 vegan (inulin and potato proteins) ice cream formulations were studied using a cold stage microscope under frozen conditions. Samples were observed before and after a temperature fluctuation (cycles of −18 °C and −6 °C for 14 days), and the data obtained compared with the results of a melting test. Results showed that milk proteins and stabilisers conferred structural stability to ice cream, both in terms of small crystal size (20–50 μm) and behaviour during melting, suitable for storage. Ice creams without one of the two constituents or in presence of potato proteins or inulin, showed a crystal size increase; in this case ice creams were for immediate consumption.","authors":[{"name":"Giovanna  Lomolino","ids":["16225084"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Stefania  Zannoni","ids":["3659099"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Andrada  Zabara","ids":["1392360361"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Matteo  Da Lio","ids":["2127944109"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Alberto  De Iseppi","ids":["51040286"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":["adad590257fcb28ff4d8fb9496eb2bd97f1413f9","74ff49abb7d27abb1162c85837e0121ddc42c662","a552da27e0a0b3aed968f080a1cef3a64009969a","0ca694e6c0b84c4ee41d78c60411d5c0934cf563","57e49fc5422627f055c13e4957849c6df2e57e19","8bc3d5f75d7b7babcce9bf5d1bcda6e80a306f94","1f87853778c278227ae91f5e158f48690a695e17","5635d7e3f232f9052096ec2ce5fbd9315c3cfb2d"],"outCitations":["798a6e4af546a008b39c7b9f6ad4f4af48f46b9b","daa07a1b058e997f45b1ed185761fd3b61062841","a94ef07568c932d06011e47431717787b6a6c11b","241893d4977d9abb8efd76504135acce77a58525","e569ad6f7e7f11599db8133e2740bb7f35ab4eac","ddcc2cc55eee0b22a69bb372a6df9f8a9a253ff8","3753c6814d2e576251285e32bd2aacd03363a027","d9165bf08260248df7f3c155ce2398de2085a864","8d3fe7c7af49d6b4f0ed618092b31837c05aebf8","c85cc647c9d859ad486acc6309e96a687fe63617","af0138eccca0898e3450c8ef3db6c4ac4c27973f","5ae87a022238dcc630f8503ac0aec86d74d7a8f7","2e3f2eea5d9ff0e066eb4fc81782542422e7c36a","9428676f8c6b4bc8825d68e9868fa9e4984fc1a0","37cefe2b0910f7770355e85287825fed9d338083","711dc52310e30f20e0afd4cd10f6c6ffd5261377","ef45f00cb857ef7726d1707f87ff5129e159ee78"],"year":2020,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cab8ebe2867fc76c3258f3dab643f3eaea228e54","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://didatticagelato.it/wp-content/uploads/simple-file-list/Ice-recrystallisation-and-melting-in-ice-cream-with-different-proteins-levels-and-subjected-to-thermal-fluctuation.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"International Dairy Journal","journalVolume":"100","journalPages":"104557","doi":"10.1016/j.idairyj.2019.104557","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2019.104557","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"magId":"2972701068","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

Unlike prior studies, the data used in this analysis are market values of assets and liabilities. Market values were obtained from the base case (no interest rate change) in the Office of Thrift Supervision's (OTS) Net Portfolio Value Model. This model calculates the value of all of a thrift's positions to calculate the value at risk. We determine the consistency of theories of derivatives use with the characteristics of derivatives users.","authors":[{"name":"Arthur M.B.

In recent years, the FPGA implementation for CNNs has attracted much attention because of its high performance and energy efficiency. However, existing implementations have difficulty to fully leverage the computation power of the latest FPGAs. In this paper we implement CNN on an FPGA using a systolic array architecture, which can achieve high clock frequency under high resource utilization. We provide an analytical model for performance and resource utilization and develop an automatic design space exploration framework, as well as source-to-source code transformation from a C program to a CNN implementation using systolic array. The experimental results show that our framework is able to generate the accelerator for real-life CNN models, achieving up to 461 GFlops for floating point data type and 1.2 Tops for 8–16 bit fixed point.","authors":[{"name":"Xuechao  Wei","ids":["1802481"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Cody Hao Yu","ids":["17813719"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Peng

Three reduced regular conditions, which are more convenient to be used than Walker's and Heyde's, are presented. The theorem, which shows under certain regular condition the poster distribution is not only consistent, but also approximately normal, is proved. Since the computation of normal distribution is relatively simpler, then the results can become the theoretic foundation for further study, for instance, assigning results prior distribution and simplifying the computation in Bayesian learning.","authors":[{"name":"Zhen-Yu","ids":["2094888298"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Shi-Min  Lin","ids":["2108835388"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Yu-Chang  Lu","ids":["32627712"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["2f4cc7791d34fd5be4d3299580998424702794c4","c76ac0a39577760d4aaf6fce98327543ec64a560","bd2d855d1a1fb161a301f0d3020a579891dd8b64","7b03fd5101079d47029bedd702fd2aff7cc00ebe","a503acd3d202cd298f16811a2ace6421a3065cb8","15fa2a266741383811c7acd4298ce54627e5186f","2086fe71a443512cd7efe50828fef81be59fe719","831774cea51dac35ff48d211fb2e417b10b00e18","a4f39acc546e051acd676ce94717f1cfb00ab3fb","5c63ab340634a23b84a233f1a7725c4b5ddffe9c"],"year":2003,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/211a3a31c3dbf19769ea9d34ef241df9ea676b98","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Proceedings of the 2003 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (IEEE Cat.

RECOGNIZING INTANGIBLE HERITAGE AND DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES - Intangible Heritage as a Driver of Cultural Landscape Management and Holistic Conservation /// \n \nThis paper chronicles the evolution of the IUCN Specialist Group on the Cultural and Spiritual \nValues of Protected Areas (CSVPA) with a focus on the development of its current Cultural and Spiritual Nature Program, which includes IUCN Best Practices Guidelines, a peer-reviewed book, training modules, case studies, and a network - all dedicated to promoting and integrating \nthe cultural and spiritual significance of nature in the management and governance of protected and conserved areas. The program is being developed in conjunction with the IUCN ICOMOS Nature Culture and Culture Nature Journeys and seeks to create a comprehensive approach to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage. Six principles distilled from the input of 200 international experts and reviewers through editorial work and workshops at the World Parks Congress in Australia, the World Conservation Congress in Hawai’i, and the Isle of Vilm in Germany provide key insights and lessons learned. The paper concludes with next steps for implementing the Best Practice Guidelines through the development of training modules and workshops and a network for providing support and sharing experiences.","authors":[{"name":"Edwin  Bernbaum","ids":["90650606"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Bas  Verschuuren","ids":["74244324"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":["65c70bc56e01225f68f40c7b1bc538df72609166"],"outCitations":["e38682e761a2aecbd84b5fe11365694605ef873b","5fcc961f36b9c7a591e7eca6724f0dd731317301","0684641f453d2b682692b1e62b37465f3306d505","f32b16b09f6585123a6d7037fb8b13c5ad0c78ff","24db6075c778c12582719318995fb856cf3a1a9b","954aae530759febd455a6e28e15a667cc74f34cf","14b72c581a59da554d257ae8c3a77ee76008d643","40a52f424ef3b0c2720e97a6720b108f6f70ea46","fcdf833578b77a8cbaf08088fce0911220128ca6","e644c37a9fd45840ba0623541ca3793d478b0053"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9745fd3e345bbd5cae5715a34dc1d9e45ca9c820","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://www.georgewright.org/342bernbaum.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Political Science"],"magId":"2999504203","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}
{"id":"e754d8f0d022fce5f72647e3b33f559770301f87","title":"Timing of Atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic Temperature Changes Across Termination III","paperAbstract":"The analysis of air bubbles from ice cores has yielded a precise record of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, but the timing of changes in these gases with respect to temperature is not accurately known because of uncertainty in the gas age–ice age difference. We have measured the isotopic composition of argon in air bubbles in the Vostok core during Termination III (∼240,000 years before the present). This record most likely reflects the temperature and accumulation change, although the mechanism remains unclear. The sequence of events during Termination III suggests that the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 ± 200 years and preceded the Northern Hemisphere deglaciation.","authors":[{"name":"Nicolas  Caillon","ids":["7581814"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Jeffrey P Severinghaus","ids":["5599650"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Jean

In Ecuador this problem has increased due to lack of policies and good planning, derived in a social, environmental and economic. Therefore to locate potential sites for a landfill is required Complete analysis according to various location criteria and an analysis of the current situation in the area. The methodology is based on the establishment of restrictive criteria TULSMA national legislation, and the EPA, which gave the map location of infrastructure for solid waste disposal. The viewshed are necessary for this type of study, since getting the visible areas, you can locate potential sites for the location of a landfill, it is also necessary to conduct an analysis of alternatives, based on their population, population growth and area for potential landfill (20 year life). Evaluating the current state of the landscape is needed when locating a landfill for a qualitative analysis of the alternatives through tabs scenic quality assessment.","authors":[{"name":"Paz  Flores","ids":["116550801"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Gabriela  Paola","ids":["82592019"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2013,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/00ee8074bd8a8621bc3faee908b80e85f5467576","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://repositorio.espe.edu.ec/bitstream/21000/6703/1/AC-GMA-ESPE-047037.pdf"],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Geography"],"magId":"2311941833","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

In this study, a static measure of performance is used to determine whether tax levels are high or low in South Africa relative to other countries. The representative tax system approach measures average effective rates for a sample of countries. The effective tax rates are applied to a set of tax bases for the sample of countries to obtain the yield of the representative tax system. The ratio of the actual yield to the representative yield is the tax effort index. The results show that the South African revenue authorities outperform comparable countries. When the different tax classes are considered, it appears that South Africa uses personal income tax and corporate income tax very intensively, but the value added tax (VAT) effort index and the effective VAT rate are low. In comparative terms, the total tax burden is high. The tax policy implications are lower personal income tax levels and corporate tax rates. Revenue losses from lower income taxes may require the implementation of higher VAT rates.","authors":[{"name":"T. J.

{"id":"87ace84426bff6abcbc722c58d96bb0562d0b8c7","title":"Evolution of the neobladder: A critical review of open and intracorporeal neobladder reconstruction techniques","paperAbstract":"Abstract Orthotopic neobladder is an attractive alternative to the ileal conduit following radical cystectomy. Robotic cystectomy is gaining popularity although the uptake of neobladder reconstruction is low, with the majority of cases being constructed extracorporeally via a mini-laparotomy. Minimally invasive cystectomy using the robotic platform facilitates intracorporeal neobladder reconstruction and several techniques have been described. This review discusses issues relating to patient selection, and describes existing techniques of open surgical neobladder reconstruction and their evolution to suit an intracorporeal approach. A Medline search for publications from January 1970 to September 2015 with the following keyword search criteria was performed: radical cystectomy, robotic cystectomy, intracorporeal, neobladder, orthotopic bladder reconstruction, surgical technique, patient selection and ureteric–ileal anastomosis.","authors":[{"name":"Wei Shen Tan","ids":["46998085"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Benjamin W Lamb","ids":["5815623"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"John D Kelly","ids":["79048709"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":["2c8638b2c1be9f9dbdd5fb02275f7c8aa234c55b","d6fa18be7ddea7767b3209915a11eebcb1b012d9","784faf4e93efc25414be72d89886a9e72afab92f","5fcda0d8281171b25ebb224808a0dfc092fdfa26","509c492b455bd33f8160dc64ca7a53af0d87d552","5d8fb2b9f0b73f99d7cf1d8770bb947f64dec1e5","35b0ef806d76877661438b878affc04d8372f855","43fddbeada480fa3a5a800bcadadf399e81b5ca0","1d6be3024d0798aa1bcc35ec87771fad0d87c049","a2c1362459a88252bace99507e968240979edee2","16184c474783ca00a476ea1b4dc0f5c9288be20f","8abb51c62470cdb84c563b0d4a7e6ba123d4d378","f516115b573979971e348f98ff47c50987a12b6d","9bdb7b1f186cd6067333b4260e213d79f854eeef","e709ecf0869075e02f08211937383427e3c37d74","c84a9d72fdb89ca41823c8f7483ae429ee7a75c9","711ed4a56f388e3d009664b8b23be3da21129ec9","4a7428c6c4efe842216d0993bc36ad9434c74186","35e800a3af55a35f7fb84b6f58052773524343ac","21595446b8f68c1e8d0ab09bbfa422ec43dbeda2","f5168d04d2caaff795e324a48603734c2706de7c"],"outCitations":["6f9aa8a2a0d7e4194d65e0907c57790659df4c22","15ca15fd06cb13f62e73cec975ff05c25d550c06","c2f1be71eb1f6f3994c2185419ead144f166504e","7efa8ea40a5c3c4170f207598d44053fbd06979d","c8b9f7505edaf3d22f713d7e6f27f498f7b2fa97","dfadf72691b8157755d9e7c74cfb2bc12fd56c81","6cab87870b5383a042f696d59dff6a67ef3c33ac","04895afbc6802fb76a58024a061fab0e42e2b616","5f4646b47530247be5a6fa28254649a86bdf7cb2","435f796c3fc85c2b8da2fa6de813324793a53bf6","af1b0aad4b04407f1dfee58d4d2738253674621a","44dddd9fe593322b9b693f7c6c779af793b4a5ee","40372b0dce72f8b87b8a7607af134f00f69f6904","7dae349fffb9b936131cf95c1b38bf49f7cef9cc","6761ae3830ff66670209ffa39c1e907eb7d7aaff","78295a7a7a5c9599862c5d8269983052b4cb8414","a3b32e43837585f7529cbaf917398026399fc0fa","1dd7e1f34ffe548f7c76c56cdb55193c86a2ed99","da897ffdc1d8047fc9bc6d0eab1eea2ba4b0154a","0d8b0b3254b74d36244e97308cf2667ddfe9d383","298003fe01a93c9b51fedca1b96a5f9eb10d6686","0683f34a09ebabf08dd85f463b3cbcaf750f9150","dcce73b23722f47965ee3f3b49e4e550d746fabe","7d2e5633876caa6775a349aa39d18c90b130921a","105c3e2bd32341b1a7470934dd9588b353ed7319","cf4aa7b880a588c0dad45c55db950d913667f65d","7aaa64055059f5cc2377c49bf62f0666959e80a2","2c89719c38be89f7daa3c356e1e9e979ae9aa354","b111dbed20e5cf94df421b8b10ad9e3dd07ac07b","fe08868f6bbf54b41dbff5d9d28379b0c56676e2","df7d7eb02fcc4d18aa91d0c291cf9890f283d3f9","f88d86b508706fad3ee3809fc5b1a671c66ccb68","936cb2cbf88d741ae6860ccf3ba37af326ea81fb","89d5ddbeef41d30630eb4120b1de13634048f61c","8a6ba2c11b364334595ee6731ec1bd8b9b87c3ff","45dfc751a77ffece7f79ae5b3cf1ea8c4c14f75e","7a3e025712852e0639807c1cc3fc4687695681cd","b25c10170da8d722939abfe1cfbf5b7b48a3b8b6","2c9e64184320811628801e4ac412003386a7d832","95a43d0787dff1b21a7e64de7dd58ac60d3108b6","b933d2b1d88f07dba6b89b5d23094b25e4ae9cc7","c225142b6725cc3943fa3baa7eaaceb03500d803","033201a267452aecda57ece4d014fcef4ff3e4ee","808677577de21cf3e10b79208c206932d4f78093","2514045248d6d0daa573d7c3663e6c5705b31527","90131cc65c4d02c360faf40944387ae9cbc94d18","858d0e035b108a409658b52207adf70dd9dddbfe","0ce095fa18fe4aed1b1b217884cdb384fe69d4fc","fbfa2afe9dd2afc043e14946a3cdd68417f1ccda","800255ce80eee1d69fc16c20bbf36a89e1c31262","5fc41f656bf045aeeaf17a5d6cacce6a2c0100a8","943604a838a3d9dd814b50e88a4b304d1b16c4a7","5021ea7a6bd9cf3116174c621e110e998b5fa729","1ce5d36eed6c2d65b5f2f467a62cc9a9c9a66d36"],"year":2016,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/87ace84426bff6abcbc722c58d96bb0562d0b8c7","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Scandinavian journal of urology","journalName":"Scandinavian Journal of Urology","journalVolume":"50","journalPages":"103 - 95","doi":"10.3109/21681805.2016.1141318","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3109/21681805.2016.1141318","pmid":"26882458","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"magId":"2287625111","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

Starting from commercially available γ-caprolactone, the synthesis was carried out in 10 steps. Key transformations were the selective O-methylation of diketone, 3-hydroxy-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-4-propionyl-5,6-dihydro-1H-pyridin-2-one, with dimethyl sulfate and cesium carbonate in dimethylformamide, a one-pot pyrazole formation with subsequent acidic deprotection to provide lactam, 1-cyclopentyl-3-ethyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridin-7-one, and finally the utilization of imidate, 1-cyclopentyl-7-ethoxy-3-ethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine for the introduction of the triazole moiety. This process avoided the use of harsh reaction conditions, undesirable reagents and overcame the environmental concerns in the original synthesis.","authors":[{"name":"Frank J.

Most ALS‐associated mutations are found in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. We conducted a study including 60 sporadic and 19 familial ALS patients, 206 reference patients with other neurological disorders and 40 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls to test the hypothesis that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of neurofilament light (NF‐L) protein, a marker of axonal degeneration, might provide diagnostic and prognostic information on the disease. All ALS patients were screened for SOD1 mutations. Ten of the familial and five of the sporadic cases carried SOD1 mutations. NF‐L concentration [median (range)] was strongly elevated in ALS [2110 (255–10 800) ng/l] compared with reference patients and healthy controls [277 (<125–15 506) and 175 (<125–710) ng/l, respectively, P < 0.001] and correlated inversely with disease duration (Spearman R = −0.518, P = 0.001). NF‐L levels were lower in SOD1 mutation‐associated ALS compared with SOD1 wild‐type (wt) ALS (P = 0.03). In conclusion, CSF NF‐L levels may provide both diagnostic and prognostic information, particularly in SOD1 wt ALS.","authors":[{"name":"H.

{"id":"d11eaad74ac1193d2e798662ecdc8f0b7cca16d8","title":"Anaximander’s Phenomenological Cosmology","paperAbstract":"Anaximander’s model of the heavens stays as close as possible to what we actually see when we look at the sky. When we look at the stars with an unbiased eye, they give the impression of some kind of fire contained within the surrounding air, which fixes their positions relative to each other and makes them move in circles around the polar axis. Anaximander’s picture of the heavens is, so to speak, the direct translation of this experience: the heavenly bodies are regularly circling wheels of air with fire hidden inside that we see through openings. The star wheels circle always in the same orbit, but the wheels of the sun and moon have a second movement up and down the celestial axis to cause the seasons. At first sight, the weirdest part of Anaximander’s conception of the heavenly bodies is his explanation of the phases of the moon and lunar and solar eclipses. They are said to result from the partially or totally closing of the apertures in their wheels: \n \n5.1 \n \nThere are some airy breathing places (ἐκπνοὰς τόπους τινὰς ἀeρώδeις), through which the heavenly bodies appear.

The structure of negative emotional states, including stress, anxiety, and depression is influenced by the building environment and its physical features. \nObjectives: The present study aimed to survey the relationship between ventilation by window opening and female student’s stress, anxiety, and depression in high school classrooms. \nMethods: The current study was conducted as a quasi-experimental method, using pre-test and post-test with the control group. Statistical population of this study was female students studying at Shiraz high schools during 2016 - 2017. A total of 384 students were selected randomly using Cochran’s formula for participation in the study. The students in 14 classrooms were divided into two groups of intervention and control. The pre-test was used for assessing stress, anxiety, and depression in DASS-21 questionnaires. The intervention group was then allowed to improve the air quality for 6 weeks by opening the window in the classroom. However, this discretion was not given to students in the control group. After 6 weeks of post-test, DASS 21 questionnaire was used. \nResults: The mean stress score in the intervention group was 20.36 ± 4.326 at pre-test and 19.91 ± 5.162 at post-test and in the control group was 20.28 ± 5.348 at pre-test and 19.91 ± 5.162 at post-test. The mean anxiety score in the intervention group was 20.15 ± 4.705 at pre-test and 18.55 ± 4.673 at post-test and in the control group was 19.12 ± 5.272 at pre-test and 18.92 ± 5.0 at post-test. Also, the mean depression score in the intervention group was 18.29 ± 4.878 at pre-test and 18.53 ± 4.750 at post-test and in the control group was 17.83 ± 5.501 at pre-test and 17.28 ± 5.375 at post-test. Ventilation by window opening could significantly decrease the level of stress (P < 0.001) and anxiety (P < 0.001) but no significant difference was observed in depression (P = 0.067). \nConclusions: Ventilation by window opening in the classroom could reduce the stress and anxiety of female high school students in eight weeks, but did not affect the level of depression.","authors":[{"name":"Najmeh  Najafi","ids":["87391894"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Khosro  Movahed","ids":["31319790"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Zahra  Barzegar","ids":["65943793"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Siamak  Samani","ids":["144713417"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":["1fde456effc4d54f6dac7469275fd701ba85625d","e001f24a91beb9fc69129c3b0eff3eb2058abc2e"],"outCitations":["5001618d3d8dc5ce4595458f8e1f29b0804c2ade","b05e291afdbb513c61c8e1c8b9bed4cab6f4f767","518b64804f3bf8cbecdd5b4beb8aefc9710bad11","23c0584e5c4d0ba33b2ab05d35038cfe4ae25afb","9218cb7f6dad53d66247417d901b24e5bc73767e","bf4868d0bf5d32eeb7d794ebcabdb3fda9d0e31f","081ce80cbe8bcf8d5772063534a2b99549d5ab98","f3c9761f269807834fcd810138d88288aa0f93c6","e843be77f652aaa8d379c39f68322d47167ef1c4","51956ec2a3d0a339d4abef0f99cddb40c046fd10","3c00916d6cf37935f43c7b13ad940890732d7f1f","8282e93de9cc80ccffeece625b826c1ff1fa99df","bf790bea86ec4d5335b4666824a3c30f2832342e","deaa33220ff1120fbf250a186a48bd807b700ee4","69b86075ad1a0dacb9652711916994a6b33f7dc6","d92baa69cb374926ea28c0b9afc20b93429affdd","d699dcdd1937c9be579a41f45759340ff6738ba6","a56244e823283a08c81d58c52504606d74a3d6df","bc7dfc5374d47fbd223ec7c529995714f9ea8e89","79416095fbc5f4cec00e42b0fcb542a3db373d6d","04385449bb1921e5ea138db76f84ded06efe6b59","23fd66f49be7474b25d45d43ff9e8468b19f9dfa","00a09616790ca21fbdc161c09fb287e989152550","0d8f71442f9361759c8cdb5d3d2b0792306a5cdf","bc03b5ae5e10c5699ca7aaac0d6d941e37eb1281","603fa7115e094d624a2eaf8634c3994499a1211c","00498a7611e8492c58c08a1afb932d4bb301869c","395226c7f1b2b94917adc6f986a5a69f0382bd47"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/20b9f7f3f42df690b1a9410315b69f280a766fae","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["http://intjsh.sums.ac.ir/article_45166_08d19d577c7309c0b2bf6a5c8bf92523.pdf"],"venue":"International Journal of School Health","journalName":"International Journal of School Health","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"10.5812/INTJSH.87038","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5812/INTJSH.87038","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"magId":"2938138828","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

Ausgehend von den Besonderheiten, die Kunstuniversitaten charakterisieren, werden Leitlinien fur die Modulierung eines kunstuniversitaren Leitbildes umrissen, die Flexibilisierung, Konzentration und lebendige Weiterentwicklung sicherstellen. Daruber hinaus wird das fur Kunstuniversitaten problematische Bachelor/Master-Modell diskutiert, es werden Moglichkeiten einer Modularisierung der Studienstrukturen aufgezeigt und die Entwicklung eines Credit-Systems beschrieben. Um eine Neuausrichtung mit deutlicher Profilbildung moglichst breit getragen anzulegen, wird die Methode der Zukunftswerkstatt beschrieben. Schlieslich werden im Sinne eines Ubergangs aus den alten in neue Strukturen Moglichkeiten einer kunstuniversitar adaquaten Organisation verbunden mit entsprechenden Steuerungsinstrumenten erortert. Hier gilt es, in besonderem Mase der Spezifik von Kunstuniversitaten Rechnung zu tragen.","authors":[{"name":"Martin  Pfeffer","ids":["2069081071"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["b5dcf3eba2b83d91874ddce73d0b86da1d3d8249"],"year":2003,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2ad172dd34701e152e7e91de8d0423de3958ebf5","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"317-331","doi":"10.1007/978-3-663-10314-1_19","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-663-10314-1_19","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Political Science"],"magId":"197575746","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}
{"id":"51dec1b2c03292ee2cbb1e7fa3bae3f0a97bc748","title":"Sources of Error in Carbonate Chemistry: What happens when Biology and Chemistry meet?","paperAbstract":"Two different experimental systems were used to evaluate sources of error in carbonate chemistry measurements at Friday Harbor Labs, WA. One system, set up in Laboratory 6, examined the effects of different filters and a UV sterilizer. The second system explored the carbon input from feeding live versus dead algae in the presence of mussels, Mytilus trossulus. The use of an activated charcoal filter and UV sterilizer increased the pH of incoming seawater more than that of a pleated sediment filter and UV sterilizer. There were no discernable changes in the Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), and no trends could be seen in Total Alkalinity. Feeding live or dead algae produced similar results over most carbonate measurements. All treatments decreased treatment tank pH, increased tank pCO2, and increased tank DIC. However, feeding dead algae notably decreased treatment tank Total Alkalinity, while mussels that were fed live food did not show a difference in this parameter when compared to non-treated water.","authors":[{"name":"Laura A.

The jlpA gene encodes a polypeptide (JlpA) of 372 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 42.3 kDa. JlpA contains a typical signal peptide and lipoprotein processing site at the N‐terminus. The presence of a lipid moiety on the JlpA molecule was confirmed by the incorporation of [3H]‐palmitic acid. Immunoblotting analysis of cell surface extracts prepared using glycine–acid buffer (pH 2.2) and proteinase K digestion of whole cells indicated that JlpA is a surface‐exposed lipoprotein in C. jejuni. JlpA is loosely associated with the cell surface, as it is easily extracted from the C. jejuni outer membrane by detergents, such as sarcosyl and Triton X‐100. JlpA is released to the culture medium, and its concentration increases in a time‐dependent fashion. The adherence of both insertion and deletion mutants of jlpA to HEp‐2 epithelial cells was reduced compared with that of parental C. jejuni TGH9011. Adherence of C. jejuni to HEp‐2 cells was inhibited in a dose‐dependent manner when the bacterium was preincubated with anti‐GST–JlpA antibodies or when HEp‐2 cells were preincubated with JlpA protein. A ligand‐binding immunoblotting assay showed that JlpA binds to HEp‐2 cells, which suggests that JlpA is C. jejuni adhesin.","authors":[{"name":"S

{"id":"dedd780e452906d1c4ce43a075adedb97b485bfe","title":"A delayed prey-predator model with Crowley-Martin-type functional response including prey refuge","paperAbstract":"In this paper, we have studied a prey–predator model living in a habitat that divided into two regions: an unreserved region and a reserved (refuge) region. The migration between these two regions is allowed. The interaction between unreserved prey and predator is Crowley–Martin-type functional response. The local and global stability of the system is discussed. Further, the system is extended to incorporate the effect of time delay. Then the dynamical behavior of the system is analyzed, taking delay as a bifurcation parameter. The direction of Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the bifurcated periodic solution are determined with the help of normal form theory and centre manifold theorem. We have also discussed the influence of prey refuge on densities of prey and predator species. The analytical results are supplemented with numerical simulations.

{"id":"a724e53e7d883660d1b237b8eab6736b74919511","title":"Low fatty acid unsaturation protects against lipid peroxidation in liver mitochondria from long-lived species: the pigeon and human case","paperAbstract":"Birds have a much higher maximum longevity (MLSP) than mammals of similar metabolic rate. Recent data showed that pigeon mitochondria produce oxygen radicals at a rate much slower than rat mitochondria, in spite of showing similar levels of oxygen consumption (Free Rad. Res., 21 (1994) 317-328). Since oxidative damage from and to mitochondria seems important in relation to aging and longevity, and mitochondrial membranes are situated at the place where oxygen radicals are generated, we studied protein and lipid peroxidation and fatty acid composition of the three main membrane phospholipids of liver mitochondria from rats (MLSP = 4 years) and pigeons (MLSP = 35 years). It was found that pigeon mitochondria show lower levels of fatty acid unsaturation than rat mitochondria in the three lipid fractions, mainly due to a substitution of highly unsaturated fatty acids (20:4 and 22:6) by linoleic acid (18:2), and that these mitochondria are more resistant to lipid peroxidation. Previous research has also obtained exactly the same major difference in fatty acid composition in human mitochondria when compared to those of rat. Thus, present information suggests that the liver mitochondrial membranes of especially long-lived species show both a low level of free radical production and a low degree of fatty acid unsaturation as important constitutive protective traits to slow down aging.","authors":[{"name":"R.

{"id":"4168054fd10143f9a89fd09a925bc3427a697ae8","title":"Parent and Community Involvement in Schools: Policy Panacea or Pandemic?","paperAbstract":"A global tide of policy, programs, and rhetoric puts parent and community involvement in the education mainstream. In the nineties, new policies on parent involvement in education were put in place at the national level in the US and UK, and in many state and local jurisdictions in the English speaking world and beyond (Moles, 2001; OECD, 1997). In the literature, reports and testimonials on parent involvement climbed steadily across the 1980s and 90s. Many promising local school community partnerships were reported (Holtzman, 1995; Corter, Harris, & Pelletier, 1998) but were not easily translated into wide scale policies. The role of the parent is popular fodder for the public mind and is good counterpoint to the roles of teachers and schools in accounting for the failures and successes of children. Report cards on parents are tabloid topics in the US, and parents being jailed for their children’s truancy gets similar press in the UK. Although it is harder to think about the roles of “community” and the complex interactions that surround the efforts of teachers and parents, the word has positive connotations not lost on politicians. Popular media reflect the importance of parents in education and large scale surveys suggest that the public, including parents themselves, see the responsibility for children’s school success as being shared between parents and schools (OECD, 1997; Williams, Williams, & Ullman, 2001, Livingstone, Hart, & Davie, 2000).

{"id":"4c0681570ac454660b55744c57f30ca02c4b103b","title":"Survey of social search from the perspectives of the village paradigm and online social networks","paperAbstract":"Two paradigms currently exist for information search. The first is the library paradigm, which has been largely automated and is the prevailing paradigm in today's web search. The second is the village paradigm, and although it is older than the library paradigm, its automation has not been considered, yet certain elements of its key aspects have been automated, as in the cases of the Q&A communities or novel services such as Quora. The increasing popularity and availability of online social networks and question-answering communities have encouraged revisiting of the automation of the village paradigm owing to new helpful developments, primarily that people are more connected with their acquaintances on the internet and their contact lists are available. In this survey, we study how the village paradigm is today partially automated: we consider the selection of candidates for answering questions, answering questions automatically and helping candidates to decide what questions to answer. Other aspects are also considered, for example, the automation of a reward system. We conclude that a next step towards the automation of the village paradigm involves intelligent agents that can leverage a P2P (peer-to-peer) social network, which will create new and interesting

Upon lowering the current, the wire returns to the superconducting state in a steplike pattern, which differs from sample to sample. Elimination of geometrical inhomogeneities, such as sharp corners, does not remove these steplike features. They appear to be intrinsic to the material. Since the material is strongly disordered, electronic inhomogeneities are considered as a possible cause. A thermal model, taking into account random variations of the electronic properties along the wire, is used as an interpretative framework.","authors":[{"name":"H. L.

Chloride salts; KCl, NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2 and potassium salts; KCl, KNO3, K2CO3 and K2SO4 were used to test the effects of cations and anions on the zeta potential of biomolecules, respectively. The absolute zeta potential of biomolecules decreased with increasing ionic strenght; divalent ions had a profound influence on reducing zeta potential than monovalent ions. The cations were less effective at low pH and became more effective at high pH for both of ionic strength. Anions possessed a more potent effect on the zeta potential at high and low pH except for 0.1 M salts concentration at high pH. In general, isoelectric point of biomolecules changed with ionic environment.

This study compared students declared as criminal justice majors versus all other declared majors regarding attitudes toward sexual issues. Of particular interest are those issues that have a “law” or “legal” aspect. Participants were from 10 undergraduate classes at a Hispanic-serving university in deep South Texas, near the Mexican border. There were 60 criminal justice majors and 258 indicating a major other than criminal justice. Measurement was accomplished through a 38 item sexual attitudes questionnaire designed specifically to assess human sexuality attitudes. Seven items showed statistically significant differences, mostly items related to legal issues. The criminal justice majors tended to be more conservative/rejecting than the non-criminal justice majors on three items with regard to bisexuality and homosexuality. But, on four items relating to males having sex before marriage, Playboy magazine, and pornography, the criminal justice majors showed a liberal, accepting attitude. The possibility of prejudiced attitudes toward homosexuals is examined and suggestion is made for education on this topic.","authors":[{"name":"Mark L.

Kawasan industri candi memiliki puluhan pabrik yang beroperasi setiap harinya, dan setiap kegiatannya menghasilkan limbah cair. Limbah cair yang dihasilkan langsung dibuang ke badan air setempat tanpa pengolahan terlebih dahulu (IPAL). Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengkaji kualitas air buangan dari limbah buangan industri candi, mengkaji lokasi yang sesuai untuk unit pengolahan air limbah buangan, dan mengkaji efisiensi pengolahan air limbah dengan metode biofilter anaerob aerob. \nMetode yang digunakan pada penelitian ini, pertama pengambilan data sampel air yang diperoleh dengan teknik purposive sampling pada air buangan berupa parameter TSS, BOD, dan COD. Acuan parameter untuk penentuan baku mutu air dari buangan pabrik adalah Perda Jateng No. 10 Tahun 2004. Metode kedua untuk penentuan lokasi pengolahan air yaitu dengan skoring. Nilai skoring diambil dengan survey pemetaan sesuai kondisi langsung di lapangan. Metode ketiga adalah analisis laboratorium dengan pengujian pengolahan air skala laboratorium untuk diketahui tingkat efisiensi pada unit. Pengolahan air terdiri dari unit anaerobik dan unit aerobik yang diuji dengan sarang tawon sebagai media biofilter. \nHasil kualitas air buangan pabrik dari kawasan industri candi terdiri dari TSS 92 mg/L, BOD 156,8 mg/L, dan COD 286,736 mg/L. Kualitas parameter BOD dan COD melebihi baku mutu dan TSS tidak melebihi baku mutu. Penilaian faktor lokasi yang direncanakan untuk pengolahan air buangan paling sesuai berada dalam kawasan pabrik candi dengan nilai skor 37. Dari hasil analisis, pengolahan air keluaran kawasan industri candi dengan penggunaan biofilter anaerob aerob memiliki tingkat efisiensi sebesar 62,95% pada BOD, 63,5% pada COD, dan 58,69% pada TSS. Nilai efisiensi pada parameter BOD dan COD belum memenuhi baku mutu air, sedangkan TSS sudah memenuhi baku mutu air. \nKata kunci : limbah, BOD, COD, TSS, efisiensi","authors":[{"name":"Febrianta Adhi Perdana","ids":["104350030"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9e0b176164aa228b0f9ce38fca1e61df2ce88514","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Physics"],"magId":"2910062356","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

{"id":"767429d28e3287b85220591532ac04d90543e8d4","title":"Sympathetic neuron survival and TrkA expression in NT3‐deficient mouse embryos","paperAbstract":"Several in vitro and in vivo studies have led to the widely accepted view that NT3 is required for sympathetic neuroblast survival, induction of TrkA expression and the acquisition of NGF dependence. However, we show that the number of neurons and the levels of trkA and p75 mRNAs in the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion (SCG) of NT3−/− mouse embryos increase normally up to E16, 2 days after SCG neurons start responding to NGF. At E18 and in the postnatal period, there are significant reductions in the number of SCG neurons and in the levels of trkA and p75 mRNAs. These results show that the neurotrophin survival requirements of SCG neurons do not switch from NT3 to NGF during development and that NT3 is not required for the expression of TrkA and p75 and the acquisition of NGF dependence. Rather, some sympathetic neurons have a late requirement for NT3 at the time when they also depend on NGF for survival. The expression of transcripts encoding catalytic TrkC is negligible at this stage, suggesting that NT3 acts mainly via TrkA.","authors":[{"name":"S

However, very little is known about the substances that ICs might use to communicate with other cells and no data are available in humans. Because carbon monoxide (CO) is emerging as a putative mediator in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility, this study examined the presence of heme oxygenase (HO2), the constitutive form of the enzyme for CO production, in human stomach with particular attention to ICs. The distribution of HO2 in nerves and ICs in human antrum was studied using specific antibodies. The immunostaining was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. HO2 immunoreactivity was found in myenteric neurons and nerve fibers supplying the circular muscle layer and in intramuscular c-kit+ ICs, but not in c-kit+ ICs surrounding the myenteric ganglia. The presence of HO2 in different cell types suggests that CO may serve as an intercellular messenger between myenteric neurons and ICs and between ICs and smooth muscle cells in human stomach.","authors":[{"name":"C.

{"id":"7a8553419c91c03e06ff81de91bf91efd45d2ffc","title":"Interventions to prevent bone loss in astronauts during space flight.","paperAbstract":"This paper reviews the interventions to stabilize calcium balance and bone metabolism and prevent bone loss in astronauts during space flight. Weightlessness during space flight results in calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K deficiency, increases urinary calcium excretion, decreases intestinal calcium absorption, and increases serum calcium level, with decreased levels of serum parathyroid hormone and calcitriol. Bone resorption is increased, whereas bone formation is decreased. The loss of bone mineral density (BMD) in the spine, femoral neck and trochanter, and pelvis is 1.0-1.6% per month. High calcium intake and vitamin D supplementation during space flight does not affect bone metabolism, but prevents an elevation of serum calcium level through increased calcitriol level, while vitamin K counteracts the reduction in bone formation. However, there are no data to show the efficacy of pharmaceutical agents for prevention of development of osteoporosis in astronauts during flight, although the preventative effect of bisphosphonates, testosterone, and vitamin K2 on cancellous bone loss in the tibia or BMD loss in the hindlimb was reported in tail-suspended mature rats. It still remains uncertain whether these agents can prevent cortical bone loss caused by weightlessness in tail-suspended rats. Therefore, in addition to calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K supplementation, agents that have both potent anti-resorptive and anabolic effects on cancellous and cortical bone may be needed to stabilize calcium balance and bone metabolism and prevent bone loss in astronauts during space flight.","authors":[{"name":"Jun  Iwamoto","ids":["47256865"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Tsuyoshi

We combine a list of state appellate cases involving gay and lesbian rights during this period with data from Lambda’s “Docket Update” to create a data set that identifies which cases Lambda was involved in. We theorize that Lambda’s involvement will be shaped by the potential policy implications of the case, the organization’s ability to influence the outcome, and organizational membership concerns. Using logistic regression, we examine the effect of case characteristics, the political and cultural climate in the state, and variations in the state’s lesbian and gay community on the likelihood of Lambda participating in a particular state-level case. We add to the understanding of movement tactical decisions and the factors influencing the likelihood of legal mobilization.","authors":[{"name":"Melinda D.

The first two methods revealed 5 peaks, the latter 7 peaks of interferon activity. There was no difference in the molecular nature of interferon produced by cultures exposed to the inducer for the whole period of incubation and that produced by cultures from which the inducer was removed after a short induction time.","authors":[{"name":"I  Táborský","ids":["11760132"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"V  Dolník","ids":["13609794"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":1977,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/09abe70b7c22d015a04dfa5d1b0529552278f821","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Acta virologica","journalName":"Acta virologica","journalVolume":"21 5","journalPages":"\n          359-64\n        ","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"22229","fieldsOfStudy":["Biology","Medicine"],"magId":"2419034910","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

Il peut evoluer vers un stade metastatique et resistant a la castration (mCRPC). Tres peu de donnees epidemiologiques sont disponibles sur le mCRPC. La base du Systeme national des donnees de sante (SNDS) couvrant l’ensemble de la population francaise offre les informations medicales individuelles necessaires pour estimer la prevalence et l’incidence du mCRPC. Methodes Un algorithme visant a identifier les patients ayant un mCRPC en 2014 parmi les hommes de plus de 40 ans affilies au regime general, a ete developpe, valide et applique dans le SNDS sur la periode 2009–2016. La date de resistance a la castration et la date de premiere prise en charge des metastases ont ete estimees en se basant sur les actes medicaux (prostatectomie, radiotherapie, etc.), les diagnostics hospitaliers, la realisation d’examen medicaux, et les dispensations et administration de medicaments captures dans le SNDS (hormonotherapie classique et de nouvelle generation, chimiotherapie, etc.). Les resultats ont ete extrapoles a l’ensemble de la population francaise. Resultats En 2014, le nombre estime de cas prevalents de cancer de la prostate etait de 488 618 dont 36 590 metastatiques (7,5 %) et 24 096 resistants a la castration (4,9 %), pour un total de 16 423 mCRPC (3,4 %). Dans 52 % des cas, la resistance a la castration et la prise en charge des metastases ont ete detectees dans un intervalle de 4 mois.

{"id":"2be198676356c11f2fc400111ecc50856a90f73b","title":"Upstream Social Marketing","paperAbstract":"The benefits of physical activity (PA) are well recognized. While the benefits of PA contribute to a higher quality of life, physical inactivity remains a population-wide plague around the world. The health risks associated with inactivity are disproportionately high among those with low-incomes. While the barriers hindering an active lifestyle among low-income persons are well known, there is a paucity of literature on the perspectives of those that are providing recreation services to low-income citizens. It is anticipated that understanding the professionals’ perspectives may help refine municipal recreation policies and procedures in order to better reach and serve low-income citizens. This study sought to understand the benefits of and challenges to implementing programs designed for low-income citizens. Framed by social marketing theory, key informant interviews and a focus group were conducted with recreation professionals from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada (N = 9). Social marketing can be a powerful way to make sense of how policies and programs are positioned by recreation professionals and offered to their less well-resourced patrons. Implications for practice include delivering programs outside of facility walls, using word of mouth as a trusted communication method, developing subsidy policies, seeking external funding sources, and relying on partnerships to facilitate delivery and recruitment. By focusing on the recreation professional, this study reveals the importance of targeting upstream audiences in order to effect change for the end users. Future research in other social service professions might benefit from a similar approach to advancing service delivery.","authors":[{"name":"Jenny E.

Stepped leaders move down from the thundercloud base to the encounter point with an upward streamer. First, the existing models, related to the advance of leading lightnings, are analyzed. Then, a novel theory is presented. The proposed model describes both the leader progression and speed. It aims at explaining the leader progression as a succession of several steps, or branches, that form the well-known tree-like shape. The speed of advance per step is described as a function of various parameters: the charge concentration surface diameter and the step length, among others. The derived formulas include two new parameter named ( χ ) and G. χ is the ratio between the guide beam length ( L ) and the diameter of the circle, inside the cloud, where the charges are concentrated ( D ) . G relates density of charges, as explained herein.","authors":[{"name":"Anibal  Seminario-Garcia","ids":["1423325670"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Cristina  Gonzalez-Moran","ids":["1447304198"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Pablo  Arboleya","ids":["1833926"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":["8653ba45685338528719ad8c510eef19bfee82b2"],"outCitations":["7d4119ba80f7bfe97e20a8513c4bb664aa92e645","b5bd6051c767ae7705da4768b3cae2d06dee4029","253dc1571331c935534239d2ba7369fa47efbf4d","d9a9ee77070c5b8497b81763df4f945b9270d76b","362b93954fff164b3e031a93f06c392485c8b5b3","a381f0d2a93c95f3a47d27e98cb06e474e8a3adc","39b0dcb9da843c161d724d1809f34f7d97f74924","8931a70ac03d8d9134a6c35ffc60a7ac6a7ea685","da972edfd10197c5c20a4bac257e6362c7ca9c69","ef8ea1c54fa1d0c30eca0b34f002773a2325c9fb","b7734691aa5e45b7bd206d3be67229e2d215028d","77c3fc1bbb2f46484640cf7651a78d69174ce845","1f32e3d4b0160a4dd556841fd731e2b093a437b0","2a74bc8ccd2f7f4e7a2b02870aab9d3bc56d842a","dd4928845e20cf2593f342f1aaff0d38deba8236","1af9d1605e95c06f8090c8d4666cd186268e5020","6a45e796bc2e9db245959323a57f39756644d8cf"],"year":2019,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4f4de17322b334628e9219e273323d7f56b72d37","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Energies","journalName":"Energies","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"10.3390/EN12132507","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3390/EN12132507","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Engineering"],"magId":"2954679108","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

Formerly, many of these effects were considered 'medical' complications of renal cell carcinoma and it was implied that many were due to the advanced stage of the disease. Thus, for example, abnormal liver function tests, hypertension and hypercalcx,mia were thought to be late manifestations of the disease and therefore, contraindications to nephrectomy. It is now known that few of the systemic effects are necessarily evidence of metastatic disease. Since the tumour itself may be the sole cause of the abnormalities, excision of the primary tumour should now be recommended in all cases. Furthermore, the disappearance of the abnormality indicates a favourable prognosis, while its reappearance usually coincides with recurrence. Thus the detection of either biochemical 'evidence' of distant metastases or other systemic effects should not influence either the initial or the subsequent surgical management of patients with renal cell carcinoma.","authors":[{"name":"H  Hope-Stone","ids":["1403481375"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":["7c4f745cf542e948c77d23653ad13838942f1cde","8d0af154c8f04da1a531fa9096d7a22bdd2e2c6a","bdcff30f635e870bef2b75debcc39cce5cd025e2","d3c16523e722405532b4f09073c75c98af2467ec","4931f77f882b25ae7d1354c7f68565f61683c9cd","664a8f3cb96151e5cbdd52ba684e934a02ef1188","53ada861db1de3a756df370a61c0bbc22ab0e6ef","122c505ada089e776365732fcefd1bc9ffe66993","97eea6eed4b703379c09f211808c92b3f30f9017","d6b38834726577b08bb81fcc610daeba4fb10c41"],"outCitations":["dba4795c7c5522661dfec24755e96d3771b91897","0416b473e4d445be964f2c51a952b6dd22fabc97","45c8ed8f6e06639ef5dca1e89dc4607a1525f813"],"year":1975,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5b0252255a9f14c5b47c650ad40ca8a41a92442d","sources":["Medline"],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine","journalName":"Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine","journalVolume":"68","journalPages":"777 - 779","doi":"10.1177/003591577506801222","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/003591577506801222","pmid":"1219751","fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"magId":"332831831","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

Little uplift emanates from either side. The most elaborate essay is \"Purity as a Revolutionary Concept in the French Revolution.\" In this setting morality likewise gets short shrift. According to Louis St.-Just (1767-1794), one of the most articulate of Jacobin leaders, the true republic destroys \"whatever is opposed to it.\" He seeks to elevate France through the \"vehemence of a pure govern ment,\" another phrase that reminds Moore of Joseph Stalin. St.-Just only recognized the absurdity of unconditional purity when it was about to take his own life as well. Moore concludes that for a long time the theory and practice of moral purity were limited to monotheistic religion. The Enlightenment, he claims, secularized this quest and produced a host of new justifica tions for mass murder with moral pretensions. There is little mention of Hitler, but what he exemplified is represented. This?explaining a his toric phenomenon without talking about it explicitly?is an amazing performance. What Moore teaches us in the bargain is that you cannot grasp the problem of Hitler just by studying Germany?not even if you are Eric Voegelin and can read Plato and Aristotle in the original Greek.","authors":[{"name":"Merritt  Moseley","ids":["115747603"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"year":2000,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7a6250bec6eb6c84dc85a3059b6c34545f500c65","sources":[],"pdfUrls":[],"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["History"],"magId":"25181863","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

To illustrate that the continuous theory can be employed in a discrete setting, we establish a uniform convergence result for the discretized continuous WT and apply the proposed method to a variety of acoustic signals.","authors":[{"name":"Luis Daniel Abreu","ids":["24329917"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Antti  Haimi","ids":["3408522"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Gunther  Koliander","ids":["1735548"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Jos'e Luis Romero","ids":["1382623700"],"structuredName":null}],"inCitations":["7e875a25430f7ee35046e13fe56e35a2658b8c9e","01caca02375dfd884915a9aaf6cfee56da9dad29","a55a1f8d81ce93507a96ec29f154a294534ce744","3f0a06ee0145415876e8e654c80227a58ed4dab0","09fc3611cdedd316455e614d9d295d51dc1de379","ff879113917bbdcee26523efe402ac04480ca15f","b686115172a11c02312c969a70842d9c241e8220","45ae12f023112e9591358471f8698aa66f87d3c2"],"outCitations":["2ba42c1bc9c803e40c0c7e1c7901d8dface74998","7099761d56368de3cc31d924b3c8b428e54e036a","710794bf54d65fbe483c42683d114ac3105b227f","12e5939a80ec59f81214d7e729c577c350af9501","c536af8ddf62b25b870033a3931b74452c51d60d","4a314e5f6da3f1215db575bea9caa98652aaa7f4","38feefdabc36c57f42fb20a70cc5297c28a6384a","0e7871bbfc36e1bbfb273986debfe9741447a786","1a2ae7e1007fc25150959d2fed570b03f942060b","9a54b8e35145b697a25a5407729e93a05e3a7260","17498436360c6f0a516ec8205e5f320f6d1d535d","474c5febd23bd9315f7081bea41da1422c9db349","4fff8d2afeade0ed6e93a8ab128ad9bf14c49411","d4093f315b5a31a28e2303c4868d7f3b600da707","06bb1ac4f4682e086063946d772340340c0c96bf","7991403f342854217af573384ebc80be0cebf826","8753b93eb3310f0f0a30474cbb019bf2ad81f551","ba1c093caa3a5139d6d758ca7479f1a5093f995a","42d386e19983a88140a5cd727a6b3ccebbb55347","f9142591e45b0aa282252660742205b1fc01318e","ea3f95bb22fb1b05b6215fcc534627667d976df7","94be8ab1c8e84cf33eece5241ca8b78ab4debf73","cf03590ef3e9d2d68fd7544ba568fab9a47be42c","e38b8af2e0bbd03431189e12db4e430f7d8cc87a","eacfd35998e97d707b858b331d165dee87b708c6","05006ef079ca9347862de45eae7e6e798d1bd066","dc9282184346604dc9926f615ed1ee3cde2456a3","4e15ae2e6c0463c897c30e3d78664ba278217959","b18cf94422ed61ca5725335c9cd6028b09ea6361","ed362097b434938359a7d06c4292212a7f59938c","797fec35d38a4f164f1f97a36273bfa6288147ff","59d12975f6a29a67d5e5d0549ac705c6387c2827","4862e7afe6d18aa284ca35a87aead3e2a3dcfbef","13af207e2ab3c2dc3c74e909fb05040ed1b6bb46","3f0a06ee0145415876e8e654c80227a58ed4dab0","eae44271b15b30c1dbea975ad1d283bd1b9192b1","b616ce5724a64ee5364525c0d4f9a4cb346b8dd3","6f9675a828665edbdf05adf752522f989866f533","bb3a131a079633146d82196d14dd64abad95556d","8886cf9f03270df3e54f2056d3e67c7f411a47b2","106f6fa177ac536c7343e0906d8ca0c7b6d4b227","a696d6ad7c306a09579ddaa96b2b516a9cf91761","7de3268eba3ca08f7716575067285fe0193b706d","313f5a42a7abeb0444e9ec30e9b88524845d21a5"],"year":2018,"s2Url":"https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c406f057111448357a29923ebaf94961c71c23d3","sources":[],"pdfUrls":["https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03183v3.pdf","http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1807.03183"],"venue":"","journalName":"arXiv: Numerical Analysis","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics","Computer Science"],"magId":"2852870959","s2PdfUrl":"","entities":[]}

{"id":"48b0c9772581e0ebe5b0a6c81f705eab8c6c2e04","title":"Multivariate Weekly Streamflow Forecasting Model","paperAbstract":"Abstract In the operation of a reservoir system, it is of interest to know an estimate of the confidence interval of the future inflow volumes for each reservoir. In this paper, the one-step ahead forecasts of weekly inflows to each reservoir are obtained through the use of a multivariate autoregressive stochastic model (MAR) which, besides aerial dependency, represents the spatial inflow dependency otructure. The continuous incorporation of measurements favours a recursive estimation procedure for model's parameters. The stochastic model was formulated within the framework of the state-space representation where the state (MAR parameters) is modelled by a simple random walk process to allow for time dependency of parameters. The recursive algorithm employed is the extended Kalman Filter, in which the noise covariance is estimated at each step. The forecast error covariance matrix is used to built the confidence regions for inflows. A case study with a South Brazilian reservoir system for hydropower production is presented. The order of the MAR model was chosen based on performance indexes related to the forecast error obtained within the historical data. The comparison between the MAR model and the best univariate fit to each site series indicates that the multivariate scheme produces forecasts similar to the univariate ones, besides providing multivariate confidence regions for the future inflows.","authors":[{"name":"G.

{"id":"9fa5c2e10ec21ea4ae1a346b8800b596719166e6","title":"2-Chlorofatty Aldehyde Elicits Endothelial Cell Activation","paperAbstract":"Endothelial activation and dysfunction are hallmarks of inflammation. Neutrophil-vascular endothelium interactions have significant effects on vascular wall physiology and pathology. Myeloperoxidase (MPO)-derived products released from activated neutrophils can mediate the inflammatory response and contribute to endothelial dysfunction. 2-Chlorofatty aldehyde (2-ClFALD) is the direct oxidation product of MPO-derived hypochlorous acid (HOCl) targeting plasmalogen phospholipids. The role of 2-ClFALD in endothelial dysfunction is poorly understood and may be dependent on the vascular bed. This study compared the role of 2-ClFALD in eliciting endothelial dysfunction in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC), and human kidney endothelial cells (HKEC). Profound increases in selectin surface expression as well as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 surface expression were observed in HCAEC and HLMVEC. The surface expression of these adherence molecules resulted in robust adherence of neutrophils and platelets to 2-ClFALD treated endothelial cells. In contrast to HCAEC and HLMVEC, 2-ClFALD-treated HKEC had substantially reduced adherence molecule surface expression with no resulting increase in platelet adherence. 2-ClFALD-treated HKEC did have an increase in neutrophil adherence. All three endothelial cell lines treated with 2-ClFALD displayed a time-dependent loss of barrier function. Further studies revealed 2-ClHDyA localizes to ER and Golgi when using a synthetic alkyne analog of 2-ClFALD in HCAEC and HLMVEC. These findings indicate 2-ClFALDs promote endothelial cell dysfunction with disparate degrees of responsiveness depending on the vascular bed of origin.","authors":[{"name":"Jane  McHowat","ids":["3990285"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"Shubha  Shakya","ids":["50844678"],"structuredName":null},{"name":"David A.
