Strain L2, an iron-reducing bacteria, was immobilized using chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol to simultaneously remove nitrate and phosphorus. The effects of carbon/nitrogen ratio (1:1, 1.5:1, and 2:1), initial Fe2+ concentration (0, 15, and 30 mg\u00b7L-1), and HRT (2, 4, and 6 h) were assessed in bioreactors and optimum conditions were established. Results showed that the nitrate and phosphorus removal efficiency reached 100.00% (2.697 mg\u00b7L-1\u00b7h-1) and 81.93% (1.533 mg\u00b7L-1\u00b7h-1) under the conditions of carbon/nitrogen of 2:1, Fe2+ concentration of 30 mg\u00b7L-1 and HRT of 6 h. The precipitation of bioreactor, which identified as FeOOH by XRD, had significant adsorption on tetracycline. The results of high-throughput sequencing indicated that strain L2 played a significant role in denitrification. This bioreactor provided effective method for the treatment of polluted water contaminated by nitrate, phosphorus, and tetracycline.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Su, Jun Feng; Li, Guo Qing; Wen, Qiong; Xue, Lei; Chen, Chang Lun; Huang, Ting Lin", "journal": "Bioprocess biosyst. eng", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#32418134", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "218652229"}
