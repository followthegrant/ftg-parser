We compared the outcomes of \"elderly\" patients presenting to our unit with a colorectal cancer emergency over a 10-year period with those of a \"younger\" cohort. METHODS A single centre retrospective review of colorectal cancer emergencies between 1st April 2007 and 1st April 2017 was performed. Patients were separated into two cohorts: \"young\" (<75 years) and \"elderly\" (\u226575 years). Data collected included demographics, disease status, treatment and outcomes. RESULTS A total of 341 patients (<75 yr: n=154; \u226575 yr: n= 187) presented as a colorectal cancer emergency. Significantly fewer \"elderly\" patients underwent curative surgical procedures (72% vs. 49%, P<0.0001) or received adjuvant chemotherapy (56% vs. 21%, P<0.0001). \"Elderly\" patients had significantly more post-operative cardio-respiratory complications (7% vs. 36%, P<0.0001), but despite this there was no significant difference in 30-day mortality (7% vs. 12%,), survival rates at 1-year (75% vs. 74%,) or 3-years (56% vs. 49%). Elderly patients treated with best supportive care had a median overall survival of just 62 (range 1-955) days. CONCLUSION Patients \u226575 yr presenting as a colorectal cancer emergency were significantly less likely to undergo emergency curative surgery or receive adjuvant chemotherapy than those <75 yr. However the 30-day mortality, 1-year and 3-year survival rates for patients undergoing curative surgery were comparable.", "publish_time": "2020-07-01", "authors": "Webster, Peter John; Tavangar Ranjbar, Niloofar; Turner, Jack; El-Sharkawi, Ahmed; Zhou, Grant; Chitsabesan, Praminthra", "journal": "Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609919/", "s2_id": "220306510"}
