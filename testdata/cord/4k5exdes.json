In the primary infection, viruses often conquer the host cell\u2019s antiviral immune response by controlling the inherently cellular mRNA degradation machinery to facilitate viral gene expression and establish a successful infection. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the diverse strategies of viral-mediated regulatory RNA shutoff for pathogenesis, and particularly sheds a light on the mechanisms that viruses evolve to elude immune surveillance during infection.", "publish_time": "2018-11-29", "authors": "Du, Shujuan; Liu, Xiaoqing; Cai, Qiliang", "journal": "Biomedicines", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/d50946bee04acb73e91b3735ccb661a278b86685.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6315618.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines6040111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30501096/", "s2_id": "54558147"}
