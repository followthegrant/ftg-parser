The growth of globalization significantly increases the risk of virus spreading, making it a global threat to future public health. In particular, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) pandemic outbreak emphasizes the importance of devices and methods for rapid, sensitive, and cost\u2010effective diagnosis of viral infections in the early stages by which their quick and global spread can be controlled. Micro and nanoscale technologies have attracted tremendous attention in recent years for a variety of medical and biological applications, especially in developing diagnostic platforms for rapid and accurate detection of viral diseases. This review addresses advances of microneedles, microchip\u2010based integrated platforms, and nano\u2010 and microparticles for sampling, sample processing, enrichment, amplification, and detection of viral particles and antigens related to the diagnosis of viral diseases. Additionally, methods for the fabrication of microchip\u2010based devices and commercially used devices are described. Finally, challenges and prospects on the development of micro and nanotechnologies for the early diagnosis of viral diseases are highlighted.", "publish_time": "2021-07-26", "authors": "Nasrollahi, Fatemeh; Haghniaz, Reihaneh; Hosseini, Vahid; Davoodi, Elham; Mahmoodi, Mahboobeh; Karamikamkar, Solmaz; Darabi, Mohammad Ali; Zhu, Yangzhi; Lee, Junmin; Diltemiz, Sibel Emir; Montazerian, Hossein; Sangabathuni, Sivakoti; Tavafoghi, Maryam; Jucaud, Vadim; Sun, Wujin; Kim, Han\u2010Jun; Ahadian, Samad; Khademhosseini, Ali", "journal": "Small", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/ffe2caec0a69763cc8efb3ccbf1411997539a2e0.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8420309.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202100692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310048/", "s2_id": "236431900"}
