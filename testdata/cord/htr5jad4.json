For example, RNA-sequencing techniques from infected cells contains reads that unequivocally align to either the host or the viral transcriptomes, enabling quantification of host and viral gene expressions (2). Occasionally, there are reads with split characteristics, having one part (e.g., the 5' end) unambiguously matching the host and another part (e.g., the 3' end) clearly matching the viral genomes. The split characteristic with unambiguous matching on either part is the key here, typically requiring convincing stretches of sequence matches such as >30bp that we used in our analysis (3). Such reads are termed host-virus chimeric reads (HVCRs). Indeed, HVCRs that surpass statistical reproducibility and signal-to-noise standards might carry novel insights into the biology of host-virus interactions (4, 5). Thus, it is important to unambiguously detect statistically rigorous and biologically relevant HVCRs. We and others have shown that detection of relevant HVCRs is complicated by unfaithful reverse-transcriptase and polymerase enzymes that template-switch during typical high throughput sequencing library preparation protocols (6-9).", "publish_time": "2021-10-27", "authors": "Yan, Bingyu; Chakravorty, Srishti; Mirabelli, Carmen; Wang, Luopin; Trujillo-Ochoa, Jorge L; Chauss, Daniel; Kumar, Dhaneshwar; Lionakis, Michail S; Olson, Matthew R; Wobus, Christiane E; Afzali, Behdad; Kazemian, Majid", "journal": "Journal of virology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01690-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34705544/", "s2_id": "240073683"}
