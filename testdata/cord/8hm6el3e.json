Examine age differences in SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from primary cases and infection risk among household contacts, and symptoms among those with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS. People with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Nashville, Tennessee and central and western Wisconsin and their household contacts were followed daily for 14 days to ascertain symptoms and secondary transmission events. Households were enrolled between April 2020 and April 2021. Secondary infection risks (SIR) by age of the primary case and contacts were estimated using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS. The 226 primary cases were followed by 198 (49%) secondary SARS-CoV-2 infections among 404 household contacts. Age group-specific SIR among contacts ranged from 36% to 53%, with no differences by age. SIR was lower from primary cases aged 12\u201317 years than from primary cases 18\u201349 years (risk ratio [RR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19\u20130.91). SIR was 55% and 45%, respectively, among primary case-contact pairs in the same versus different age group (RR 1.47; 95% CI 0.98\u20132.22). SIR was highest among primary case-contacts pairs aged \u226565 years (76%) and 5\u201311 years (69%). Among secondary SARS-CoV-2 infections, 19% were asymptomatic; there was no difference in the frequency of asymptomatic infections by age group. CONCLUSIONS. Both children and adults can transmit and are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SIR did not vary by age, but further research is needed to understand age-related differences in probability of transmission from primary cases by age.", "publish_time": "2021-08-20", "authors": "McLean, Huong Q.; Grijalva, Carlos G.; Hanson, Kayla E.; Zhu, Yuwei G.; Deyoe, Jessica E.; Meece, Jennifer K.; Halasa, Natasha B.; Chappell, James D.; Mellis, Alexandra; Reed, Carrie; Belongia, Edward A.; Talbot, H.
