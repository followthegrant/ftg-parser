We describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations. RECENT FINDING: To date, no randomized prospective studies have been published; recommendations are based on some observational studies, case reports, and expert opinions. The article provides an overview of the most important publications, presents the current results of the German Registry for PIMS and expert recommendations for treatment. SUMMARY: MIS-C PIMS is a new syndrome that is associated with a variety of virus infections, and also with SARS-CoV-2. The main characteristics are fever, multiple organ dysfunction due to a hyper-inflammatory state. In particular, cardiac dysfunction and severe shock. A high proportion of patients require intensive medical care, but the absolute number of children with SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C is low. Medical therapy is based on pathophysiologic considerations and is not evidence-based. Immunoglobulins, steroids and biologics are used and lead to effective treatment. Therefore, the mortality rate is very low. Patients usually recover within days, sequelae are reported only in a minority of cases.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Piekarski, Florian; Steinbicker, Andrea U; Armann, Jakob P", "journal": "Curr. opin. anaesthesiol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1246783", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "235255946"}
