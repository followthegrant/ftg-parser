Social disadvantage is a key component in several health impact frameworks, providing explanations for how individual-level factors interact with interpersonal and environmental factors to create health disparities. Understanding the association between social disadvantage and vascular neuropathology, brain lesions identified by neuroimaging and autopsy, could provide insight into how one's social context interacts with biological processes to produce disease. The goal of this scoping review was to evaluate the scientific literature on the relationship between social disadvantage and cerebrovascular disease, confirmed through assessment of vascular neuropathology. We reviewed 4049 titles and abstracts returned from our search and included records for full-text review that evaluated a measure of social disadvantage as an exposure variable and cerebrovascular disease, confirmed through assessment of vascular neuropathology, as an outcome measure. We extracted exposures and outcomes from 20 articles meeting the criteria after full-text review, and described the study findings and populations sampled. An improved understanding of the link between social factors and cerebrovascular disease will be an important step in moving the field closer to addressing the fundamental causes of disease and towards more equitable brain health.", "publish_time": "2021-07-02", "authors": "Keller, Sarah A; Hansmann, Kellia J; Powell, W Ryan; Bendlin, Barbara B; Kind, Amy J H", "journal": "International journal of environmental research and public health", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281008/", "s2_id": "236141163"}
