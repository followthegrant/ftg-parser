Vitamin E has shown beneficial effects as a possible \"scavenger\" of oxidative stress products, which play a major role in pathogenesis of the disease. AIMS The purpose of the present meta-analysis is to investigate the effects of vitamin E supplementation in biochemical and histological parameters in adult patients with NAFLD. METHODS Literature search was performed in major electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL and EMBASE) up to June 2020 for randomized clinical trials, which examined vitamin E versus placebo treatment in adults with NAFLD. Changes in liver enzymes were considered as primary outcomes, while changes in histology, biochemical and metabolic parameters as secondary. Quality of evidence was assessed through risk of bias according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS Eight studies were included in qualitative analysis and seven in quantitative analysis. Vitamin E reduced the values of liver enzymes compared to placebo (-7.37 IU/L, 95% CI: -10.11 to -4.64 for ALT and -5.71 IU/L, 95% CI: -9.49 to -1.93 for AST) Additionally, vitamin E improved statistically significantly liver pathology in every individual histologic parameter as well LDL, FBG and serum leptin values. CONCLUSIONS Vitamin E can improve biochemical and histological characteristics of NAFLD patients, especially of NASH patients. The results indicate that vitamin E could be a promising choice and be considered as a treatment option in patients with NAFLD.", "publish_time": "2020-08-18", "authors": "Vadarlis, Andreas; Antza, Christina; Bakaloudi, Dimitra Rafailia; Doundoulakis, Ioannis; Kalopitas, Georgios; Samara, Myrto; Dardavessis, Theodoros; Maris, Theofanis; Chourdakis, Michael", "journal": "Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810309/", "s2_id": "221181369"}
