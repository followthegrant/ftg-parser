The similar techniques are also investigated by the computational method using Gaussian software. The density functional theory (DFT) method is used to obtain the optimized structure using the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) basis set. This optimization procedure of the molecule gives the minimum energy confirmation of the structure. The computed geometrical parameters are compared with experimental data. The experimental FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra of MPNP are obtained in the regions 4000\u2013400 and 4000\u201350 cm(\u20131) respectively. The detailed vibrational assignments of the molecule are obtained with the support of potential energy distribution. The theoretical NMR ((1)H and (13)C) analysis is conducted by the GIAO method for its structural characterization and compared with experimental chemical shifts. The experimental UV\u2013vis spectrum is obtained in the dimethyl sulfoxide solvent and compared with the theoretically computed spectrum by the time-dependent DFT method. In addition to these studies, other analyses such as nonlinear optical, natural bonds orbital, frontier molecular orbital, molecular electrostatic potential, and NCI have been conducted to understand the nature of the molecule. The title molecule is docked and also the drug-likeness, ADMET studies were carried out.
