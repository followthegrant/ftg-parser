Social Reproduction in Calm and Crisis", "doi": "10.1007/s10746-021-09592-5", "pmcid": "PMC8259550", "pubmed_id": "34248233", "license": "no-cc", "abstract": "This paper identifies experiential processes through which social structures become taken for granted, termed processes of \u201cstructure marginalization\u201d. Passive processes of structure marginalization relegate social structures to the margin of experience without the use of higher-order cognitive acts such as evaluation and reflection. Examples include adapting to social structures via routine and habitual practices (material reification), a lack of conscious awareness of the complexity, historical formation, and other details of social structures (ignorance), and rendering social structures irrelevant when they are unreflectively judged to be of no value for achieving ends (nullification). Active processes of structure marginalization reflectively and discursively relegate social structures to marginal consciousness. Examples include the use of naturalistic and necessitarian explanations for the social order that implicitly justify it as inalterable or \u201cjust the way things are\u201d (discursive reification), normative justifications for the status quo (legitimation), and conscious awareness of one\u2019s powerlessness to control social-structural conditions (helplessness). Active processes of structure marginalization originate in passive processes. The goal of the typology is to explain, at the level of experience, why social structures typically remain unproblematic and unnoticed in everyday life, even during periods of social crisis and change or when existing structures produce harmful effects.", "publish_time": "2021-07-06", "authors": "Gunderson, Ryan", "journal": "Hum Stud", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/e6c42bf6ecf2ee22449fcacb2cbc65f655442cc4.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8259550.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10746-021-09592-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248233/", "s2_id": "235766238"}
