In the present study, we deal with a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) metapopulation model where the epidemic process in each patch is represented by an SIR model and the mobility of individuals is assumed to be a homogeneous diffusion. We consider two types of patches including high-risk and low-risk ones under the assumption that a local patch is changed from a high-risk one to a low-risk one by an intervention. We theoretically analyze the intervention threshold which indicates the critical fraction of low-risk patches for preventing a global epidemic outbreak. We show that an intervention targeted to high-degree patches is more effective for epidemic control than a random intervention. The theoretical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations for synthetic and realistic scale-free patch networks. The theoretical results also reveal that the intervention threshold depends on the human mobility network and the mobility rate. Our approach is useful for exploring better local interventions aimed at containment of epidemics.", "publish_time": "2019-08-05", "authors": "Matsuki, Akari; Tanaka, Gouhei", "journal": "", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/3fbf8753270219bc6ed9ca2885d07ca5f8433ae5.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217496.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217496/", "s2_id": ""}
