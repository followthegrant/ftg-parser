While much consideration has been given to the broad environmental impacts of the textile and laundering industries, little is known about the impact wearing clothing has had on the human microbiome, particularly that of the skin, despite our long history with clothing. This review discusses the history of clothing and the evolution of textiles, what is and is not known about microbial persistence on and degradation of various fibres, and what opportunities for the industrial and environmental application of clothing microbiology exist for the future.", "publish_time": "2021-01-01", "authors": "Sanders, Deaja; Grunden, Amy; Dunn, Robert R", "journal": "Biology letters", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2020.0700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33435848/", "s2_id": "231588199"}
