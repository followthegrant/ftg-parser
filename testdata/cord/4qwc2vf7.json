Because of the public health emergency, chest CT has been widely used for sensitive detection and diagnosis, monitoring the changes of lesions and also for treatment evaluation. The purpose of this study was to investigate radiation dose and image quality of chest CT scans received by COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the oncogenic risk of multiple chest CT examinations. METHODS: A retrospective review of 33 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection was performed from January 31, 2020 to February 19, 2020. The date of each CT exam and respective radiation dose for each exam was recorded for all patients. Multiple pulmonary CT scans were obtained during diagnosis and treatment procedure. Scan frequency, total scan times, radiation dose, and image quality were determined. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (15 males and 18 females, age 21\u201382 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia underwent a total of 143 chest CT scans. The number of CT scans per patient was 4 \u00b1 1, with a range of 2\u20136. The time interval between two consecutive chest CT scans was 3 \u00b1 1 days. The average effective dose from a single chest CT scan was 1.21 \u00b1 0.10 mSv, with a range of 1.02\u20131.44 mSv. The average cumulative effective dose per patient was 5.25 \u00b1 1.52 mSv, with a range of 2.24\u20137.48 mSv. The maximum cumulative effective dose was 7.48 mSv for six CT examinations during COVID-19 treatment. Based on subjective image quality analysis, the visual scoring of CT findings was 11.23 \u00b1 1.35 points out of 15 points. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency, total number and image quality of chest CT scans should be reviewed carefully to guarantee minimally required CT scans during the COVID-19 management.", "publish_time": "2021-10-08", "authors": "Bai, Lu; Zhou, Jie; Shen, Cong; Cai, Shubo; Guo, Youmin; Huang, Xunan; Jia, Guang; Niu, Gang", "journal": "Chin J Acad Radiol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/21cc49b95d9c7d9688f50d904ed5289285fcadee.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8498979.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642650/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42058-021-00083-1", "s2_id": "238425252"}
