This study analyzed the learning outcomes of undergraduate nursing students taking a BLS clinical simulation course. A total of 479 nursing students participated. A pre-test and post-test were carried out to evaluate theoretical knowledge of BLS through questions about anatomical physiology, cardiac arrest, the chain of survival, and CPR. A checklist was used in the simulation to evaluate practical skills of basic CPR. The learning outcomes showed statistically significant differences in the total score of the pre-test and after completing the BLS clinical simulation course (pre-test: 12.61 (2.30), post-test: 15.60 (2.06), p < 0.001). A significant increase in the mean scores was observed after completing the course in each of the four parts of the assessment protocol (p < 0.001). The increase in scores in the cardiac arrest and CPR sections were relevant (Rosenthal\u2019s r: \u22120.72). The students who had prior knowledge of BLS scored higher on both the pre-test and the post-test. The BLS simulation course was an effective method of teaching and learning BLS skills.", "publish_time": "2021-02-03", "authors": "Requena-Mullor, Mar\u00eda del Mar; Alarc\u00f3n-Rodr\u00edguez, Raquel; Ventura-Miranda, Mar\u00eda Isabel; Garc\u00eda-Gonz\u00e1lez, Jessica", "journal": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/c450b5ff3acb14786b91558e06c98b1f9ca97c4d.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7913518.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913518/", "s2_id": ""}
