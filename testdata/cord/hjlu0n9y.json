Because of the inherent thrombogenicity of intracranial stents, dual-antiplatelet therapy is initiated after placement, which has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality related to perioperative ischemic events in neurointerventional procedures. However, in some series, as much as 50% of patients demonstrate clopidogrel non-responsiveness. In these non-responders, alternate agents such as ticagrelor can be used to achieve adequate anticoagulation. Compared with clopidogrel, a prodrug requiring Cytochrome P450 enzymolysis for activation, ticagrelor directly and reversibly inhibits the P2Y12 ADP receptor. The absorption of the prodrug and the formation of its active metabolite is comparatively quicker ( tmax 1.3-2 hours; 1.5-3 hours, respectively). To date, there have been no documented cases of ticagrelor non-responsiveness involving patients undergoing placement of flow-diverting stents or other endovascular neuro-interventional procedures.", "publish_time": "2017", "authors": "Ghamasaee, Pegah; Carr, Kevin; Johnson, Jeremiah; Grandhi, Ramesh", "journal": "Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019917697473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28391744/", "s2_id": "22178790"}
