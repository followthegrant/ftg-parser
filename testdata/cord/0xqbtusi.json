Although pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis are the most described complications, some investigations reported thrombotic localization also in the splanchnic venous district. METHODS We describe the case of a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with abdominal pain and diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis. In addition, we shortly review available literature supporting the possible role of COVID-19 as leading cause of splanchnic venous thrombosis. RESULTS After in-depth diagnostic workup, we excluded the commonest causes of portal thrombosis and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 infection represented the main explanation of this finding. CONCLUSIONS Our study warns the clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for thrombosis in patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection manifesting gastrointestinal symptoms. An appropriate diagnostic work-up could allow to obtain an early diagnosis and consequently improve the clinical outcome of patients.", "publish_time": "2021-09-05", "authors": "Pizzini, Attilia; Tripolino, Cesare; Zaccaroni, Stefania; Cicognani, Camilla; Dapporto, Susanna; Cipollini, Maria Luigia; Giannone, Claudia; Cavoli, Carlotta; Silingardi, Mauro", "journal": "Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.3233/ch-211256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511494/", "s2_id": "237494299"}
