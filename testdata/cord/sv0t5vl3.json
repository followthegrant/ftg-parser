The MALDI-ToF MS technique analyzes the total protein of culturable microorganisms at the species level and produces a mass spectra based on peptides which is compared to a database of identified profiles. Consequently, unique signatures of each microorganism are produced allowing identification at the species and, more importantly, strain level. Our present study proposes that the MALDI-ToF MS can be further used to screen functional and metabolic differences. While other studies applied the MALDI-ToF technique to identify subgroups within species, we investigated how various environmental factors could alter the unique bacterial signatures. We found that genetic and phenotypic differences between microorganisms belonging to the same species can be reflected in peptide-mass fingerprints generated by MALDI-ToF MS. These results suggest that MALDI-ToF MS can screen intra-species phenotypic differences of several microorganisms.", "publish_time": "2020-01-25", "authors": "Chac, Denise; Kordahi, Melissa; Brettner, Leandra; Verma, Arushi; McCleary, Paul; Crebs, Kelly; Yee, Cara; DePaolo, R.
