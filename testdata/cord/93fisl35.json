International organizations are thus calling for a transition toward territorialized food systems to alleviate some of these challenges. Yet, limited evidence supporting the benefits of territorialized food systems is available. Our objective was to summarize the current body of literature on territorialized food systems and their impacts on human health, food security, and the environment using a rapid review methodology. Articles were retrieved from three databases and analyzed using keywords and inclusion criteria corresponding to territorialized food systems, environment, human health, and food security. Six relevant publications were identified. While this limited evidence suggests that territorialized food systems may have positive effects on all three dimensions, data are not consistent across publications. For example, territorialized food systems may contribute to improved diet quality, provide agroecosystem services, and contribute to food security. However, food produced within these food systems may have a higher carbon footprint and be less available than industrially produced food. This rapid review also highlights the siloed nature of the current research on territorialized food systems and emphasizes the need for more holistic and interdisciplinary research.", "publish_time": "2021-09-24", "authors": "Rochefort, Gabrielle; Lapointe, Annie; Mercier, Annie-Pier; Parent, Genevi\u00e8ve; Provencher, V\u00e9ronique; Lamarche, Beno\u00eet", "journal": "Nutrients", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/81ccbfe124234785316c053bfd17b63893952a30.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8537681.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13103345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34684346/", "s2_id": "239470544"}
