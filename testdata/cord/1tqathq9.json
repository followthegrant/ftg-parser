However, spread of COVID19 infection continues unabated. We aimed to ascertain number of breakthrough COVID19 infections after vaccinations in a chronic care, diabetes-centric healthcare facility. METHODS: We reviewed rigorously maintained data of vaccinations, health status, symptoms of COVID19 & RT-PCR testing of all staff (doctors, nurses, paramedical workers, and other staff) in our health care facility from January 16, 2021 till date. RESULTS: Out of 123 employees, 113 were vaccinated (Covaxin, 28, Covishield, 85). Second dose was completed in 107 (94.7%) and first dose in 6 persons (5.3%). Symptomatic COVD19 infections occurred in 19 persons (16.9%) post any dose of vaccine. Symptomatic breakthrough infections > 14 days after second dose occurred in 15 persons (13.3%). Except one (required hospitalization), all 14 had mild COVID19 disease. CONCLUSIONS: We report mild symptomatic breakthrough infections as seen in our health care facility. Research in breakthrough infections in India should be extended to other institutions and community to obtain larger data.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Tyagi, Kanika; Ghosh, Amerta; Nair, Dipti; Dutta, Koel; Singh Bhandari, Prakash; Ahmed Ansari, Irshad; Misra, Anoop", "journal": "Diabetes Metab Syndr", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1213150", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "233486139"}
