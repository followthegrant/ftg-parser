Persons with suspected cases are required to report to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ministry of Health within 24 hours; the patient\u2019s close contacts are then traced and placed in quarantine for 7 days. We report 3 confirmed early cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Two cases were imported from United States; the other was imported from Canada. The patients exhibited fever and signs and other symptoms that were indistinguishable from those of seasonal influenza. Serial virologic monitoring of pharyngeal swabs showed that they were negative for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus by real-time reverse transcription\u2013PCR 4\u20136 days after onset of illness. One close contact whose sample tested positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus had no symptoms during quarantine. A national network is essential for controlling pandemic (H1N1) 2009.", "publish_time": "2009-09-01", "authors": "Bin, Cao; Xingwang, Li; Yuelong, Shu; Nan, Jiang; Shijun, Chen; Xiayuan, Xu; Chen, Wang", "journal": "Emerg Infect Dis", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/51fef2a2c2978a6384b1925376b460da142708ad.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2819857.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1509.090794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19788809/", "s2_id": "23107913"}
