Looking at the virus as an \u2018infodemic\u2019 and a set of transnational political events, it argues that a conjuncturally specific form of toxic, especially white, masculinity is key to understanding the virus\u2019s entwinement with contemporary post-truth or \u2018emo-truth\u2019 politics. A conjunctural focus reveals why a certain form of aggressive (masculine and white), ruggedly individualist truth-telling, its false statements, its historical causes, and mortal effects could become so spectacularly impactful at a particular point in time, in particular places.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Harsin, Jayson", "journal": "Eur.
