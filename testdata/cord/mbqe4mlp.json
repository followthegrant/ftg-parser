As the pandemic progresses, patients are presenting with ectopic pregnancies (EPs) and symptomatic COVID-19. Objective: We present the management of a patient with multiple medical comorbidities and tubal EP in the setting of severe symptomatic COVID-19 infection where all management options were precluded. Methods: Case report with literature review of management of tubal EP in the setting of severe symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Result: After careful consideration of options, the patient underwent successful medical management with methotrexate while receiving supportive care for COVID-19. Conclusions: Methotrexate proved to be the safest therapeutic option in this patient. Management of patients with severe COVID-19 and gynaecologic emergencies should be individualised and carefully reviewed with evolving knowledge of COVID-19.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Millan, N M; Morano, J; Florez, L; Carugno, J; Medina, C A", "journal": "Facts Views Vis Obgyn", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#covidwho-1436617", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34555882/; https://doi.org/10.52054/fvvo.13.3.030", "s2_id": "237615650"}
