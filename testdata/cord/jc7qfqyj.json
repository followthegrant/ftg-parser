SIGNIFICANCE: Our study focused on the problem associated with poor water-soluble drugs which have significant biological activity in vivo. METHODS: Different niosomal formulations of simvastatin were prepared and characterized in terms of morphology, size, encapsulation efficiency (EE), and release kinetic. Antiproliferative activity and the mechanism were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Moreover, confocal microscopy was employed to analyze the cell uptake of simvastatin loaded niosomes to the cancerous cells. RESULTS: Size, polydispersity index (PDI), and EE of the best formulation were obtained as 164.8 nm, 0.232, and 97%, respectively. The formulated simvastatin had a spherical shape and showed a slow release profile of the drug after 72 h. Stability data elucidated an increase in mean diameter and PDI which was lower for 4 \u00b0C than 25 \u00b0C. Confocal microscopy showed the localization of drug loaded niosomes in the cancer cells. The MTT assay revealed both free drug and drug loaded niosomes exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells). Flow cytometry and qPCR analysis revealed drug loaded niosomes exert their cytotoxicity on cancerous cells via regulation of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes. CONCLUSION: The prepared niosomal simvastatin showed good physicochemical and biological properties than free drug. Our study suggests that niosomal delivery could be considered as a promising strategy for the delivery of poor water-soluble drugs to cancer cells.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Akbarzadeh, Iman; Saremi Poor, Anita; Yaghmaei, Soheila; Norouzian, Dariush; Noorbazargan, Hassan; Saffar, Samaneh; Ahangari Cohan, Reza; Bakhshandeh, Haleh", "journal": "Drug Dev Ind Pharm", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#32808813", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "221164700"}
