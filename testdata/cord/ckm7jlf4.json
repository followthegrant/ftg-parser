The biological results reveal that our compounds showed excellent cytotoxicity toward three common human cancer cell lines (SW620, PC-3 and NCI-H23) with IC50 values ranging from 0.09 to 0.007 \u00b5M. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was equipotent or even up to 10-times more potent than adriamycin and up to 205-times more potent than SAHA. Among the series of N- hydroxypropenamides, compounds 10a-d were the most potent HDAC inhibitors as well as cytotoxicity toward the cell lines tested. In addition, the strong inhibitory activites toward HDAC of our compounds were observed with IC50 values of below-micromolar range. Especially, compound 4a inhibited HDAC6 with an IC50 value of 29-fold lower than that against HDAC2 isoform. Representative compounds 4a and 7a were found to significantly arrest SW620 cells at G0/G1 phase. Compounds 7a and 10a were found to strongly induce apoptosis in SW620 cells. Docking studies revealed some important features affecting the selectivity against HDAC6 isoform. The results clearly demonstrate the potential of the indirubin-hydroxamic acid hybrids and these compounds should be very promising for further development.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Anh, Duong Tien; Hai, Pham-The; Dung, Do Thi Mai; Dung, Phan Thi Phuong; Huong, Le-Thi-Thu; Park, Eun Jae; Jun, Hye Won; Kang, Jong Soon; Kwon, Joo-Hee; Tung, Truong Thanh; Han, Sang-Bae; Nam, Nguyen-Hai", "journal": "Bioorg Med Chem Lett", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#32916298", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "221636987"}
