The aim of this study is to examine as to whether SARS is associated with the risk of psychiatric disorders and suicide. A total of 285 patients with SARS and 2850 controls without SARS (1:10) matched for sex, age, insurance premium, comorbidities, residential regions, level of medical care, and index date were selected between February 25 and June 15, 2003 from the Inpatient Database Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database. During the 12-year follow-up, in which 79 in the SARS cohort and 340 in the control group developed psychiatric disorders or suicide (4047.41 vs. 1535.32 per 100,000 person-years). Fine and Gray\u2019s survival analysis revealed that the SARS cohort was associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and suicide, and the adjusted subdistribution HR (sHR) was 2.805 (95% CI: 2.182\u20133.605, p < 0.001) for psychiatric disorders and suicide. The SARS cohort was associated with anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder/acute stress disorder (PTSD/ASD), and suicide. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the SARS group was associated with anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, PTSD/ASD, and suicide after the individuals with a diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and suicide were excluded within the first year, and with anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders, while those in the first five years were excluded. In conclusion, SARS was associated with the increased risk of psychiatric disorders and suicide.", "publish_time": "2020-10-06", "authors": "Tzeng, Nian-Sheng; Chung, Chi-Hsiang; Chang, Chuan-Chia; Chang, Hsin-An; Kao, Yu-Chen; Chang, Shan-Yueh; Chien, Wu-Chien", "journal": "Transl Psychiatry", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/a8e665f2a72d51514b7f68da7410b9cb5dd3dbdd.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7538046.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-01021-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024072/", "s2_id": "222143301"}
