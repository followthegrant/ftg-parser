Emergency meetings of ACIP may occur if a vaccine candidate receives an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. This Update provides a combined summary of the August 26 and September 22, 2020, meetings, both of which focused completely on COVID-19 vaccines. Representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics (YAM, DWK) and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (STO) are present as liaisons to the ACIP", "publish_time": "2020-11-12", "authors": "O\u2019Leary, Sean T; Maldonado, Yvonne; Kimberlin, David W", "journal": "J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piaa144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180938/", "s2_id": "226848173"}
