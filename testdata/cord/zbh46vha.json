AVM compartments supplied by leptomeningeal networks and feeding arteries too small and/or tortuous for safe catheterization are rarely penetrated by liquid occlusive agents. A case with both impediments prompted a novel solution. A balloon was inflated across the supply to a lenticulostriate feeder, thereby favoring penetration of the liquid occlusive agent, injected from a different feeding territory, back into the AVM compartment supplied by the temporarily occluded feeder. This technique may reduce the number of embolization stages in large high-flow AVMs and increase the likelihood of achieving complete occlusion. This technique is highly complex and requires meticulous monitoring of multiple events.", "publish_time": "2014", "authors": "Bank, William O; Stemer, Andrew B; Armonda, Rocco A; Bell, Randy S", "journal": "Journal of neurointerventional surgery", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010637.rep; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23943818/", "s2_id": "24196185"}
