This study reports the efficacy of family-wide polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in screening, detecting, and identifying initial cases of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in Thailand. Respiratory secretions were collected from suspected individuals traveling from Wuhan, China to Thailand at the beginning of January 2020. Family-wide PCR assays yielded positive results for coronavirus in one traveler within 12 h on January 8, 2020. Nucleotide sequences (290 bp) showed 100% similarity to SARS-CoV-2. The whole genome sequence was further characterized by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for confirmation. Combining family-wide PCR, as a rapid screening tool, with NGS, for full genome characterization, could facilitate early detection and confirmation of a novel pathogen and enable early containment of a disease outbreak.", "publish_time": "2020-10-07", "authors": "Wacharapluesadee, Supaporn; Buathong, Rome; Iamsirithawon, Sopon; Chaifoo, Walairat; Ponpinit, Teerada; Ruchisrisarod, Chanida; Sonpee, Chanikarn; Katasrila, Panticha; Yomrat, Siriporn; Ghai, Siriporn; Sirivichayakul, Sunee; Okada, Pilailuk; Mekha, Nanthawan; Karnkawinpong, Opart; Uttayamakul, Sumonmal; Vachiraphan, Apichart; Plipat, Tanarak; Hemachudha, Thiravat", "journal": "Front Public Health", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/7265f063ed3eaaddcb804ff720cd89cc962a9299.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7579402.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.555013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134237/", "s2_id": "222143030"}
