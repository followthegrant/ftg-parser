We describe herein novel findings in a case of FSCD that was diagnosed and medically managed following virus detection by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of surgical biopsy samples. Hematologic changes in this ferret suggested spread of the virus to the bone marrow, which was confirmed by IHC staining of a postmortem sample. Genotyping of the virus indicated that the virus grouped with alphacoronaviruses and was most closely related to ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) MSU-2. Our clinical case demonstrates that a FRECV MSU-2-like ferret coronavirus associated previously with the enteric pathotype may cause systemic disease, including bone marrow involvement causing persistent pancytopenia.", "publish_time": "2020-06-26", "authors": "Tarbert, Danielle K; Bolin, Lisa L; Stout, Alison E; Schaefer, Deanna M W; Ruby, Rebecca E; Rodriguez-Ramos Fernandez, Julia; Duhamel, Gerald E; Whittaker, Gary R; de Matos, Ricardo", "journal": "Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638720937105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32589111/", "s2_id": "220071118"}
