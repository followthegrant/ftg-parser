Multiple materials and designs were developed to produce face masks that focused on ease of production, the ability to generate a reliable facial seal, and the ability to tailor the mask for those who did not fit commercially available N95 masks. Two final designs were selected. Mask components were assembled into kits and distributed to community sewists. Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were developed for quality improvement. A process was successfully developed to produce 5000 face masks in a period of 3 weeks that fit almost all (95%) health care workers who did not fit in a commercially available mask. The process was able to produce quality face masks with specific attention paid to developing masks that would pass qualitative fit testing.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Mehta, Sonia; Dooley, F Cole; Gore, Stephanie; Spiess, Bruce; Gravenstein, Nik; Algarra, Nelson Nicolas", "journal": "Am J Med Qual", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#32911956", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "221621646"}
