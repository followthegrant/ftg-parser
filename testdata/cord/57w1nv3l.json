The concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC(50,) 2 \u00b5M) was >35x higher than the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after oral administration of the approved dose of ivermectin when given fasted. Simulations were conducted using an available population pharmacokinetic model to predict total (bound and unbound) and unbound plasma concentration\u2010time profiles after a single and repeat fasted administration of the approved dose of ivermectin (200 \u03bcg/kg), 60 mg, and 120 mg. Plasma total Cmax was determined and then multiplied by the lung:plasma ratio reported in cattle to predict the lung Cmax after administration of each single dose. Plasma ivermectin concentrations of total (bound and unbound) and unbound concentrations do not reach the IC(50), even for a dose level 10x higher than the approved dose. Even with the high lung:plasma ratio, ivermectin is unlikely to reach the IC(50) in lungs after single oral administration of the approved dose (predicted lung: 0.0873 \u00b5M) or at doses 10x higher that the approved dose administered orally (predicted lung: 0.820 \u00b5M). In summary, the likelihood of a successful clinical trial using the approved dose of ivermectin is low. Combination therapy should be evaluated in vitro. Re\u2010purposing drugs for use in COVID\u201019 treatment is an ideal strategy but is only feasible when product safety has been established and experiments of re\u2010purposed drugs are conducted at clinically relevant concentrations.", "publish_time": "2020-05-07", "authors": "Schmith, Virginia D.; Zhou, Jie (Jessie); Lohmer, Lauren RL", "journal": "Clin Pharmacol Ther", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/abdd02b8f977cbfea4b8222e901d94d1a65c7afc.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.1889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32378737/", "s2_id": "218532281"}
