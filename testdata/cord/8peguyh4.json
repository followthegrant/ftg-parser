Properties such as T helper cell function, T cell memory, and CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity may play critical roles in optimal and long-lived immunity through vaccination. Directly manipulating specific immune activation or antigen delivery pathways with adjuvants may selectively augment desired T cell responses in vaccination and may improve the effectiveness and durability of vaccine responses in humans. In this review we outline recently studied adjuvants in their potential for antigen presenting cell and T cell programming during vaccination, with an emphasis on what has been observed in studies in humans as available.", "publish_time": "2021-07-24", "authors": "Rapaka, Rekha R.; Cross, Alan S.; McArthur, Monica A.", "journal": "Vaccines (Basel)", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/18e9e35aa6d9eef5db844ff569e33fa49dad89dc.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8402546.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451945/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9080820", "s2_id": "237340362"}
