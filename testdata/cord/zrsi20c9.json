Methods A cross-sectional study among ophthalmologists that was done via a self-administered web-based survey with 25 questions, starting with demographic data, followed by questions regarding the effect of the pandemic on practice. After that, detailed questions about infection control measures taken by different facilities and the use of various personal protective equipment and their availability were asked. Results We received 106 responses to the survey. Most of the respondents (86.8%) reported a reduction in the number of patients in the outpatient clinics, 49% limited services to emergencies, 50% reported triage for all patients, and 28% only reported providing face masks for patients. All our participants wear masks either surgical or filtering, 67% always use slit-lamp shields, and 75.5% apply hand hygiene per patient. The availability of various personal protective equipment and disinfectants was reported by 72% of our participants. Conclusion Real-life practice differs from the theoretical recommendations. Extra measures are required regarding patients' triage, availability, and use of slit-lamp shields, face shields, and goggles. A stricter hand hygiene policy needs to be implemented and monitored.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Ashour, D. M.; Awad-Allah, M. A. A.; Yosef, M.; Saleh, M.
