In this document, a study of various scientific articles, reports, publications, and existing documentation on the digital transformation processes launched in the different Latin American universities was carried out, presenting the methodological proposals promoted toward the new modalities of remote education, the reinvention of administrative processes, and the support provided to the university community to reduce the digital divide. An online survey was designed to know the advances in the digital transformation (DT) of 20 universities in Latin America. Outcomes of the online survey supply insights in four key DT objectives: teaching and learning, student support, research, and administration. Also, a case study of the implementation and monitoring of the DT model at the Technological University of Panama and its projections was considered. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Castillo, A.; Villarreal, V.; Mora, D.; Ala\u00edn, L.", "journal": "Lecture Notes in Educational Technology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#covidwho-1349276", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-3941-8_7", "s2_id": "238007684"}
