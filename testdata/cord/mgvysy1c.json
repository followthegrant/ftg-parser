We included patients aged 12\u201317 years treated with LDV/SOF, presenting with significant fibrosis (F \u2265 2 on the METAVIR scale) in transient elastography (TE) at the baseline and we compared the outcomes with that of patients without fibrosis. Patients were followed every 4 weeks during the treatment, at the end of the therapy, at week 12 posttreatment, and one year after the end of treatment. Liver fibrosis was established using noninvasive methods: TE, aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), and Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4). There were four patients with significant fibrosis at baseline: one with a fibrosis score of F2 on the METAVIR scale, and three with cirrhosis (F4) at baseline. One year after the end of treatment, the hepatitis C viral load was undetectable in three of them. One patient was lost to follow-up after week 4. In two out of the four patients, a significant improvement and regression of liver fibrosis was observed (from stage F4 and F2 to F0-F1 on the METAVIR scale). In one patient, the liver stiffness measurement median increased 12 weeks after the end of the treatment and then decreased, but still correlated with stage F4. An improvement in the APRI was observed in all patients. In four patients without fibrosis, the treatment was effective and no progression of fibrosis was observed. A one-year observation of teenagers with CHC and significant fibrosis treated with LDV/SOF revealed that regression of liver fibrosis is possible, but not certain. Further observations in larger groups of patients are necessary to find predictors of liver fibrosis regression.", "publish_time": "2021-07-31", "authors": "Pokorska-\u015apiewak, Maria; Dobrzeniecka, Anna; Marczy\u0144ska, Magdalena", "journal": "Viruses", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/6c3ff32132fd30fac82266f0ffc40144348e901d.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8402679.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452383/", "s2_id": "237338984"}
