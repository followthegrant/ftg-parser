From the focal stereotaxic transplantation to the minimally invasive intravenous and intraarterial delivery, stem cells display the ability to replenish injured cells and to secrete therapeutic molecules, altogether promoting brain repair. The increased stroke incidence in COVID-19 survivors poses as a new disease indication for cell therapy, owing in part to the cells' robust anti-inflammatory properties. Optimization of the cell transplant regimen will ensure the safe and effective clinical application of cell therapy in stroke and relevant neurological disorders.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Park, You Jeong; Borlongan, Cesar V", "journal": "J Cereb Blood Flow Metab", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#covidwho-1288495", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x211026507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34187231/", "s2_id": "235686255"}
