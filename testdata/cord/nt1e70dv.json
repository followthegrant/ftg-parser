This phenomenon is called antibody-dependent infection enhancement (ADE). ADE not only promotes the virus to be recognized by the target cell and enters the target cell, but also affects the signal transmission in the target cell. Early formalin-inactivated virus vaccines such as aluminum adjuvants (RSV and measles) have been shown to induce ADE. Although there is no direct evidence that there is ADE in COVID-19, this potential risk is a huge challenge for prevention and vaccine development. This article focuses on the virus-induced ADE phenomenon and its molecular mechanism. It also summarizes various attempts in vaccine research and development to eliminate the ADE phenomenon, and proposes to avoid ADE in vaccine development from the perspective of antigens and adjuvants.", "publish_time": "2021-09-14", "authors": "Xu, Lele; Ma, Zhiqian; Li, Yang; Pang, Zhaoxia; Xiao, Shuqi", "journal": "Adv Immunol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/76b8044a2df24972553d63ec270fc19f688915df.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8438590.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34656289/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065277621000298; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ai.2021.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065277621000298", "s2_id": "237508163"}
