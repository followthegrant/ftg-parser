A more in-depth study of blood coagulation abnormality is needed. We retrospectively analyzed 147 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to three ICUs in Wuhan from February 9th, 2020 to March 20th, 2020. The baseline coagulation and other characteristics were studied. Our results showed that the prolonged PT, FDP, DD were positively correlated with the levels of neutrophils, ferritin, LDH, total bilirubin, multi-inflammation cytokines, and negatively correlated with the lymphocytes level (p < 0.01). The level of ATIII was significantly negatively correlated with the levels of neutrophils, ferritin, LDH, total bilirubin, IL2R, IL6 and IL8 (p < 0.05). The patients in the ARDS group had a more prominent abnormality in PT, FDP, DD and ATIII, while the patients in the AKI group had more prolonged PT, more severe FDP and DD level, more inferior ATIII and Fib level than those in the non-AKI group (p < 0.01). The value of PT, DD and FDP were positively correlated with the classical APACHE II, SOFA and qSOFA scores, while the ATIII was negatively correlated with them (p < 0.001). The high levels of PT, FDP and DD were correlated with in-hospital mortality (p < 0.001). In conclusion, blood coagulation disorder was prominent in ICU patients with COVID-19 and was correlated with multi-inflammation factors. The abnormality of blood coagulation parameters could be an adverse prognostic indicator for ICU patients with COVID-19.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Liu, Yang; Gao, Weibo; Guo, Wei; Guo, Yang; Shi, Maojing; Dong, Guiying; Ge, Qinggang; Zhu, Jihong; Lu, Jin", "journal": "J Thromb Thrombolysis", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#696135", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "221019379"}
