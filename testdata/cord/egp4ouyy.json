Nosocomial risk exists in maternity departments (3% in postnatal beds), incidence rates are 7.5\u201312.7% or 1.3\u20138.5 per 1000 days in neonatal care units and 14.2% or 11.7 per 1000 days in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Gram-positive cocci bloodstream infections are the most common nosocomial infections in NICU but viral gastroenteritis are more frequent in neonatal care units. Risk factors are low birthweight, small gestational age and intravascular catheter in NICU, and for viral nosocomial infections, visits and winter outbreaks.", "publish_time": "2004-02-07", "authors": "Lachassinne, E; Letamendia-Richard, E; Gaudelus, J", "journal": "Arch Pediatr", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/a47f4d3e7b35db88bde75a4a7cd8a81d50b9e1f1.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7133330.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X03006390; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X03006390", "s2_id": "71547455"}
