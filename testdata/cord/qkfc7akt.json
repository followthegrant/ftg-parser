In the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus infection, significantly abnormal coagulation parameters in SARS-CoV-2 infection occur very often, but complications in the opposite direction such as bleeding diathesis are very rare. In these cases, there are different levels of gravity: for one patient the major bleed required the anticoagulant therapy to be stopped until bleeding stabilized, one patient needed interventional radiology and one patient died.", "publish_time": "2021-04-01", "authors": "Coppola, Antonietta; Annunziata, Anna; Gioia, Maria Rosaria; Fiorentino, Giuseppe", "journal": "Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.1739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33794592/", "s2_id": "232764178"}
