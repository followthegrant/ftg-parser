This study retrospectively evaluated and compared the pre-, intra-, and post-operative clinical characteristics after open and robotic approaches for pancreatic enucleation. METHODS Fifty-six cases of enucleation for benign or borderline tumours of the pancreas treated from March 2010 to July 2015 were identified by a retrospective search. These included 25 patients who underwent an open approach and 31 patients who underwent a robotic approach. The clinical characteristics were extracted and compared. RESULTS The two groups had a similar location and pathology of the tumour. The robotic group had a significantly shorter operation time and significantly less blood loss than the open group. The rates of clinical pancreatic fistula (PF) formation and major complications were similar. The robotic approach could be applied for a tumour on the right side of the pancreas without increasing the incidence of clinical PF or other major complications. The patients with clinical PF had a significantly shorter distance between the lesion and the main pancreatic duct (MPD). CONCLUSION Robotic enucleation appears to be a feasible and safe approach for benign or borderline tumours of the pancreas and was associated with similarly favourable surgical outcomes as the open approach. Identifying and avoiding the MPD is an important step during enucleation.", "publish_time": "2016", "authors": "Jin, Jia-Bin; Qin, Kai; Li, Hua; Wu, Zhi-Chong; Zhan, Qian; Deng, Xia-Xing; Chen, Hao; Shen, Bai-Yong; Peng, Cheng-Hong; Li, Hong-Wei", "journal": "World journal of surgery", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-016-3655-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491323/", "s2_id": "24404297"}
