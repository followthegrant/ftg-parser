A recently identified membrane-associated form of the granins is likely to also be involved in this aggregation, as well as in the membrane envelopment of the aggregate during the formation of an immature secretory granule.", "publish_time": "1991", "authors": "Chanat, Eric; Pimplikar, Sanjay W.; Stinchcombe, Jane C.; Huttner, Wieland B.", "journal": "Cell Biophys", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/cac9726c46a9d9c587a8c846ab1d82331a338767.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090494/", "s2_id": ""}
