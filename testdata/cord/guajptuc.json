Passage through the basement membrane (BM), a 50\u2013100-nm-thick crucial barrier underlying epithelia and endothelia, is a prerequisite for successful host invasion. Such passage allows pathogens to reach nerve endings or blood vessels in the stroma and to facilitate spread to internal organs. During evolution, several pathogens have developed different mechanisms to cross this dense matrix of sheet-like proteins. To breach the BM, some microorganisms have developed independent mechanisms, others hijack host cells that are able to transverse the BM (e.g. leukocytes and dendritic cells) and oncogenic microorganisms might even trigger metastatic processes in epithelial cells to penetrate the underlying BM.", "publish_time": "2012-01-31", "authors": "Steukers, Lennert; Glorieux, Sarah; Vandekerckhove, Annelies P.; Favoreel, Herman W.; Nauwynck, Hans J.", "journal": "Trends Microbiol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/ed6763279a0411caa9ec4872d2df1131ae18d42d.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127156.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2012.01.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X12000029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22300759/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X12000029", "s2_id": "11456393"}
