It is not known whether COVID-19 additionally affects arterial stiffness. METHODS: This case-control study compared brachial-ankle pulse wave (baPWV) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocities (cfPWV) of acutely ill patients with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-two COVID-19 patients (50% females, 77 [67-84] years) were compared with 22 age- and sex-matched controls. In COVID-19 patients, baPWV (19.9 [18.4-21.0] vs. 16.0 [14.2-20.4], P = 0.02) and cfPWV (14.3 [13.4-16.0] vs. 11.0 [9.5-14.6], P = 0.01) were higher than in the controls. In multiple regression analysis, COVID-19 was independently associated with higher cfPWV (\u00df = 3.164, P = 0.004) and baPWV (\u00df = 3.532, P = 0.003). PWV values were higher in nonsurvivors. In survivors, PWV correlated with length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 appears to be related to an enhanced PWV reflecting an increase in arterial stiffness. Higher PWV might be related to an increased length of hospital stay and mortality.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Schnaubelt, S; Oppenauer, J; Tihanyi, D; Mueller, M; Maldonado-Gonzalez, E; Zejnilovic, S; Haslacher, H; Perkmann, T; Strassl, R; Anders, S; Stefenelli, T; Zehetmayer, S; Koppensteiner, R; Domanovits, H; Schlager, O", "journal": "J. intern. med", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1112272", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "232089166"}
