Rapid strategic communications planning in a pandemic by governments is, however, possible and necessary. Steps include setting up a dedicated communications task force, mobilising partners and resources, developing a creative brief and theory of change and overseeing the creation, testing, roll out and revision of content. In this short guide, we argue that a minimum of strategic planning can be undertaken rapidly, and that good use can be made of simple principles of behaviour change, even during pandemics. Our aim here is to provide a blueprint that governments and their partners, especially in low-income settings, can follow to design, coordinate and resource national communications efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic immediately and for the longer term.", "publish_time": "2020-08-06", "authors": "Curtis, Val; Dreibelbis, Robert; Sidibe, Myriam; Cardosi, Jason; Sara, Jennifer; Bonell, Chris; Mwambuli, Kaposo; Ghosh Moulik, Soma; White, Sian; Aunger, Robert", "journal": "BMJ Glob Health", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/a0100fac0b7563d13e09b317db484a5bb031c142.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7412616.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764128/", "s2_id": "219911186"}
