It is an established necessity that psychological support groups are jointly facilitated, which poses a challenge for lone Psychologists. In the context of COVID-19 and pressures on services, MDT members are less available to collaborate. Psychology referrals have increased and people with CF (PWCF) are at increased risk of social isolation. A virtual group was developed incorporating two CF services;addressing both the psychotherapeutic needs of PWCF and the need for collaboration of the lone Psychologists. Method: Two Psychologists from Glasgow and London adult CF centres connected online in June 2020. Similarities in therapeutic approach, experience of lone working, and need to increase outpatient contact were identified. Key themes to structure a series of groups were identified from Psychology referrals. The logistics of cross-NHS Trust working, GDPR, and IT issues were discussed and navigated. In January 2021 approval was given by stakeholders, including Information Governance. The group terms of reference and a pathway for patient recruitment and screening were developed. Results: Working as lone CF Psychologists can be isolating, with less opportunity for creativity. Collaborating has reduced isolation and made it possible to develop a virtual patient group. Regular meetings helped us stay connected and committed in a time of uncertainty and change. Our experiences mirror the anticipated benefits of the support group for PWCF. We hope to model this as facilitators. Conclusion: We present a way to overcome the barriers of isolation and lone-working to creatively collaborate on running virtual patient groups. This new service model presents opportunities for diversity and new ways of thinking. We hope that the group will help to reduce social isolation for PWCF in the same way it has done for two lone CF Psychologists.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "McKenzie-Howat, E.; Patel, S.", "journal": "Journal of Cystic Fibrosis", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#covidwho-1368813", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s1569-1993(21)00998-x", "s2_id": "236736480"}
