In the CREDENCE trial canagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or cardiovascular (CV) death by 31%. In this current analysis we sought to determine whether the effect of canagliflozin on HHF/CV death differed in subgroups defined by key baseline participant characteristics. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Canagliflozin was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of HHF/CV death regardless of age, sex, history of HF or CV disease, and the use of loop diuretics or GLP1 receptor agonists (all pinteraction >0.114). The absolute benefit of canagliflozin was greater in those at highest baseline risk, such as those with CV disease (50 fewer events/1000 patients treated over 2.5years versus 20 fewer events in those without CV disease) or advanced kidney disease (eGFR 30-45 ml/min/1.73m2 : 61 events prevented/1000 patients treated over 2.5 years versus 23 events in eGFR 60-90 ml/min/1.73m2 ). Canagliflozin consistently reduces the proportional risk of HHF/CV death across a broad range of subgroups with greater absolute benefits in those at highest baseline risk.
