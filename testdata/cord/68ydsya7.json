While machine learning (ML) is a powerful predictive tool, determining the proper algorithm to apply across diverse data sets is challenging. AutoPrognosis (AP) is a novel method that uses automated ML framework to incorporate the best performing stages of prognostic modeling into a single well-calibrated algorithm. We aimed to compare various ML methods to AP in predictive performance of complications after TKA. METHODS: Thirty-eight preoperative patient demographics and clinical features from all primary TKAs performed at California-licensed hospitals between 2015 and 2017 were evaluated as predictors of major complications after TKA. Traditional logistic regression (LR), various other ML methods (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Random Forest), and AP were used for model building to determine discriminative power (area under receiver operating curve), calibration (Brier score), and feature importance. RESULTS: Between 2015 and 2017, there were a total of 156,750 TKAs with 1109 (0.7%) total major complications. AP had the highest discriminative performance with area under receiver operating curve 0.679 compared with LR, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Random Forest (0.617, 0.601, 0.662, 0.657, and 0.545, respectively). AP (Brier score 0.007) had similar calibration as the other ML methods (0.006, 0.006, 0.022, 0.007, and 0.008, respectively). The variables that are most important for AP differ from those that are most important for LR. CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional ML algorithms, AP has superior discriminative ability with similar calibration and suggests nonlinear relationships between variables in outcomes of TKA.", "publish_time": "2021-08-02", "authors": "Devana, Sai K.; Shah, Akash A.; Lee, Changhee; Roney, Andrew R.; van der Schaar, Mihaela; SooHoo, Nelson F.", "journal": "Arthroplast Today", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/e902872a5f671b584e82f30868d2c4047f68fd06.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8349766.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349766/", "s2_id": ""}
