Widespread restrictions on community mobility have resulted in a projected decline of international tourism arrivals up to 30%. The rapid development of Virtual Reality (VR) and its effectiveness in the simulation of real-life experiences provides an opportunity for virtual holiday making especially when actual travel is not possible. Based on a quantitative study with 193 participants, the role of VR as a substitute for physical travel during the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 was examined, more specifically by looking at the relationship between perceived risk to travel and technological acceptance of VR. The findings suggest that tourists use VR as a travel substitute during and even after a pandemic. However, perceived risk does not play a significant role when it comes to using VR.", "publish_time": "2020-11-28", "authors": "Sarkady, Daniel; Neuburger, Larissa; Egger, Roman", "journal": "Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2021", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/526f64b78190a993d6099ce07e6f988bdcb97924.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7798063.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798063/", "s2_id": ""}
