The ability to detect disease outbreaks in the early stages is a key component of efficient disease control and prevention. With the increased availability of electronic health-care data and spatial analysis techniques, there is great potential to develop algorithms to enable more effective disease surveillance. The research focuses to develop a transparent user-friendly method to simulate the outbreak data. The paper describes the GIS tools to identify and define the field of investigation which requires consideration of the strengths and limitations of data collection instruments, facility of locational data collection, accuracy of locational data, and pertinent attributes for understanding disease risk. Using such information, it is quite easy for authorities to locate the highly effected area and take appropriate actions in that particular areas. However, GIS techniques, resources, and methods can be used in Pakistan for more effective investigation of vulnerable geographical locations.", "publish_time": "2020-05-01", "authors": "Sarwar, Suleman; Waheed, Rida; Sarwar, Sahar; Khan, Aisha", "journal": "Sci Total Environ", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/473106f0e1dbd6be47a6566633d1ecb09099dfe7.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387823/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720326061; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720326061?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139089", "s2_id": "218466606"}
