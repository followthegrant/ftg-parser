Skamnelos et. al reported a method to handmake face shields by attaching a sponge and an elastic band to an A4\u2010size OHP transparent sheet.(4) Yet, preparing such materials in large numbers can be difficult. To solve this problem, we present an alternate, easy method to make face shields with low\u2010cost materials along with the A4\u2010size OHP transparent sheet.", "publish_time": "2020-05-15", "authors": "Ino, Yuji; Yano, Tomonori; Yamamoto, Hironori", "journal": "Dig Endosc", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412104/; https://doi.org/10.1111/den.13724", "s2_id": "218649837"}
