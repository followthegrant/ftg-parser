Exact mechanisms for this extreme coagulation activation have not yet been elucidated. However, one of the consistent laboratory finding is the increase in fibrinogen, in some cases, marked elevation. High circulating levels of fibrinogen have been linked to thrombosis for years and for this reason, hyper\u2010fibrinogenemia is considered one of the mechanisms for COVID\u201019 coagulopathy. In this forum article, instead of the prothrombotic role, a protective function for fibrinogen is discussed. Fibrinogen, like the other well\u2010known acute phase reactants, is increased in COVID\u201019 possibly to protect the host.", "publish_time": "2020-06-03", "authors": "Thachil, Jecko", "journal": "J Thromb Haemost", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/d05e6bffab82c4e2e99b4e01577ab409892ce02b.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32588535/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14942", "s2_id": "219799858"}
