The cyclometalated iridium catalyst-mediated N-alkylation of amines with alcohols displays high activity (S/C up to 10,000 and yield up to 96%) and ratio of amine/imine (up to >99:1) in a broad range of substrates (up to 46 examples) using water as the green and eco-friendly solvent. Most importantly, this transformation is simple, efficient, and can be performed at a gram scale, showcasing its potential for industrially synthesizing N-alkylamine compounds.", "publish_time": "2020-10-19", "authors": "Luo, NianHua; Zhong, YuHong; Wen, HuiLing; Luo, Renshi", "journal": "ACS Omega", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/f422b318bc9f14da737c7a5bb28947fe2765ac5f.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7594325.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594325/", "s2_id": ""}
