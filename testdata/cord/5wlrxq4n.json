The analysis will allow to promote social relations by enhancing the facility\u2019s spaces and activities, with the ultimate objective of improving residents\u2019 quality of life. To assess social wellness and evaluate the effectiveness of the village areas and activities, this work introduces measures of sociability for both residents and places. Our data analysis is based on classical statistical methods and innovative machine learning techniques. First, we analyze the correlation between relational indicators and factors such as the outdoor temperature and the patients\u2019 movements inside the facility. Then, we use statistical and accessibility analyses to determine the spaces residents appreciate the most and those in need of enhancements. We observe that patients\u2019 sociability is strongly related to the considered factors. From our analysis, outdoor areas result less frequented and need spatial redesign to promote accessibility and attendance among patients. The data awareness obtained from our analysis will also be of great help to caregivers, doctors, and psychologists to enhance assisted care home social activities, adjust patient-specific treatments, and deepen the comprehension of the disease.", "publish_time": "2020-08-12", "authors": "Bellini, Gloria; Cipriano, Marco; De Angeli, Nicola; Gargano, Jacopo Pio; Gianella, Matteo; Goi, Gianluca; Rossi, Gabriele; Masciadri, Andrea; Comai, Sara", "journal": "Computers Helping People with Special Needs", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/879039de650bb1f4c2e0fcbdf1dc112e06ed7647.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7479800.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479800/", "s2_id": ""}
