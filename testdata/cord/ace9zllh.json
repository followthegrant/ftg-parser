Patients and methods: A vocal biomarker, a unitless scalar with a value between 0-1, was developed based on 434 voice samples. The biomarker training was followed by a prospective, multi-center, observational study. All subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2, had their voice recorded to a smartphone application and gave their informed consent to participate in the study. The association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the vocal biomarker was evaluated. Results: Final study population included 80 subjects with a median age of 29 [23-36], of whom 68% were men. Forty patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Infected patients were 12 times more likely to report at least one symptom (odds ratio 11.8, p<.001). The vocal biomarker was significantly higher among infected patients (0.11 [0.06-0.17] vs. 0.19 [0.12-0.3], p=.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) evaluating the association of the vocal biomarker with SARS-CoV-2 status was 72%. With a biomarker threshold of 0.115, the results translated to a sensitivity and specificity of 85% [95% CI: 70-94%] and 53% [95% CI: 36-69%], respectively. When added to a self-reported symptom classifier, the AUC significantly improved from 0.775 to 0.85. Conclusion: Voice analysis is associated with SARS-CoV-2 status and holds the potential to improve the accuracy of self-reported symptom-based screening tools. This pilot study suggests a possible role for vocal biomarkers in screening for SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Maor, Elad; Tsur, Nir; Barkai, Galia; Meister, Ido; Makmel, Shmuel; Friedman, Eli; Aronovich, Daniel; Mevorach, Dana; Lerman, Amir; Zimlichman, Eyal; Bachar, Gideon", "journal": "", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1230655", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "234498008"}
