Our goal was to evaluate the outcome of patients with severe CAP, focusing on the impact of new rather than old fluoroquinolones combined with \u03b2-lactam in the empirical antimicrobial treatments. METHODS: Retrospective study of consecutive patients admitted in a 16-bed general intensive care unit (ICU), between January 1996 and January 2009, for severe (Pneumonia Severity Index > or = 4) community-acquired pneumonia due to non penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and treated with a \u03b2-lactam combined with a fluoroquinolone. RESULTS: We included 70 patients of whom 38 received a \u03b2-lactam combined with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin and 32 combined with levofloxacin. Twenty six patients (37.1%) died in the ICU. Three independent factors associated with decreased survival in ICU were identified: septic shock on ICU admission (AOR = 10.6; 95% CI 2.87-39.3; p = 0.0004), age > 70 yrs. (AOR = 4.88; 95% CI 1.41-16.9; p = 0.01) and initial treatment with a \u03b2-lactam combined with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin (AOR = 4.1; 95% CI 1.13-15.13; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, when combined to a \u03b2-lactam, levofloxacin is associated with lower mortality than ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin in severe pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia.", "publish_time": "2011-03-15", "authors": "Olive, David; Georges, Hugues; Devos, Patrick; Boussekey, Nicolas; Chiche, Arnaud; Meybeck, Agnes; Alfandari, Serge; Leroy, Olivier", "journal": "BMC Infect Dis", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/463d44f3bcccc8432f468012eb3f708a8828a327.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3065411.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3065411/", "s2_id": ""}
