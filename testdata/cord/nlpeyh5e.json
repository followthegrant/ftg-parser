As a measure of transmissibility, the value of basic reproduction number varies over time during an epidemic of infectious disease. Hence, this study aimed to estimate concurrently the time-varying reproduction number over time during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Methods: We extracted the epidemic data from the \"Tracking the Epidemic\" website of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the duration of January 19, 2020 and March 14, 2020. Then, we applied the novel method implemented in the incidence and EpiEstim packages to the data of daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating the time-varying reproduction number in the R software. Results: The epidemic curve of daily new confirmed cases in China peaked around February 4-6, 2020, and then declined gradually, except the very high peak on February 12, 2020 owing to the added clinically diagnosed cases (Hubei Province only). Under two specified plausible scenarios for the distribution of serial interval, both curves of the estimated time-varying reproduction numbers fell below 1.0 around February 17-18, 2020. Finally, the COVID-19 epidemic in China abated around March 7-8, 2020, indicating that the prompt and aggressive control measures of China were effective. Conclusion: Seeing the estimated time-varying reproduction number going downhill was more informative than looking for the drops in the daily number of new confirmed cases during an ongoing epidemic of infectious disease. We urged public health authorities and scientists to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers routinely during epidemics of infectious diseases and to report them daily to the public until the end of the COVID-19 epidemic.", "publish_time": "2020-04-17", "authors": "Hu, Fu-Chang; Wen, Fang-Yu", "journal": "", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/fbaadfdfe0cfb67bc843b8e7171bb8211ed50218.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.11.20061838", "s2_id": "216055371"}
