In this work, computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches comprising ligand- and structure-based methods were explored for predicting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) inhibitors. The CADD ligand-based method used a quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) classification model that was built using 5276 organic molecules extracted from the ChEMBL database with SARS-CoV-2 screening data. The best model achieved an overall predictive accuracy of up to 67% for an external and internal validation using test and training sets. Moreover, based on the best QSAR model, a virtual screening campaign was carried out using 11,162 MNPs retrieved from the Reaxys(\u00ae) database, 7 in-house MNPs obtained from marine-derived actinomycetes by the team, and 14 MNPs that are currently in the clinical pipeline. All the MNPs from the virtual screening libraries that were predicted as belonging to class A were selected for the CADD structure-based method. In the CADD structure-based approach, the 494 MNPs selected by the QSAR approach were screened by molecular docking against M(pro) enzyme. A list of virtual screening hits comprising fifteen MNPs was assented by establishing several limits in this CADD approach, and five MNPs were proposed as the most promising marine drug-like leads as SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors, a benzo[f]pyrano[4,3-b]chromene, notoamide I, emindole SB beta-mannoside, and two bromoindole derivatives.", "publish_time": "2020-12-10", "authors": "Gaud\u00eancio, Susana P.; Pereira, Florbela", "journal": "Mar Drugs", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/1003805f6df81314fdaa991f085c0ff5014dd8d8.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7764804.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322052/; https://doi.org/10.3390/md18120633", "s2_id": "229281393"}
