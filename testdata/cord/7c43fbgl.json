The former measurements were used to determine the dissociation degree of CTAB in a confined geometry, in a thin common black film (CBF). The latter measurements allowed us to determine the electrolyte concentration at which a Newton black film (NBF) is formed and to study the influence the foam film type (CBF or NBF) has on the stability of the respective foam. Last but not least, CBFs were studied in a temperature gradient and it was found that water diffuses from cold to hot regions which can be explained with a negative Soret coefficient of HO. All of these examples demonstrate that - curves provide much more information about foam films than simply the interaction forces.", "publish_time": "2006-06-20", "authors": "Schulze-Schlarmann, Judith; Buchavzov, Natalie; Stubenrauch, Cosima", "journal": "Soft matter", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1039/b602975b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680237/", "s2_id": "98429105"}
