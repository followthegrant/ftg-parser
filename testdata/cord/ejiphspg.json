The anti-cancer and anti-viral activities have been demonstrated stressing possibilities for the drug repurposing and therefore new information on high dosage safety is on demand. We analyzed in vivo tissue responses for high doses of ivermectin using Corydoras fish as animal model. We made intestinal histology and hematologic assays after oral administration of ivermectin transported with polyelectrolytes formulation. Histology showed any apparent damage of intestinal tissues at 0.22\u2013170 mg of ivermectin/kg body weight. Immunofluorescence evidenced delocalization of Myosin-Vb at enterocytes only for the higher dose. Hematology parameters showed random variations after 7 days from administration, but a later apparent recover after 14 and 21 days. The study evaluated the potential of high doses of oral administration of ivermectin formulation, which could be an alternative with benefits in high compliance therapies.", "publish_time": "2020-12-31", "authors": "Madrid, Rafael R.M.; Mathews, Patrick D.; Patta, Ana C.M.F.; Gonzales-Flores, Anai P.; Ramirez, Carlos A.B.; Rigoni, Vera L.S.; Tavares-Dias, Marcos; Mertins, Omar", "journal": "Heliyon", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/328401206bf2e3657e352ad5c5a2e566cc09736d.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7775035.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020326633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33426351/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020326633; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05820", "s2_id": "229934929"}
