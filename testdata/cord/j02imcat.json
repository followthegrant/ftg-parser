Provision of dental services was significantly affected, with limited provision for emergencies resulting in patients increasingly attending hospitals.Objectives and methods The aim of the study was to assess the provision of emergency dental services by the maxillofacial departments during the initial COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the United Kingdom. At the outset of the first lockdown, we initiated a prospective study to monitor the presentation and management of dental emergencies at five hospital trusts. Data were collected onto an online live database until the lockdown relaxation.Results Of a total of 211 dental emergencies, 156 were infection-related, 42 were trauma-related and 12 were cases of post-operative complications. A proportion of patients (76%) could have been treated in primary care, with 52% of presentations having already been 'triaged' on several occasions by urgent dental hubs and given multiple antibiotic courses, rather than any direct treatment.Conclusion There is a need to restructure emergency dental service provision as well as planning for possible further COVID-19 spikes and future pandemics.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Blackhall, Kristian K; Singh, Rabindra P", "journal": "Br. dent. j", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1014998", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "231192727"}
