The value of superficial middle cerebral vein (SMCV) for predicting midline shift is currently unclear for patients with acute LAO. Methods: Consecutive acute LAO (middle cerebral artery M1 \u00b1 intracranial internal carotid artery) patients between March 2018 and May 2019 were included. Absent filling of ipsilateral cortical vein (marked as SMCV-) was defined as no contrast filling into the vein across the whole venous phase of four-dimensional computed tomography (CT) angiography derived from CT perfusion in the ischemic hemisphere. Results: In the total of 81 patients, 31 (38.4%) were identified as SMCV-. SMCV- independently predicted midline shift, with sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 82.5%. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that including SMCV- as a predictor in addition to baseline ischemic core volume significantly increased the area under the curve in predicting midline shift (SMCV- with baseline ischemic core volume vs. baseline ischemic core volume: AUC = 0.903 vs. 0.841, Z = 2.451, P = 0.014). Conclusion: In acute LAO patients, the presence of SMCV- was a sensitive and specific imaging marker for midline shift. SMCV- had supplementary value to baseline ischemic core volume in predicting midline shift.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Zhang, Sheng; Lin, Longting; Zhang, Ruiting; Wang, Meiping; Yu, Yannan; Shi, Zongjie; Parsons, Mark; Geng, Yu", "journal": "Frontiers in neurology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.570844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33224087/", "s2_id": "226247675"}
