A quantitative analysis of the Daily Nation and Citizen newspapers showed different patterns of framing of the virus. Specifically, this analysis focuses on multiple frames used by the two newspapers with respect to the following topical categories: context, basic information, preventive information, treatment information, medical research, Social context, Economic context, Political context, personal stories and other. Although the Daily Nation published more stories than the Citizen Newspaper, only the frame personal stories were significantly higher in the Daily Nation compared to Citizen Newspapers.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Mwangale Kiptinness, E.; Okoye, J.
