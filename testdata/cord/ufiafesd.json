Due to its high prevalence, it constitutes the first cause of disability among the Americas, where only a very low percentage of the population receives the adequate evidence-based psychological treatment. Internet-Based Interventions (IBIs) are a great alternative to reduce the treatment gap for mental disorders. Although there are several studies in low-and middle-income countries proving IBIs' feasibility and acceptability, there is still little evidence of the effectiveness in diverse social and cultural contexts such as Latin America. METHODS: Two studies will be described: Study 1 is focused on the cultural adaptation of a cognitive-behavioral IBI Smiling is Fun (Botella et al. 2012, 2015) for Ecuadorian population with depression based on the procedure by Salamanca-Sanabria et al. (2018). Study 2 describes the design of a randomized controlled trial to test the preliminary efficacy of the culturally adapted intervention in a Public Health Care setting. A total of 153 patients with mild to moderate degree of depression as assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) will be randomly assigned to either an IBI group using only automated support by the system; an IBI group including also minimal human support; or a waiting list group. The primary outcome (depression) and secondary outcomes (e.g., anxiety, affect, quality of life) will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Mixed-model analyses with no ad hoc imputations will be conducted. DISCUSSION: This paper is pioneering in exploring the role of an Internet-based culturally adapted intervention for depression in a public care context in Ecuador. Results obtained will offer new insights into the viability and effectiveness of digital technologies for the psychological treatment of mental illnesses in developing countries.", "publish_time": "2020-11-28", "authors": "Qui\u00f1onez-Freire, Carlos; Vara, M.
