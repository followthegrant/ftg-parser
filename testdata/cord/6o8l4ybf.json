As a newly emerging disease, new cases are reported each day to add to the physician\u2019s knowledge about the best clinical approach. One of the controversies in this regard is the gold standard diagnostic method. Evidence suggests that polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR) for Coronavirus nucleic acid has a low sensitivity and computed tomography (CT) has been suggested for more accurate diagnosis. Yet, CT has the disadvantage of radiation and is not safe in all patients. Here, we present a case series of 23 patients who underwent both RT\u2013PCR and CT and report the outcome.
