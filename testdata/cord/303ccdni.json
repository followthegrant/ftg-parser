There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a similar entity in adults (MIS-A). We report a case of a young adult with a hyperinflammatory systemic syndrome with end-organ lesions and a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods and Procedures The patient developed end-organ lesions in the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, haematological and mucocutaneous systems. A wide diagnostic work-up did not find any specific aetiology (autoimmunity, neoplastic or infectious). There was evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection with positive autoimmune titres (positive IgG). A presumptive diagnosis of MIS-A was made and treatment with corticosteroids was introduced with improvement. Discussion COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults is still an unknown entity with no diagnostic criteria or treatment guidelines. Much of what is known is inferred from what we already know about MIS-C. There have been several reported cases with severity ranging from mild to severe. The mechanisms behind this condition are still largely unknown. More evidence is needed to establish diagnosis and treatment. LEARNING POINTS COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults is a new entity with few case reports.Awareness is important for early diagnosis and treatment.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Pombo, Francisco; Seabra, Carolina; Soares, Vergilio; S\u00e1, Ana Jo\u00e3o; Ferreira, In\u00eas; Mendes, Marina", "journal": "European journal of case reports in internal medicine", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.12890/2021_002520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987131/", "s2_id": "234497761"}
