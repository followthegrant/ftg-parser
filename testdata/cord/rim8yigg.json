STUDY DESIGN: We contacted non-pregnant patients at an urban, safety-net hospital-based primary care clinic who had been prescribed DMPA intramuscular (IM) in the past year to gauge interest in self-administered DMPA-SC. Interested patients received a prescription for DMPA-SC and a telehealth appointment with a clinic provider to learn self-injection. We recorded patient interest in DMPA-SC, completed appointments, and completed first injections. We conducted initial outreach in May, 2020 and recorded appointment attendance and completed injections through August, 2020. RESULTS: Of 90 eligible patients (age 17-54), we successfully contacted and discussed DMPA-SC with 70 (78%). Twenty-six (37%) patients expressed interest in DMPA-SC and scheduled telehealth appointments to learn to self-administer the medication. Fifteen (58%) of those interested (21% of the total) successfully self-injected DMPA-SC. Of the 44 (63%) patients not interested in DMPA-SC, the three most common reasons were fear of self-injection (n=23 [52%]), wanting to stop DMPA (n=11 [25%]), and satisfaction with DMPA-IM (n=6 [14%]). CONCLUSION: There is interest in and successful initiation of self-administered DMPA-SC among patients at an urban safety net hospital-based primary care clinic who have used DMPA-IM in the last year.", "publish_time": "2020-09-12", "authors": "Katz, Micah; Newmark, Rebecca L.; Aronstam, Alison; O'Grady, Niamh; Strome, Sara; Rafie, Sally; Karlin, Jennifer", "journal": "Contraception", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/7f8b32ff386851dfe47e18a44f4e02d26a0d1af2.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7486600.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32931811/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782420303413?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010782420303413; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2020.09.001", "s2_id": "221616234"}
