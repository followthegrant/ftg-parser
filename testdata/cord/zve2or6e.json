In responding to the COVID\u201019 pandemic, the course content switched from the biochemistry of nucleic acids to the science of the newly discovered virus, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. This provided a unique opportunity to model authentic science inquiry through cycles of questioning, investigating, assessing, and critical thinking on a rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary topic. This learning experience helped enhance science literacy, supported self\u2010directed learning and curiosity, and emphasized the importance of evaluating information sources to recognize misinformation.", "publish_time": "2020-10-14", "authors": "Zewail\u2010Foote, Maha", "journal": "Biochem Mol Biol Educ", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/7de6810f19c8f9c45dbe5601f2161963b1a95b86.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7675327.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/bmb.21462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053605/", "s2_id": "222420553"}
