From improvements in finding and catching fish to emulating their natural prey and accessing previously inaccessible waters, to anglers sharing their exploits with others, technology is completely changing all aspects of recreational fishing. These innovations would superficially be viewed as positive from the perspective of the angler (aside from the financial cost of purchasing some technologies), yet for the fisheries manager and policy maker, technology may create unintended challenges that lead to reactionary or even ill-defined approaches as they attempt to keep up with these changes. The goal of this paper is to consider how innovations in recreational fishing are changing the way that anglers interact with fish, and thus how recreational fisheries management is undertaken. We use a combination of structured reviews and expert analyses combined with descriptive case studies to highlight the many ways that technology is influencing recreational fishing practice, and, relatedly, what it means for changing how fisheries and/or these technologies need to be managed\u2014from changes in fish capture, to fish handling, to how anglers share information with each other and with managers. Given that technology is continually evolving, we hope that the examples provided here lead to more and better monitoring of technological innovations and engagement by the management and policy authorities with the recreational fishing sector. Doing so will ensure that management actions related to emerging and evolving recreational fishing technology are more proactive than reactive.", "publish_time": "2021-02-23", "authors": "Cooke, Steven J.; Venturelli, Paul; Twardek, William M.; Lennox, Robert J.; Brownscombe, Jacob W.; Skov, Christian; Hyder, Kieran; Suski, Cory D.; Diggles, Ben K.; Arlinghaus, Robert; Danylchuk, Andy J.", "journal": "Rev Fish Biol Fish", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/0ee04c155ecb70dbddb5b438017738eb3e3ce1d6.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7900803.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642705/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11160-021-09643-1", "s2_id": "232016800"}
