Current evidence confirms the role of dromedaries in primary human infections but does not explain the sporadic community cases. However, asymptomatic or subclinical cases could represent a possible source of infection in the community. METHODS: Archived human sera (7461) collected between 2011 and 2016 from healthy adult blood donors from 50 different nationalities in the western part of Saudi Arabia were obtained for MERS-CoV seroprevalence investigation. Samples were tested for MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (Abs) by ELISA and confirmed by testing for neutralizing Abs (nAbs) using both pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays. RESULTS: Out of 7461 samples, 174 sera from individuals with 18 different nationalities were ELISA positive (2.3%, 95% CI 2.0-2.7). Presence of nAbs was confirmed in 17 samples (0.23%, 95% CI 0.1-0.4) of which one sample exhibited positivity in both neutralization assays. Confirmed seropositivity was identified in young (15-44 years) men and women from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, and India without significant preference. CONCLUSIONS: An increasing trend of MERS-CoV seroprevalence was observed in the general population in western Saudi Arabia, suggesting that asymptomatic or mild infections might exist and act as an unrecognized source of infection. Seropositivity of individuals from different nationalities underscores the potential MERS exportation outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, enhanced and continuous surveillance is highly warranted.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Degnah, Afnan A; Al-Amri, Sawsan S; Hassan, Ahmed M; Almasoud, Abdulrahman S; Mousa, Manar; Almahboub, Sarah A; Alhabbab, Rowa Y; Mirza, Ahmed A; Hindawi, Salwa I; Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Azhar, Esam I; Hashem, Anwar M", "journal": "J Infect Public Health", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#154833", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "210998406"}
