SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it has been described to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor. Natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in domestic and wildlife animals, measured by RT-qPCR, has been confirmed in different countries, especially from the Felidae family. In silico analysis of the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the cellular receptor ACE2 in various animal species has suggested that wild felids and domestic cats could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 based on this interaction. Here, we performed a protein-protein molecular docking analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the ACE2 receptor from different animals to elucidate the potential of those species as intermediate hosts or susceptible animals for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared to human ACE2, we found that ACE2 receptors from domestic cats and tigers could efficiently interact with RBD of SARS CoV-2 Spike protein. However, dog, ferret, and hamster ACE2 receptor interaction with SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD was not predicted as favorable, demonstrating a potential differentiated susceptibility in the evaluated species.", "publish_time": "2021-02-15", "authors": "Rendon-Marin, Santiago; Martinez-Gutierrez, Marlen; Whittaker, Gary R.; Jaimes, Javier A.; Ruiz-Saenz, Julian", "journal": "Front Genet", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/45589d1977b92f8b40b263663a40b891f0e1b49d.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7917236.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33659022/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.571707", "s2_id": "231919348"}
