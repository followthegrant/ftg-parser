However, it remains unknown whether this association represents an independent risk for poor outcome. We aimed to estimate the attributable effect of CMV reactivation on mortality in immunocompetent ARDS patients. METHODS: We prospectively studied immunocompetent ARDS patients who tested seropositive for CMV and remained mechanically ventilated beyond day 4 in two tertiary intensive care units in the Netherlands from 2011 to 2013. CMV loads were determined in plasma weekly. Competing risks Cox regression was used with CMV reactivation status as a time-dependent exposure variable. Subsequently, in sensitivity analyses we adjusted for the evolution of disease severity until onset of reactivation using marginal structural modeling. RESULTS: Of 399 ARDS patients, 271 (68 %) were CMV seropositive and reactivation occurred in 74 (27 %) of them. After adjustment for confounding and competing risks, CMV reactivation was associated with overall increased ICU mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 2.74, 95 % CI 1.51\u20134.97), which resulted from the joint action of trends toward an increased mortality rate (direct effect; cause specific hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95 % CI 0.86\u20132.90) and a reduced successful weaning rate (indirect effect; cause specific HR 0.83, 95 % CI 0.58\u20131.18). These associations remained in sensitivity analyses. The population-attributable fraction of ICU mortality was 23 % (95 % CI 6\u201341) by day 30 (risk difference 4.4, 95 % CI 1.1\u20137.9). CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation is independently associated with increased case fatality in immunocompetent ARDS patients who are CMV seropositive.
