A 37-year-old man with COVID-19 presented with moderate symptoms, mild pulmonary impairment and elevated inflammatory markers, suggesting an increased risk of cytokine storm and possible worsening of clinical condition. Experimental use of colchicine resulted in an 85% decrease in C reactive protein levels 3 days after treatment initiation and a 182.6% decrease in interleukin-6 levels 8 days after treatment initiation. Due to the lack of effective therapies, it is important to search for potential compounds and compounds that focus on controlling the danger caused by systemic inflammation in COVID-19. Although further research is needed in the area of colchicine and viral infection, preliminary efficacy was observed.", "publish_time": "2021-07-29", "authors": "Knack, Rafael Silvestre; Losso, Luis Carlos; Knack, Renata Silvestre; Hanada, Talie", "journal": "BMJ Case Rep", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/efac1305dde74458676abd11649104730c949c37.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8323388.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326122/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-244482", "s2_id": "236515168"}
