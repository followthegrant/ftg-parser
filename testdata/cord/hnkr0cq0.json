Healthcare workers adherence to prevention and control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we assessed the KAP among healthcare workers towards COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. Method A self-developed piloted KAP questionnaire was used among the recruited healthcare workers working for the COVID-19 response in the Universal College of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital (UCMSTH), in Bhairahawa, Nepal. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of questions regarding the clinical characteristics, prevention and management of COVID-19. Assessment on attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on behaviour and change in practices while working during this response. Knowledge scores were calculated and compared by demographic characteristics and their attitude and practices towards COVID-19. Data were analysed using bivariate statistics. Results A total of 103 healthcare workers participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 28.24(6.11) years (range: 20-56); 60.2% were females; 61.2% were unmarried; 60.2% had medical degree and 39.8% were nursing staff. The mean knowledge score was 10.59(1.12) (range: 7-13) and it did not vary by demographic characteristics. Attitude was positive for 53.4% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.35(1.19) and negative for 46.6% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.88(0.98) (p=0.02). Practice was good ([\u2265]3 score) for 81.5% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.73(1.12) and practice was poor for 18.5% participants with a mean knowledge score of 10.46(1.13) (p=0.24). The attitude of the participants improved with the increasing age of the participants (29.55(7.17), p=0.02). Conclusion There is comparably better knowledge regarding COVID-19 among healthcare workers along with appropriate practices, however attitude was less optimistic with better knowledge but more optimistic with higher age of the healthcare workers. Hence, protective measures for healthcare workers in order to improve their attitude is necessary during the pandemic response.", "publish_time": "2020-08-22", "authors": "Limbu, D. K.; Piryani, R.
