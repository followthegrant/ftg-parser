In response to the state of emergency imposed by COVID-19, Jordanian universities switched to the online learning model as an alternative to traditional face-to-face education. The researchers designed a questionnaire that consists of two main sections; the first section included demographic information including gender, level/year, age, and cumulative average (GPA). The second section comprised five main constructs: (1) use of digital tools (mobile phone, laptop, i-pad) before and after COVID-19, (2) sleeping habits before and after COVID-19, (3) social interaction, (4) psychological state, and (5) academic performance. The researchers contacted different instructors teaching compulsory courses at four public and private universities and asked them to distribute the electronic questionnaire. Using the snowball sampling method, the questionnaire was delivered to students studying at the selected universities, and a total of 775 responses was received. The data were analyzed according to Likert's five-point scale, where frequencies and percentages were calculated. The data will be useful for researchers interested in studying the relationship between the e-learning model and psychosomatic disorders. Policymakers can use the data to identify university students\u2019 emotional and psychological needs and propose practical solutions for their educational well-being.", "publish_time": "2020-07-31", "authors": "Haider, Ahmad S; Al-Salman, Saleh", "journal": "Data Brief", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/350a466b63bbdac0c96ec5327667a7c7c23a0e12.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7392902.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920309987?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352340920309987; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.106104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789158/", "s2_id": "220871906"}
