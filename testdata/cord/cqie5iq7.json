Although children are particularly vulnerable, biomonitoring studies are lacking. Toenail concentration of 24 metals was measured in 366 children (6\u201310 years), who live and attend school in a city hosting a cement plant. Living addresses and schools were geocoded and attributed to exposed or control areas, according to modeled ground concentrations of PM(10) generated by the cement plant. Air levels of PM(10) and NO(2) were monitored. PM(10) levels were higher in the exposed, than in the control area. The highest mean PM(10) concentration was recorded close to the cement plant. Conversely, the highest NO(2) concentration was in the control area, where vehicular traffic and home heating were the prevalent sources of pollutants. Exposed children had higher concentrations of Nickel (Ni), Cadmium (Cd), Mercury (Hg), and Arsenic (As) than controls. These concentrations correlated each other, indicating a common source. Toenail Barium (Ba) concentration was higher in the control- than in the exposed area. The location of the attended school was a predictor of Cd, Hg, Ni, Ba concentrations, after adjusting for confounders. In conclusion, children living and attending school in an urban area exposed to cement plant emissions show a chronic bioaccumulation of toxic metals, and a significant exposure to PM(10) pollution. Cement plants located in populous urban areas seem therefore harmful, and primary prevention policies to protect children health are needed.", "publish_time": "2021-06-25", "authors": "Di Ciaula, Agostino", "journal": "Expo Health", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/fca9d7f62e20c7c3e8ebdb932c3fe7476319ac6c.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8229267.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12403-021-00412-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189342/", "s2_id": "235638499"}
