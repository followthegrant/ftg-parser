Methods This study was conducted in a consecutive series of 130 patients. 134 procedures were performed for treating these patients in Hanoi Medical University Hospital and Bach Mai Hospital from January 2012 to April 2017. 143 flow diverter stents (Pipeline, FRED and SILK) were used. Aneurysm morphology, stent patency and cerebral parenchyma before and after intervention were analyzed on images of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR). The follow-up data after 3-6 months and 12 months were recorded. Results In 130 patients (31 men, 99 women), aneurysms of internal carotid artery were mostly common (92.6%), especially in cavernous (35.1%) and in para-ophthalmic (40.3%) segments. 83 cases (61.9%) had wide-neck aneurysms, and 16 cases (11.9%) had multiple aneurysms, and only 5 cases (3.7%) had blister-liked aneurysms. Endovascular treatment was successfully performed at rate of 94.8%. In 3 patients, the stent could not be delivered. Mortality and morbidity rates were 1.5% and 3.7%, respectively. MRI and MSCT follow-up at 3 months showed complete or incomplete occlusions of aneurysms was 7.4% or 17.5%, respectively. 3 patients experienced a thromboembolic event (4.3%). Conclusions Intracranial aneurysms of cavernous and para-ophthalmic segments of internal carotid artery are mostly common with wide-neck and multi aneurysms. Deployment of flow diverter stent is safe and effective with high rate of successful and low procedural complications.", "publish_time": "2020-02-01", "authors": "Binh, Nguyen Thai; Luu, Vu Dang; Thong, Pham Minh; Cuong, Nguyen Ngoc; Anh, Nguyen Quang; Tuan, Tran Anh; Linh, Le Tuan; Thien, Nguyen Tat; Uddin, Md Jamal; Dinh, Thien Chu; Chu, Dinh-Toi", "journal": "Heliyon", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32055743/", "s2_id": "211098008"}
