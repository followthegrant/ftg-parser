Nurses are assuming expanded roles for a broad range of patients in community-based care. Nurse educators have a responsibility to teach nursing students about the needs of patients and families in the home care setting. METHOD: To describe how the creation of a home care video series and a medication reconciliation simulation scenario were used as a teaching strategy in a simulation center. RESULTS: The teaching strategy supported senior-level nursing students' understanding of the complexity of home care nursing and the nurse's role and responsibilities in care coordination, care transitions, and interprofessional practice. CONCLUSION: The home care video scenario was received favorably by nursing students. Additional simulation video scenarios are needed that address the health disparities among underrepresented and vulnerable groups. There is potential to offer the simulation in a virtual-online format during the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing mandates.
