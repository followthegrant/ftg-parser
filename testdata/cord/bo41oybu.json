It has also induced some changes in working habits at dermatology clinics. The majority of dermatology clinics limited the number of patients at outpatient clinics and postponed the elective procedures. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the working conditions and habits of dermatologists in Turkey during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. METHODS: This is a survey study with seventeen questions in which two hundred fifteen dermatologists working in Turkey participated. RESULTS: Our results revealed that 53.5% of the participants worked in the areas related to COVID\u201019 during the pandemic. The average number of dermatology outpatient days in a week was five among the 48.8% of dermatologists, 21.4% of those had three working days, and 18.1% of those had four days. During the pandemic, the most common reasons for referral to outpatient clinics were acne and acneiform eruptions (88.8%), dermatitis (73.5%), and hair loss (71.2%). Participants hesitated to use the following treatments: long\u2010term systemic steroid (77.7%), cyclosporine (69.8%), and methotrexate (60%). CONCLUSION: It is observed that the COVID\u201019 pandemic had affected the working habits and conditions of the dermatologists, which might be considered for the designing of new working approaches.", "publish_time": "2021-06-25", "authors": "Ustaoglu, Eda", "journal": "J Cosmet Dermatol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/27d922e8e9b10b72bee6224d0377eb1262afb5a0.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8447070.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133815/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14297", "s2_id": "235460879"}
