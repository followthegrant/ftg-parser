Of these, the function of the Nidovirus RdRp associated nucleotidyl transferase domain (NiRAN) remains unanswered. The elucidation of the 3D structure of RdRp from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), provided the first ever insights into the domain organisation and possible functional characteristics of the NiRAN domain. Using in silico tools, we predict that the NiRAN domain assumes a kinase or phosphotransferase like fold and binds nucleoside triphosphates at its proposed active site. Additionally, using molecular docking we have predicted the binding of three widely used kinase inhibitors and five well characterized anti-microbial compounds at the NiRAN domain active site along with their drug-likeliness as well as DFT properties. For the first time ever, using basic biochemical tools, this study shows the presence of a kinase like activity exhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Interestingly, the proposed kinase inhibitors and a few of the predicted nucleotidyl transferase inhibitors significantly inhibited the aforementioned enzymatic activity. In line with the current global COVID-19 pandemic urgency and the emergence of newer strains with significantly higher infectivity, this study provides a new anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug target and potential lead compounds for drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2.", "publish_time": "2021-02-03", "authors": "Dwivedy, Abhisek; Mariadasse, Richard; Ahmad, Mohammed; Chakraborty, Sayan; Kar, Deepsikha; Tiwari, Satish; Majumdar, Tanmay; Jeyakanthan, Jeyaraman; Biswal, Bichitra K.", "journal": "bioRxiv", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/c9819e8e0813dfd774390c9cc4466c9c1937f606.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.03.429510", "s2_id": "231884990"}
