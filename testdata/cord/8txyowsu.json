Two weeks after the resolution of COVID-19 infection, he presented with shortness of breath and oxygen desaturation requiring intubation and admission to the intensive care unit. The workup confirmed miliary pulmonary TB. The patient subsequently improved on antitubercular treatment. We discuss the possible contribution of COVID-19 infection to the rapid progression of TB infection to involve the lung in a miliary pattern, and how the coexistence of the two diseases might have led to a worse outcome.", "publish_time": "2021-03-30", "authors": "Elziny, Moustafa M.; Ghazy, Ahmed; Elfert, Khaled A.; Aboukamar, Mohamed", "journal": "Am J Trop Med Hyg", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/123fe4cc0ef20a8dfc0dfa9af4c5a402b878f87a.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8103485.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784243/; https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1156", "s2_id": "232429700"}
