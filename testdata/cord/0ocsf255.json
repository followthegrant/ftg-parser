Family therapists, paradoxically, given the core of their work is with systems, are also experiencing upheaval in professional and personal lives, trying to work amidst a society in chaos. This paper offers a collection of reflections by systemic and family therapists from diverse cultures and contexts penned in the midst of the pandemic. The main intention in distilling these narratives is to preserve the \u2018cultural diversity\u2019 and \u2018ecological position\u2019 of the contributors, guided by phenomenology, cultural ecology, and systemic worldviews of \u2018experiencing.\u2019 The second intention is to \u2018unite\u2019 promoting solidarity in this isolating situation by bringing each story together, creating its own metaphor of a family: united, connected, stronger. As a cross\u2010cultural family practitioner, with a strong mission for collaboration, the lead author acknowledges the importance of Context \u2013 the nation and location of the experience; Culture \u2013 the manner in which culture impacts on experience; Collaboration \u2013 enhancing partnership, enriching knowledge, and mapping the journey\u2019s direction; and Connectedness \u2013 combating isolation while enhancing unity. Since the key transmission of culture is through language, raw reflections were sought initially in the practitioners\u2019 own language, which were translated for an English\u2010speaking readership. These narratives are honest and rich descriptions of the authors\u2019 lived experiences, diverse and distinctive. The contributors trust colleagues will find these reflections helpful, validating and acknowledging the challenges of this unique period in history.", "publish_time": "2020-06-08", "authors": "Amorin\u2010Woods, Deisy; Fraenkel, Peter; Mosconi, Andrea; Nisse, Martine; Munoz, Susana", "journal": "Aust N Z J Fam Ther", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/379da3c50aa52fdc31677e140730bcca461507f4.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7300858.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/anzf.1416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836731/", "s2_id": "219800150"}
