We describe a panel of human mAbs binding to diverse epitopes on the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors and found a minority of these possessed neutralizing activity. Two mAbs (COV2-2676 and COV2-2489) inhibited infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 and recombinant VSV/SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We mapped their binding epitopes by alanine-scanning mutagenesis and selection of functional SARS-CoV-2 S neutralization escape variants. Mechanistic studies showed that these antibodies neutralize in part by inhibiting a post-attachment step in the infection cycle. COV2-2676 and COV2-2489 offered protection either as prophylaxis or therapy, and Fc effector functions were required for optimal protection. Thus, natural infection induces a subset of potent NTD-specific mAbs that leverage neutralizing and Fc-mediated activities to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection using multiple functional attributes.", "publish_time": "2021-03-16", "authors": "Suryadevara, Naveenchandra; Shrihari, Swathi; Gilchuk, Pavlo; VanBlargan, Laura A.; Binshtein, Elad; Zost, Seth J.; Nargi, Rachel S.; Sutton, Rachel E.; Winkler, Emma S.; Chen, Elaine C.; Fouch, Mallorie E.; Davidson, Edgar; Doranz, Benjamin J.; Chen, Rita E.; Shi, Pei-Yong; Carnahan, Robert H.; Thackray, Larissa B.; Diamond, Michael S.; Crowe, James E.", "journal": "Cell", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/c6dfc8077114075d9918f57c038d4daa38d19ae8.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773105/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867421003573; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421003573?v=s5", "s2_id": "232234730"}
