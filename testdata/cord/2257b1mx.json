PURPOSE: To compare the LB in urban and rural patients suffering from chronic coronary syndrom (CCS) METHODS: 250 outpatients suffering from CCS were invited during the 6th week of the 1st C19 lockdown to answer to a phone-call questionnaire. RESULTS: 220 questionnaires were fit for analysis, of whom about 1/4 declared a psychologic impairment; people staying at home in urban zones trended to be more impacted. Unhealthier behaviours including cigarette smoking, decrease in physical activity and increase in screentime were common, especially in patients from urban zones. Telehealth partially counterbalanced limitation in care access and none declared discontinuation of medications. CONCLUSION: The lockdown impacted wellbeing of CCS patients; living in rural zone was associated with a healthier LB.", "publish_time": "2021-05-11", "authors": "Chague, F; Cransac-Miet, A; Boulin, M; Saint-Jalmes, M; Bichat, F; Soudry, A; Danchin, N; Zeller, M; Cottin, Y", "journal": "Eur J Prev Cardiol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136086/", "s2_id": ""}
