Diarrhea and vomiting have been reported in about 8%\u20109% of cases, reaching more than 20% in some studies. Children with gastrointestinal involvement appear to be younger than those without, but the severity of the disease seems to be similar between the two groups of subjects. Fecal shedding in children has been reported in 20%\u201030% of children and has been observed in both those with and those without overt gastrointestinal involvement. Moreover, prolonged fecal elimination, lasting several days after negativization of real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction assay on respiratory swabs, has been reported with variable frequency in children with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. These observations raise the question regarding the possibility of oral\u2010fecal transmission and the possible role of children in spreading the infection, particularly when they appear asymptomatic or with gastrointestinal symptoms but with no respiratory involvement, as well as during their convalescent phase.", "publish_time": "2020-11-24", "authors": "Chiappini, Elena; Licari, Amelia; Motisi, Marco Antonio; Manti, Sara; Marseglia, Gian Luigi; Galli, Luisa; Lionetti, Paolo", "journal": "Pediatr Allergy Immunol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/b5fbb5f5184505bc95b5bb15c134cdb01167494b.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7753808.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33236437/; https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.13373", "s2_id": "227154995"}
