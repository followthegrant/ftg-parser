The specific sepsis-related biomarkers should be used in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic response monitoring, rational use of antibiotics, and prognosis (risk stratification), etc. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the expression level of Decoy Receptor 3 (DcR3) and the mechanism of high expression in sepsis patients. Septic cell model experiments were performed by treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and Jurkat cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and zymosan, respectively. SP600125, SB203580 and ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) were used to inhibit JNK1/2, p38MAPK and NF-\u03baB signalling pathways in septic cell model, respectively. These results showed that DcR3 levels were higher in sepsis group than control. DcR3 mRNA and protein levels in HUVECs were increased following treatment with LPS, LTA and zymosan, and also increased in Jurkat cells treated by LPS, but not by LTA or zymosan. When HUVECs were treated with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor PDTC, DcR3 expression was decreased compared with controls. However, SP600125 and SB203580 had no effect on DcR3 mRNA or protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that DcR3 secretion proceeded through the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway in HUVECs.", "publish_time": "2018-12-27", "authors": "Hou, Yanqiang; Liang, Dongyu; Liu, Yang; Chen, Hongwei; Lou, Xiaoli", "journal": "BMC Biochem", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/6bfd2809e31c992d160d33b11111f8cebda23876.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6307204.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6307204/", "s2_id": ""}
