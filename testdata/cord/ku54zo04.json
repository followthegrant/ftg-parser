The rapid growth of the disease has led to overwhelmed health-care systems, overcrowded hospitals, an insufficient number of health-care professionals and shortages of medical equipment. The potential exposure of front-line health-care workers during the COVID-19 outbreak has led to self-isolation and the appearance of adverse feelings such as stress, anxiety and fear. All these factors, combined with an increased workload and extra and changed shifts, are determinants of a sleep-loss process that may result in insomnia. The exacerbated pro-inflammatory milieu caused by insomnia and sleep deprivation present in health professionals may therefore make them more prone to developing severe COVID-19 if infected and/or aggravate the symptoms of the disease. Keeping these professionals healthy and doing everything possible to prevent them from being infected with COVID-19 should be a top priority. As part of this effort, we must be aware of the important effects of insomnia on the immune systems of these professionals and take all possible measures to counter these effects.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Ishikura, Isabela A; Rosa, Daniela S; Hachul, Helena; Pires, Gabriel N; Tufik, Sergio; Andersen, Monica L", "journal": "Scand J Public Health", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1192683", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "233298892"}
