This study proposes a dynamic co-evolution of knowledge management and business model transformation based on a comparative analysis of the focal firms' BMs and their main partners in two e-commerce ecosystems in China. Design/methodology/approach The open data of listed companies regarding the introduction of emerging topics on the transformation tendency of BMs in the post-COVID-19 business world is qualitatively analysed. The theoretical foundation is based on a critical review of the literature. Findings Three aspects of the co-evolution between knowledge management and business model transformation are introduced. These three aspects are as follows: knowledge integration helps with multi-system business integration and decision-making collaborations;knowledge sharing helps to enhance cognitive ability and network value based on businesses;and the creation of new knowledge helps enrich the knowledge base and promote the transformation of BMs. Research limitations/implications Solely attributing a firm's ability to cope with environmental uncertainties to its business model weakens the importance of its knowledge management. This study argues that the co-evolution between knowledge management and business model transformation also plays a key role in a firm's response to issues post-COVID-19. Originality/value This study calls for the development of a normative theory of co-evolution between knowledge management and business model transformation, implying uncharted territories of knowledge management based on interaction with business model designs in e-business ecosystems.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Li, H.
