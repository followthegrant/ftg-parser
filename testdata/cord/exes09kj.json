Reactions toward older adults included a mix of prosocial behaviors and ageist responses, consistent with the history of positive and negative views and treatment of older adults in the United States. METHODS: In a two-part study (n = 113, M(age) = 18.49, SD = 0.50; range 18\u201319), we examined whether pre-pandemic ageism among undergraduates predicts prosocial behavioral intentions toward older adults both specific to COVID-19 and in general. RESULTS: Pre-pandemic ageism toward older adults predicted less intentions to help older adults generally and specific to COVID-19. Whereas viewing older adults as incompetent predicted greater intentions to help specific to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: These results reflect the complexity of predicting helping behaviors and suggest that even supportive behaviors toward older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic may be rooted in negative ageist stereotypes. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.", "publish_time": "2020-10-29", "authors": "Lytle, Ashley; Apriceno, MaryBeth; Macdonald, Jamie; Monahan, Caitlin; Levy, Sheri R", "journal": "J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/1f1490d67e96036194270497e05009af01cca667.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7798635.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33386844/", "s2_id": "230108808"}
