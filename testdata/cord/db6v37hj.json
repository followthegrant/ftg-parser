We have humanized this antibody to generate MAb hu206 by complementarity determining region grafting. MAb hu206 retained binding and in vitro neutralizing activity, as well as cross-reactivity with ten different VZV strains. Single-chain antibody fragments (scAb) derived from MAb hu206 were produced in Escherichia coli. These scAb retained the binding properties of the whole antibody. However, monomeric scAb exhibited markedly reduced neutralizing activity compared to the bivalent parental MAb hu206. Shortening the peptide linker joining the V(H) to the V(kappa) domain from 14 to 5 or even 0 residues encouraged multimerization and increased neutralizing efficacy. The fact that Fab fragments enzymatically generated from whole MAb hu206 lost their neutralizing potency lent support to the proposal that valency is important for VZV neutralization at this epitope.", "publish_time": "2001", "authors": "Drew, P D; Moss, M T; Pasieka, T J; Grose, C; Harris, W J; Porter, A J", "journal": "The Journal of general virology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11458003/", "s2_id": "40653673"}
