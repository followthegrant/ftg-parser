Neurodegenerative disorders are known to be chronic, disabling diseases that imply a higher vulnerability to infections, and for this reason, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have a worse course in these patients. In the present study, we report our experience with 12 patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) who became infected with SARS-Cov-2 due to a COVID-19 outbreak in a care residency, and thus hospitalised in our COVID hospital. Most of the PD patients had a long disease duration and multiple comorbidities even though SARS-CoV-2 manifestations were mild, and none required intensive care. Despite lung conditions, most of our PD patients had mild symptoms: 7 patients were clinically asymptomatic (58.3%); 3 patients had fever, cough, and myalgia (25%) and 2 patients had dyspnoea (16%) that needed high-flow oxygen therapy. Few complications related to PD were seen. All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalisation period of 30 days. Mortality rate during hospitalisation was zero. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not have a poor prognosis in patients with PD. More extensive data and evaluations, however, are needed to confirm our data, and caution is warranted.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Buccafusca, Maria; Micali, Cristina; Autunno, Massimo; Versace, Antonio Giovanni; Nunnari, Giuseppe; Musumeci, Olimpia", "journal": "Neurol Sci", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1028115", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "231593152"}
