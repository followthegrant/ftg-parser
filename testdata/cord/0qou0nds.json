We integrated commercially available reagents into a CRISPR/Cas9-based lateral flow assay that can detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences with single-base specificity. This approach requires minimal equipment and represents a simplified platform for field-based deployment. We also developed a rapid, multiplex fluorescence CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease cleavage assay capable of detecting and differentiating SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus in a single reaction. Our findings provide proof-of-principle for CRISPR/Cas9 point-of-care diagnosis as well as a scalable fluorescent platform for identifying respiratory viral pathogens with overlapping symptomology.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Osborn, Mark J; Bhardwaj, Akshay; Bingea, Samuel P; Knipping, Friederike; Feser, Colby J; Lees, Christopher J; Collins, Daniel P; Steer, Clifford J; Blazar, Bruce R; Tolar, Jakub", "journal": "", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1085120", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "232087208"}
