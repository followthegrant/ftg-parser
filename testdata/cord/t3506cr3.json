This overstretched situation has been greatly aggravated since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study is to analyse the prevalence of burnout among primary care physicians and to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on burnout. Methods: This was a multicentre longitudinal descriptive study of occupational factors and burnout before and since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to assess the impact of the pandemic on burnout in primary care physicians, two paired groups of physicians were compared using Wilcoxon\u2019s and McNemar\u2019s tests. Results: In January 2019, 10% of primary care physicians scored high on all burnout domains. Seven months into the COVID-19 pandemic (October 2020), this percentage increased to 50%. Paired groups analysis showed unprecedented worsening due to the pandemic: emotional exhaustion, which already affected 55% of primary care physicians, jumped to 77%. Conclusions: Burnout is endemic among primary care physicians. It has been associated with lower patient satisfaction, reduced health outcomes, and increased costs. The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed burnout in primary care professionals to the edge.", "publish_time": "2021-08-27", "authors": "Seda-Gombau, Gemma; Montero-Al\u00eda, Juan Jos\u00e9; Moreno-Gabriel, Eduard; Tor\u00e1n-Monserrat, Pere", "journal": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/74d560676fc58188a5dc1d18d5856060a02f6152.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8431168.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501618/", "s2_id": "237470458"}
