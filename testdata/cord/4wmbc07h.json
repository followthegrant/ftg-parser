In mammals, hair cells lack regenerative capacity, and their death leads to permanent hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Their paucity and inaccessibility has limited the search for otoprotective and regenerative strategies. Growing hair cells in vitro would provide a route to overcome this experimental bottleneck. We report a combination of four transcription factors (Six1, Atoh1, Pou4f3, and Gfi1) that can convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts, adult tail-tip fibroblasts and postnatal supporting cells into induced hair cell-like cells (iHCs). iHCs exhibit hair cell-like morphology, transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles, electrophysiological properties, mechanosensory channel expression, and vulnerability to ototoxin in a high-content phenotypic screening system. Thus, direct reprogramming provides a platform to identify causes and treatments for hair cell loss, and may help identify future gene therapy approaches for restoring hearing.", "publish_time": "2020-06-30", "authors": "Menendez, Louise; Trecek, Talon; Gopalakrishnan, Suhasni; Tao, Litao; Markowitz, Alexander L; Yu, Haoze V; Wang, Xizi; Llamas, Juan; Huang, Chichou; Lee, James; Kalluri, Radha; Ichida, Justin; Segil, Neil", "journal": "", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/5418783a26f473cec99e73bb7adb2e7ec375c794.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7326493.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326493/", "s2_id": ""}
