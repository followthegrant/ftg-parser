It explores the gaps between their practices, perspectives and discourses that discuss Islam\u2019s relevance in health educational programmes. Individual semi-structured interviews with 19 local women of diverse social backgrounds show that while Islam is influential in their health conceptions, this is limited to the self-internalisation of theologically-based discourses. Discussions on how positive gender relations based on Islamic values can contribute to women\u2019s health outcomes are lacking in their narratives, existing academic literature and public discourses. A comprehensive approach to leveraging religious concepts in advocating good health for Muslims should also include women\u2019s empowerment and improvement of gender relations.", "publish_time": "2021-08-20", "authors": "Zainal, Humairah; Masud, Dhiya Mahirah; Mohamed Nasir, Kamaludeen", "journal": "Cont Islam", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/fdf8a9d56ac20074b0cc9e37823af2acd819ea6c.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8378528.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8378528/", "s2_id": ""}
