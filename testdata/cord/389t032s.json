We focused on using synthetic peptides for developing antibodies against SARS-CoV, which aimed to block viral invasion by eliciting an immune response specific to the native SARS-CoV S protein. Methods: Six peptide sequences corresponding to the surface regions of SARS-CoV S protein were designed and investigated by use of combined bioinformatics and structural analysis. These synthetic peptides were used to immunize both rabbits and monkeys. Antisera collected 1 week after the second immunization were analyzed by ELISA and tested for antibody specificity against SARS-CoV by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Results: Four of our six synthetic peptides (S2, S3, S5, and S6) elicited SARS-CoV-specific antibodies, of which S5 (residues 788\u2013820) and S6 (residues 1002\u20131030) exhibited immunogenic responses similar to those found in a parallel investigation using truncated recombinant protein analogs of the SARS-CoV S protein. This suggested that our S5 and S6 peptides may represent two minimum biologically active sequences of the immunogenic regions of the SARS-CoV S protein. Conclusions: Synthetic peptides can elicit specific antibodies to SARS-CoV. The study provides insights for the future development of SARS vaccine via the synthetic-peptide-based approach.", "publish_time": "2004-06-01", "authors": "Choy, Wai-Yan; Lin, Shu-Guang; Chan, Paul Kay-Sheung; Tam, John Siu-Lun; Lo, Y M Dennis; Chu, Ida Miu-Ting; Tsai, Sau-Na; Zhong, Ming-Qi; Fung, Kwok-Pui; Waye, Mary Miu-Yee; Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing; Ng, Kai-On; Shan, Zhi-Xin; Yang, Min; Wu, Yi-Long; Lin, Zhan-Yi; Ngai, Sai-Ming", "journal": "Clin Chem", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/29c8e6c9a49f04815754c6c29eec9f8bc7bb5070.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108158.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15044316/", "s2_id": "15017915"}
