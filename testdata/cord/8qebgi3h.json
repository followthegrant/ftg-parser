Transcription factors (TFs) served as essential DNA binding proteins play an integral role in regulating cytokine storm, and the detection of it in the human coronavirus environment provides especially valuable approaches to diagnosis and treatment of 2019-nCoV and development of antiviral drugs. In this work, an entropy-driven electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was constructed for ultra-sensitive bioassay of NF-\u03baB p50. The strategy primarily capitalizing the splendid double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding properties of transcription factors, employing GOAu-Ru composite material as ECL emitter, utilizing entropy-driven reactions for signal amplification method, offered a repeatable proposal for TFs detection. In the absence of TFs, the released DNA1 further went in the entropy-driven reaction, contributing to an \u201cECL off\u201d state. However, in the presence of TFs, the dsDNA avoided being digested, which blocked DNA1 for participating in the entropy-driven reaction, and the system exhibited an \u201cECL on\u201d state. Most importantly, the ECL bioanalytical method denoted broad application prospects for NF-\u03baB p50 detection with a lower detection limit (9.1 pM).", "publish_time": "2020-12-30", "authors": "Zhang, Kai; Fan, Zhenqiang; Yao, Bo; Zhang, Tingting; Ding, Yuedi; Zhu, Sha; Xie, Minhao", "journal": "Biosens Bioelectron", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/f3a15682699b5b5dee6b324afc9c1e78ad66bd7a.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7772087.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112942; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566320309271?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566320309271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33401144/", "s2_id": "229716114"}
