BACKGROUND: Given the high incidence of coronavirus and shortage of nurses in Iranian hospitals, learning about nurses' intention to care for patients with COVID-19 is important. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, 648 Iranian nurses were surveyed during March 2020. The online questionnaire consisted of two parts. The mediating role was explored for the following: job satisfaction and commitment in the association of workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours, and pay satisfaction with the intention to care. The study adhered to STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: The results of this study show that job satisfaction and organisational commitment mediated the relationship of nurses' workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours, and pay satisfaction with the intention to care for patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate the importance of job satisfaction and organisational commitment as mechanisms that help to understand the association of nurses' workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours and pay satisfaction with the intention to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Hospital managers need to attend to the role of nurses' job satisfaction and other organisational factors to ensure that they can cope with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Sharif Nia, Hamid; Arslan, G\u00f6kmen; Naghavi, Navaz; Sivarajan Froelicher, Erika; Kaveh, Omolhoda; Pahlevan Sharif, Saeed; Rahmatpour, Pardis", "journal": "J Clin Nurs", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#covidwho-1150160", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "231987007"}
