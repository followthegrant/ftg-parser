Accordingly, many aviation stakeholders put hopes into the ongoing process of vaccination, with the expectation that a high degree of vaccination will push the envelope for a return to normalcy. One prerequisite for reviving international air connectivity is the introduction of verification documents, also called \u201cvaccination passports\u201d. These passports, however, come with several challenges which need to be overcome in order to enable recovery. In this study, we propose a framework covering five important aspects and policy challenges concerning the introduction of vaccination passports for a return of aviation, covering the topics: Competition, Epidemiology, Technology, Ethics, and Politics. Neglecting to appropriately address these challenges will likely not only delay the recovery, but possibly miss an important opportunity before new disastrous events appear on the horizon.", "publish_time": "2021-06-29", "authors": "Sun, Xiaoqian; Wandelt, Sebastian; Zhang, Anming", "journal": "Transp Policy (Oxf)", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/1e4e64229af9c649921536696d40f5f086fa0728.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8481163.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X21001992; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.06.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0967070X21001992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608363/", "s2_id": "237686749"}
