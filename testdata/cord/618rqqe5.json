Globally, control of Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) are the most challenging aspects of viral hepatitis elimination. In many developed countries elimination of HBV could be targeted to special populations mostly immigrants from low resource settings. Elimination of HCV however remains a challenge globally. Barriers to HCV elimination include high cost of medications and the ability to engage specific at-risk populations as well as individuals who are out of medical care. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, treatment access and screening has been further negatively impacted by social distancing rules and COVID-19 related anxieties. This threatens to throw most countries off course in their elimination efforts. Prior to the pandemic, some states in the US had had scaled up their elimination efforts with plans to ramp up testing and treatment using Netflix like payment models for HCV DAAs (Direct Acting Antiviral Drugs). Most of these efforts have stalled on account of the health system's focus on COVID-19 control. To prevent further delays in achieving elimination targets, programs would need to explore new models of care that address COVID-19 related access hurdles. Systems that leverage technologies like telemedicine and self-testing could help maintain treatment levels. Mathematical models estimate that Covid-19-related delays in 2020 could lead to 44,800 hepatocellular cancers and 72,300 liver-related deaths over the next decade.", "publish_time": "2021-04-29", "authors": "Sowah, Leonard; Chiou, Christine", "journal": "AIDS research and human retroviruses", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1089/aid.2020.0301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913731/", "s2_id": "233447645"}
