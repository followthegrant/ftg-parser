METHODS: We prospectively studied pregnant women attending our hospital with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection by RT\u2010PCR test and an age\u2010matched control group who admitted for routine prenatal care. An ultrasound examination that included measurements of the AT, ET, and AT/ET ratio (PATET) were performed and the results were compared. RESULTS: Fifty\u2010five SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected and 93 control group pregnant women were included in this study. AT found higher in the COVID\u201019 positive group when compared with controls. When the ET and PATET parameters were compared, no differences were detected between the groups. Eleven neonates had Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) requirement in the COVID\u201019 positive group while there were none in the control group. All fetal pulmonary artery Doppler values were decreased in NICU admitted fetuses. The mean gestational week of this group was lower than non\u2010NICU COVID\u201019 positive group and the control group. CONCLUSION: COVID\u201019 infection increases fetal pulmonary blood flow, which appears high AT values on Doppler parameters. NICU admission only occurred in the COVID\u201019 group and their Doppler values were found significantly lower than non\u2010NICU COVID\u201019 group. The clinical significance of this result must be evaluated with further studies.", "publish_time": "2021-06-29", "authors": "Sule, Goncu Ayhan; Aysegul, Atalay; Selcan, Sinaci; Atakan, Tanacan; Eda, Ozden Tokalioglu; Deniz, Oluklu; Filiz, Halici Ozturk; Ozlem, Moraloglu Tekin; Dilek, Sahin", "journal": "Echocardiography", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/c28765f6806cd7f87d7246301dc8bd03507b97de.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8444886.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34184313/; https://doi.org/10.1111/echo.15146", "s2_id": "235672993"}
