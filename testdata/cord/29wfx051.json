As a result, there is still an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers and effective therapeutic approaches. Severe-critical manifestations of COVID-19 are caused by a dysregulated immune response. Immune checkpoint molecules such as Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) play an important role in regulating the host immune response and several lines of evidence underly the role of PD-1 modulation in COVID-19. Here, by analyzing blood sample collection from both hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy donors, as well as levels of PD-L1 RNA expression in a variety of model systems of SARS-CoV-2, including in vitro tissue cultures, ex-vivo infections of primary epithelial cells and biological samples obtained from tissue biopsies and blood sample collection of COVID-19 and healthy individuals, we demonstrate that serum levels of PD-L1 have a prognostic role in COVID-19 patients and that PD-L1 dysregulation is associated to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Specifically, PD-L1 upregulation is induced by SARS-CoV-2 in infected epithelial cells and is dysregulated in several types of immune cells of COVID-19 patients including monocytes, neutrophils, gamma delta T cells and CD4+ T cells. These results have clinical significance since highlighted the potential role of PD-1/PD-L1 axis in COVID-19, suggest a prognostic role of PD-L1 and provide a further rationale to implement novel clinical studies in COVID-19 patients with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.", "publish_time": "2021-06-07", "authors": "Sabbatino, Francesco; Conti, Valeria; Franci, Gianluigi; Sellitto, Carmine; Manzo, Valentina; Pagliano, Pasquale; De Bellis, Emanuela; Masullo, Alfonso; Salzano, Francesco Antonio; Caputo, Alessandro; Peluso, Ilaria; Zeppa, Pio; Scognamiglio, Giosu\u00e8; Greco, Giuseppe; Zannella, Carla; Ciccarelli, Michele; Cicala, Claudia; Vecchione, Carmine; Filippelli, Amelia; Pepe, Stefano", "journal": "Front Immunol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/fa601a235b12e2024fbc2f5699650397a7546c8d.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8215357.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163490/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.695242", "s2_id": "235354796"}
