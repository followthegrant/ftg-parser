Bempedoic acid is an emerging treatment for hypercholesterolemia that has recently been approved for marketing in the United States and Europe. This review focuses on its mechanism of action and summarizes the main preclinical study findings. Furthermore, we report the clinical evidence supporting and guiding its use in hypercholesterolemia management.", "publish_time": "2020-08-24", "authors": "Colivicchi, Furio; Di Fusco, Stefania Angela; Scicchitano, Pietro; Caldarola, Pasquale; Murrone, Adriano; Valente, Serafina; Urbinati, Stefano; Roncon, Loris; Amodeo, Vincenzo; Aspromonte, Nadia; Cipriani, Manlio; Domenicucci, Stefano; Francese, Giuseppina Maura; Imazio, Massimo; Scotto di Uccio, Fortunato; Di Lenarda, Andrea; Gulizia, Michele Massimo; Gabrielli, Domenico", "journal": "Journal of cardiovascular medicine", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842050/", "s2_id": "221326069"}
