The key features of the mask are the mutual arrangement of the layers, the direction of air flows and the synchronization of the discharge with respiration, which ensures the safe wearing of the mask and high degree of protection against pathogenic microorganisms.", "publish_time": "2020-04-02", "authors": "Starikovskiy, Andrey Yu.; Usmanova, Dinara R.", "journal": "", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "2004.00807", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/a031ab7127ab14bed64558c538b27715229d59d7.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00807v1.pdf", "s2_id": "214775100"}
