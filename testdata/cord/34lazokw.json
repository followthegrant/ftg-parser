We are already facing a \"second wave\" of infections and we might be dealing during the next months with a \"third wave\" and subsequently new waves. Therefore, during the different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic we have to face the problems of how to perform elective cardiac invasive procedures in non-COVID patients and which patients/procedures should be prioritised. In this context, the interplay between the pandemic stage, the availability of healthcare resources and the priority of specific cardiac disorders is crucial. Clear pathways for \"hot\" or presumed \"hot\" patients and \"cold\" patients are mandatory in each hospital. Depending on the local testing capacity and intensity of transmission in the area, healthcare facilities may test patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before the interventional procedure, regardless of risk assessment for COVID-19. Pre-hospital testing should always be conducted in the presence of symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In cases of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 positive patients, full personal protective equipment using FFP 2/N95 masks, eye protection, gowning and gloves is indicated during cardiac interventions for healthcare workers. When patients have tested negative for COVID-19, medical masks may be sufficient. Indeed, individual patients should themselves wear medical masks during cardiac interventions and outpatient visits.", "publish_time": "2021-01-08", "authors": "Chieffo, Alaide; Tarantini, Giuseppe; Naber, Christoph Kurt; Barbato, Emanuele; Roffi, Marco; Stefanini, Giulio G; Buchanan, Gill Louise; Buszman, Piotr; Moreno, Ra\u00fal; Zawi\u015blak, Barbara; Cayla, Guillaume; Danenberg, Haim; Da Silveira, Joao Antonio Brum; Nef, Holger; James, Stefan K; Mauri Ferre, Josepa; Voskuil, Michiel; Witt, Nils; Windecker, Stephan; Baumbach, Andreas; Dudek, Dariusz", "journal": "EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.4244/eij-d-20-01291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33416050/", "s2_id": "231192143"}
