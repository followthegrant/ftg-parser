Results obtained with resialylated erythrocytes indicated that the ability of the viruses to recognize 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in an \u03b12,6-linkage decreased in the following order: AT>CU>BCV>VA. Only minor differences were observed with respect to the \u03b12,3-linkage. The amino acid sequence of the S protein of strain CU and VA was derived from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene. Strain VA differed from strain CU in 34 positions, 18 in the S1 and 16 in the S2 subunit.", "publish_time": "1996", "authors": "K\u00fcnkel, F.; Herrler, G.", "journal": "Arch Virol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/106b769328f09f2f27eb26ecfe9d11f60c8325e2.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8712929/", "s2_id": "28024372"}
