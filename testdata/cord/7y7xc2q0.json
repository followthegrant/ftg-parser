Clinicians often struggle to distinguish these from primary headache disorders whereby there is no underlying structural pathology. Here the authors describe the advancement in our understanding of vascular headache disorders, their clinical presentation and the developments in neuroimaging that facilitate diagnosis.Areas coveredHere the authors discuss the definition of primary and secondary headache disorders. They review the literature on the presentation, choice of neuroimaging and diagnostic tools that can be used to diagnose specific vascular headaches including Carotid or Vertebral artery dissection, Stroke, Temporal Arteritis, subarachnoid haemorrhage, cerebral venous thrombosis, Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction syndrome, Primary angiitis, AV malformation and Genetic vasculopathy. The authors discuss the influence of Covid-19 on the management of patients with headache.Expert opinionWhilst developments in neuroimaging have been of paramount importance in the diagnosis of vascular headache disorders, there is no substitute for meticulous history taking and examination. Research has aided our understanding of clinical presentation however further studies are needed as well as increased education of neurologists and acute physicians.", "publish_time": "2021-09-23", "authors": "Dorsey, Sophie; Ahmed, Fayyaz", "journal": "Expert review of neurotherapeutics", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14737175.2021.1984882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34553658/", "s2_id": "237607482"}
