However, the clinical course of COVID-19 remains poorly characterized. Although some cases of pneumothorax have been reported, they all had pulmonary complications or were managed with mechanical ventilation. We herein report a case of pneumothorax that developed even though the patient had no pulmonary underlying diseases and had never been managed with mechanical ventilation. In the present case, a lung bulla was found on chest computed tomography during treatment for COVID-19. We concluded that COVID-19 affected the formation of the lung bulla and induced the complication of pneumothorax.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Yamaya, Takafumi; Baba, Tomohisa; Hagiwara, Eri; Ikeda, Satoshi; Niwa, Takashi; Kitayama, Takaaki; Murohashi, Kota; Higa, Katsuyuki; Sato, Yozo; Ogura, Takashi", "journal": "Intern Med", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#836062", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "225132751"}
