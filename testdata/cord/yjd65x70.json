(authoritarian control) and ?sermon? (two-way risk communication) policies, whereas two-way risk communication demonstrates a uniquely positive effect on public value consensus;and (b) the effect of two-way risk communication on policy compliance willingness is mediated by public value consensus By enhancing public value consensus, two-way risk communication helps establish consensus between citizens and the government on ?what needs/needs not to be done? and ?what should/should not be done? to slow down the pandemic, thus coalescing efforts in a cooperative spirit;(c) nudge intervention positively moderates the effect of two-way risk communication on public value consensus, but has no effect on the authoritarian control?policy compliance willingness relationship In other words, nudge intervention is a better companion to ?sermons,? not ?sticks ? Findings of the nuanced relationship manifested the differentiated effect of authoritarian control and two-way risk communication on citizens? policy compliance willingness during a pandemic The results provide theoretical implications for scholars to unlock the ?black box? of public values and practical implications for strategies from behavioral public administration aspects to curb the ongoing COVID-19", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Guan, Bin Bao Guoxian Liu Qingchuan Raymond Raduziner Gary", "journal": "Administration &amp; Society", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1085218", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "233959753"}
