In this research, drawing from the duality framework on leader characteristics, we examine how leader openness to experience is associated with their increased engagement in marketing behaviors (e.g. recruiting new customers). Across two field studies, including an exploratory sample of small business owners and a sample of non-executive leaders in the outpatient physical therapy industry, we find that openness to experience was related to leaders\u2019 likelihood of executing marketing functions. Additionally, this relationship was weakened when leaders had a primary focus on short-term financial outcomes (i.e., high bottom-line mentality). We further link marketing to unit-level performance in a subsample of Study 2, suggesting that non-executive leaders\u2019 marketing behaviors can impact objective organizational performance.", "publish_time": "2021-09-01", "authors": "Graham, Katrina A.; Smith, Robert S.", "journal": "Curr Psychol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/4213212ef8cf6c1d1a71f8f5558c81130d2319fa.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8409699.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34489613/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02216-2", "s2_id": "237398172"}
