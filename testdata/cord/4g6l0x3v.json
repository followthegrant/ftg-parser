Here, we provide spatial and temporal evidence that excess nutrients exacerbate the detrimental effects of heat stress to spark mass coral bleaching in the Red Sea. Exploiting this region's unique oceanographic regime, where nutrients and heat stress vary independently, we demonstrate that the world's third largest coral reef system historically suffered from severe mass bleaching only when exposed to both unusually high temperature and nutrients. Incorporating nutrient-supplying ocean currents and their variability into coral bleaching forecasts will be critical for effectively guiding efforts to safeguard the reefs most likely to persist in the Anthropocene.", "publish_time": "2020-08-01", "authors": "DeCarlo, Thomas M; Gajdzik, Laura; Ellis, Joanne; Coker, Darren J; Roberts, May B; Hammerman, Nicholas M; Pandolfi, John M; Monroe, Alison A; Berumen, Michael L", "journal": "Science advances", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abc5493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937375/", "s2_id": "221217373"}
