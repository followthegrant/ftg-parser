A significant factor in the workplace that is thought to influence employees\u2019 mental health is leadership behavior. Hence, effective leadership interventions to foster employees\u2019 (leaders\u2019 and staff members\u2019) mental health might be an important measure to address this pressing issue. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review according to the PRISMA statement (Liberati et al. 2009) and systematically searched the following databases: PubMed (PMC), Web of Science, PsycINFO (EBSCOhost), EconLit (EBSCOhost), and Business Source Premier (EBSCOhost). In addition, we performed a hand search of the reference lists of relevant articles. We included studies investigating leadership interventions in the health care sector that aimed to maintain/foster employees\u2019 mental health. RESULTS: The systematic search produced 11,221 initial search hits in relevant databases. After the screening process and additional literature search, seven studies were deemed eligible according to the inclusion criteria. All studies showed at least a moderate global validity and four of the included studies showed statistically significant improvements of mental health as a result of the leadership interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, leadership interventions with reflective and interactive parts in group settings at several seminar days seem to be the most promising strategy to address mental health in health care employees. As the available evidence is limited, efforts to design and scientifically evaluate such interventions should be extended.", "publish_time": "2020-10-04", "authors": "Stuber, Felicitas; Seifried-D\u00fcbon, Tanja; Rieger, Monika A.; G\u00fcndel, Harald; Ruhle, Sascha; Zipfel, Stephan; Junne, Florian", "journal": "Int Arch Occup Environ Health", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/a3ba999001a89961d42c3d5d033fb6aeabfedd43.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7532985.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33011902/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-020-01583-w", "s2_id": "222119473"}
