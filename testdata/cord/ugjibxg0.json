Culture is central to an effective community-engaged public health communication to reduce collective risks. In this commentary, we discuss the importance of culture in unpacking messages that may be the same globally (physical/social distancing) yet different across cultures and communities (individualist versus collectivist). Structural inequity continues to fuel the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on black and brown communities nationally and globally. PEN-3 offers a cultural framework for a community-engaged global communication response to COVID-19.", "publish_time": "2020-07-09", "authors": "Airhihenbuwa, C.O.; Iwelunmor, J.; Munodawafa, D.; Ford, C.L.; Oni, T.; Agyemang, C.; Mota, C.; Ikuomola, O.B.; Simbayi, L.; Fallah, M.P.; Qian, Z.; Makinwa, B.; Niang, C.; Okosun, I.", "journal": "Prev Chronic Dis", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/9f17aea23769e3513367554638ca0ef20a962194.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7367065.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd17.200245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32644918/", "s2_id": "220471811"}
