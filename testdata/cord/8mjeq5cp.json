Here we report that the MERS-CoV receptor--dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)--is expressed in the upper respiratory tract epithelium of camels but not in that of humans. Lack of DPP4 expression may be the primary cause of limited MERS-CoV replication in the human upper respiratory tract and hence restrict transmission.", "publish_time": "2016", "authors": "Widagdo, W; Raj, V Stalin; Schipper, Debby; Kolijn, Kimberley; van Leenders, Geert J L H; Bosch, Berend J; Bensaid, Albert; Segal\u00e9s, Joaquim; Baumg\u00e4rtner, Wolfgang; Osterhaus, Albert D M E; Koopmans, Marion P; van den Brand, Judith M A; Haagmans, Bart L", "journal": "Journal of virology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02994-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26889022/", "s2_id": "4774743"}
