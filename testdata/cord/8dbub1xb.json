However, an abdominal incision, albeit much smaller than conventional surgery, is still needed. A transvaginal extraction of a sigmoid colon neoplasia with en bloc salpingo-oophorectomy and colorectal mechanical anastomosis is described. The technique is feasible and safe. The excellent recovery of the 86-year-old patient shows the potential future of the natural orifices endoscopic surgery.", "publish_time": "2010", "authors": "Garc\u00eda Fl\u00f3rez, L J; Arg\u00fcelles, J; Quijada, B; Alvarez, V; Galarraga, M A; Gra\u00f1a, J L", "journal": "Techniques in coloproctology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-009-0561-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20135188/", "s2_id": "40507441"}
