Rationale Virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies demonstrate a significant decrease in both viral load and hospital transfer rate among patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection. Objective To assess the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms in LTCFs who received LY-CoV555 as compared to those who did not receive this treatment. Design Retrospective case-control study and logistic regression analysis. Setting LTCFs in New York. Participants Two-hundred forty-six (246) LTCF patients diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection with positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from November 15, 2020, to January 31, 2021. Methods Two-hundred forty-six (246) COVID-19 patients were identified from electronic medical records, out of which 160 cases were exposed to LY-CoV555 treatment (700 mg single dose, intravenous infusion). Eighty-six (86) patients were unexposed controls who did not receive monoclonal antibodies, LY-CoV555. Outcome We assessed the odds of death and hospitalization of exposed cases as compared to unexposed controls. Using logistic regression analysis, we also assessed the risk factors associated with these outcomes in the entire sample population. Results The mean age of the entire sample was 82.4 years. Fifty-two percent (52%) of patients (n = 129) were female and 48% (n = 117) were male. The mean ages of the exposed group and the unexposed group were 81 years and 84 years, respectively. At the end of the study, 92% (148/160) of the exposed group were alive or not transferred to the hospital as compared to 79% (68/86) patients of the unexposed group (OR 3.23, 95% CI: (1.48, 7.31), p-value = 0.0032). Three percent (3%; 5/160) of patients died in the exposed group compared to 10% (9/86) of patients who died in the unexposed group (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: (0.1, 0.85), p-value = 0.0257). Four point thirty-seven percent (4.37%; 7/160) of patients in the exposed group and 10.46% (9/86) of patients in the unexposed group were transferred to the hospital (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: (0.15, 1.08), p-value = 0.0793). Conclusion Early treatment with monoclonal antibody LY-CoV555 is associated with decreased mortality among high-risk patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection in LTCFs. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend towards a lower risk of hospitalization in patients treated with LY-CoV555.", "publish_time": "2021-05-10", "authors": "Alam, Mohammud M; Mahmud, Saborny; Aggarwal, Sandeep; Fathma, Sawsan; Al Mahi, Naim; Shibli, Mohammed S; Haque, Siddiqi M; Mahmud, Sharothy; Ahmed, Ziauddin", "journal": "Cureus", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/d3cac53e666847603c75a254d2f39e4a8bd99d42.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8109198.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33981518/", "s2_id": "234470345"}
