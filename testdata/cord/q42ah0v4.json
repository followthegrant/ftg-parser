However, the causations of Kawasaki disease, its variations, and COVID-19-associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome have been recently explained to involve high replication rate viral infections. In a subset of patients, the extensive antigen-antibody immune complexes that are not quickly cleared by phagocytosis will create a type III hypersensitivity immune reaction. The subsequent release of proteases and other enzymes and the expression or exposure of new immunogenic antigens due to protease attacks on basement membranes of epithelial cells or endothelial cells in blood vessels will induce new autoantibodies and cause Kawasaki disease, its variations, and COVID-19-related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. There is now increasing evidence that a viral infection of a large surface area of tissue, such as the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract or blood vessels, and a resultant type III hypersensitivity immune reaction is the most plausible explanation for the causations of Kawasaki disease, its variations, and COVID-19-related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. Furthermore, an improved understanding of these causations also suggests several potential new treatments which can be more effective.", "publish_time": "2021-03-25", "authors": "Roe, Kevin", "journal": "SN Compr Clin Med", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/009dfd3ce55e3312c27a702e32e2294dbf62e5f4.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7993892.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-021-00872-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786417/", "s2_id": "232360225"}
