CIITA is the founding member of the mammalian nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat (NLR) protein family but stood apart for a long time as the only transcriptional regulator. More recently, it was found that its closest homolog, NLRC5 (NLR protein caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-containing 5), is a regulator of MHC-I gene expression. Both act as non-DNA-binding activators through multiple protein\u2013protein interactions with an MHC enhanceosome complex that binds cooperatively to a highly conserved combinatorial cis-acting module. Thus, the regulation of MHC-II expression is regulated largely through the differential expression of CIITA. In addition to the well-defined role of CIITA in MHC-II GENE regulation, we will discuss several other aspects of CIITA functions, such as its role in cancer, its role as a viral restriction element contributing to intrinsic immunity, and lastly, its very recently discovered role as an inhibitor of Ebola and SARS-Cov-2 virus replication. We will briefly touch upon the recently discovered role of NLRP3 as a transcriptional regulator, which suggests that transcriptional regulation is, after all, not such an unusual feature for NLR proteins.", "publish_time": "2021-01-22", "authors": "Le\u00f3n Machado, Jorge Alfonso; Steimle, Viktor", "journal": "Int J Mol Sci", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/8d26612f24762d3a3a19de9096bdae2c9857fbf2.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7866136.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22031074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33499042/", "s2_id": "231770017"}
