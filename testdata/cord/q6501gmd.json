We studied HCoV-NL63 infection in hospitalized children diagnosed with respiratory tract infections. From November 2002 to April 2003, we evaluated 300 respiratory specimens for HCoV-NL63. Of the 300 samples, 28 (9.3%) were positive for HCoV-NL63. The highest prevalence was found in February (18%). The main symptoms were fever (61%), rhinitis (39%), bronchiolitis (39%), digestive problems (33%), otitis (28%), pharyngitis (22%), and conjunctivitis (17%). A fragment of the spike protein gene was sequenced to determine the variety of circulating HCoV-NL63. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that strains with different genetic markers cocirculate in France.", "publish_time": "2005-08-01", "authors": "Vabret, Astrid; Mourez, Thomas; Dina, Julia; van der Hoek, Lia; Gouarin, St\u00e9phanie; Petitjean, Jo\u00eblle; Brouard, Jacques; Freymuth, Fran\u00e7ois", "journal": "Emerg Infect Dis", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/ffb381668d93248759ca3855425e05722cb9f562.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3320486.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16102311/", "s2_id": "6993915"}
