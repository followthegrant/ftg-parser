Several studies have documented a high prevalence of lupus anticoagulant that may at least partially explain the procoagulant profile of COVID-19. However, the association between lupus anticoagulant and thrombotic complications in COVID-19 is controversial and no study has specifically evaluated the impact of lupus anticoagulant on mortality. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between lupus anticoagulant and mortality in a large group of 192 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Lupus anticoagulant was found in 95 patients (49.5%). No difference in the percentage of patients with lupus anticoagulant was observed between 130 survivors and 62 non-survivors (47.7 versus 53,2%; p = 0.4745). When the combined outcome of death or need for mechanical ventilation in survivors was taken into account, the difference in the prevalence of patients with lupus anticoagulant between the patients with the combined outcome (n = 76) and survivors who did not require mechanical ventilation (n = 116) was not significant (52.6% versus 47.4%; p = 0.4806). In multivariate analysis predictors of mortality or need for mechanical ventilation in survivors were obesity, low oxygen saturation and elevated troponin levels measured on admission. In conclusion, our study did not show any association of lupus anticoagulant with mortality and with need for mechanical ventilation in survivors. The role of obesity, low SaO2 and elevated troponin levels as predictors of a worse prognosis in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was confirmed.", "publish_time": "2020-11-07", "authors": "Gazzaruso, Carmine; Mariani, Giuseppe; Ravetto, Carolina; Malinverni, Laura; Tondelli, Elena; Cerrone, Maria; Sala, Vittorio; Bevilacqua, Luigi; Altavilla, Teodoro; Coppola, Adriana; Gallotti, Pietro", "journal": "J Thromb Thrombolysis", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/bfb37646cd0204e447a09288cf06a89debb16c73.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7648549.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-020-02335-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33159639/", "s2_id": "226264565"}
