The efficacy and safety of these drugs is unknown in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients affected by ABCB1 genetic variability. Patients carrying one or two copies of the ABCB1 C3435T were predictively considered as risk phenotypes. It was predicted that risk phenotypes due to carrying either one or two copies of ABCB1 C3435T were highly prevalent in Europe (76.8%; 95% CI: 75\u201378), followed by America (67%; 95% CI: 65\u201369), Asia (63.5%; 95% CI: 62\u201365) and Africa (41.4%; 95% CI: 37\u201346), respectively. It is hypothesized that a considerable proportion of COVID-19 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir inheriting ABCB1 C3435T genetic polymorphism may be predisposed to either therapeutic failure or toxicity.", "publish_time": "2021-03-24", "authors": "Biswas, Mohitosh", "journal": "Pharmacogenomics", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7989382.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759544/; https://doi.org/10.2217/pgs-2020-0096", "s2_id": "232336770"}
