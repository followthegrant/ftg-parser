And the nursing experience about this disease is rare reported. CASE PRESENTATION: This study reported a 50-year-old man with adenoid cystic carcinoma in left main bronchus by computed tomography (CT), fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and puncture biopsy. The case is the first report about operation method and the comprehensive nursing care, including conventional nursing, airway management, fluid management, nutritional support, and psychosocial support for patients undergoing primary bronchial malignancy resection and left pneumonectomy. After multidisciplinary treatment and comprehensive care, the patient was cured and discharged on the 17th day after surgery. CONCLUSION: This study reported a rare case with bronchial malignancy resection and left pneumonectomy and discussed its nursing care. A skilled management of ECMO, intraoperative position transformation, and prevention, as well as control of pulmonary complications are fundamental in caring patients with bronchial tumors. Monitoring of pulmonary function and blood pressure, adequate nutrition, and psychological support could be contributing factors for successful treatment during the postoperative stage.", "publish_time": "2020-10-06", "authors": "Yang, Hui; Chen, Ruiyun; Chen, Jingru; Yan, Fan; Zhang, Hongmei; Wei, Li; Jia, Xiangbo; Wang, Yuming", "journal": "J Cardiothorac Surg", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/e58ccbaff80d5639f74dee8385a9a9ff18eac9ea.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7538043.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33023608/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13019-020-01348-z", "s2_id": "222153930"}
