Prevalent cancer cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2019 were linked with the provincial COVID\u201019 surveillance system. We compared CS' cumulative incidence of being tested, testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), being hospitalized and dying of COVID\u201019 with that of the general population; we compared COVID\u201019 prognosis in CS and in patients without cancer. During the study period, 15 391 people (1527 CS) underwent real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, of whom 4541 (447 CS) tested positive; 541 (113 CS) died of COVID\u201019. CS had higher age\u2010 and sex\u2010adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) of testing (1.28 [95% confidence interval, CI = 1.21\u20101.35]), of positive test (IRR 1.06 [95% CI = 0.96\u20101.18]) and of hospitalization and death (IRR 1.27 [95% CI = 1.09\u20101.48] and 1.39 [95%CI = 1.12\u20101.71], respectively). CS had worse prognosis when diagnosed with COVID\u201019, particularly those below age 70 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of death 5.03; [95% CI = 2.59\u20109.75]), while the OR decreased after age 70. The OR of death was higher for CS with a recent diagnosis, that is, <2 years (OR = 2.92; 95% CI = 1.64\u20105.21), or metastases (OR = 2.09; 95% CI = 0.88\u20104.93). CS showed the same probability of being infected, despite a slightly higher probability of being tested than the general population. Nevertheless, CS were at higher risk of death once infected.", "publish_time": "2021-04-27", "authors": "Mangone, Lucia; Gioia, Francesco; Mancuso, Pamela; Bisceglia, Isabella; Ottone, Marta; Vicentini, Massimo; Pinto, Carmine; Giorgi Rossi, Paolo", "journal": "Int J Cancer", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/fe37622df94ae42d0c97b42ce98097e736e54761.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8250826.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861870/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.33601", "s2_id": "233278278"}
