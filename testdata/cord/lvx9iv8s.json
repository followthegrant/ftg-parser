Its effect on patients with pre-existing severe acute pancreatitis is not known. METHODS: We hereby, present 3 cases with severe acute pancreatitis with persistent respiratory failure who acquired nosocomial COVID-19 during their hospital stay after recovery from respiratory failure. Their clinical course is highlighted which might reflect on pathophysiology of organ dysfunction. RESULTS: None of the 3 patients with severe acute pancreatitis who developed nosocomial COVID-19 redeveloped respiratory failure suggestive of severe COVID-19 despite having recently recovered from pancreatitis induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Only one patient had SARS-CoV2 induced moderate pneumonia. CONCLUSION: These cases highlight that host responses and mechanisms of lung injury might be different in severe pancreatitis and COVID-19.", "publish_time": "2020-08-19", "authors": "Elhence, Anshuman; Mahapatra, Soumya Jagannath; Vajpai, Tanmay; Garg, Pramod Kumar", "journal": "Pancreatology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/c0e823f8947f0702e0fcd6cdeafdf10d09710308.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7437538.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32859545/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1424390320306578; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1424390320306578?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pan.2020.08.008", "s2_id": "221178212"}
