Over-automation seems to be the driver of the digitalization process. Substitution is the paradigm leading Artificial Intelligence and robotics development against human cognition. Digital technology should be designed to enhance human skills and make more productive use of human cognition and capacities. Digital technology is characterized also by scalability because of its easy and inexpensive deployment. Thus, automation can lead to the absence of jobs and scalable negative impact in human development and the performance of business. A look at digitalization from the lens of Sustainable Development Goals can tell us how digitalization impact in different sectors and areas considering society as a complex interconnected system.
