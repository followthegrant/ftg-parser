Virologic diagnosis was assessed using viral isolation, polymerase chain reaction and serology for all patients with a flu-like syndrome. Albumin, vitamins and trace elements were also measured. RESULTS The risk of influenza increased 6.5-fold in patients with an antibody titer of 40 during the influenza outbreak (P=0.04). Micronutrients and vitamins deficiencies were important. Patients with antibody titer >1:40 could still be infected by the virus without correlation with the nutritional status. CONCLUSION Humoral protection with a titer >1:40 might not be protective in the elderly. Nutritional deficiencies were too prevalent to detect any effect on the results.", "publish_time": "2006", "authors": "Paccalin, Marc; Plouzeau, Chlo\u00e9; Bouche, Gauthier; Guillard, Olivier; Beby-Defaux, Agn\u00e8s; Mauco, G\u00e9rard; Agius, G\u00e9rard", "journal": "Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17008234/", "s2_id": "24596638"}
