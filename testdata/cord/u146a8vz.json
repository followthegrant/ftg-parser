It is not clear whether this pediatric condition is related to thrombotic events. With this study we reviewed the literature for thrombotic complications in children with COVID-19 infection and MIS-C. DATA SOURCES: We searched the Medline PubMed Advanced Search Builder, Scopus, Web Of Science, and Google Scholar electronic databases (until 1 January 2021) using the medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and text words (their combinations and truncated synonyms): (THROMBOSIS OR THROMBOPHILIA) AND (CHILD OR CHILDREN OR INFANT) AND (COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2). STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were children with COVID-19 or SARS-COV-2 infection. The search was limited to articles published in English. Exclusion criteria were: reviews of published studies, studies published only as abstracts, letters or conference proceedings, discussion papers, animal studies, or editorials. RESULTS: After screening for duplicates, the initial search yielded 86 records: 12 were case reports involving 19 children; comorbidities were absent or mild in 73.7%. The most common site of thrombosis the lung (21%); the most often used drug was heparin (42%). Two studies were an international survey (n = 337 patients) and a large multicenter study (n = 186 patients with MIS-C). The risk of ischemic stroke in SARS-CoV-2 infection (0.82%) and deep venous thrombosis in MIS-C (4.3%) was lower in children than in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombodic or thromboembolic events are rare in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection and MIS-C. Nonetheless, as in adults, a high index of suspicion should be maintained in children with COVID-19 infection or MIS-C, particularly in those with comorbidities predisposing to thrombotic events.", "publish_time": "2021-07-16", "authors": "Zaffanello, Marco; Piacentini, Giorgio; Nosetti, Luana; Ganzarolli, Stefania; Franchini, Massimo", "journal": "Thromb Res", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/2509745d08933ac1737f3081f401211947ad3983.json", "document_parses/pdf_json/6587316c55dd9ae203adee7441cd46e46d2341cf.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8284063.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049384821004047?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2021.07.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384821004047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34293539/", "s2_id": "235964775"}
