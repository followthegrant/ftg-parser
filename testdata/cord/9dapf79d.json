This process has been facilitated by the development of bedside resuscitation surfaces. These new devices are unaffordable, however, in most of sub-Saharan Africa, where 42% of the world\u2019s 2.4 million annual newborn deaths occur. This paper describes the rationale and design of BabySaver, an innovative low-cost mobile resuscitation unit, which was developed iteratively over five years in a collaboration between the Sanyu Africa Research Institute (SAfRI) in Uganda and the University of Liverpool in the UK. The final BabySaver design comprises two compartments; a tray to provide a firm resuscitation surface, and a base to store resuscitation equipment. The design was formed while considering contextual factors, using the views of individual women from the community served by the local hospitals, medical staff, and skilled birth attendants in both Uganda and the UK.", "publish_time": "2021-06-21", "authors": "Ditai, James; Barry, Aisling; Burgoine, Kathy; Mbonye, Anthony K.; Wandabwa, Julius N.; Watt, Peter; Weeks, Andrew D.", "journal": "Children (Basel)", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/9c05397322460ad1a07771e196acbbd6564cbdb7.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8235222.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/children8060526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205496/", "s2_id": "235652773"}
