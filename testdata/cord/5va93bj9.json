For biomaterials in bone reconstruction, the promotion of osteogenic differentiation and reduction of inflammation are desirable. Fibrillar coatings are interesting because of fibrils' high surface area-volume ratio, aiding adsorption and adhesion. Fibrils also serve as a matrix for the immobilization of biomolecules with biological activity, such as the phenolic compound phloroglucinol (PG), the subunit of marine polyphenols. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of PG coatings on fibroblast- and osteoblast-like cells to increase the osseointegration of titanium implants. Collagen fibril coatings, containing PG at low and high concentrations, were produced on titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) scaffolds generated by additive manufacturing (AM). These coatings, especially PG-enriched coatings, reduced hydrophobicity and modulated the behavior of human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 and mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 cell lines. Both osteoblastic and fibroblastic cells spread and adhered well on PG-enriched coatings. Coatings significantly reduced the inflammatory response. Moreover, osteogenic differentiation was promoted by collagen coatings with a high PG concentration. Thus, the enrichment of collagen fibril coatings with PG is a promising strategy to improve Ti6Al4V implants for bone contact in orthopedics and dentistry and is worthy of further investigation.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Mieszkowska, Anna; Beaumont, Harrison; Martocq, Laurine; Koptyug, Andrey; Surmeneva, Maria A; Surmenev, Roman A; Naderi, Javad; Douglas, Timothy E L; Gurzawska-Comis, Katarzyna A", "journal": "", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#32899166", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "221571789"}
