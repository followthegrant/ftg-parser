Between June 2020 and June 2021, 55,824 outbreaks were reported, with 414,882 cases in all settings. About 12.5% were reported in an occupational setting and within this, most of them were identified in the industry and building sectors. The outbreaks that had a greater impact were those that took place both in agriculture and in the meat industry, where there is a higher risk of exposure due to living and working conditions. Outbreaks in the catering and home care sectors were also frequent. Since the beginning, there was coordination between all stakeholders involved in the management of the pandemic, in order to implement prevention and control measures, as well as social protection measures. In addition, special actions were implemented in the most vulnerable sectors. Despite the work carried out, the presence of outbreaks in these sectors continues, although they are smaller than the previous pandemic phase. Due to this, there is needed to continue strengthening the inter-sectoral coordination structures and mechanisms to ensure the implementation of those measures that contribute to the containment of the pandemic.", "publish_time": "2021-10-22", "authors": "Rivera Ariza, Silvia; Guzm\u00e1n Herrador, Bernardo; Garc\u00eda Gomez, Montserrat; Suarez Rodr\u00edguez, Berta; Molina Romera, Germ\u00e1n; Monge Corella, Susana; Sim\u00f3n Soria, Fernando; Sierra Moros, Maria Jos\u00e9", "journal": "Revista espanola de salud publica", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34675178/", "s2_id": "239457974"}
