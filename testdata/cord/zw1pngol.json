Wrist grip level decreases over time in both professions;due to the damage to the anatomical structures of the wrist, for reasons such as positioning the patient, exercising, etc. Our aim in this study is to ensure that the aforementioned similar sub divisional health workers;to reveal the occupational difference rates between hand grip strength and forearm flexion extension strength losses. In our study, only male participants were included in the study in order to eliminate gender-related muscle strength differences. 20 male neurology physiotherapists and 20 male intensive care workers were determined as the research sample. Wrist circumference and Body Mass Index (BMI) of the groups were calculated for the anthropometric measurement evaluations in both groups included in the study. The wrist grip strength of both hands of the participants was evaluated with jamar dynamometer and flexion and extension strengths with an Electronic Push/Pull Dynamometer (EPPD). The data obtained were evaluated with SPSS22. In the analysis of the data, \"Independent samples t\" test was applied for parameters such as age, height, weight, and dominant hand preference, duration of work, flexion, extension and left jamar average values. \"Mann Whitney U\" test, one of the non-parametric tests, was applied for variables that do not show normal distribution. In the light of the data obtained as a result, there are statistically significant differences between the two groups for height, time spent in the profession/month and left hand extension values and right hand jamar average values in both occupational groups (P&lt;0,05).", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Orha, A.
