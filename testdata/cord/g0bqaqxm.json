White matter injury after TBI is characterized by axon damage and demyelination, resulting in neural network impairment and neurological deficit. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can promote white matter repair. The activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) has been reported to promote microglia/macrophages towards anti-inflammatory state and therefore to promote axon regeneration. Bexarotene, an agonist of retinoid X receptor (RXR), can activate RXR/PPAR\u03b3 heterodimers. The aim of the present study was to identify the effect of bexarotene on BDNF in microglia/macrophages and axon sprouting after TBI in mice. Bexarotene was administered intraperitoneally in C57BL/6 mice undergoing controlled cortical impact (CCI). PPAR\u03b3 dependency was determined by intraperitoneal administration of a PPAR\u03b3 antagonist T0070907. We found that bexarotene promoted axon regeneration indicated by increased growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) expression, myelin basic protein (MBP) expression, and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)+ axon sprouting. Bexarotene also increased microglia/macrophages-specific brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression after TBI. In addition, bexarotene reduced the number of pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages while increased the number of anti-inflammatory microglia/macrophages after TBI. Moreover, bexaortene inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. In addition, bexarotene treatment improved neurological scores and cognitive function of CCI-injured mice. These effects of bexarotene were partially abolished by T0070907. In conclusion, bexarotene promotes axon sprouting, increases microglia/macrophages-specific BDNF expression, and induces microglia/macrophages from a pro-inflammatory state towards an anti-inflammatory one after TBI at least partially in a PPAR\u03b3-dependent manner.", "publish_time": "2020-09-08", "authors": "He, Junchi; Huang, Yike; Liu, Han; Sun, Xiaochuan; Wu, Jingchuan; Zhang, Zhaosi; Liu, Liu; Zhou, Chao; Jiang, Shaoqiu; Huang, Zhijian; Zhong, Jianjun; Guo, Zongduo; Jiang, Li; Cheng, Chongjie", "journal": "Experimental neurology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2020.113462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916173/", "s2_id": "221567646"}
