The cytokine storm also occurs in the recently emerged novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Therefore, cytokines which usually help the immune system to fight infections are potentially harmful in the course of COVID-19 infections. Therefore, avoiding or mitigating the cytokine storm may be a key treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Rokni, Mohsen; Hamblin, Michael R; Rezaei, Nima", "journal": "Hum Vaccin Immunother", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#730558", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "221328972"}
