Despite the similarities between adult and childhood asthma, the pediatric population presents some specific characteristics, notably in relation to exacerbations. Asthma in the newborn infant is a specific entity, the definition of which has recently been officially recognized. In exacerbations, the most important trigger factors are respiratory virus infections, the strain having prognostic importance. The indoor and outdoor environments are risk factors, particularly high levels of atmospheric pollution. Nutrients seem to play a prognostic role through vitamin D or food allergy. Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide and examination of induced sputum may help in diagnosis and adjustment of treatment but these tools are not yet effective as predictive factors in asthma exacerbations. Prevention, early management and continued education of children and their families remain the best methods to improve asthma control.", "publish_time": "2011-11-12", "authors": "Carsin, A.; Pham-Thi, N.", "journal": "Rev Mal Respir", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/259bacd86c3efe63c149f66aa069b50c97b50691.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135330.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842511003986; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842511003986", "s2_id": "196373965"}
