An area of research interest is coronavirus transcription regulation that uses an RNA-RNA mediated template-switching mechanism. It is not known how different transcriptional stoichiometries of each viral gene are generated. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing data from whole RNA transcriptomes identified TRS dependent and independent transcripts. Integration of transcripts and 5\u2019-UTR sequence motifs identified that the pentaloop and the stem-loop 3 were also located upstream of spliced genes. TRS independent transcripts were detected as likely non-polyadenylated. Additionally, a novel conserved sequence motif was discovered at either end of the TRS independent splice junctions. While similar both SARS viruses generated similar TRS independent transcripts they were more abundant in SARS-CoV-2. TRS independent gene regulation requires investigation to determine its relationship to viral pathogenicity.", "publish_time": "2020-06-24", "authors": "Cox, Brian J.", "journal": "bioRxiv", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/26a10ba5e6f4a2569cff458fd4c42e0b26e48059.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.169144", "s2_id": "220253352"}
