METHOD: Cross-sectional study with a quantitative and analytical approach, a total of 459 indigenous people (57.1% men, aged 36.3 \u00b1 14.7 years old) belonging to the Munduruku ethnic group from the Kwat\u00e1-Laranjal Indigenous Land, in Amazonas, Brazil, were selected by probabilistic sampling in all households in the four most populous villages. Sociodemographic and anthropometric variables, blood pressure levels and lipid profile were evaluated. Fasting capillary blood glucose was measured with a digital device. The associations were assessed by multinomial logistic regression, and p-values\u22640.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: For pre-diabetes, prevalence was 74.3% and, for diabetes, 12.2%. The variables associated with the risk for pre-diabetes were the following: age (OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.00 \u2013 1.06) and obesity (OR = 9.69; 95% CI = 1.28 \u2013 73.58). The positive associations indicating risk for diabetes were as follows: age (OR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.03 \u2013 1.08), overweight (OR = 4.17; 95% CI = 1.69 \u2013 10.32) and obesity (OR = 35.26; 95% CI = 4.12 \u2013 302.08). CONCLUSIONS: The risks associated with pre-diabetes and diabetes among the Munduruku indigenous people revealed a worrying index. It is necessary to consider changes in eating habits and lifestyle, as well as possible environmental and social changes that can affect this and other groups, with emphasis on those who live in vulnerable conditions.", "publish_time": "2021-09-03", "authors": "Gomes, Hanna Lorena Moraes; Sombra, Neuliane Melo; Cordeiro, Eliza Dayanne de Oliveira; Filho, Zilmar Augusto de Souza; Toledo, Noeli das Neves; Mainbourg, Evelyne Marie Therese; Sousa, Ant\u00f3nio Manuel; de Almeida, Gilsirene Scantelbury", "journal": "PLoS One", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/40d9792d99f4457a70fe2d5e4d31b7d9ba410b2e.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8415589.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415589/", "s2_id": ""}
