A case-based review was performed to present real-life experiences in terms of main findings and treatment options. We described two cases with the diagnosis of MIS and searched the literature to review all reported &#8805; 18-year-old cases. The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. All relevant articles from January 2020 to February 2021 were reviewed. An adolescent and an adult patient (18 and 40 years-old, respectively) with the diagnosis of MIS were presented. Both had the consistent clinical findings with the case definition criteria. Although steroid, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and supportive care treatments have been suggested in the literature, there exists no treatment guideline for MIS-A. The clinical and laboratory findings of the patients progressively improved with the implementation of the IVIG and the pulse steroid treatments. A total of 51 cases (&#8805; 18 years-old) with MIS were analyzed. Mean age was 29.4 \u00b1 10 years. Fever (80.4%), gastrointestinal (72.5%), and respiratory symptoms (54.9%) were the predominant symptoms. Cardiovascular abnormalities were the most frequent reported findings (82.4%, 42/51). The dermatological and conjunctival findings were reported in 39.2% and 35.3% of the patients, respectively. The increased level of inflammatory biomarkers was remarkable. Most of the patients were treated successfully with steroid and IVIG. Clinicians managing adult patients should keep in mind the development risk of MIS related with SARS-CoV-2 infection to perform necessary interventions properly without delay. IVIG and pulse steroid treatments are the effective options on clinical improvement.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Bastug, Aliye; Aslaner, Halide; Aybar Bilir, Yesim; Kemirtlek, Nizamettin; Gursoy, Fahriye Melis; Bastug, Serdal; Bodur, Hurrem", "journal": "Rheumatol Int", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1141406", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "232285324"}
