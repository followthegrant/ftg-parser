Therefore, we present a novel fully automatic modified Attention U-Net (CXAU-Net) multi-class segmentation deep model that can detect common findings of COVID-19 in CXR images. The architectural design of this model includes three novelties: first, an Attention U-net model with channel and spatial attention blocks is designed that precisely localize multiple pathologies; second, dilated convolution applied improves the sensitivity of the model to foreground pixels with additional receptive fields valuation, and third a newly proposed hybrid loss function combines both area and size information for optimizing model. The proposed model achieves average accuracy, DSC, and Jaccard index scores of 0.951, 0.993, 0.984, and 0.921, 0.985, 0.973 for image-based and patch-based approaches respectively for multi-class segmentation on Chest X-ray 14 dataset. Also, average DSC and Jaccard index scores of 0.998, 0.989 are achieved for binary-class segmentation on the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) CXR dataset. These results illustrate that the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art segmentation methods.", "publish_time": "2021-08-08", "authors": "Arora, Ruchika; Saini, Indu; Sood, Neetu", "journal": "Optik (Stuttg)", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/91038ee99b1b9034fbf9dfe8921dec5da22438c0.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8349421.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393275/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2021.167780; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003040262101370X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003040262101370X", "s2_id": "236952970"}
