For this, a dummy was used that emits simulated human breath containing aerosols (mean diameter of 0.3 \u00b5m) and CO2, with a horizontal exhalation velocity of v = 2.4 m/s, measured 10 cm in front of the mouth. Aerosol and CO2 concentration profiles were mapped using sensors placed around the dummy. No substantial enrichment of aerosols and CO2 was found at adjacent seats, provided that (1) there were floor displacement outlets under each seat enabling a minimum local fresh air vertical flow of vv = 0.05 m/s, (2) the air exchange rate (ACH) was more than 3, and (3) the dummy wore a surgical face mask. Knowledge of dispersion of viral droplets by airborne routes in real environments will help in risk assessment when re-opening concert halls and theatres after a pandemic lockdown.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Schade, Wolfgang; Reimer, Vladislav; Seipenbusch, Martin; Willer, Ulrike; H\u00fcbner, Eike G", "journal": "Int J Infect Dis", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1220863", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "233258400"}
