The present research investigated the impact of the individual differences in propensity to experience shame (or shame-proneness) on two emotion regulation strategies\u2014perspective taking and positive reappraisal. A total of 228 participants, undergraduate students, were allocated randomly to one of the eight experimental conditions. The results revealed that for high shame-prone participants, the use of perspective taking, without positive reappraisal, led to a heightened experience of shame. In contrast, the combination of perspective taking and positive reappraisal led to reductions in shame among high shame-prone participants. The findings highlight the relationship between individual differences, and the separate and combined effects of affect regulation strategies on the experience of shame.", "publish_time": "2020-09-01", "authors": "Krishnamoorthy, Govind; Davis, Penelope; O\u2019Donovan, Analise; McDermott, Brett; Mullens, Amy", "journal": "Int J Cogn Ther", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/86a8cca0a84c461e377a41e4562462ed10644bbd.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7462113.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s41811-020-00085-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904830/", "s2_id": "221458488"}
