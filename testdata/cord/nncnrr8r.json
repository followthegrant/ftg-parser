They are metabolized to the active ribonucleoside triphosphate form and concentrate in the genomes of RNA viruses during viral replication. \u00df-D-N 4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, the initial metabolite of molnupiravir) is more than 100-fold more active than ribavirin or favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2, with antiviral activity correlated to the level of mutagenesis in virion RNA. However, NHC also displays host mutational activity in an animal cell culture assay, consistent with RNA and DNA precursors sharing a common intermediate of a ribonucleoside diphosphate. These results indicate that highly active mutagenic ribonucleosides may hold risk for the host.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Zhou, Shuntai; Hill, Collin S; Sarkar, Sanjay; Tse, Longping V; Woodburn, Blaide M D; Schinazi, Raymond F; Sheahan, Timothy P; Baric, Ralph S; Heise, Mark T; Swanstrom, Ronald", "journal": "J. infect. dis", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1220266", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "233998489"}
