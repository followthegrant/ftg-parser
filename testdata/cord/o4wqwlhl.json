Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the reference sample type, but oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) may be a more acceptable sample type in some patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in a single screening center to assess the diagnostic performance of the Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) on OPS compared with reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using NPS during the second pandemic wave in Switzerland. RESULTS: 402 outpatients were enrolled in a COVID-19 screening center, of whom 168 (41.8%) had a positive RT-qPCR test. The oropharyngeal Ag-RDT clinical sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal RT-qPCR was 81% (95%CI: 74.2-86.6). Two false positives were noted out of the 234 RT-qPCR negative individuals, which resulted in a clinical specificity of 99.1% (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) for the Ag-RDT. For cycle threshold values &#8804; 26.7 (&#8805; 1E6 SARS-CoV-2 genomes copies/mL, a presumed cut-off for infectious virus), 96.3% sensitivity (95%CI: 90.7-99.0%) was obtained with the Ag-RDT using OPS. INTERPRETATION: Based on our findings, the diagnostic performance of the Panbio&#8482; Covid-19 RDT with OPS samples, if taken by a trained person and high requirements regarding quality of the specimen, meet the criteria required by the WHO for Ag-RDTs (sensitivity &#8805;80% and specificity &#8805;97%) in a high incidence setting in symptomatic individuals.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Ngo Nsoga, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se; Kronig, Ilona; Perez Rodriguez, Francisco Javier; Sattonnet-Roche, Pascale; Da Silva, Diogo; Helbling, Javan; Sacks, Jilian A; de Vos, Margaretha; Boehm, Erik; Gayet-Ageron, Ang\u00e8le; Berger, Alice; Jacquerioz-Bausch, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique; Chappuis, Fran\u00e7ois; Kaiser, Laurent; Schibler, Manuel; Renzoni, Adriana; Eckerle, Isabella", "journal": "PLoS One", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#covidwho-1282300", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "235634679"}
