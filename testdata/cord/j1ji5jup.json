This protein was further characterized with regard to its glycosylation. The glycosylated subunits of the protein are polypeptides having a molecular mass of 42.5 kDa. Both subunits appear to be processed to the same extent by the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides. Each subunit on the mature virion has 6-7 high mannose and 3-4 complex type carbohydrate chains attached to it.", "publish_time": "1987", "authors": "Hogue, B G; Brian, D A", "journal": "Advances in experimental medicine and biology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3124516/", "s2_id": "42405669"}
