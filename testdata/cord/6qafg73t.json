This study determined whether OSA defined using a hypopnea definition characterized by a >3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal (AHI3%A) is associated with CVD/CHD. Methods: Data were analyzed from 6307 Sleep Heart Health Study participants who had polysomnography. Self-reported CVD included angina, heart attack, heart failure, stroke or previous coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty. Self-reported CHD included the aforementioned conditions but not stroke or heart failure. The association between OSA and CVD/CHD was examined using logistic regression models with stepwise inclusion of demographic, anthropometric, social/behavioral and co-morbid medical conditions. A parsimonious model in which diabetes and hypertension were excluded because of their potential to be on the causal pathway between OSA and CVD/CHD also was constructed. Results: For CVD, the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for AHI3%A >30/hour were 1.39 (1.03-1.87) and 1.45 (1.09-1.94) in the fully adjusted and parsimonious models. Results for CHD were 1.29 (0.96-1.74) and 1.36 (0.99-1.85). In participants without OSA according to more stringent AHI4% criteria but with OSA using the AHI3%A definition, similar findings were observed. Conclusion: OSA defined using an AHI3%A is associated with both CVD and CHD. Use of a more restrictive AHI4% definition will misidentify a large number of individuals with OSA who have CVD or CHD. These individuals may be denied access to therapy, potentially worsening their underlying CVD or CHD.", "publish_time": "2020-09-23", "authors": "Quan, S.
