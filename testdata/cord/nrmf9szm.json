The focus of this communication is on a potential biomarker, short telomere length (TL), that might serve to identify patients more likely to die from the SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of age. The common thread linking these patients is lymphopenia, which largely reflects a decline in the numbers of CD4/CD8 T cells but not B cells. These findings are consistent with data that lymphocyte TL dynamics impose a limit on T-cell proliferation. They suggest that T-cell lymphopoiesis might stall in individuals with short TL who are infected with SARS-CoV-2.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Aviv, Abraham", "journal": "FASEB J", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#306321", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "218691375"}
