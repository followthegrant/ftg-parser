RECENT FINDINGS: Studies show immune dysregulation in MIS-C including T lymphocyte depletion and activation, T cell receptor Vbeta skewing, elevated plasmablast frequencies, increased markers of vascular pathology, and decreased numbers and functional profiles of antigen-presenting cells. SUMMARY: MIS-C is a late manifestation of infection with SARS-CoV-2 associated with marked immune activation and many potential mechanisms of immunopathogenesis. MIS-C and KD have clinical similarities but are distinct. Myocardial dysfunction with or without mild coronary artery dilation can occur in MIS-C but generally corrects within weeks. In contrast, the coronary arteries are the primary target in KD, and coronary artery sequelae can be lifelong. Supportive care and anti-inflammatory therapy appear to hasten improvement in children with MIS-C, and there is hope that vaccines will prevent its development.", "publish_time": "2021-10-19", "authors": "Vella, Laura A.; Rowley, Anne H.", "journal": "Curr Pediatr Rep", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/abec38e011841939bccb23850bda2a7f6d7bc954.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8524214.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s40124-021-00257-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34692237/", "s2_id": "239022172"}
