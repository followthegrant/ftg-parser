Typically, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) mediates this platelet clumping. PTCP has little clinical significance, but misdiagnosis may lead to unnecessary diagnostic tests and treatment. In this case report, we present a 65-year-old Caucasian female suffering from multiple complications during and after cardiac surgery. During her postoperative stay at the ICU, she was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia and an inadequate response to platelet supplementation.", "publish_time": "2021-03-05", "authors": "Ceran, Enise; Schl\u00f6mmer, Christine; Kr\u00f6ckel, Ivonne; Scheriau, Georg; Angleitner, Philipp; Steinlechner, Barbara", "journal": "Case Rep Med", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/a297d5a5681ab399f0caf90c30f4febbbc59bc4d.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7954639.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/3695407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33747091/", "s2_id": "232292982"}
