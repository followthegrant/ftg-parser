METHODS: A cohort of 55 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was prospectively recruited \u2013 blood sampling was performed at baseline, post-treatment and hospital discharge. Serum IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and other laboratory investigations were compared between treatment groups and across timepoints. Acute serum IL-6 and CRP levels were then compared to those with suspected COVID-19 (SCOVID) and age and sex matched patients with SAB and patients hospitalized for any non-infectious condition (NIC). RESULTS: IL-6 was elevated at admission in the SARS-CoV-2 cohort but at lower levels compared to matched SAB patients. Median (IQR) IL-6 at admission was 73.89 pg/mL (30.9, 126.39) in SARS-CoV-2 compared to 92.76 pg/mL (21.75, 246.55) in SAB (p=0.017); 12.50 pg/mL (3.06, 35.77) in patients with NIC; and 95.51 pg/mL (52.17, 756.67) in SCOVID. Median IL-6 and CRP levels decreased between admission and discharge timepoints. This reduction was amplified in patients treated with remdesivir and/or dexamethasone. CRP and bedside vital signs were the strongest predictors of COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the kinetics of IL-6 did not offer enhanced predictive value for disease severity in COVID-19 over common investigations such as CRP and vital signs.", "publish_time": "2021-03-17", "authors": "Copaescu, Ana; James, Fiona; Mouhtouris, Effie; Vogrin, Sara; Smibert, Olivia C.; Gordon, Claire L.; Drewett, George; Holmes, Natasha E.; Trubiano, Jason A.", "journal": "Front Immunol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/0a5a39d9541ab6ea99573b096b95fb7180e318cf.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8009986.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33815405/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.646095", "s2_id": "232246164"}
