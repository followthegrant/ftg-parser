The limit case of no acquired immunity (neither natural nor via vaccination) is considered mimicking the situation (i) when no effective vaccine being developed or available yet, and (ii) the virus strongly mutates causing massive re-infections. Therefore, the only means of suppressing the virus spread are via quarantine measures and effective identification and isolation of infected individuals. We found both the disease-free and the endemic fixed points and examined their stability. The basic reproduction ratio is obtained and its dependence on the parameters of the model is dis-cussed. We found the presence of the contact rate threshold beyond which the disease-free fixed point cannot be reached. Using the numeric solution, the approximate analytic solution of the model, characterized by rescaled contact rate, is obtained. Several possible \u201cquarantine on\u201d/\u201cquarantine off\u201d scenarios are considered and the one combined with flex-ible adjustment of the identification and isolation rates is found to be the most effective in bringing the second and consequent waves down. The study can be interpreted as a reference point for the case when the natural or acquired immunity, as well as vaccination, are taken into account. It will be a topic of a separate study. \u00a9 2021, Lviv Polytechnic National University. All rights reserved.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Ilnytskyi, J.
