Yearly publications, main subject categories, journals, the performance of countries, and research hot topics were identified. The network of keywords and collaborations of countries was visualized and cross relationships were determined. Results showed that the annual output in the field increased during the related period. The USA, China, and Germany are the leading countries while the USA, Germany, and the UK are the most collaborative countries in bioaerosol research. \u201cJournal of Aerosol Science\u201d is the most productive journal and \u201cEnvironmental Sciences & Ecology\u201d is the most popular research area. The research hot spots are health effects, sampling, particulate matter, and indoor air quality in the bioaerosol topic. The findings of this research could provide information to understand the development and trends as well as future needs of bioaerosol research.", "publish_time": "2021-10-03", "authors": "Can-G\u00fcven, E.", "journal": "Int J Environ Sci Technol (Tehran)", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/ce236dff838ecbd96eeca1e9b0c7399df745b6d7.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8487676.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630577/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13762-021-03683-7", "s2_id": "238255156"}
