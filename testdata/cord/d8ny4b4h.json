It has been introduced as a famine-resilience crop and has become a cultural diet. However, little is known about its culinary and nutritional properties. This study aimed to explore the cooking and nutritional properties of Zamn\u00e8 (Senegalia macrostachya (Reichenb. ex DC.) Kyal. & Boatwr.). Zamn\u00e8 presented characteristics of medium size, flattened, dry, and hard-to-cook legume. The moisture, cylindrical ratio, diameter, thickness, weight, true density, coat percentage, coat thickness, and cooking time of the seeds were in the range of 4.5-5.8 %, 1.1, 7.4-8.0 mm, 1.6-1.8 mm, 65.0-76.4 mg, 1.1 g/ml, 16.8-22.2 %, 9.0-11.9, and 180 minutes, respectively. The raw Zamn\u00e8 showed 39.8-43.6, 9.7-11.5, 16.6-29.4, 13.3-20.2, 16.6-26.4, and 3.7-3.9 (g/100 g dry weight) of protein, fat, total dietary fiber, insoluble dietary fiber, digestible carbohydrate, and ash contents, respectively. The traditional cooking process improved most of the parameters determining the proximate compositions but resulted in 51-52 % of protein losseand 47-50 % carbohydrate losses into the cooking wastewater. Besides, pseudoZamn\u00e8, a famine-emergency crop similar to Zamn\u00e8, revealed inferior cooking quality than Zamn\u00e8. The data reported here provide a basis for alternative cooking techniques and further investigations of Zamn\u00e8 and pseudoZamn\u00e8 seeds\u2019 nutritional quality.", "publish_time": "2020-10-21", "authors": "Soungalo Drabo, Moustapha; Shumoy, Habtu; Ciss\u00e9, Hama; Parkouda, Charles; Niki\u00e9ma, Fulbert; Ismail, Odetokun; Traor\u00e9, Yves; Savadogo, Aly; Raes, Katleen", "journal": "Food Res Int", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/2f310c39093b8d44a87e753441ffac6ad7741d4f.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109810; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0963996920308358; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996920308358?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33288185/", "s2_id": "224805980"}
