Any deviation of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity will reduce the predictive values of the test. Here, we report the occurrence of contaminations of commercial primers/probe sets with the SARS-CoV-2 target sequence of the RT-qPCR as an example for pitfalls during PCR diagnostics affecting diagnostic specificity. In several purchased in-house primers/probe sets, quantification cycle values as low as 17 were measured for negative control samples. However, there were also primers/probe sets that displayed very low-level contaminations, which were detected only during thorough internal validation. Hence, it appears imperative to pre-test each batch of reagents extensively before use in routine diagnosis, to avoid false-positive results and low positive predictive value in low-prevalence situations. As such, contaminations may have happened more widely, and COVID-19 diagnostic results should be re-assessed retrospectively to validate the epidemiological basis for control measures.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Wernike, Kerstin; Keller, Markus; Conraths, Franz J; Mettenleiter, Thomas C; Groschup, Martin H; Beer, Martin", "journal": "Transbound. emerg. dis.
