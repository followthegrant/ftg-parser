METHODS: Thirty-two days of data (the growth rate/mortality of COVID-19 cases) that were shared by Chinese National Health Commission and Chinese Weather Net were collected by two authors independently. Student\u2019s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the difference in the mortality of confirmed/severe cases before and after the use of \u201cFangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan\u201d makeshift hospitals (MSHs). We also studied whether the above outcomes of COVID-19 cases were related to air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), or air quality index (AQI) by performing Pearson\u2019s analysis or Spearman\u2019s analysis. RESULTS: Eight days after the use of MSHs, the mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (t = 4.5, P < 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P < 0.001), (t and U are the test statistic used to test the significance of the difference). In contrast, the mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged in non-Hubei regions (U = 76, P = 0.106). While on day 12 and day 16 after the use of MSHs, the reduce in mortality was still significant both in Wuhan and Hubei; but in non-Hubei regions, the reduce also became significant this time (U = 123, P = 0.036; U = 171, P = 0.015, respectively). Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be negatively correlated with AT both in Wuhan (r = \u2212 0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = \u2212 0.440, P = 0.012). Also, both the growth rate and the mortality of COVID-19 cases were found to be significantly correlated with AQI in Wuhan and Hubei. However, no significant correlation between RH and the growth rate/mortality of COVID-19 cases was found in our study. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that both the use of MSHs, the rise of AT, and the improvement of air quality were beneficial to the survival of COVID-19 patients.", "publish_time": "2020-07-21", "authors": "Cai, Yuwen; Huang, Tianlun; Liu, Xin; Xu, Gaosi", "journal": "PeerJ", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/f9e086114da65a6cf8fe565b6fa1c8fba42485d8.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7380280.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742816/", "s2_id": "220884049"}
