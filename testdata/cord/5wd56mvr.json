Neurologists must weigh up the need to start or continue disease-modifying treatments against the risk of infection, the risk of complications from the infection, and the risk of multiple sclerosis activity. Since this is an unprecedented situation, most decisions are being made on the basis of a theoretical approach and the criteria of each neurologist. AIMS: The aim of this study is conduct a literature search to collect available evidence on the relationship between disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This evidence, together with the experience of the authors in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic, will make it possible to offer some proposals for the treatment and follow-up of patients in this epidemiological context. DEVELOPMENT: After the literature search and our experience in the management of patients, a number of proposals for treatment are established for each drug, which must necessarily be individualised for each patient, since, in these exceptional circumstances, their peculiarities can affect the prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The neurologist should be aware of current evidence to assess the risk-benefit of starting, maintaining and stopping disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis during the pandemic.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Costa-Frossard, L; Moreno-Torres, I; Meca-Lallana, V; Garc\u00eda-Dom\u00ednguez, J M; En Representaci\u00f3n Del Grupo de Estudio de Enfermedades Desmielinizantes de la Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, En Representaci\u00f3n Del Grupo de Estudio de Enfermedades Desmielinizantes de la Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid", "journal": "Rev Neurol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#116778", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "219785289"}
