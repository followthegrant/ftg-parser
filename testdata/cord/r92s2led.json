To date, such interventions have neither been uniformly nor systematically implemented in most countries. For example, even when under strict stay-at-home orders, numerous jurisdictions granted exceptions and/or were in close proximity to locations with entirely different regulations in place. Here, we investigate the impact of such geographic inconsistencies in epidemic control policies by coupling search and mobility data to a simple mathematical model of SARS-COV2 transmission. Our results show that while stay-at-home orders decrease contacts in most areas of the United States of America (US), some specific activities and venues often see an increase in attendance. Indeed, over the month of March 2020, between 10 and 30% of churches in the US saw increases in attendance; even as the total number of visits to churches declined nationally. This heterogeneity, where certain venues see substantial increases in attendance while others close, suggests that closure can cause individuals to find an open venue, even if that requires longer-distance travel. And, indeed, the average distance travelled to churches in the US rose by 13% over the same period. Strikingly, our mathematical model reveals that, across a broad range of model parameters, partial measures can often be worse than no measures at all. In the most severe cases, individuals not complying with policies by traveling to neighboring jurisdictions can create epidemics when the outbreak would otherwise have been controlled. Taken together, our data analysis and modelling results highlight the potential unintended consequences of inconsistent epidemic control policies and stress the importance of balancing the societal needs of a population with the risk of an outbreak growing into a large epidemic.", "publish_time": "2020-08-24", "authors": "Althouse, Benjamin M.; Wallace, Brendan; Case, Brendan; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Berdahl, Andrew M.; White, Easton R.; H\u00e9bert-Dufresne, Laurent", "journal": "medRxiv", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/77bc878b52bda01566a5b5fa926bc1a1acde532c.json", "document_parses/pdf_json/83d510f711964575eabec22154a8037655293bba.json", "document_parses/pdf_json/7cea5a8a4730586ed0c06811d5f86fe6a4c9787e.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7457624.xml.json"], "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.21.20179473v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869043/", "s2_id": "221257239"}
