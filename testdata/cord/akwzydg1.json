Bleeding often occurs when the platelet count is <20 000/uL. The disease can progress because of accompanying COVID-19 disease. CASE REPORT: A 9-month-old boy, weighing 8.5 kg, came to the hospital with petechiae on the forehead, cheeks, mouth, and extremities. The patient had rhinorrhea for 3 days previously and was febrile, pale, weak, and could not drink. He had the measles-rubella vaccination 19 days prior. Physical examination showed no abnormalities of the eyes, ears, nose, throat, and mouth. Heart and lungs were within normal limits, with no organomegaly, lymph-adenopathy, or congenital anomaly of the abdomen. Laboratory examination showed hemoglobin, 12.7 g/dL; leukocytes, 7420/uL; platelet count, 16 000/uL; and hematocrit, 37.9%. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 14 mm at 1 h and 21 mm at 2 h. Peripheral blood smear showed normal RBC morphology, normal leukocytes, and few platelets. IgG was reactive and IgM was nonreactive on rapid antibody test. RT-PCR was positive for SARS-COV-2. Chest-X-ray showed pneumonia. The diagnosis was newly diagnosed ITP with COVID-19. Patient was treated with 30 mg/kg body weight/day of IV methylprednisolone for 3 days (250 mg); then 20 mg/kg body weight/day (175 mg) orally for 4 days in 3 divided doses. Azithromycin 100 mg/day, zinc 20 mg/day, and vitamin C 50 mg/day orally were also given. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 screening is highly recommended during this pandemic to identify it as a potential cause of childhood ITP. Megadose methylprednisolone had an excellent response in alleviating ITP with confirmed COVID-19 in an infant.", "publish_time": "2021-09-02", "authors": "Ringoringo, Harapan Parlindungan; Hartoyo, Edi", "journal": "Am J Case Rep", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/03cd9bea2dd13ee4a0acdf95d03ca202f20b9505.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8422568.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471086/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.931517", "s2_id": "237387577"}
