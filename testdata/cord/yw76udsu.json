Herein, we developed a new type of chemiluminescent functionalized magnetic nanomaterial for sensitive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen. First, HAuCl(4) was reduced by N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABEI) in the presence of amino magnetic beads (MB-NH(2)) to generate ABEI-AuNPs, which were directly assembled on the surface of MB-NH(2). Then, Co(2+) was modified onto the surface to form MB@ABEI-Au/Co(2+) (MAA/Co(2+)). MAA/Co(2+) exhibited good chemiluminescence (CL) and magnetic properties. It was also found that it was easy for the antibody to be connected with MAA/Co(2+). Accordingly, MAA/Co(2+) was used as a sensing interface to construct a label-free immunoassay for rapid detection of the N protein in SARS-CoV-2. The immunoassay showed a linear range from 0.1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL and a low detection limit of 69 fg/mL, which was superior to previously reported methods for N protein detection. It also demonstrated good selectivity by virtue of magnetic separation, which effectively removed a sample matrix after immunoreactions. It was successfully applied for the detection of the N protein in spiked human serum and saliva samples. Furthermore, the immunoassay was integrated with an automatic CL analyzer with magnetic separation to detect the N protein in patient serums and rehabilitation patient serums with satisfactory results. Thus, the CL immunoassay without a complicated labeling procedure is sensitive, selective, fast, simple, and cost-effective, which may be used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the CL quenching mechanism of the N protein in the immunoassay was also explored.", "publish_time": "2021-10-12", "authors": "Wang, Shanshan; Shu, Jiangnan; Lyu, Aihua; Huang, Xiaoxue; Zeng, Weihong; Jin, Tengchuan; Cui, Hua", "journal": "Anal Chem", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/cd43fe64c9b472acf8b02137361d1e3379240e2b.json", "document_parses/pdf_json/5c81bb7761a6b61214f70623ffd6cfff5f2a7a29.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8524964.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c03208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636246/", "s2_id": "238636741"}
