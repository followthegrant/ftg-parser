We performed a retrospective chart review of patients receiving care in April 2019 and April 2020 from four large, academic institutions across two states. The subjects were included if they were aged 0-18 years and were seen in a pediatric clinic in April 2019 or April 2020. We extracted the number of visits, visit type, and visit diagnosis; and the patient characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, and insurance status. Logistic regression analysis identified characteristics associated with obtaining care in April 2020. We included 120,230 visits. Participants were 50% white and half had Medicaid. In 2020 there were significantly fewer visits for both well and acute visits with 42,670 visits in 2020 compared to 77,560 in 2019; 6616 were telehealth visits in 2020. Visits for chronic conditions were significantly decreased in 2020. Attending a visit in 2020 was more likely if the participant was black or Hispanic, younger, attending an acute visit, or had private insurance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric primary care decreased substantially for both well visits and follow-up of chronic conditions.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Brown, Callie L; Montez, Kimberly; Amati, Jane Blakely; Simeonsson, Kristina; Townsend, John D; Orr, Colin J; Palakshappa, Deepak", "journal": "Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online)", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#covidwho-1256497", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "235297226"}
