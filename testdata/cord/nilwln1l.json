Glycoengineering using chemical, enzymatic, and genetic approaches has a long history, and precise gene editing provides a nearly unlimited playground for stable engineering of glycosylation in mammalian cells to explore and dissect the glycome and its many biological functions. Genetic engineering of glycosylation in cells also brings studies of the glycome to the single cell level and opens up wider use and integration of data in traditional omics workflows in cell biology. The last few years have seen new applications of glycoengineering in mammalian cells with perspectives for wider use in basic and applied glycosciences, and these have already led to discoveries of functions of glycans and improved designs of glycoprotein therapeutics. Here, we review the current state of the art of genetic glycoengineering in mammalian cells and highlight emerging opportunities.", "publish_time": "2021-02-20", "authors": "Narimatsu, Yoshiki; B\u00fcll, Christian; Chen, Yen-Hsi; Wandall, Hans H.; Yang, Zhang; Clausen, Henrik", "journal": "J Biol Chem", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/8cdd9cf5835b96f62871138f0bafbb5782ec12db.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8042171.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617880/", "s2_id": "232017317"}
