The podcast was initially used to highlight the scholarship and humanity of fellow human biologists through interviews about \"how the sausage is made\" in research-that is, the nuts and bolts that go into our publications. However, we soon realized there is much more a weekly podcast can do to help colleagues in our interrelated fields. METHODS: Here we introduce the different contributions to this #Hackdemics special issue. Through #Hackademics, we address under-discussed topics in academia such as work-life integration, hostile academic environments, decolonization of research and teaching, and science communication, among others. RESULTS: The feedback received from listeners for the #Hackademics series reinforced a need for more tools for navigating the academic side of our disciplines. Furthermore, there was a need to decentralize what is often termed \"institutional knowledge\" by sharing it in a more authoritative medium-a special issue of peer-reviewed articles in our Association's esteemed journal. This special issue's contributions also elevate diverse voices with multiple authors at different career stages. CONCLUSIONS: Using the institutional credibility of peer-review to legitimize these topics, this issue's articles can be a resource for those looking to initiate conversations or change within their departments or institutions with the hope of creating a kinder, more respectful, collaborative, equitable, and accessible academic environment.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Ocobock, Cara; Owens, Caroline; Holdsworth, Elizabeth; Gildner, Theresa; Lynn, Christopher", "journal": "Am J Hum Biol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#mdl-34323324", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "236497749"}
