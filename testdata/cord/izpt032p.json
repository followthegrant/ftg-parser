However, the role of LL-37 as a T cell self-antigen in the context of atherosclerosis remains unclear. The objective of this study was to test for the presence of T cells reactive to LL-37 in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Furthermore, the role of T cells reactive to LL-37 in atherosclerosis was assessed using apoE\u2212/\u2212 mice immunized with the LL-37 mouse ortholog, mCRAMP. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ACS were stimulated with LL-37. PBMCs from stable coronary artery disease (CAD) patients or self-reported subjects served as controls. T cell memory responses were analyzed with flow cytometry. Stimulation of PBMCs with LL-37 reduced CD8+ effector T cell responses in controls and patients with stable CAD but not in ACS and was associated with reduced programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1) mRNA expression. For the mouse studies, donor apoE\u2212/\u2212 mice were immunized with mCRAMP or adjuvant as controls, then T cells were isolated and adoptively transferred into recipient apoE\u2212/\u2212 mice fed a Western diet. Recipient mice were euthanized after 5 weeks. Whole aortas and hearts were collected for analysis of atherosclerotic plaques. Spleens were collected for flow cytometric and mRNA expression analysis. Adoptive transfer experiments in apoE\u2212/\u2212 mice showed a 28% reduction in aortic plaque area in mCRAMP T cell recipient mice (P < 0.05). Fifty six percent of adjuvant T cell recipient mice showed calcification in atherosclerotic plaques, compared to none in the mCRAMP T cell recipient mice (Fisher\u2019s exact test P = 0.003). Recipients of T cells from mice immunized with mCRAMP had increased IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 expression in CD8+ T cells compared to controls. In conclusion, the persistence of CD8+ effector T cell response in PBMCs from patients with ACS stimulated with LL-37 suggests that LL-37-reactive T cells may be involved in the acute event. Furthermore, studies in apoE\u2212/\u2212 mice suggest that T cells reactive to mCRAMP are functionally active in atherosclerosis and may be involved in modulating plaque calcification.", "publish_time": "2020-10-06", "authors": "Chernomordik, Fernando; Cercek, Bojan; Lio, Wai Man; Mihailovic, Peter M.; Yano, Juliana; Herscovici, Romana; Zhao, Xiaoning; Zhou, Jianchang; Chyu, Kuang-Yuh; Shah, Prediman K.; Dimayuga, Paul C.", "journal": "Front Immunol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/910073b243326bf424a9ff0391e0cb81a0c890e5.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7573569.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7573569/", "s2_id": ""}
