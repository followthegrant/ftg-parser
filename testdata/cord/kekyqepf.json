However, data suggests that asthmatics do not have an increased risk of COVID\u201019 infection or disease. There is a paucity of data describing pediatric asthmatics with COVID\u201019. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of asthma among hospitalized children with acute symptomatic COVID\u201019, compare demographic and clinical outcomes between asthmatics and nonasthmatics, and characterize behaviors of our outpatient pediatric population. METHODS: We conducted a single\u2010center retrospective study of pediatric patients admitted to the Cohen Children's Medical Center at Northwell Health with symptomatic COVID\u201019 within 4 months of the surge beginning in March 2020 and a retrospective analysis of pediatric asthma outpatients seen in the previous 6 months. Baseline demographic variables and clinical outcomes for inpatients, and medication compliance, health behaviors, and asthma control for outpatients were collected. RESULTS: Thirty\u2010eight inpatients and 95 outpatients were included. The inpatient prevalence of asthma was 34.2%. Asthmatics were less likely to have abnormal chest x\u2010rays (CXRs), require oxygen support, and be treated with remdesivir. Among outpatients, 41% reported improved asthma control and decreased rescue medication use, with no COVID\u201019 hospitalizations, despite six suspected infections. CONCLUSIONS: Among children hospitalized for acute symptomatic COVID\u201019 at our institution, 34.2% had a diagnosis of asthma. Asthmatics did not have a more severe course and required a lower level of care. Outpatients had improved medication compliance and control and a low risk of hospitalization. Biological and behavioral factors may have mitigated against severe disease.", "publish_time": "2021-06-01", "authors": "Farzan, Sherry; Rai, Shipra; Cerise, Jane; Bernstein, Shari; Coscia, Gina; Hirsch, Jamie S.; Jeanty, Judith; Makaryus, Mary; McGeechan, Stacy; McInerney, Alissa; Quizon, Annabelle; Santiago, Maria Teresa", "journal": "Pediatr Pulmonol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/b33ff39cdf5836a779aa85453c2b4cca7b2f3c50.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8242640.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062054/", "s2_id": "235303126"}
