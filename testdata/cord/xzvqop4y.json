To contain spending, the government capped public health expenditure and introduced increased cost-sharing. The Greek case is important for studying the impact of recessions on health systems. This study analysed changes in household health expenditure in Greece over the economic crisis and explored whether the impact differed across socioeconomic groups. PARTICIPANTS: We used data from the Greek Household Budget Survey for the years 2004 and 2008\u20132017. The dataset comprised 51 654 households, with a total of 128 111 members. DESIGN: We compared pre-crisis and post-crisis trends in Greek household out-of-pocket payments for healthcare from 2004 to 2017 using an interrupted time series analysis. This study explored spending in euros and as a share of total household purchases. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the population level trend in household health spending was reversed after the crisis began (pre-crisis trend: \u20ac0.040 decrease per quarter (95% CI: \u22120.785 to \u22120.022), post-crisis trend: \u20ac0.315 increase per quarter (95% CI: \u22120.004 to 0.635)). We also found that spending on inpatient services and pharmaceuticals has been increasing since the start of the crisis, whereas outpatient services expenditure has been decreasing. Across all households, out-of-pocket payments incurred a greater financial burden after the crisis relative to pre-existing trends, but the poorest households incurred a disproportionately higher burden. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to use an interrupted time series analysis to assess the impact of the economic crisis on household health expenditure in Greece. Our findings suggest that there was an erosion of financial protection for Greek households as a consequence of the economic crisis. This effect was particularly pronounced among poorer households, which is indicative of a regressive financing system.", "publish_time": "2020-08-11", "authors": "Crookes, Catriona; Palladino, Raffaele; Seferidi, Paraskevi; Hirve, Raeena; Siskou, Olga; Filippidis, Filippos T", "journal": "BMJ Open", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/c7adbe988e5d5929d20832056866cd11d5e2df4e.json", "document_parses/pdf_json/a37748ec3ffafc9288ec89ec1d81c9cfe8c7e2ac.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7418851.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784261/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038158", "s2_id": "221127228"}
