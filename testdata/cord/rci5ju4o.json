Besides explaining intellectual capital (IC), its methods of measurement, and its effect on AI development. On the other hand, this paper clarified the role of AI that helped early disclosure of the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventative detection that was taken with the help of AI, and that helped contain the pandemic with the help of AI. As expected, this will lead to an increased interest in IC and work to develop AI, especially robots and digital transactions that will be dependent on technology 5G, which will impact the habits and traditions in the present and future of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a9 The Author(s).", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Al Momani, K.
