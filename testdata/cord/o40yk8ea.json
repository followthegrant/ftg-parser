Specificity, sensitivity, promptness or scalability are the main parameters to estimate the final performance, but rarely all of them match in a single test. We have developed SCOVAM, a protein microarray with several viral antigens (spike, nucleocapsid, main protease Nsp5) as capturing probes in a fluorescence immunoassay for COVID\u201019 serological testing. SCOVAM depicts IgG and IgM antibody responses against each of these proteins of 22 individuals in a single microscope slide. It detects specific IgM (0.094 \u03bcg ml(\u20101)) and IgG (~0.017 \u03bcg ml(\u20101)) and is scalable and cost\u2010effective. We validated SCOVAM by comparing with a widely used chemiluminescent commercial serological test (n = 742). SCOVAM showed twice the sensitivity and allowed following seroconversion in a single assay. By analysing the prevalence 4 months later in a subset of 76 positive sera, we still detected 93.42% of positives, almost doubling the detection of the commercial assay. The higher sensitivity of SCOVAM is especially relevant to screen sera for convalescent plasma\u2010based treatments, high\u2010throughput antibody response monitoring after vaccination or evaluation of vaccine efficiency.", "publish_time": "2021-04-30", "authors": "Ruano\u2010Gallego, David; Garc\u00eda\u2010Villadangos, Miriam; Moreno\u2010Paz, Mercedes; G\u00f3mez\u2010Elvira, Javier; Postigo, Marina; Sim\u00f3n\u2010Sacrist\u00e1n, Mar\u00eda; Reyburn, Hugh T.; Carolis, Carlo; Rodrigo, Natalia; Codeseira, Yaiza B.; Rueda, Paloma; Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Sonia; Enjuanes, Luis; Parro, Victor", "journal": "Microb Biotechnol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/b1c59002d54951462104879fa5e130c27886b74a.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8085928.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929101/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.13801", "s2_id": "233449154"}
