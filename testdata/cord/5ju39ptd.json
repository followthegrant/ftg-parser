This study aimed to identify active high-risk transmission clusters of COVID-19 in Sergipe. METHODS: We performed a prospective space-time analysis using confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the first 7 weeks of the outbreak in Sergipe. RESULTS: The prospective space-time statistic detected \"active\" and emerging spatio-temporal clusters comprising six municipalities in the south-central region of the state. CONCLUSIONS: The Geographic Information System (GIS) associated with spatio-temporal scan statistics can provide timely support for surveillance and assist in decision-making.", "publish_time": "2020-06-01", "authors": "Andrade, Lucas Almeida; Gomes, Dharliton Soares; G\u00f3es, Marco Aur\u00e9lio de Oliveira; de Souza, M\u00e9rcia Simone Feitosa; Teixeira, Daniela Cabral Pizzi; Ribeiro, Ca\u00edque Jordan Nunes; Alves, Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Barreto; de Ara\u00fajo, Karina Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Gomes Machado; dos Santos, Allan Dantas", "journal": "Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/ed30ca4e8df74476f7c9d9e43c8ae7648050b9e1.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7269533.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1590/0037-8682-0287-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32491098/", "s2_id": "219284050"}
