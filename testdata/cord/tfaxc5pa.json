The residency application process is changing rapidly in response to an increasingly complex and competitive atmosphere, with wider recognition of the stress, expense, and difficulty of matching into graduate training programs. The COVID-19 pandemic and societal upheaval make this application cycle more challenging than ever before. Medical students need reliable, accurate, honest advising from faculty in their field of choice in order to apply successfully to residency. The authors outline a model for faculty career advisors, distinct from mentors or general academic advisors. The faculty career advisor has detailed knowledge about the field, an in-depth understanding of the application process and what constitutes a strong application. The faculty career advisor provides accurate information regarding residency programs within the specialty, helping students to strategically apply to programs where the student is likely to match, decreasing anxiety, expense and over-application. Faculty career advisor teams advise students throughout the application process with periodic review of student portfolios and are available for support and advice throughout the process. The authors provide a guide for the faculty career advisor in Obstetrics and Gynecology, including faculty development and quality improvement.", "publish_time": "2020-10-07", "authors": "ROYCE, Celeste S.; EVERETT, Elise N.; CRAIG, LaTasha B.; FLEMING, Angela; FORSTEIN, David A.; GRAZIANO, Scott C.; Star HAMPTON, B.; HOPKINS, Laura; MCKENZIE, Margaret; Kang MORGAN, Helen; Madani SIMS, Shireen; MOROSKY, Christopher", "journal": "Am J Obstet Gynecol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/0a0e2725bfbe62c2b949a27e492595c23a2f483e.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937820311789; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820311789?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038302/", "s2_id": "222179760"}
