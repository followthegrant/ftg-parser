As one of the SNARE proteins, SEC22B functions in membrane fusion of vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, antigen cross-presentation, secretory autophagy, and other biological processes. However, apart from not being SNARE proteins, there is little knowledge known about its two homologs (SEC22A and SEC22C). SEC22B alterations have been reported in many human diseases, especially, many mutations of SEC22B in human cancers have been detected. In this review, we will introduce the specific functions of SEC22B, and summarize the researches about SEC22B in human cancers and other diseases. These findings have laid the foundation for further studies to clarify the exact mechanism of SEC22B in the pathological process and to seek new therapeutic targets and better treatment strategies.
