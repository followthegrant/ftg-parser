In recent years, some international studies have used multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches combined with geographic information systems (GIS-MCDA) to support decision-makers in assessing the suitability of agricultural land for irrigation in semi-arid regions. Unlike previous studies, which have only considered a single source of water for crop irrigation, this study proposes a GIS-MCDA approach that considers all potentially available local water sources (e.g., groundwater, surface water, and wastewater) as possible alternatives for better multisource water resource management (MWRM) in regions facing water shortages. The geospatial multicriteria evaluation implemented in this study considers a series of technical, environmental, and agricultural productivity criteria using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. Three independent baseline maps were generated, showing the spatial distribution of suitable areas for crop irrigation for each considered water source in the studied area. Surface water, groundwater, and wastewater offered suitable crop irrigation for 83%, 70%, and 26% of the study area, respectively. Overlapping these areas produced a final map showing all the feasible areas for each crop irrigation alternative at the same time. The MWRM approach considering all water sources increased the coverage of suitable areas to be irrigated in the study area by 2.2%, 20.4%, and more than 225% compared to considering surface water, groundwater, and wastewater, respectively, independently. The GIS-MCDA framework proposed in this study provides better support for decision-makers and stakeholders, favouring a reduction in possible conflicts over water scarcity, the diversification of irrigated crops, and an improvement in the quality-quantitative management of water resources in semi-arid regions.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "da S Alves, Su\u00eanio Anderson F; Coelho, Victor Hugo R; Tsuyuguchi, B\u00e1rbara Barbosa; de O Galv\u00e3o, Carlos; R\u00eago, Janiro C; Almeida, Cristiano das N; Abels, Anna; Pinnekamp, Johannes; Rufino, Iana A A", "journal": "J Environ Manage", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#mdl-34351300", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "236926859"}
