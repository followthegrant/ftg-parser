The activation of inflammasome in the host infected by SARS-CoV-2 is highly related to cytokine storm and hypercoagulopathy, which significantly contribute to the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Even though many studies have shown the host defense mechanism induced by inflammasome against various viral infections, mechanistic interactions leading to downstream cellular responses and pathogenesis in COVID-19 remain unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with numerous cardiovascular disorders including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. The inflammatory response triggered by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome under certain cardiovascular conditions resulted in hyperinflammation or the modulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 signaling pathways. Perturbations of several target cells and tissues have been described in inflammasome activation, including pneumocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells. The interplay between inflammasome activation and hypercoagulopathy in COVID-19 patients is an emerging area to be further addressed. Targeted therapeutics to suppress inflammasome activation may have a positive effect on the reduction of hyperinflammation-induced hypercoagulopathy and cardiovascular disorders occurring as COVID-19 complications.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Gedefaw, Lealem; Ullah, Sami; Leung, Polly H M; Cai, Yin; Yip, Shea-Ping; Huang, Chien-Ling", "journal": "", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1194613", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "233425671"}
