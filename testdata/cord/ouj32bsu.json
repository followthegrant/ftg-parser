Increasing evidence suggests that significant species differences exist in meloxicam metabolism. Because of this, dose extrapolation from domestic animals may not be appropriate for exotic species. The objective of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in a population of male Malayan flying foxes, Pteropus vampyrus, following a single oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Using a sparse sampling method based on a pilot study, two blood samples from each of 10 bats were collected over an 8-hr time period. Analysis of meloxicam in plasma samples was conducted using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The peak plasma concentration of 598 \u00b1 157.5 ng/ml occurred at 1.0 hr post dosing. The terminal half-life was 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 hr, which indicates that meloxicam is rapidly metabolized in this species. No adverse clinical effects were noted during the study period. A single oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg appears safe for use in male Malayan flying foxes, but due to rapid elimination, frequent dosing may be required to maintain plasma concentrations within a therapeutic range. Multidose studies are needed to determine if plasma accumulation of meloxicam occurs.", "publish_time": "2018", "authors": "Goodnight, Andrea L; Cox, Sherry", "journal": "Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1638/2017-0067.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900779/", "s2_id": "49192426"}
