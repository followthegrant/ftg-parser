Furthermore, patients with thoracic malignancies are thought to be at particularly high risk given their older age, smoking habits, and pre-existing cardio-pulmonary comorbidities. For this reason, physicians around the world have formed TERAVOLT, a global consortium dedicated to understanding the impact of COVID-19 on patients with thoracic malignancies.", "publish_time": "2020-05-16", "authors": "Whisenant, Jennifer G.; Trama, Annalisa; Torri, Valter; De Toma, Alessandro; Viscardi, Giuseppe; Cortellini, Alessio; Micheilin, Olivier; Barlesi, Fabrice; Dingemans, Anne-Marie C.; Van Meerbeeck, Jan; Pancaldi, Vera; Soo, Ross A.; Leighl, Natasha B.; Peters, Solange; Wakelee, Heather; Garassino, Marina Chiara; Horn, Leora", "journal": "Cancer Cell", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/7f319534517c08aa97b2249ee7e51018f9eeaf44.json"], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2020.05.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1535610820302580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425702/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610820302580?v=s5", "s2_id": "218656993"}
