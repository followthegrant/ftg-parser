Compared to the ample amount of research on biological detection, work on integrated devices for air monitoring is rare. In this work, we integrated a wet-cyclone air sampler and a DC impedance microfluidic cytometer to build a cyclone-cytometer integrated air monitor (CCAM). The wet-cyclone air sampler sucks the air and concentrates the bioaerosols into 10 mL of aqueous solvent. After 5 min of air sampling, the bioaerosol-containing solution was conveyed to the microfluidic cytometer for detection. The device was tested with aerosolized microbeads, dust, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). CCAM is shown to differentiate particles from 0.96 to 2.95 \u03bcm with high accuracy. The wet cyclone air-sampler showed a 28.04% sampling efficiency, and the DC impedance cytometer showed 87.68% detection efficiency, giving a total of 24.59% overall CCAM efficiency. After validation of the device performance, CCAM was used to detect bacterial aerosols and their viability without any separate pretreatment step. Differentiation of dust, live E. coli, and dead E. coli was successfully performed by the addition of BacLight bacterial viability reagent in the sampling solvent. The usage could be further extended to detection of specific species with proper antibody fluorescent label. A promising strategy for aerosol detection is proposed through the constructive integration of a DC impedance microfluidic cytometer and a wet-cyclone air sampler.", "publish_time": "2021-07-13", "authors": "Lee, Chang Heon; Seok, Hyunho; Jang, Woohyuk; Park, Geunsang; Kim, Ji Tae; Kim, Hyeong-U; Rho, Jihun; Kim, Taesung; Chung, Taek Dong", "journal": "Biosens Bioelectron", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/884b5f563e99a110e5aae3473ebf4c3147ec47c6.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8275843.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113499; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566321005364?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34311208/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566321005364", "s2_id": "235812821"}
