Developing a measure that helps to conserve the health care resource is, therefore, highly desirable, and the pooling of the specimens for testing is one of the attractive strategies. Recently we showed that saliva could be a potential alternative specimen for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) by real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR). In the present study, we performed the pooling of saliva specimens for testing by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RT\u2010PCR. We showed that the saliva pool of either five or ten samples, by allowing the detection of either gene in the pool at an increased cycle threshold cut\u2010off value, further performing individual sample testing in the positive pools did not compromise the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.
