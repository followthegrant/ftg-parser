Ltd., Singapore, Republic of Singapore) and Xpert\u00ae Xpress Flu/RSV kit (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, USA), two rapid point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) by reference to multiplex RT-PCR for respiratory viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs (n=117) were collected from patients with influenza-like illness in Paris, France. Thawed specimens were further analyzed with both NAATs. The usability was comparable for both NAATs. Satisfaction questionnaire was better for the VitaPCR&#8482; platform for the short time of test result in 20 minutes. Both NAATs showed comparable sensitivities (VitaPCRTM: 95.0%; Xpert\u00ae Xpress: 97.5%) and specificities (100%) for influenza A/B RNA detection, with excellent reliability and accuracy between both NAATs. Both VitaPCR&#8482; and Xpert\u00ae Xpress NAATs can be implemented in hospital setting as POC NAATs to rapidly detect influenza A/B RNA in symptomatic patients.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Mboumba Bouassa, Ralph-Sydney; Tonen-Wolyec, Serge; Rodary, Julien; B\u00e9lec, Laurent", "journal": "Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#covidwho-1269260", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "233243253"}
