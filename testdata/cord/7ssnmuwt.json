MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 and neurological symptoms and cerebral imaging (CT or MRI) were included. A chart review regarding neurological symptoms, COVID-19 and imaging findings was conducted. RESULTS: 12 patients (4 females, age 68\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u008a12 years) could be included. Three patients had acute findings. Two patients had acute and subacute cerebral ischemia, one patient had additional intracranial hemorrhages and presumed central pontine myelinolysis. One patient had presumed COVID-19-associated pansinusitis. CONCLUSION: Findings on cerebral imaging in patients with COVID-19 are uncommon and nonspecific. However, cerebral ischemia is regularly encountered and patients should be evaluated for stroke symptoms. KEY POINTS: \u00b7 Approx. 20\u00e2\u0080\u008a% of patients with COVID-19 develop neurological symptoms.. \u00b7 Findings on cerebral imaging in patients with COVID-19 are heterogeneous and nonspecific.. \u00b7 The most common findings are cerebral ischemia and hemorrhages..
