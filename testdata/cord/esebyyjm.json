The present study examined whether individuals or those with someone close to them with a COVID-19 diagnosis differentially experienced anxiety during the pandemic. METHODS: Four web-based repeated cross-sectional surveys were conducted among Canadians aged 18 and older (n = 4015) regarding the impact of COVID-19 on mental health between May 8th and July 14th, 2020. Data on sociodemographic, COVID-19 symptoms/diagnoses for self or someone close, and anxiety were collected. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Anxiety among individuals affected by the pandemic remained stable over time. Individuals or those with someone close diagnosed with COVID-19 had greater odds of having anxiety (OR = 1.55; 95%CI 1.12, 2.14) compared to those who had not been diagnosed (self or close other) with COVID-19. Individuals or those with someone close to them who had symptoms of COVID-19 had greater odds of having anxiety (OR = 2.08; 95%CI 1.51, 2.87) compared to those who did not report symptoms (self or close other). CONCLUSIONS: This evidence highlights the importance of targeted psychosocial interventions for those directly impacted by the COVID-19 virus.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Nigatu, Yeshambel T; Elton-Marshall, Tara; Wells, Samantha; Jankowicz, Damian; Wickens, Christine M; Hamilton, Hayley A", "journal": "Anxiety Stress Coping", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1242077", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "235198860"}
