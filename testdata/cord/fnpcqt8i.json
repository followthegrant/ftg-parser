Nanomaterials have the ability to directly penetrate cancer cells and potentially achieve minimally invasive, precise and efficient tumor annihilation. As such, nanoscale metal organic frameworks (nMOFs) are becoming increasingly attractive as potential therapeutic agents in the medical field due to their high structural variability, good biocompatibility, ease of surface functionalization as well as their porous morphologies with tunable cavity sizes. This overview addresses five different common strategies used to find cancer therapies, while summarizing the recent progress in using nMOFs as cytotoxic cancer cell agents largely through in vitro studies, although some in vivo investigations have also been reported. Chemo and targeted therapies rely on drug encapsulation and delivery inside the cell, whereas photothermal and photodynamic therapies depend on photosensitizers. Concurrently, immunotherapy actively induces the body to destroy the tumor by activating an immune response. By choosing the appropriate metal center, ligands and surface functionalization, nMOFs can be utilized in all five types of therapies. In the last section, the future prospects and challenges of nMOFs with respect to the various therapies will be presented and discussed.
