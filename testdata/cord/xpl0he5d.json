METHODS: A cross-sectional on-line survey was distributed to employees of a major health care institution located in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil between April 3 and April 10, 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The sample comprised 2,646 respondents. Most participants (44.4%) reported excessive or almost excessive access to information about the novel coronavirus and 67.6% reported having increased their average time spent on social media. When asked how frequently they consider it was easy to determine the reliability of information, \"sometimes\" corresponded to 43.2% of the answers in contrast to 14.6% responding \"always\". Answers related to potential signs of information overload associated with the pandemic indicated that 31% of respondents felt stressed by the amount of information they had to keep up with almost every day or always. Overall, 80.0% of respondents reported having experienced at least one of the following symptoms: headache, eye twitching, restlessness or sleeping difficulty. The frequency of symptoms was higher among participants with a more negative information processing style regarding when dealing with large volumes of information relative to those with a positive information processing style. Likewise, symptoms were more frequently reported by participants who had increased their social media access relative to those reporting reduced access during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our survey provides a description of how health professionals consume COVID-19 related information during the pandemic, and suggests that excessive information exposure and high processing demands may impose psychological distress and affect mental health.", "publish_time": "2020", "authors": "Baz\u00e1n, Paulo Rodrigo; Azevedo Neto, Raymundo Machado de; Dias, Julia Abou; Salvatierra, Vanessa Gil; Sanches, Liana Guerra; Lacerda, Shirley Silva; Amaro Junior, Edson; Kozasa, Elisa Harumi; Balardin, Joana Bisol", "journal": "Einstein (Sao Paulo)", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#965534", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "227210763"}
