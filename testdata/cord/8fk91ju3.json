Visual acuity was counting fingers, and bilateral retinitis and panuveitis were revealed in ocular examination. The result of the vitreous sample using RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and negative for Herpesviridae viruses and mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was successfully treated with corticosteroid.Conclusion: We report a case of bilateral neuroretinitis and panuveitisin a recovered COVID-19 patient and positive RT-PCR of the vitreous sample. It is suggested to apply intraocular sampling and evaluation for COVID-19 in patients with the new-onset of uveitis and/or retinitis during the pandemic.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Hosseini, Seyedeh Maryam; Abrishami, Mojtaba; Zamani, Ghodsieh; Hemmati, Armin; Momtahen, Solmaz; Hassani, Mohadeseh; Omidtabrizi, Arash", "journal": "Ocul Immunol Inflamm", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#1172599", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "233191378"}
