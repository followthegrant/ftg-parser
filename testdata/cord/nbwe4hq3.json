To assess this, we surveyed 18-45-year-old women on their intent to be vaccinated, experiences with Covid-19, and uptake of other vaccines. Among the 342 who completed the survey, only one-third were likely to accept the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as it was available. Less than half would accept it even if recommended by their doctor. Most (69%) wanted more information on its safety and 48% wanted proof it works. Likelihood of accepting the vaccine with a doctor's recommendation was associated with fear of catching Covid-19 and exposure to social media as well as HPV and annual flu vaccination. This demonstrates it will be necessary to help vaccine-hesitant individuals overcome their concerns to reach herd immunity in the US. Physician recommendation and social media may play important roles.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Berenson, Abbey B; Chang, Mihyun; Hirth, Jacqueline M; Kanukurthy, Manasa", "journal": "Hum Vaccin Immunother", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#covidwho-1254251", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "", "s2_id": "235336635"}
