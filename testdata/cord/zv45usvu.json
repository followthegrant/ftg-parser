Early diagnosis is an essential key to limit the outbreak of the virus. STUDY DESIGN: Case series, study conducted between March 25, 2020, and April 15, 2020. SETTING: Ambulatory, nonhospitalized patients who were quarantined in a designated hotel for COVID-19 patients and were recruited by an advertisement at the hotel. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In total, 140 patients participated in a web-based questionnaire assessing initial symptoms of common viral diseases, olfactory and taste functions, xerostomia, and orofacial pain. RESULTS: A total of 58 men and 70 women participated. Initial symptoms were cough (59.4%), weakness (47.7%), myalgia (46.9%), fever (42.2%), headache (40.6%), impaired sense of smell (38.3%), impaired sense of taste (32.8%), sore throat (26.6%), runny nose (26.6%), and nasal congestion (22.7%). All symptoms were more frequent among women; however, only runny nose was statistically significant (P = .018). The most common combination of symptoms was cough and weakness (37.5%). A total of 25.8% reported olfactory and taste dysfunctions in the absence of other symptoms. In a comparison between the sexes, cough and runny nose were the most common combination in women (P = .018). A total of 38.3% of patients reported olfactory dysfunction as an initial symptom. Anosmia and facial pain were more common among women (P < .001 and P = .01, respectively), and 56% of patients reported xerostomia. CONCLUSION: A considerable number of patients presented with olfactory and oral disorders. Interestingly, women presented with a different cluster of symptoms than men, which may suggest a new clinical approach to diagnosing COVID-19 disease.", "publish_time": "2020-06-16", "authors": "Biadsee, Ameen; Biadsee, Ameer; Kassem, Firas; Dagan, Or; Masarwa, Shchada; Ormianer, Zeev", "journal": "Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/6bb1574733f4f05d976d88596329a799ee1fe871.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7298562.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820934380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32539587/", "s2_id": "219701687"}
