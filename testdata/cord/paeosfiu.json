Here, primary chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were infected with three pathogenic IBV strains, and it was observed that the TLR7-MYD88 pathway was inhibited but the TLR3-TIRF pathway was activated. After treatment with poly(I:C)-LMW, poly (I:C)-LMW/LyoVec, and Imiquimod, the replication of IBV was significantly suppressed after 24 h. However, treatment with TLR3 pathway inhibitors such as Pepinh-TRIF, celastrol, chloroquine, and BX795 resulted in increased replication of IBV after 36 h. These results also showed that chloroquine and celastrol were most effective inhibitors of the antiviral response at 48 hpi.", "publish_time": "2020-06-10", "authors": "Zhu, Jinyan; Xu, Shuang; Li, Xueyan; Wang, Jue; Jiang, Yueqi; Hu, Weichen; Ruan, Wenke", "journal": "Arch Virol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/638bff0c969beca15528550c9055bd2766a33c05.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7286419.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04690-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32524263/", "s2_id": "219568354"}
