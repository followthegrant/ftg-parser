Diseases in individuals which offer some commercial value are often well documented and subsequently well studied in comparison to those wild groups offering little commercial gain. This is particularly the case with those associated with mariculture or the commercial fisheries. Specifically, these include many Holothuroidea, and numerous crustacea and mollusca species. Pathogens/parasites consisting of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes from all groups have been associated with diseases from such organisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. Viral pathogens in particular, appear to be an increasingly important group and research into this group will likely highlight a larger number of diseases and pathogens being described in the near future. Interestingly, although there are countless examples of the spread of disease usually associated with transportation of specific infected hosts for development of aquaculture practices, this process appears to be continuing with no real sign of effective management and mitigation strategies being implicated. Notably, even in well developed countries such as the UK and the US, even though live animal trade may be well managed, the transport of frozen food appears to be less well so and as evidence suggests, even these to have the potential to transmit pathogens when used as a food source for example.", "publish_time": "2015-10-31", "authors": "Sweet, Michael J.; Bateman, Kelly S.", "journal": "Journal of Sea Research", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/8102dc5160310e245b81df113ab6cfadf41b3d47.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172736.xml.json"], "url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1385110115300186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336936/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2015.06.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110115300186", "s2_id": "82135842"}
