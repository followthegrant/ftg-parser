In the application of clinical medicine, lung CT images are utilized by practitioners to determine whether a patient is infected with coronavirus. However, there are some laybacks can be considered regarding to this diagnostic method, such as time consuming and low accuracy. As a relatively large organ of human body, important spatial features would be lost if the lungs were diagnosed utilizing two dimensional slice image. Therefore, in this paper, a deep learning model with 3D image was designed. The 3D image as input data was comprised of two-dimensional pulmonary image sequence and from which relevant coronavirus infection 3D features were extracted and classified. The results show that the test set of the 3D model, the result: f1 score of 0.8379 and AUC value of 0.8807 have been achieved.", "publish_time": "2021-07-08", "authors": "Qi, Haibo; Wang, Yuhan; Liu, Xinyu", "journal": "", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "2107.04055", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04055v1.pdf", "s2_id": "235790563"}
