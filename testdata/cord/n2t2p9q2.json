Prospective resident recruitment and resident education were particularly affected due to limitations on in-person gatherings in effort to curb exposure. Finding ways to mitigate the pandemic's effect on recruitment and education was a challenge faced by residency programs across the nation. This article discusses a single Interventional Radiology program's approach to adapting to the reality of limited interpersonal interaction as well as efforts to maintain engagement for resident recruitment and education in a virtual setting.", "publish_time": "2021-09-25", "authors": "Phadke, Daniel; Khaja, Minhaj S; Banathy, Alexandra K; Clark, Meghan R; Grewal, Sukhdeep; Kinariwala, Dhara; Wilkins, Luke R", "journal": "Acad Radiol", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/59276e1e267b52def9bed9c999b4d35d93775984.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8463284.xml.json"], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2021.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580013/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1076633221003846; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633221003846", "s2_id": "237619243"}
