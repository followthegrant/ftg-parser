We technically review a study that compared multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) models to classify CT samples with COVID-19, Influenza viral pneumonia, or no-infection. We compare this mentioned study with one that is developed on existing 2D and 3D deep-learning models, combining them with the latest clinical understanding, and achieved an AUC of 0.996 (95%CI: 0.989\u20131.00) for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT studies. They calculated a sensitivity of 98.2% and a specificity of 92.2%.", "publish_time": "2020-04-22", "authors": "Butt, Charmaine; Gill, Jagpal; Chun, David; Babu, Benson A.", "journal": "Appl Intell", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/9439a5ed7c53f89eb7dd70fd9d6cf26d80c24347.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175452.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175452/", "s2_id": ""}
