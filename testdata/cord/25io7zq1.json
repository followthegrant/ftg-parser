Early diagnosis of malaria by either a rapid diagnostic test or microscopy enables prompt treatment with the effective antimalarial, artemether-lumefantrine, preventing progression to severe disease and death. Intravenous artesunate is the preferred treatment for severe malaria in both children and adults. Adding single low-dose primaquine to standard treatment is recommended in endemic areas to block onward transmission. Use of the highly effective artemisinin-based therapies should be limited to the treatment of confirmed malaria infections, as there is no clinical evidence that these antimalarials can prevent or treat COVID-19. Routine malaria case management services must be sustained, in spite of COVID-19, to treat malaria effectively and support SA's malaria elimination efforts.", "publish_time": "2020-11-23", "authors": "Raman, J; Barnes, K I; Baker, L; Blaylock, M; Blumberg, L; Frean, J; Misiani, E; Ukpe, I S", "journal": "South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2020.v111i11.15289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403998/", "s2_id": "230782705"}
