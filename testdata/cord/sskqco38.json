The TREM2 signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of diseases ranging from neurodegeneration in the central nervous system to metabolic disease in the periphery. Here, we report that TREM2 is a thyroid hormone-regulated gene and its expression in macrophages and microglia is stimulated by thyroid hormone and synthetic thyroid hormone agonists (thyromimetics). Our findings report the endocrine regulation of TREM2 by thyroid hormone, and provide a unique opportunity to drug the TREM2 signaling pathway with orally active small-molecule therapeutic agents.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Ferrara, Skylar J; Chaudhary, Priya; DeBell, Margaret J; Marracci, Gail; Miller, Hannah; Calkins, Evan; Pocius, Edvinas; Napier, Brooke A; Emery, Ben; Bourdette, Dennis; Scanlan, Thomas S", "journal": "Cell Chem.
