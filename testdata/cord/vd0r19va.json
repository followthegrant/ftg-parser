Furthermore, it examines and clusters eighteen cryptocurrencies by exploring their market efficiency similarity. Comparing the cryptocurrency bubble periods with the COVID-19 pandemic, the results indicate that this pandemic has the highest impact on cryptocurrency market efficiency. Interestingly, using the dynamic time warping clustering approach, we found evidence on the presence of three clusters that essentially represent mining coins, non-mining coins and token categorizations.", "publish_time": "2021", "authors": "Montasser, Ghassen El Charfeddine Lanouar Benhamed Adel", "journal": "Finance Research Letters", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "#covidwho-1330832", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102362", "s2_id": "238778837"}
