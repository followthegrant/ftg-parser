In just 6 months, the virus had infected more than 7.5 million population worldwide, and in 10 months infected over 40 million. Clinical manifestation of Sars-CoV-2 range from mild symptoms like sneezing, coughing, cold and fever to severe respiratory complications such as pneumonia and acute distress respiratory syndrome, sepsis, and multiple organ failure. The virus is highly contagious and transmits through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no treatment option available to treat Sars-CoV-2. Several research groups are working to explore different aspects of virus but further research is needed to fill the knowledge gaps. Herein, this review article provides latest update on genomic characterization, transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical manifestation of Sars-CoV-2.", "publish_time": "2020-01-01", "authors": "Nishwa, Dur E; Riaz, Hafiza Arooba; Fatima, Ameer; Wahid, Braira", "journal": "Theoretical biology forum", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.19272/202011402005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929003/", "s2_id": "233460071"}
