The study aimed to report the outcomes of planned urgent and cancer cases during the current pandemic using a multi-disciplinary prioritisation group. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of patients having urgent or cancer surgery at a NHS Trust from 1st March to 30th April 2020 who had been prioritised by a multi-disciplinary COVID Surgery group. Rates of post-operative PCR positive and suspected COVID-19 infections within 30 days, 30-day mortality and any death related to COVID-19 are reported. RESULTS: Overall 597 patients underwent surgery with a median age of 65 years (interquartile range (IQR) 54\u201374 years). Of these, 86.1% (514/597) had a current cancer diagnosis. During the period, 60.8% (363/597) of patients had surgery at the NHS Trust whilst 39.2% (234/597) had surgery at Independent Sector hospitals. The incidence of COVID-19 in the East Midlands was 193.7 per 100,000 population during the study period. In the 30 days following surgery, 1.3% (8/597) of patients tested positive for COVID-19 with all cases at the NHS site. Overall 30-day mortality was 0.7% (4/597). Following a PCR positive COVID-19 diagnosis, mortality was 25.0% (2/8). Including both PCR positive and suspected cases, 3.0% (18/597) developed COVID-19 infection with 1.3% at the independent site compared to 4.1% at the NHS Trust (p=0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of COVID-19 infection in the post-operative period were low especially in the Independent Sector site. Mortality following a post-operative diagnosis of COVID-19 was high.
