Today, 25 years later, along with the original prototype of supraglottic airways quite a few numbers of different devices exist that can be used to secure the airway \"above the glottis\". After initially primarily marketing adult sizes many suppliers offer paediatric sizes nowadays. However, the scientific evidence in terms of superiority or at a least equality to the original LMA-Classic( of any of these airway devices must be considered insufficient except for the LMA-ProSeal\u2122. Consequently, the routine use of these devices outside controlled clinical studies must be considered questionable. The following article aims at providing a critical appraisal of currently available supraglottic airway devices for neonates and infants.", "publish_time": "2013", "authors": "Goldmann, Kai", "journal": "Anasthesiologie, Intensivmedizin, Notfallmedizin, Schmerztherapie : AINS", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1343759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23633256/", "s2_id": "354160"}
