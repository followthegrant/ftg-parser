Despite unprecedented research and developmental efforts, SARS-CoV-2-specific antivirals are still unavailable for the treatment of COVID-19. In most instances, SARS-CoV-2 infection initiates with the binding of spike glycoprotein to the host cell ACE2 receptor. Utilizing the crystal structure of the ACE2/Spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) complex (PDB file 6M0J) in a computer-aided drug design (CADD) approach, we identified and validated 5 potential inhibitors of S-RBD and ACE-2 interaction. Two of the five compounds, MU-UNMC-1 and MU-UNMC-2, blocked the entry of pseudovirus particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein. In live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays, both the compounds showed antiviral activity with IC50 values in the micromolar range (MU-UNMC-1: IC50= 0.67 \u03bcM and MU-UNMC-2: IC50= 1.72 \u03bcM) in human bronchial epithelial cells. Furthermore, MU-UNMC-1 and MU-UNMC-2 effectively blocked the replication of rapidly transmitting variants of concern: South African variant B.1.351 (IC50= 9.27 \u03bcM & 3.00 \u03bcM) and Scotland variant B.1.222 (IC50= 2.64 \u03bcM & 1.39 \u03bcM) respectively. Following these assays, we conducted 'induced-fit (flexible) docking' to understand the binding mode of MU-UNMC-1/MU-UNMC-2 at the S-RBD/ACE2 interface. Our data showed that mutation N501Y (present in B.1.351 variant) alters the binding mode of MU-UNMC-2 such that it is partially exposed to the solvent and has reduced polar contacts. Finally, MU-UNMC-2 displayed high synergy with remdesivir (RDV), the only approved drug for treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE The ongoing coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). More than 207 million people have been infected globally, and 4.3 million have died due to this viral outbreak. While a few vaccines have been deployed, a SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19 is yet to be approved. As the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2 is critical for cellular entry, using a combination of a computer-aided drug design (CADD) approach and cell-based in vitro assays, we report the identification of five potential SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. Out of the five, two compounds (MU-UNMC-1 and MU-UNMC-2) have antiviral activity against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants from South Africa and Scotland. Furthermore, MU-UNMC-2 acts synergistically with remdesivir, suggesting that RDV and MU-UNMC-2 can be developed as a combination therapy to treat COVID-19, infected individuals.", "publish_time": "2021-09-22", "authors": "Acharya, Arpan; Pandey, Kabita; Thurman, Michellie; Klug, Elizabeth; Trivedi, Jay; Sharma, Kalicharan; Lorson, Christian L; Singh, Kamal; Byrareddy, Siddappa N", "journal": "Journal of virology", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": [""], "pmc_json_files": [""], "url": "https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01437-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34550770/", "s2_id": "237608992"}
