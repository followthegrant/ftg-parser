Difficulty in RV-C cultivation and target sequence variation has precluded the development of a PCR based quantification method. Objective The aim of this study was to develop and validate reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays for a broad range of circulating RV-C genotypes in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs). Study design Four assays were designed to quantify a 296bp region located within the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of RV-C types. These assays were based on in silico analysis of available RV-C sequences. Probes were designed to provide 100% homology to the corresponding RV-C genotypes. Results The linear dynamic range of each of the four assays spanned eight orders of magnitude (104\u20131011 copies/mL). The limit of detection for assays 1\u20134 was estimated to be 1147 copies/mL, 765 copies/mL, 1138 copies/mL and 1470 copies/mL respectively. Each assay demonstrated a strong linear relationship (r2 =>0.995) and amplification efficiency greater than 95%. Repeatability and reproducibility of the method were shown to be high, with coefficients of variations lower than 8% and 15% respectively.", "publish_time": "2016-09-30", "authors": "Sikazwe, Chisha T.; Chidlow, Glenys R.; Imrie, Allison; Smith, David W.", "journal": "Journal of Virological Methods", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/6fd0dededc4ca7e5434b4008ed41f494bde09e79.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172306.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416300556; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.05.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416300556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27216896/", "s2_id": "3920546"}
