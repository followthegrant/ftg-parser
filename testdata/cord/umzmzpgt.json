Building on our recent work on a computer vision-based localization approach that runs in real time on a smartphone, we describe an accessible wayfinding iOS app we have created that provides turn-by-turn directions to a desired destination. The localization approach combines dead reckoning obtained using visual-inertial odometry (VIO) with information about the user\u2019s location in the environment from informational sign detections and map constraints. We explain how we estimate the user\u2019s distance from Exit signs appearing in the image, describe new improvements in the sign detection and range estimation algorithms, and outline our algorithm for determining appropriate turn-by-turn directions.", "publish_time": "2020-08-10", "authors": "Fusco, Giovanni; Cheraghi, Seyed Ali; Neat, Leo; Coughlan, James M.", "journal": "Computers Helping People with Special Needs", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/260f4d8cced547ab23753b9c4a24d332b3359142.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7703403.xml.json"], "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7703403/", "s2_id": ""}
