We characterized distress, coping, and preferences for support among NYC HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional web survey of physicians, advanced practice providers, residents/fellows, and nurses, conducted during a peak of inpatient admissions for COVID-19 in NYC (April 9th\u2013April 24th 2020) at a large medical center in NYC (n = 657). RESULTS: Positive screens for psychological symptoms were common; 57% for acute stress, 48% for depressive, and 33% for anxiety symptoms. For each, a higher percent of nurses/advanced practice providers screened positive vs. attending physicians, though housestaff's rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from either. Sixty-one percent of participants reported increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 outbreak. Physical activity/exercise was the most common coping behavior (59%), and access to an individual therapist with online self-guided counseling (33%) garnered the most interest. CONCLUSIONS: NYC HCWs, especially nurses and advanced practice providers, are experiencing COVID-19-related psychological distress. Participants reported using empirically-supported coping behaviors, and endorsed indicators of resilience, but they also reported interest in additional wellness resources. Programs developed to mitigate stress among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic should integrate HCW preferences.", "publish_time": "2020-06-16", "authors": "Shechter, Ari; Diaz, Franchesca; Moise, Nathalie; Anstey, David E.; Ye, Siqin; Agarwal, Sachin; Birk, Jeffrey L.; Brodie, Daniel; Cannone, Diane E.; Chang, Bernard; Claassen, Jan; Cornelius, Talea; Derby, Lilly; Dong, Melissa; Givens, Raymond C.; Hochman, Beth; Homma, Shunichi; Kronish, Ian M.; Lee, Sung A.J.; Manzano, Wilhelmina; Mayer, Laurel E.S.; McMurry, Cara L.; Moitra, Vivek; Pham, Patrick; Rabbani, LeRoy; Rivera, Reynaldo R.; Schwartz, Allan; Schwartz, Joseph; Shapiro, Peter; Shaw, Kaitlin; Sullivan, Alexandra M.; Vose, Courtney; Wasson, Lauren; Edmondson, Donald; Abdalla, Marwah", "journal": "Gen Hosp Psychiatry", "mag_id": "", "who_covidence_id": "", "arxiv_id": "", "pdf_json_files": ["document_parses/pdf_json/b90a19c9baff98fca2705003601768e5acfda458.json"], "pmc_json_files": ["document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7297159.xml.json"], "url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163834320300839; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834320300839?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32590254/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.06.007", "s2_id": "219700374"}
