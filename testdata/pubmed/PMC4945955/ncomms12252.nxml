Here we report the assembly of lipid-like peptoids into highly stable, crystalline, free-standing and self-repairing membrane-mimetic 2D nanomaterials through a facile crystallization process. Both experimental and molecular dynamics simulation results show that peptoids assemble into membranes through an anisotropic formation process. We further demonstrated the use of peptoid membranes as a robust platform to incorporate and pattern functional objects through large side-chain diversity and/or co-crystallization approaches. Similar to lipid membranes, peptoid membranes exhibit changes in thickness upon exposure to external stimuli; they can coat surfaces in single layers and self-repair. We anticipate that this new class of membrane-mimetic 2D nanomaterials will provide a robust matrix for development of biomimetic membranes tailored to specific applications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

For example, self-assembly of lipid molecules and membrane proteins is crucial in defining cell architecture and enabling cell function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. From a material's perspective, cell membranes, which consist of 3&#x02013;5-nm-thick lipid bilayers, are of particular interest because they represent a class of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials that have rather unusual properties, such as sequence-specific water and ion transport and the ability to self-repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Because cell membranes are a great source of inspiration in biotechnology and nanotechnology, many efforts have been made to create synthetic, membrane-mimetic 2D nanomaterials assembled from lipids, or synthetic analogues of lipids (for example, lipid-like peptides, block copolymers)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, assembly of these lipid analogues into stable, free-standing, bilayer 2D membranes presents a significant challenge, and one of the major disadvantages that limit the technological applications of the lipid-based membranes is their poor stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>Peptoids (or poly-N-substituted glycines)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, non-natural mimetics of peptides and proteins, have received particular attention because they can be cheaply and efficiently synthesized, and several hundred commercially available amines can be used to attain large side-chain diversity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Peptoids are highly peptidase/proteinase-resistant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and are chemically and thermally stable<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Because peptoids lack backbone hydrogen bonds, which simplifies tuning interpeptoid and peptoid-surface interactions exclusively through side-chain chemistry, they offer unique opportunity for achieving sequence-specific molecular recognition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and controlling self-assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. All these features make peptoids highly attractive as synthetic analogues of lipids for self-assembly of membrane-mimetic 2D materials. Herein we report the first example of self-assembling highly stable and self-repairing membrane-mimetic 2D nanomaterials by designing lipid-like sequence-defined peptoids.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Design of lipid-like peptoids</title><p>Inspired by the diblock-like feature of lipids and taking advantage of the ease of peptoid design, here we designed and synthesized a series of amphiphilic, lipid-like peptoids containing two sub-blocks, respectively, six polar residues, <sc>N</sc>-(2-carboxyethyl)glycine (Nce) and six nonpolar residues, <sc>N</sc>-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]glycines(N<sub>4-Cl</sub>pe) (Pep-<bold>1</bold>&#x02013;Pep-<bold>5</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref> for details). In doing so, our goal was to build lipid-bilayer-like membrane-mimetic 2D nanomaterials by using the six Nce groups to mimic polar lipid head groups and the six N<sub>4-Cl</sub>pe groups to create aromatic counterparts of nonpolar lipid tails. Moreover, the aromatic residue N<sub>4-Cl</sub>pe was chosen because it is known to stabilize self-assembled materials by enhancing intermolecular packing through, for example, <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>&#x02013;<italic>&#x003c0;</italic> interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Assembly of lipid-like peptoids into 2D membranes</title><p>Peptoid membranes were formed through an easy, evaporation-induced crystallization process from amorphous to highly crystalline materials (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1 and 2</xref> for details). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies showed that these peptoids formed 2D membrane-like nanomaterials with straight edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1b and 3c</xref>). Membranes assembled from Pep-<bold>1</bold> to Pep-<bold>5</bold> exhibited a thickness in the range of 3.5&#x02013;4&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 1b and 3c</xref>), similar to the thickness of lipid membranes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The observation of many overlapping membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>) indicated that they were free-standing in solution and overlapped during sample preparation.</p><p>X-ray analyses demonstrate that membranes assembled from Pep-<bold>1</bold> to Pep-<bold>5</bold> are highly crystalline and all exhibit similar X-ray diffraction patterns, with only noticeable differences in the first low <italic>q</italic> peak corresponding to membrane thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The difference and broadening in this peak suggests that peptoid backbones are dynamic and the thickness of peptoid membranes is variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The similarity in other X-ray diffraction peaks indicates that functional groups, such as clickable alkynyl group in Pep-<bold>4</bold>, can be added at the N termini of membrane-forming peptoids to build functional membranes with similar structures.</p><p>For the peaks above <italic>q</italic>=0.25&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the strongest peak at <italic>q</italic>=1.4&#x02009;&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is because of the alignment of peptoid chains, which leads to a spacing of 4.5&#x02009;&#x000c5; between the peptoids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The 3.6-&#x000c5; spacing is the distance between each residue along the chain direction. The 6-&#x000c5; spacing corresponds to the N<sub>4-Cl</sub>pe side-chain length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The 1.8-nm spacing corresponds to the distance between two peptoid backbones packed inside the membranes with N<sub>4-Cl</sub>pe groups facing each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). The presence of extensive &#x003c0;-stacking is evidenced by X-ray diffraction peaks at 4, 3.8 and 3&#x02009;&#x000c5; (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the hydrophobic interactions that impart high stability to the membrane are robust to variations in ionic strength and pH. Pep-<bold>3</bold> nanomembranes formed even when 500&#x02009;mM NaCl was added to the crystallization solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), and Pep-<bold>2</bold> membranes formed at pH values from 5.6 to 10.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b&#x02013;e</xref>). To further illuminate the role of hydrophobic interactions in membrane formation, we designed peptoids Pep-<bold>6</bold> and Pep<bold>-7</bold> by varying the position of the side-chain chloro (-Cl) group on the nonpolar residues. Pep-<bold>6</bold>, which has six <sc>N</sc>-[2-(3-chlorophenyl)ethyl]glycines (N<sub>3-Cl</sub>pe) residues, formed membranes with slightly different packing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), while Pep<bold>-7</bold> with six <sc>N</sc>-[2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl]glycines (N<sub>2-Cl</sub>pe) did not self-assemble into crystalline membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), which N<sub>2-Cl</sub>pe might create too much steric hindrance to maintain an ordered packing of hydrophobic domains. These results demonstrate that the position of the -Cl group is important for the packing of hydrophobic domains and the resultant membrane structures.</p><p>To further demonstrate that the ordering of hydrophobic domains is the key to forming membrane structures, we synthesized peptoids Pep-<bold>8</bold>&#x02013;Pep-<bold>11</bold> by either having only three N<sub>4-Cl</sub>pe residues as hydrophobic domains (Pep-<bold>8</bold>) or changing the polar domains from Nce<sub>6</sub> to Nce<sub>3</sub> (Pep-<bold>9</bold>), non-carboxyl-containing Nte<sub>3</sub> [Nte=N-2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethylglycine] (Pep-<bold>10</bold>) or (NceNae)<sub>3</sub> [Nae=<sc>N</sc>-(2-aminoethyl)glycine] (Pep-<bold>11</bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). As we expected, Pep-<bold>8</bold> with only three N<sub>4-Cl</sub>pe residues could not form membranes because of the lack of enough hydrophobic interactions to stabilize the membrane structure. On the other hand, when six N<sub>4-Cl</sub>pe residues remain, Pep-<bold>9</bold>&#x02013;Pep-<bold>11</bold> with even three polar residues (Nce<sub>3</sub> of Pep-<bold>9</bold> and Nte<sub>3</sub> of Pep-<bold>10</bold>) or a mixture of Nce and Nae residues (Pep-<bold>11</bold>) self-assembled into biomimetic membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>To highlight the significance of hydrophobic interactions in the membrane formation and the similarity of designed peptoids and lipids, we designed and synthesized peptoids Pep-<bold>12</bold>&#x02013;Pep-<bold>14</bold>, which have various number of Nhex [Nhex=<italic>N</italic>-(6-hexyl)glycine] residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). While Pep-<bold>12</bold>, an addition of two Nhex residues at the C terminus of Pep-<bold>2</bold>, self-assembled into biomimetic membranes with &#x0223c;4&#x02009;nm thickness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>), replacing of all aromatic N<sub>4-Cl</sub>pe residues with aliphatic Nhex residues resulted in no membrane formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). We reason that such changes might result in forming decreased hydrophobic interactions because of the loss of <italic>&#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0;</italic> interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. To increase the hydrophobic interactions for sufficiently stabilizing membrane structures, we further synthesized Pep-<bold>14</bold>, which has 12 Nhex residues and 6 Nce residues. As we expected, Pep-<bold>14</bold> self-assembled into &#x0223c;3.8-nm-thick biomimetic membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>).</p><p>The presence of 4.5&#x02009;&#x000c5; and 1.8-nm spacings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) in Pep-<bold>5</bold> membranes was also observed within their high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). These TEM data showed that Pep-<bold>5</bold> formed well-aligned strips along the <italic>x</italic> direction (defined as the direction along straight edge, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>) in the membrane structure, suggesting peptoids packed anisotropically and assembled into membranes with a faster rate along the <italic>x</italic> direction than along the <italic>y</italic> direction. Indeed, time-dependent TEM experiments, which showed that Pep-<bold>3</bold> self-assembled into elongated nanoribbons as intermediates, further confirmed this anisotropic membrane formation process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). We infer that peptoids align along the <italic>x</italic> direction with stronger interpeptoid interactions than those along the <italic>y</italic> direction; however, interpeptoid interactions along both directions are strong enough for peptoids to build membrane-mimetic 2D nanomaterials.</p><p>These AFM, X-ray diffraction and TEM results enable us to propose a structural model for peptoid membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Membrane thickness is determined by the hydrophobic N<sub>4-Cl</sub>pe domains and the flexible hydrophilic Nce domains. To minimize the exposure of hydrophobic groups to water and to bring carboxyl groups on adjacent peptoid chains next to each other, the flexible hydrophilic domains need to be floppy, but they could align laterally to form strips along the <italic>x</italic> direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Amphiphilic peptoids are stacked together along both <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic> directions to form a lipid-membrane-like structure consisting of a hydrophobic interior and two polar faces. We reason that the significant hydrophobic interactions between N<sub>4-Cl</sub>Pe groups and the diblock-like features of these assembling peptoids combine to create strong interpeptoid interactions and drive the crystallization of free-standing membranes in solution. Thus, these peptoids exhibit much more robust assembly than hydrocarbon-based phospholipids, which self-assemble into liposomes or micelles in solution and only form bilayer 2D membranes at interfaces<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Molecular dynamic simulations of peptoid membranes</title><p>To test this model and to understand the interactions that stabilize a robust assembly, we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the stability and flexibility of these peptoid membranes. Individual peptoids were initially placed in extended conformations and the N<sub>4-Cl</sub>Pe residues were positioned in the membrane centre to minimize the exposed hydrophobic surface area. To model the peptoid membrane atomistically, we set up a periodic box of 16 &#x000d7; 6 Pep-<bold>1</bold> (6.4 &#x000d7; 10.2&#x02009;nm) with half the peptoids oriented up along the <italic>z</italic> axis and half oriented down. The side chains were oriented along the <italic>y</italic> axis, and the peptoids were stacked along the <italic>x</italic> axis. The system was solvated with 2&#x02009;nm of explicit SPC water in the <italic>z</italic> direction. Peptoids were modelled with the AMBER03 forcefield<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> with parameters from the generalized amber force field<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, and the simulations were carried out for 600&#x02009;ns using GROMACS 4.6.4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Our simulated structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> showed extensive <italic>&#x003c0;</italic>-stacking in the hydrophobic N<sub>4-Cl</sub>Pe region and disorder in the carboxyl tails. In addition, simulated X-ray diffraction data for Pep-<bold>1</bold> membranes is in good agreement with the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The observation of strips of flexible hydrophilic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>) agrees well with TEM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Furthermore, simulated structures showed much higher contact density along the <italic>x</italic> direction (15.9 contacts per nm<sup>2</sup> of contact area) than the <italic>y</italic> direction (0.86 contacts per nm<sup>2</sup> of contact area); this indicates that peptoid packing in the membrane is anisotropic, which is consistent with our experimental results showing the anisotropic membrane formation process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Incorporating functional objects into peptoid membranes</title><p>While peptoids Pep-<bold>1</bold>&#x02013;Pep-<bold>5</bold> have a stable membrane-mimetic core structure, we also aimed to design membranes that can incorporate different functional objects to perform useful chemical functions while retaining the high stabilities and core structures of the parent peptoids.

They self-assemble either as free-standing membranes through an anisotropic crystallization process in solution or as continuous single-layer membranes on substrate surfaces through a heterogeneous nucleation process. They exhibit a number of properties associated with cell membranes, including hydrophobic cores and hydrophilic surfaces, thicknesses in the 3.5&#x02013;5.6-nm range, spontaneous assembly at interfaces, thickness variations in response to changes in Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentration and the ability to self-repair. We further demonstrate that peptoid membranes provide a robust platform to incorporate and pattern a diverse range of functional objects as peptoid side chains either before assembly or by co-crystallization approaches. We are currently using these approaches to incorporate functional objects such as artificial channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and protein complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.
