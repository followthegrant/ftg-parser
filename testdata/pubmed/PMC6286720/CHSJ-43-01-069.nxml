The respiratory function of these patients was monitored from the clinical and radiological points of view. Deceased patients underwent autopsy.Results: Pulmonary complications occurred in 47.24% of cases. Most pulmonary complications (over 50%) occurred in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.Regarding the clinical aspects of pulmonary complications, the most frequent were ARDS, atelectasisand bronchopneumopathies, determined by the etiological factors that had caused the acute kidney injury in the first place, and by the acute kidney injury-induced physiological effects.Conclusions: 1. The frequency of pulmonary complications in acute kidney injury is very high and has a negative impact on the evolution and prognosis. 2. The etiology of the pulmonary complications is complex, as these are caused by the agents that induced the acute kidney injury in the first place, most frequently by septic shock. 3. Along with clinical and radiological evidence of pulmonary damage, severe pulmonary histological lesions were found in deceased patients, with a high contribution to the increased mortality rate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Acute kidney injury</kwd><kwd>pulmonary complications</kwd><kwd>hemodialysis</kwd><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>acute respiratory distress syndrome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lung is an organ where the complications of acute kidney injury frequently occur.

In sepsis-induced AKI pulmonary complications exceed 50% of all the cases (52.48%). The clinical aspects are very diverse. Most are related to the septic factor:
acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopneumonia, atelectasis, and bronchoalveolar damage, representing 25.67%. Other pulmonary complications were: pleurisy (4.05%), sepsis-induced pulmonary edema (2.32%), pulmonary embolism (1.57%), and pulmonary and airway hemorrhage (9.30%). Histology analysis has shown that these pulmonary complications are caused by
shock-specific factors (IDC, ARDS), as well as local pulmonary factors (atelectasis, bronchopneumopathy, coagulation disorders, etc. [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Histological material (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) brings extra diagnostic elements, adding information to the image investigations. These have constantly shown interstitial pulmonary edema, capillary congestion, intra-alveolar hemorrhage and edema, and atelectasis areas. These histological features were also present in the early deceased cases, in which the etiologic factor, along with the disruption of the coagulation balance [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the uremic factor, were decisive.</p><p>Half of the cases that underwent necropsy presented pulmonary damage that, along with other factors and complications, contributed to the patient&#x02019;s death.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Pulmonary nterstitial and alveolar hemorrhage, HE staining 4&#x000d7;</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CHSJ-43-01-069-fig1"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Pulmonary interstitial hemorrhage and alveolar damage, HE staining 10&#x000d7;</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CHSJ-43-01-069-fig2"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In order to interpret the pulmonary manifestations that occur during acute kidney injury, it is necessary to assess the lung damage from AKI&#x02019;s early stage, considering multiple factors: the etiologic factor that triggered the AKI [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; the patient&#x02019;s comorbidities; and the biological, physiopathological, and clinical disorders caused by the AKI (the uremic factor). [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The acute kidney injury&#x02019;s etiology is most often represented by various types of shock. It is well-known that respiratory failure, as well as kidney failure, is a complication that occurs in shock.</p><p>Most pulmonary manifestations were found in patients with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (severe sepsis and septic shock) [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], at times when the lungs were primarily affected. In these cases, multiple factors affected the lungs: IDC, pulmonary blood flow redistribution, pulmonary surfactant alteration, chemical mediators (cytokines, elastase, etc.) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], bacteria and endotoxins, and kinins that trigger bronchospasm. Another element with a pulmonary impact that contributed to the
so-called fluid lung syndrome was hyperhydration [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Hyperhydration is sometimes caused by an excess of fluid replacement therapy in shock in situations in which the kidneys are unable to eliminate the fluid excess [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the comorbidities, these were very diverse, considering the acute kidney injury patient&#x02019;s history (chronic bronchopulmonary disease, emphysema, cifosis, thoracic trauma, tuberculosis, etc.).</p><p>The biological alterations that occur during acute kidney injury are not without pulmonary consequences. The high blood urea level can increase membrane permeability, contributing to the pathogenesis of the so-called &#x0201c;uremic lung&#x0201d;.</p><p>Dyspnea can also occur in acidosis, anemia, and electrolyte imbalance, in the absence of pulmonary lesions.</p><p>Bleeding pulmonary disorders can occur in different types of shock, especially septic shock, but also in the context of certain nephropathies that cause hematuria [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or in Goodpasture syndrome, a typical situation of glomerular nephropathy associated with hemoptysis [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There are also toxic factors (e.g., carbon tetrachloride) with kidney impact. Certain therapeutic procedures used to treat acute kidney injury (hemodialysis, blood transfusions) contributed to increased lung damage. Emergency hemodialysis has pulmonary effects [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]-hypoxia, hypoventilation, and pulmonary hypertension are described. Granulocytes and monocytes are activated, releasing inflammation mediators with pulmonary impact.</p><p>Preserved blood, if needed for transfusion, affects the lung by causing capillary obstruction determined by platelets, leucocyte cellular debris, and microemboli. It also causes an increase of serotonin level and pulmonary immunological effects.</p><p>A significant number of acute kidney injury patients required surgery to treat the main cause of the kidney damage. Surgical procedures were required to treat peritonitis, pancreatitis, colecistitis, etc. These procedures caused pulmonary damage through anesthetic factors (intubation, mechanical ventilation [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], pulmonary impact of anesthetics, airways damage). Surgical procedures in the upper abdomen, as well as post-surgery distension, can also cause pulmonary complications.</p><p>The clinical aspects of pulmonary complications included respiratory muscle reduction (2.70%) in patients with severe sepsis. The patients underwent surgical procedures, presented long periods of anuria, and lacked proper nutrition, sometimes because the enteral or parenteral input was not properly assimilated by the altered cells. These cases evolved with a decrease of the pulmonary functional capacity, followed by other pulmonary complications.</p><p>The acute kidney injury&#x02019;s pulmonary complications did not remain without consequences on the evolution and prognosis. Therefore, out of 15 deceased patients, 6 involved pulmonary damage as the main cause of death, along with other organ failure.</p><p>In patients with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury, especially with pulmonary complications, the oliguric or anuric periods were prolonged. Sometimes, a sudden and explosive restart of the diuresis process was noticed after management of the pulmonary complication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>1.
