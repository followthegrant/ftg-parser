Such a screener is primarily meant to initiate and facilitate communication about sexual issues between the clinician and the patient. As such, the screener can offer support for clinicians who are less familiar with sexual medicine and who might not routinely discuss sexual issues with their patients and provide information on where and whether further assessment of sexual problems is indicated.</p><p id="p0015">A problem of short screeners or single-item measures is that they are often viewed as psychometrically suspect and harbor a heightened risk for random measurement errors and biases, which are less likely to occur in larger multiple-item questionnaires. Nevertheless, the use of short screeners or single-item measures has many appealing advantages. Not only can survey lengths be shortened, thus lowering research costs, but also using short instruments is &#x0201c;ethically&#x0201d; favorable because they are less of a burden and less monotonous for respondents and thus might lead to greater survey effectiveness, especially in difficult clinical populations.</p><p id="p0020">Despite the need for a brief, initial screening instrument for sexual problems, relatively little work has been done to develop and evaluate the validity and utility of using short screeners or even single-item measures in sexual medicine. One such attempt was conducted in 2010 by Kriston et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> who suggested a 1-question screener asking about overall sexual satisfaction. With a dichotomous response option, this item showed 76.4% sensitivity and 76.5% specificity in the test sample (N&#x000a0;= 6,194). A more extensive 5-item version showed a more favorable sensitivity (83.1%) and specificity (81.2%) profile. Similarly, a fast screener of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) for easy use in outpatient visits, an abridged 6-item versions of the popular Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI; 19-item in its original version),<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> was developed by Isidori et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> based on the Italian FSFI version. The initial validation study showed an adequate sensitivity and specificity profile (0.93 and 0.94) and good reliability, internal consistency, and retest stability.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Following up on attempts to produce a short version of the FSFI, Maseroli et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> presented an altered Italian version of the Female Sexual Dysfunction Index&#x02013;6 (FSDI-6). In this version, an item related to personal interest in having a satisfying sex life was added, whereas the item related to sexual arousal was removed. Limiting the validity of the 2 screeners is the fact that they lack more extensive and especially cross-cultural validation, because these versions were based on the Italian FSFI version without further psychometric analysis. To address these limitations, Carpenter et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> developed a psychometrically solid short version of the English-language FSFI. Results of their analysis indicated that a 9-item scale provided more information than the FSFI-6 version across a spectrum of sexual functioning. However, this brief scale needs further validation.</p><p id="p0025">Recently, former members of the FSD subcommittee of the European Society for Sexual Medicine (ESSM) acknowledged the demand for a brief screening measure of sexual problems and subsequently developed such a screener for women. The construction of the screener was largely based on methods used in previous epidemiologic research.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> In a group meeting, the former members of the ESSM FSD subcommittee developed items based on prior research evidence and clinical practice. These items were presented to the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) standards committee who, after jointly discussing and revising the items until reaching consensus about their content, sent the screener to all members of the ISSM standards committee for final approval.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p id="p0030">Simultaneously and using a similar process, a short screener for male sexual dysfunction was developed to have similar length and structure as the female screener. For the development of the Sexual Complaints Screener for Women (SCS-W), the FSD subcommittee relied on current definitions of FSD, its different domains, and key diagnostic criteria, such as presence of personal distress. In the end, 10 items were constructed, each consisting of an a-series in which the degree of the specific dysfunction is rated and a b-series in which the degree of personal distress caused by that specific dysfunction is assessed. The domains that are intended to be covered by the SCS-W are sexual desire or interest, objective and subjective arousal, orgasm, pain, vaginismus, persistent genital arousal disorder, and sexual satisfaction. Response options are rated&#x000a0;on a 5-point Likert-type scale for all items (0&#x000a0;= &#x0201c;never&#x0201d; to 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x0201c;almost all the time/always&#x0201d; for the a-series and 0&#x000a0;= &#x0201c;not at all a problem&#x0201d; to 4&#x000a0;= &#x0201c;a very great problem&#x0201d; for the b-series).</p><p id="p0035">At this stage, neither the original English nor any translated versions of the SCS-W have been tested for their psychometric properties such as reliability or validity; therefore, at this stage, no statements regarding its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in identifying patients with a potential sexual problem can be made. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity and utility of the German version of the SCS-W to be used as a routine screening instrument in daily clinical practice by assessing the content and convergent and discriminant validities of the screener in a population sample of women (N&#x000a0;= 309).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Participants</title><p id="p0040">The data used in this present study were collected within the context of a larger project looking at women's perception of male ejaculatory function. The initial study was set up in Zurich, Switzerland as a cross-sectional online survey in which self-reported data were collected using a set of validated and study-specific questionnaires. The survey took approximately 30 minutes to complete. To be included in the survey, women had to be 18 to 75 years of age and have engaged in sexual intercourse at 1 point in their lives (determined by the question, &#x0201c;Have you ever been sexually active?&#x0201d;). At the stage of recruitment, no further inclusion or exclusion criteria were imposed on the sample to maintain population representativeness. At the end of the 4-month recruitment phase, data were available on 425 participants. Because of missing values in the FSFI and the SCS-W (&#x0003e;20% of questions), 114 women were excluded from the study. Hence, the final sample included in the present study of 309 women represents 72.7% of participants who started the survey.</p><p id="p0045">The mean age of participants was 26.9 years (SD&#x000a0;= 6.6). The sample was predominantly Swiss (84.7%), with 8.44% German and 6.82% &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; nationalities (predominantly Italian, Spanish, and Austrian). Most participants had completed high school or its equivalent (73.14%), most had attended university (42.72), 64.1% were in a relationship at the point of completing the survey, and 94.8% identified themselves as heterosexual, 1.6% as homosexual, and 3.6% as bisexual.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Recruitment and Procedure</title><p id="p0050">Recruitment was achieved through word-of-mouth recommendations and by advertisements throughout universities and on various social media platforms such as Facebook. The survey started on September 1, 2014 and the online questionnaires were accessible until January 31, 2015. The survey started with a declaration of consent ensuring the subject's ethical rights in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. To consent, participants had to tick a box. Without ticking this box, they could not proceed to the online survey. In the introductory paragraph, participants also were informed about the intimate nature of the questions, that the assessment was fully anonymous and voluntary, and about their right to withdraw from the study at any time (in which case, their data collected until then would be deleted). Ethical approval was obtained by the ethics committee of the Department of Psychology at the University of Zurich (Zurich, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Measures</title><p id="p0055">The SCS-W is a sex-specific screening tool estimating female sexual complaints during the past 6 months.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The questionnaire consists of 10 items rated on a 5- to 6-point Likert-like scale. In addition to the assessment of sexual complaints, the associated perception of the complaints as a personal problem (distress) is measured. Up to this point, there have been no published surveys testing their psychometric properties and the quality of the criteria remains unknown.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p id="p0060">In addition to the SCS-W, the FSFI was used.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The FSFI is a 19-item self-report questionnaire assessing female sexual functioning in the past 4 weeks. It addresses 6 subdomains of sexual functioning including desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and sexual pain. Response options are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 5 to 6 points for the frequency and level of the 6 dimensions. The total score can be determined through a computational algorithm described by Rosen et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Higher scores indicate better sexual functioning. The questionnaire shows good psychometric properties for total scores and subscales, with internal consistencies (Cronbach &#x003b1;) of 0.89 to 0.95 and adequate test-retest reliability (r) of 0.43 to 0.86. Analyses of sensitivity and specificity yielded a score no higher than 26.55 to indicate potential FSD without it being a clinically diagnosis. It is recommended to combine the FSFI with the assessment of sexual distress.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In the present study, the validated German version was used.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Data Analysis</title><p id="p0065">Missing data (&#x0003c;20%) in the FSFI were handled using mean imputation. Convergent and discriminant validities were calculated, which are considered subcategories of construct validity. For convergent validity, we calculated Spearman bivariate correlations (r) between the single-item SCS-W domain score and the FSFI individual and total scores of the corresponding subscale (apart from persistent genital arousal in the SCS-W, which has no corresponding subscale in the FSFI). The SCS domains vaginismus and dyspareunia were correlated with the FSFI pain items and total subdomain scores, because the FSFI does not specifically discriminate between these 2 domains. Correlation coefficients ranging from 0.00 to 0.25 indicate little or no relation, those ranging from 0.25 to 0.50 suggest a fair degree of relation, those ranging from 0.50 to 0.75 are considered moderate to good, and those higher than 0.75 are considered good to excellent.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p id="p0070">To assess discriminant validity, we calculated bivariate correlations between single-item domain scores and non-corresponding FSFI subscale scores. Discriminant validity was present when an item had a significantly higher correlation with its own dimension compared with other dimensions (referred to as &#x0201c;scaling success&#x0201d;). To assess the significance of the difference between the correlation coefficients, we used Fisher r-to-z transformation.</p><p id="p0075">Because the distribution of the FSFI and SCS-W items showed significant skewness and kurtosis, statistical methods for factor analysis were chosen that do not require normality of the data. For verification of the 6-factor structure of the FSFI in our population, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted with principal component analysis (PCA) for estimation of factors.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> PCA also was conducted to establish the structure of the SCS-W. PCA is the most commonly used method of factor analysis and makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data. PCA was conducted for the FSFI (to confirm the factor structure in our sample) and the SCS-W. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was used to assess the aptitude of the questionnaire items to be included in the factor analysis. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin values higher than 0.80 were considered optimal and those lower than 0.5 were considered insufficient.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The varimax rotation method was used to rotate the axes such that the eigenvectors remain orthogonal and the different factors remain uncorrelated as they are rotated. Varimax rotation maximizes the weighted sum, reflecting a concern for simple structure within variables and within factors. Statistical criteria for item inclusion were factor loadings higher than 0.5 and low cross-factor loadings. Items loading no higher than 0.49 were excluded from the model.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p id="p0080">All analyses were conducted using STATA 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).

The availability of a short screener that can be easily administered by non-specialized clinicians is of great clinical use because it can help initiate and facilitate communication about sexual issues. In addition, epidemiologic research and studies can profit from such brief screeners especially when the assessment of sexual problems is not the primary focus of the study but could&#x02014;without much effort and time investment for the participant&#x02014;be simultaneously assessed. For this, brief but accurate instruments developed on a sound scientific basis with good psychometric properties are necessary.</p><p id="p0105">We present for the 1st time some psychometric characteristics of the SCS-W as assessed in a population sample of 309 women with a mean age of 27 years. Convergent validity of the SCS-W was assessed by correlation with the matching FSFI subdomain. Results showed that convergent validity was acceptable to excellent for all domains, with correlations ranging from 0.39 to 0.69. In other words, the theoretically matching SCS-W and FSFI subdomains do indeed correspond with one another. To demonstrate construct validity, discriminant validity also must be present so that convergent evidence can be interpreted relative to discriminant evidence. For this, the patterns of intercorrelations between the non-matching domains should be low and correlations of the matching SCS and FSFI domains should be substantially greater. Accordingly, discriminant validity of the SCS-W was assessed by exploring the correlations between the SCS-W items and the non-matching FSFI subdomains. Results showed that discriminant validity was unsatisfactory (ie, non-significant) for arousal, lubrication, and vaginismus. However, it should be noted that the domains of sexual functioning show high intercorrelations and overlap and frequently correlations of up to 0.5 have been reported. This could be a reason why analyses failed to detect solid proof of discriminant validity. For construct validity, we were successful in identifying a 6-factor structure of the original SCS-W with moderate to high standardized factor loadings and no complicated item loadings. Overall these results offer support for the factorial validity of the instrument and demonstrate that each item really does assess a different aspect of sexual functioning and therefore might be regarded a unique and independent domain.</p><p id="p0110">In summary, the SCS-W presents a useful addition to the very scarce number of brief screeners available to capture female sexual problems. With its small number of items and good psychometric properties, the SCS-W has several advantages, because it can be used in clinical settings to quickly screen women for sexual problems and/or to assess treatment outcomes, especially when time pressure precludes the use of more lengthy and extensive inventories. It also can be be conveniently included in a large-scale survey without impeding data collection. Compared with the existing, although scarcely validated, brief inventories, such as the FSFI-6 or the FSDI-6, the SCS-W has the advantage that it was developed from scratch and specifically constructed by a panel of experts, based on knowledge gained from clinical practice and prior research evidence, and is not constituted of single items taken from larger questionnaires. Whether this truly represents an advantage has to be confirmed in future studies comparing the available brief inventories and counterchecking them against the clinical FSD diagnosis.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0115">Several potential limitations to the study need to be mentioned. (i) Caution should be applied when extrapolating the findings to other population or clinical samples. The generalizability of our results could be limited because a convenience sample of volunteers, instead of a random sample of the general population, was used. Furthermore, the representativeness of our sample might be biased not only because of the relatively young mean age and the means of recruitment, which was undertaken mainly in academic university settings, but also because women who participate in studies of such sensitive nature (ie, the main study was investigating women's perception of male ejaculatory function) might show different characteristics compared with women who would not consider revealing such &#x0201c;sensitive&#x0201d; information. (ii) Available information on the psychometric properties of the German SCS-W was limited because the validity of the screener could not be counterchecked against a clinical diagnosis of FSD but relied on a comparison with FSFI scores. Furthermore, reliability could not be assessed because of a lack of follow-up data that did not allow for the measurement of test-retest reliability. Future studies should consider using samples of women with a clinically established diagnosis of FSD to allow more in-depth exploration of the psychometric properties of the SCS-W such as reliability, sensitivity, and specificity. (iii) Discriminant validity was rather low, especially for the domains of arousal, lubrication, and vaginismus. This could be due to the high inter-relatedness of the various subdomains of sexual functioning that has been demonstrated in numerous previous studies. (iv) The findings cannot be extrapolated to the original English or any other translated version of the SCS-W for which the psychometric properties need to be assessed separately.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0120">The German version of the brief screener for women's sexual problems demonstrated acceptable construct and factor validity in this population sample of 306 women and could be applied as an assessment tool for sexual problems not only in a clinical setting but also in research studies in which the main outcomes are not sexual problems. Because of the limited information that can be assessed by such a brief screener and because of good rather than excellent construct validity, it is not intended to replace a clinical diagnosis of FSD and should be seen as a support for clinicians in obtaining a quick overview about the patient's sexual health. Further utility and psychometric properties such as reliability should be investigated in greater depth in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Statement of authorship</title><p id="p0125"><list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><title>Category 1</title><list-item id="o0010"><label>(a)</label><p id="p0130">Conception and Design<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><p id="p0135">Andrea Burri</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>(b)</label><p id="p0140">Acquisition of Data<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0015"><list-item id="u0015"><p id="p0145">Andrea Burri</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item id="o0020"><label>(c)</label><p id="p0150">Analysis and Interpretation of Data<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0020"><list-item id="u0020"><p id="p0155">Andrea Burri</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list><list list-type="simple" id="olist0015"><title>Category 2</title><list-item id="o0025"><label>(a)</label><p id="p0160">Drafting the Article<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0025"><list-item id="u0025"><p id="p0165">Andrea Burri</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item id="o0030"><label>(b)</label><p id="p0170">Revising It for Intellectual Content<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0030"><list-item id="u0030"><p id="p0175">Andrea Burri; Hartmut Porst</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0180">Category 3<list list-type="simple" id="olist0020"><list-item id="o0035"><label>(a)</label><p id="p0185">Final Approval of the Completed Article<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0035"><list-item id="u0035"><p id="p0190">Andrea Burri; Hartmut Porst</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kriston</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>G&#x000fb;nzler</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rohde</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is one question enough to detect female sexual dysfunctions?
