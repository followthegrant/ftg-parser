Several hundred thousand of these infections, especially in children, progress to a life-threatening disease known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Dengue has emerged in many regions of the world and the number of cases and the range of the virus continue to increase every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>).</p><p>The DENV complex consists of 4 distinct serotypes, designated DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. Infection with 1 DENV serotype is believed to provide long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Thus, persons can be infected with multiple serotypes during their lifetime. People with a repeat (secondary) DENV infection have a greater risk for DHF than persons infected for the first time, indicating that preexisting serotype cross-reactive immunity is a risk factor for severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Furthermore, all 4 serotypes of DENV can cause DHF, but within each serotype some genotypes or clades within genotypes are linked to severe disease and others to mild disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>).</p><p>Factors driving global emergence of dengue fever (DF) and DHF are complex and include viral and host factors as well as environmental changes that favor transmission. The epidemiology of dengue in Sri Lanka is particularly interesting because before 1989 all 4 serotypes were present and many repeat infections occurred, but few cases of DHF were documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Incidence of DHF dramatically increased in 1989, and hundreds to thousands of cases of DHF have been documented every year since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Genetic studies with DENV-3 strains from Sri Lanka demonstrated that viruses isolated before and after emergence of DHF belonged to 2 distinct clades (DENV-3, genotype IIIA and IIIB, respectively), indicating that DENV-3 strain differences are likely to have contributed to emergence of DHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>).</p><p>The magnitude of DF and DHF epidemics in Sri Lanka has continued to increase; 2 of the largest epidemics occurred in 2002 and 2004. We report results from dengue surveillance and virologic studies conducted during 2003&#x02013;2006 in Sri Lanka. We also compare recent (2003&#x02013;2006) and past (1981&#x02013;1997) surveillance data and virus isolates to better understand factors driving emergence of severe disease in Sri Lanka.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Sample Collection</title><p>Genetech Molecular Diagnostics Institute in Colombo, Sri Lanka, receives diagnostic specimens for dengue testing from clinics and hospitals in Colombo.

National data reported in this article are based on cases reported to the Central Epidemiology Unit. A special investigation form for collection of detailed information is sent out by the Central Epidemiology Unit for each reported case of DF or DHF to the reporting health office and the treating hospital.

For DENV-3, we amplified a 1,057-bp segment encompassing part of the capsid (C) protein, the premembrane (preM) protein, and part of the E protein by using primers D3F 132&#x02013;159 (5&#x02032;- TCAATATGCTGAAACGCGTGAGAAACCG-3&#x02032;) and D3R 1189&#x02013;1171 (5&#x02032;- CTCCTCAGGCAAAACCGCT-3&#x02032;).

The number of samples tested ranged from 212 in 2003 to 1,686 in 2004 when Sri Lanka had a large DHF epidemic. Of the 3,833 samples, 930 (24%) were positive by PCR for DENV. On an annual basis, the proportion of positive samples was 39% in 2003, 22% in 2004, 18% in 2005, and 32% in 2006.</p><sec><title>Comparison of Dengue Data Collected at Genetech with Nationally Reported Data</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A, shows dengue cases reported to the Ministry of Health in Sri Lanka during 1980&#x02013;2005. Cases reported before 1996 are based on passive surveillance and outbreak investigations conducted by the Ministry of Health. DF and DHF were designated as reportable diseases in 1996, and data obtained since 1996 are based on mandatory reporting. Although DENVs were common in Sri Lanka and persons there were exposed to multiple infections, severe disease was rare before 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). The 1990s were characterized by small but regular epidemics of severe disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). In the period since 2000, the magnitude of the epidemics has increased further; particularly large epidemics occurred in 2002 and 2004 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A) Dengue cases reported to the Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka (1981&#x02013;2005).

Because dengue is a reportable disease in Sri Lanka, physicians are expected to report cases to the Ministry of Health. We compared monthly dengue data reported to the Ministry of Health from Colombo and data collected at Genetech during January 2003&#x02013;April 2006. Data from Genetech closely mirrored cases reported to the Ministry of Health, indicating that the laboratory at Genetech can serve as a sentinel site for monitoring DENV activity in the Colombo region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel B). The peak number of cases observed at Genetech preceded reported peaks by &#x02248;1 month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel B); these cases from 2 sources were significantly correlated (correlation coefficient&#x000a0;0.80).</p></sec><sec><title>Circulating Dengue Serotypes</title><p>Of 930 PCR-positive samples collected during 2003&#x02013;2006, we serotyped 605 samples by nested PCR. DENV serotypes 2 (40%) and type 3 (46%) were common, and serotypes 1 (7%) and 4 (7%) were rare. We examined the relative abundance of each serotype at monthly intervals during October 2003&#x02013;September 2006 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). DENV-2 and DENV-3 were the dominant serotypes throughout the study period. DENV-1 and DENV-4 were also regularly isolated but in low numbers. All 4 serotypes were detected in 2004 and 2006. In 2005, DENV activity was low and DENV-1 was not identified in samples. These results demonstrate that although all 4 serotypes cocirculate in Sri Lanka, DENV serotypes 2 and 3 are primarily responsible for clinically apparent cases.</p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Relative abundance of dengue (DEN) virus serotypes in Sri Lanka.

The peak of disease in adults was surprising because previous studies indicated that dengue transmission in Colombo was high and most adults were likely to be immune to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). To further evaluate the peak of disease observed in young adults, we examined the age distribution of case-patients reported to the Ministry of Health during 1996&#x02013;2006. These data showed a striking change in age distribution of dengue case-patients over this 11-year period (<xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD2">Technical Appendix</xref>). Before 2000, one large peak of cases was observed in children and few cases were observed for adults. After 2000, two peaks of reported disease were observed for children and young adults.

The C6/36 mosquito cell line was inoculated by using serum samples from 220 samples that were positive by PCR for DENV. Virus was isolated from 181/220 specimens. The 181 isolates consisted of 18 DENV-1 strains, 76 DENV-2 strains, 64 DENV-3 strains, and 23 DENV-4 strains. To identify DENV genotypes that have been circulating in this country over the past 3 decades, we sequenced representative isolates from 2003 and 2004, as well as other isolates from Sri Lanka in our collection. All virus strains and sequences used for this analysis are listed in the <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix Table</xref>.

As demonstrated previously by our group, DENV-3 genotype III consists of pre (IIIA)&#x02013; and post (IIIB)&#x02013;1989 clades from Sri Lanka, as well as Latin American and East African clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). The DENV-3 strains from Sri Lanka isolated in 2003 and 2004 form a new, distinct clade that is closely related but distinct from the DENV-3 clade IIIB viruses that were isolated in the 1990s. This new 2003&#x02013;2004 clade includes an isolate from 1993, which strongly suggests that the clade is derived from strains that have been on the island for some time.</p><fig id="F6" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Phylogram of dengue serotype 3 (DENV-3) genotype III viruses from Sri Lanka (SL), 1981&#x02013;2004, and other DENV-3 genotype III viruses.

Over the past 2 decades, the epidemiology of dengue has changed and regular epidemics of DF and DHF have been reported in Sri Lanka, India, the Maldive Islands, Bangladesh, and Pakistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). We need a better understanding of the epidemiology of dengue in this region to develop and implement effective control programs and to most effectively use dengue vaccines that are currently in clinical trials.</p><p>We have investigated the emergence of DHF in Sri Lanka by analyzing samples sent for diagnostic testing to the Genetech Research Institute in Colombo. This institute received 3,833 samples for testing during 2003&#x02013;2006. On an annual basis, the proportion of samples positive for dengue was 39% in 2003, 22% in 2004, 18% in 2005, and 32% in 2006. The low proportion of positive samples in 2004 and 2005 compared with other years was unexpected because one would expect a greater proportion of positive cases during an epidemic year such as 2004. During the 2004 epidemic, there was widespread fear of dengue, and indiscriminate testing of fever cases is likely to have led to the overall lower proportion of positive cases.</p><p>We have demonstrated that all 4 serotypes cocirculate in Sri Lanka and were responsible for clinically apparent cases detected during 2003&#x02013;2006. DENV types 2 and 3 were responsible for most human cases; types 1 and 4 were relatively rare. DENV types 2 and 3 native to the region may be more pathogenic than the other serotypes and thus may be recovered more frequently during human surveillance.</p><p>Viruses isolated during 1978&#x02013;2004 were sequenced to understand the origin and evolution of DENV in Sri Lanka. For DENV-1, isolates obtained in Sri Lanka in the 1980s belong to the South Pacific genotype, whereas more recent isolates belong to the American/African genotype. These results indicate that the South Pacific genotype of DENV-1 was replaced after a new introduction of the American/African genotype of DENV-1. All DENV-2 isolates from Sri Lanka belong to a single (Indian subcontinent/ Malaysian) genotype. There is no evidence for introduction of DENV-2 from other areas because DENV-2 strains from Sri Lanka were more related to one another than to any other strain used in this analysis. All DENV-3 strains from Sri Lanka belonged to genotype III. However, in 1989 and again in 2000, the dominant clade of DENV-3 genotype III was replaced by a new clade of genotype III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). In 1989, the lineage replacement was most likely caused by the introduction of DENV-3 from outside Sri Lanka. In 2000, the dominant lineage of DENV-3 was replaced by a previously rare lineage from Sri Lanka. The oldest (1978) and most recent isolates of DENV-4 belong to the Southeast Asian genotype, which indicates that this genotype is established on the island.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking feature of the epidemiology of dengue in Sri Lanka is the abrupt, stepwise increase in the number of severe disease cases in 1989 and again in 2000. In previous studies, we have highlighted the potential role of a shift in the circulating clade of DENV-3 from genotype IIIA to IIIB in this sudden emergence of severe disease in 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). Recent studies have also demonstrated that DENV-3 clade IIIB viruses replicate and disseminate better in the vector than clade IIIA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>). This finding may explain the explosive spread of IIIB and closely related viruses within the region as well as into Latin America. The stepwise increase in cases after 2000 was accompanied by appearance of another clade of DENV-3 genotype III viruses that have replaced the clade IIIB viruses. Thus, evolution within DENV-3 genotype III continues to be linked to changes in disease severity in Sri Lanka. A similar phenomenon has also been reported by Bennett et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref><italic>,</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). They compared data for 20 years from Puerto Rico for DENV-2 and DENV-4 and observed replacement of dominant clades by a previously rare lineage in the population or by viruses introduced from outside Puerto Rico. Clade replacement was linked to positive selection in the NS2A gene for DENV-4 and the E gene for DENV-2. Further studies are needed to assess if mutations in specific genes are also linked to emergence of new clades of DENV-3 in Sri Lanka.</p><p>When analyzing data collected at Genetech during 2003&#x02013;2006, we observed a peak of dengue in young adults (20&#x02013;30 years of age). Analysis of national data collected during 1996&#x02013;2005 demonstrated that the disease peak in adults is a recent phenomenon and occurred after 2000. In areas with high transmission, where the virus has been historically established, most adults are likely to be immune because of childhood infections. The changing age structure may be indicative of the virus moving into new areas with many susceptible adults. During the large epidemics that occurred after 2000, many cases were reported from regions of the country where few cases have been reported (Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health, unpub. data). To better understand the molecular epidemiology and changing age distribution of dengue in Sri Lanka, laboratory-supported, population-based, active surveillance studies are needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Appendix Table</title><p>DENV sequences used to construct phylogenetic trees*</p></caption><media xlink:href="08-0926_appT-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="N0x1c67d50N0x3b90440" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Technical Appendix</title><p>Severe Dengue Epidemics in Sri Lanka, 2003-2006</p></caption><media xlink:href="08-0926_Techapp-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="N0x1c67d50N0x3b90500" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="citation"><p><italic>Suggested citation for this article</italic>: Kanakaratne N, Wahala WMPB, Messer WB, Tissera HA, Shahani A, Abeysinghe N, et al.
