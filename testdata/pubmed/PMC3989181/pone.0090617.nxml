These data suggest generalization of a protocol similar to our recent clinical trial with NAC in blast-induced mTBI in a battlefield setting <xref rid="pone.0090617-Hoffer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, to mild concussion from blunt trauma. This study used both weight drop in mice and fluid percussion injury in rats. These were chosen to simulate either mild or moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). For mice, we used novel object recognition and the Y maze. For rats, we used the Morris water maze. NAC was administered beginning 30&#x02013;60 minutes after injury. Behavioral deficits due to injury in both species were significantly reversed by NAC treatment. We thus conclude NAC produces significant behavioral recovery after injury. Future preclinical studies are needed to define the mechanism of action, perhaps leading to more effective therapies in man.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by the Lincoln Master Clinician in Neurosurgery Award to JM, [USPHS grant #NS070825]; and the National Science Council of Taiwan [#NSC98-2314-B-038-011-MY3], [NSC101-2321-B-038-005].

Many survivors experience prolonged or even permanent neurocognitive dysfunction, with lasting changes in cognition, motor function, and personality <xref rid="pone.0090617-Comper1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A conservative estimate is that 3.2 million Americans, or 1.5% of the population, currently live with long-term disabilities after TBI, and these disabilities are estimated to cost $9.2 billion in lifetime medical costs and $51.2 billion in productivity losses <xref rid="pone.0090617-RutlandBrown1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The pathophysiology of TBI is divided into primary and secondary injury processes. Primary injury refers to the direct physical trauma to the brain from impact force or penetrating injury. Secondary injury involves a cascade of molecular mechanisms that are initiated at the time of trauma and evolves in the hours and days after the traumatic event. These mechanisms include glutamatergic excitotoxicity, free-radical injury to cell membranes, electrolyte imbalances, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and secondary ischemia from vasospasm <xref rid="pone.0090617-Yi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090617-MorgantiKossmann1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090617-Farkas1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090617-Lenzlinger1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Since these processes are believed to be partially responsible for the progressive neurological impairment after TBI, the development of effective therapeutic strategies capable of arresting secondary injury-induced damage has become a focus of intense research activity over the last two decades, both in clinical and preclinical settings.</p><p>
<italic>N</italic>-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is the active agent in Mucomyst, a US Food and Drug Administration approved medication with a forty-year safety history. There is also literature on NAC as a neuroprotective agent in preclinical models of central and peripheral nervous injury. NAC has been shown to have antioxidant and neurovascular-protective effects after TBI <xref rid="pone.0090617-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090617-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090617-Hicdonmez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. When combined with minocycline, NAC treatment following controlled cortical impact (CCI) increased levels of anti-inflammatory M2 microglia in white matter tracts <xref rid="pone.0090617-Bergold1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Such studies however, have been primarily at the biochemical and cellular levels, rather than focusing on behavioral parameters.</p><p>We recently conducted, in an active theatre of war, a study demonstrating that NAC, in addition to standard symptomatic therapy, has beneficial effects on the severity and resolution of auditory, vestibular and cognitive function sequelae after blast induced mild TBI (mTBI) in military personnel <xref rid="pone.0090617-Hoffer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In this paper, we sought to determine the efficacy of NAC in two different rodent models of TBI to determine the generality of any effects and allow for future mechanistic studies. The studies were organized first to examine the efficacy of NAC in blunt trauma, to study the potential for transitioning NAC. In order to further study this potential, in the second group of animals, NAC was combined with topiramate. The rationale for this is the fact that in any future human clinical trial with NAC a standard of care for headache could not be withheld irrespective of how the experimental protocol is organized. Behavioral parameters of learning and memory were used as end points to correlate with the clinical trial of NAC in theater cited above. We used a weight drop (WD) protocol in mice and a midline fluid percussion injury (FPI) protocol in rats. The WD protocol models &#x0201c;mild&#x0201d; TBI (mTBI) where there is little evidence for gross anatomical disruption of brain tissue whereas the FPI protocol simulates &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; TBI. In the article by Hoffer <xref rid="pone.0090617-Hoffer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> it was reported that NAC treatment was supplemented, in some patients, with standard treatment with topiramate, a non-narcotic medication used to treat post-traumatic headache symptomatically. Hence, we added treatment with topiramate concurrently with NAC in the mouse study of closed head concussion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experiment 1: Fluid Percussion Injury in rats</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis, IN) weighing between 350 and 400 grams were used.

All rats were surgically prepared for midline FPI. The animals were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: Sham (<italic>n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;</italic>9), TBI (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9), or TBI-NAC (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8). Under 2% isoflurane anesthesia, a 4.8 mm diameter burr hole was performed midline between the coronal and lambdoid sutures, and a Luer-Loc hub was affixed to the perimeter of the burr hole using cyanoacrylate. Dental acrylic and two small nickel-plated screws were used to anchor a hub to the skull. Twenty-four hours later, at the time of injury, the rats were anesthetized, the surgical site was exposed, and the animals were connected to the injury device. The force of the injury administered was between 1.82&#x02013;1.95 atmospheres of pressure (atm) which correlates to a moderate degree of injury. Sham animals were connected to the injury device but no injury was delivered. NSAIDs were used for postoperative analgesia.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Materials and Drug Treatment</title><p>NAC (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis MO) was dissolved in 0.9% sterile saline and the pH was adjusted to 7.2 using hydrochloric acid.

<italic>Morris water maze - Hidden Platform</italic>. Spatial learning and memory was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) task on post injury days (PID) 10&#x02013;14. The protocol for hidden platform testing has been described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0090617-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Briefly, a circular tank 180 cm in diameter, 45 cm in height, was filled with water maintained between 25&#x02013;28&#x000b0;C. Maze performance and video tracking for each animal was measured using EthoVision XT 8.5 (Noldus Information Technology Inc., Leesburg, VA). The goal of the task is to locate a hidden submerged platform that is 15 cm in diameter located 2 cm below the surface of the water. The location of the platform was fixed across all the trials during hidden platform testing. Distinct visual cues on the walls of the maze room, which remained constant across all trials, provided spatial references to assist the animals in locating the hidden platform. Rats were tested for four trials per day over four days on PID 10&#x02013;13. In each trial, the rat was placed into the water from one of four cardinal directions in a pseudorandom order and allowed up to 120 seconds to locate the platform. If the animal did not locate the platform within 120 seconds, they were gently guided to it by the experimenter. All animals were allowed to remain on the platform for 30 seconds before being removed from the tank and placed in a heated incubator for 10 minutes until the next trial.</p><p>
<italic>Morris water maze &#x02013; Probe Trial</italic>. A probe trial was performed 24 hours after the last day of hidden platform testing, on PID 14. Each animal was allowed to swim for 30 seconds in the pool with the platform removed to determine the number of times the animal crossed the platform zone, defined as 2&#x000d7; the diameter of the platform (i.e., 30 cm diameter, or an additional 7.5 cm radius beyond the platform perimeter).</p><p>
<italic>Morris water maze- Visible Platform</italic>. A visible platform test was performed immediately following the probe trial, on PID 14. The water level was lowered in the tank so that the platform surface was 1.5 cm above water level. The animal was allowed to swim for 60 seconds in the pool to locate the platform. After the platform was located, the animal was allowed to remain on the platform for 30 seconds. If the animal did not locate the platform within 60 seconds, it was gently guided to it by the experimenter and then allowed to remain for 30 seconds. A second trial was immediately conducted, and the latency to reach the platform was measured as a test for visual acuity and swim strength.</p></sec><sec id="s2a5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using IBM, SPSS Statistics 20. Student's t-test was used to compare the duration of the suppression of the righting reflex between the two injured groups. One-way or repeated-measures ANOVA were used to determine overall groups differences during MWM testing. Fisher's LSD post hoc test was used where appropriate. A p-value of 0.05 or less was defined as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Experiment 2: Weight Drop in Mice</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male ICR mice (6&#x02013;8 weeks age and 30&#x02013;40 g weight) were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (HSD Jerusalem), Israel, and thereafter bred and raised within the vivarium. Animals were housed 3&#x02013;5 per cage with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water on a 12 hour light/dark cycle at 22&#x000b1;1&#x000b0;C. All experimental manipulations were undertaken during the light phase of the cycle. Experimental procedures and housing conditions were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tel Aviv University (M-10-030), and in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. A minimum number of animals were used and all efforts were made to minimize potential suffering. Each animal was used for only one experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Weight Drop Injury</title><p>On the day of injury, mice were randomly assigned to one of 4 treatment groups, Sham-Vehicle (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9), Sham-Drug (NAC + topiramate; <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6), TBI-Vehicle (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9), or TBI-Drug (NAC + topiramate; <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8) groups. Animals were anesthetized lightly with isoflurane and then placed under the weight drop device. This device consists of a cylindrical 30 g weight with a rounded tip which is dropped through a vertical metal guide tube (13 mm in diameter and 80 cm long). Each mouse was placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a molded foam pad with the right temporal region, between the corner of the eye and the ear, directly under the guide tube. TBI was produced by releasing the weight from the top of the tube onto the scalp. The foam pad used to support the head of the mouse allowed some anterior/posterior motion in the absence of any rotational head movement <xref rid="pone.0090617-Milman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090617-Zohar1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Sham-injured mice underwent identical treatment but no weight was dropped.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>Materials and Drug Treatment</title><p>NAC (Sigma Aldrich Israel Ltd., Rehovot, Israel) was prepared as a suspension in sterile 0.9% saline at a concentration of 100 mg/10 ml and pH adjusted to 7.2. Topiramate (Sigma Aldrich Israel Ltd., Rehovot, Israel) was prepared as a suspension in 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; vehicle), to provide final concentration of 30 mg/10 ml. Both drugs were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in a volume of 0.1 ml/10 g body weight. Thus, the dose after NAC was 100 mg/kg and for topiramate was 30 mg/kg. These doses were chosen to parallel the doses used in the clinical trial in human blast trauma <xref rid="pone.0090617-Hoffer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. One hour after injury or sham-injury, animals were treated with single doses of either Vehicle (DMSO) or Drug (NAC + topiramate).</p></sec><sec id="s2b4"><title>Cognitive Assessment</title><p>At 7 and 30 days after WD or sham-injury, animals were assessed using two behavioral tests: novel object recognition (NOR) and the Y maze.</p><p>
<italic>Novel Object Recognition.</italic> An object recognition task was used to assess recognition memory <xref rid="pone.0090617-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Mice were individually habituated to an open field box (59&#x000d7;59&#x000d7;20 cm) for 5 minutes, 24 hours before the test. During the acquisition phase, two identical objects (A and B), which were sufficiently heavy and high to ensure that mice could neither move nor climb over them, were placed in a symmetric position within the chamber. Each animal was then placed in the box and allowed to explore the objects for 5 minutes. Twenty-four hours after the acquisition phase, one object (A or B randomly) was substituted for a novel one (C) and exploratory behavior was again evaluated for 5 minutes. The open field box and all objects were thoroughly cleansed using 70% ethanol between sessions to preclude odor recognition. Exploration of an object was characterized as rearing on it or sniffing it at a distance of less than 2 cm and/or touching it with the nose. Successful recognition was revealed by preferential exploration of the novel object <xref rid="pone.0090617-Baratz1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Discrimination of visual novelty was assessed by a preference index <xref rid="pone.0090617-Dix1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, determined as: (time near the new - time near the old object)/(time near the new + time near the old object).</p><p>
<italic>Y maze paradigm.</italic> The Y maze test was used to assess spatial memory <xref rid="pone.0090617-Baratz1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This task takes advantage of the preference of rodents to explore novel rather than familiar places. The Y maze was constructed of black Perspex and comprised of three arms (8&#x000d7;30&#x000d7;15 cm at an angle of 120&#x000b0; from the others), each distinguished by the presence of a different visual cue (triangle, square, or circle). One arm was randomly selected as the &#x02018;start&#x02019; arm and this remained constant for each animal on both trials. During the initial trial, of 5 minutes duration, one of the two remaining arms was randomly selected to be closed off whereas on the second trial, of 2 minutes duration, both arms were open. These trials were separated by a 2-minute inter-trial interval, during which time the mouse was returned to its home cage and the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol. The time spent in each of the arms was quantified. Discrimination of spatial novelty was assessed by a preference index <xref rid="pone.0090617-Dix1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> determined as: (time in the new-time in the old arm)/(time in the new + time in the old arm).</p></sec><sec id="s2b5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All results are presented as mean &#x000b1; <italic>SEM</italic> and were analyzed with SPSS 15 software (Genius Systems, Petah Tikva, Israel).

These data suggest generalization of a protocol similar to our recent clinical trial with NAC in blast-induced mTBI in a battlefield setting <xref rid="pone.0090617-Hoffer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, to mild concussion from blunt impact trauma. The use of different models in the two rodent species are predicated on both conceptual and technical reasons. Conceptually, the weight drop and FPI models span the range of mild-moderate TBI. Moreover, mice swim much more poorly than rats, and the weights needed to injure the rat brain are an order of magnitude greater than for mice. These larger weights frequently elicit skull fractures.</p><p>These data augment a growing clinical and basic research literature on the efficacy of NAC in early treatment following mild TBI. The present study was designed to parallel a protocol used with blast mTBI in a combat setting, which included early symptomatic treatment (e.g., topiramate for headache) and NAC. The outcomes with both the rat fluid percussion model and the mouse weight drop model are consistent with the neuroprotective efficacy observed by others following a single dose of NAC in ameliorating biochemical and histological endpoints in a rat weight drop model <xref rid="pone.0090617-Hicdonmez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and of multiple doses in ameliorating inflammatory sequelae in an open skull dural impact rat model <xref rid="pone.0090617-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

Thus, NAC likely works on a number of levels - and clearly has antioxidant activity itself. However, it also acts as a precursor for glutathione (GSH); which is a tripeptide derived by linking the amine group of cysteine to a glycine and to the carboxyl group of the glutamate side-chain. GSH is an important intracellular antioxidant, that prevents damage caused by reactive oxygen species. GSH is synthesized within its target cells from the amino acids, L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid and glycine. Importantly, it is the sulfhydryl (thiol) group (SH) of cysteine that serves as a proton donor and is thus responsible for the antioxidant activity of glutathione. It is cysteine that is the rate-limiting factor in cellular GSH synthesis, as this amino acid is relatively rare in foods. The cellular bases for memory and regulation of motivation associated with the nucleus accumbens may also be improved via NAC-induced neuronal activation of cysteine-glutamate exchange, augmented by indirect effects of NAC on metabolic glutamate receptors, mGluR2/3 and mGluR5, as reported for amelioration of cocaine-induced disruption of memory and regulation of motivation in rodents <xref rid="pone.0090617-Moussawi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

However, the relative impermeability of the normal blood-brain barrier to NAC <xref rid="pone.0090617-GilgunSherki1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> implies that local CNS bioavailability would be a natural consequence of intracranial vascular disruption in mTBI, either acutely during vascular remodeling after injury <xref rid="pone.0090617-Rubovitch1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> or a delayed leakiness of the blood-brain barrier from neuroinflammatory processes <xref rid="pone.0090617-Rubovitch1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090617-DeVries1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

In addition, recent studies by Acosta et al <xref rid="pone.0090617-Acosta1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> suggest that neuroinflammation associated with traumatic brain injury may suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, with in turn, may underlie some of the cognitive deficits seen in this disorder. The improved clinical outcomes after early NAC treatment for blast TBI <xref rid="pone.0090617-Hoffer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> are consistent with the hypothesis that vascular effects of TBI facilitate selective delivery of NAC to affected sites.</p><p>In summary, this paper documents the efficacy of NAC in reversing or preventing cognitive abnormalities in rodent models of mild to moderate TBI. Future preclinical studies are needed to further define the mechanism of action, leading to more effective therapies in man. We also can now begin to consider clinical work in a human model since the current set of experiments attempted to approximate considerations needed in a clinical study by utilizing and accepted standard of care in the animals in experiment two.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0090617-Hoffer1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
