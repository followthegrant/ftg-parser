In South Africa medical scheme members pay higher out-of-pocket payments for medicines than those without insurance.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aim</title><p>This study explored reasons for co-payments among insured Pretoria medical scheme members purchasing prescription medicines at private retail pharmacies, despite being insured and protected against such payments.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Setting</title><p>The study took place in retail pharmacies in Pretoria, Gauteng Province, South Africa.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Methods</title><p>An exploratory qualitative study was performed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among purposefully sampled medical scheme members (12) and nine key informants (six pharmacists and three regulators &#x02013; one for the pharmaceutical industry, one for medical schemes and one for pharmacists). Three pharmacies (two corporate and one independent) each were identified from high and low socio-economic areas. Scheme members were interviewed immediately after having made a co-payment (eight) or no co-payment (four) from the selected pharmacies. Interviews were recorded, coded and organised into themes.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Results</title><p>Co-payments were deemed confusing, unpredictable and inconsistent between and within pharmacies. Members blamed schemes for causing co-payments. Six sampled pharmacies rarely stocked the lowest-priced medicines; instead, they dispensed medicines from manufacturers with whom they had a relationship. Corporate pharmacies were favoured compared to independents and brand loyalty superseded cost considerations. Medical scheme members did not understand how medical schemes&#x02019; function.</p></sec><sec id="st6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Unavailability of lowest-priced medicines at pharmacies contributes to co-payments. Consumer education about generics and expedited implementation of National Health Insurance could significantly reduce co-payments.</p></sec><sec id="st7"><title>Keywords</title><p>co-payments; high socio-economic; low socio-economic; medical scheme; medicines pricing policy; National Health Insurance; pharmacist; prescribed minimum benefit; retail pharmacy; regulator.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the United States (US), high healthcare expenditure is observed in private sector settings and rapid growth in cost is observed in prescription medicines and administrative costs of private health insurance.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Similarly, in South Africa, insured medical scheme members incur high co-payments for services offered in private sector facilities.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Existing and proposed legislation in the country, such as the <italic>Medicines and Related Substances Act 101 of 1965, Pharmacy Act 53 of 1974, Medical Schemes Act 131 of 1998</italic> and National Health Insurance Policy, collectively aim to offer consumers transparency in the pricing of medicines, the right of access to cheaper prescription medicines and protection from financial ruin because of healthcare costs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Realisation of positive outcomes intended by introducing these policies is only possible if consumers are fully informed about available options, to minimise co-payments, by health professionals responsible for the prescribing and dispensing of medicines.</p><p>The <italic>Medical Schemes Act</italic>, for example, compels medical schemes to offer full reimbursement for formulary medicines used to treat medical conditions listed on the prescribed minimum benefit (PMB) schedule.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, the benefit packages of medical scheme organisations differ, thus making it necessary for each registered member to understand the terms and conditions of coverage offered to them. To qualify for full financial coverage members are expected to purchase medicines that appear on the formulary list; otherwise they incur co-payments. Those not adhering to this requirement become liable for additional costs such as co-payments, especially if services rendered cost more than the scheme&#x02019;s reimbursement threshold.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Other medical schemes allocate funds into their member&#x02019;s savings account to cater for costs such as physician consultations and medicines. These funds represent a member&#x02019;s share of the maximum allowable expenditure towards costs such as prescription medicines. When funds are depleted, the member pays cash out-of-pocket (OOP) and this happens even when membership monthly contributions continue to be debited by the medical scheme.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Generally, health insurance organisations introduce co-payments and formularies as measures aimed at controlling high expenditure on prescription medicines; however, in the USA, some members enrolled in these medical schemes believe that these measures are designed to save money for health insurance companies and their subsidiaries.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>In 2015, the annual average increase in member contributions in South Africa was reported to be 9.2%, almost double Consumer Price Index (CPI) (4.6%) at the time.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Harris et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> suggested that being medically insured in South Africa is linked to financial ruin. For example, it was reported that in 2005 spending per private medical scheme member was ninefold higher than public sector expenditure.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Ataguba et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> conducted a study in South Africa to assess the extent to which medical scheme membership led to an increase or reduction in OOP payments. The study concluded that medical scheme members paid higher healthcare charges than non-members and proposed the speedy implementation of the planned National Health Insurance.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, the study did not explore factors affecting co-payments from the perspective of insured medical scheme members. The aim of this study was therefore to explore views about co-payments and identify factors that influenced Pretoria medical scheme members to co-pay when purchasing prescription medicines at pharmacies, despite already being insured by medical scheme insurance organisations.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Methods</title><p>An exploratory qualitative study was conducted at community pharmacies in South Africa&#x02019;s capital city, Pretoria. A purposive sample comprising 12 medical scheme members and nine key informants (KIs) was selected (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The KIs included six pharmacists and three regulators &#x02013; one for pharmacists, one for medical schemes and one for the pharmaceutical industry. One of the regulators had extensive experience both as a pharmaceutical industry regulator and a representative of medical schemes. Medical scheme members and pharmacists were interviewed at the premises of six purposively sampled private community pharmacies &#x02013; three pharmacies each (two corporate and one independent) were identified from high and low socio-economic areas; and the other KIs were interviewed at their workplaces. Medical scheme members provided insights and understanding of factors that have an influence on co-payments for medicines from their personal experiences. The role of KIs was to provide views about co-payments in relation to existing medicine policies, dispensing practices and any known consumer-related experiences at South African private sector retail pharmacies. The interviews of medical scheme members were much shorter (10&#x02013;30 min) than those of KIs (46&#x02013;90 min). Interviews were recorded using a recording device and interview notes were captured in a diary during, and immediately after, each interview. Codes identified from recordings and interview notes were transformed into organised text for theme development.</p><table-wrap id="T0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Profile of interviewees and interview locations.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High socio-economic location</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low socio-economic location</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><bold>A: Medical scheme members (12)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Corporate pharmacies</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KER_M12 Co-payer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LES_M11 Co-payer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NEL_M4 Co-payer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EST_M10 Co-payer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DUM_M8 Non-co-payer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MAL_ Non-co-payer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Independent pharmacies</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BAB_M9 Co-payer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MOR_M5 Co-payer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FUT_M3 Co-payer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DIR_ M1 Co-payer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MAN_M6 Non-co-payer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FRI_M7 Non-co-payer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><bold>B: Pharmacists (6)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Corporate pharmacies</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VER_P6 Pharmacist</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SUN_P3 Pharmacist</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DIS_P2 Pharmacist</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KAL_P4 Pharmacist</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Independent pharmacies</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CRO_P5 Pharmacist</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KEM_P1 Pharmacist</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><bold>C: Regulators (3)</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Regulator 1</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Pharmacists&#x02019; regulator</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Regulator 2</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Medical schemes&#x02019; regulator</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Regulator 3</td><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Medical schemes&#x02019; representative and former regulator of medicines</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s20003"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical clearance was granted by the University of the Western Cape Senate Research Committee (Registration No. 15/7/8).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Results</title><p>Ten themes were identified to represent interviewee views about co-payments, as well as purchasing behaviour and perceptions that result in OOP payments, and they are presented in the following section.</p><sec id="s20005"><title>Feelings and views about co-payments</title><p>Pharmacists and medical scheme members were confused by the unpredictability and inconsistencies in co-payment charges:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I noticed that prices are different at different pharmacies.

Manufacturers sponsor us financially with staff training and conferences and you can imagine when this happens you have to be loyal to the manufacturer.&#x02019; (VER_P6, male, pharmacist at a corporate pharmacy located in a high-income area)</p></disp-quote><p>The profitability of the pharmacy business and relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers are prioritised by dispensing pharmacists, and the purchaser position appears to be rarely considered.</p></sec><sec id="s20015"><title>The effect of brand loyalty</title><p>Pharmacists suggested that familiarity with a specific brand resulted in patients being loyal to particular brands:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x02018;When the scheme introduces a new cheaper medicine on the formulary list, then you find patients wanting to stick to what they are used to, which they call the original.

If a patient feels comfortable with a medicine, they do not understand why they should be changed to another medicine. They co-pay if they don&#x02019;t change.&#x02019; (KAL_P4, male, pharmacist at a corporate pharmacy located in a low-income area)</p></disp-quote><p>Because patients sometimes preferred to use specific medicines, these are demanded at pharmacies. In response, because pharmacists focus more on profitability they tend to avoid providing explanations about the financial advantages of changing to lower-cost treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0016"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results revealed that almost all interviewed medical scheme members and dispensing pharmacists, regardless of socio-economic status, were confused by co-payment practices. While medical scheme members believed themselves to have no recourse except to pay if charged a co-payment, pharmacies simply added the scheme&#x02019;s unpaid shortfall amount onto the member&#x02019;s invoice. The amount later gets paid OOP as a co-payment to the pharmacy. Such an arrangement results in the scheme saving money, the pharmacy generating income and the consumer being the only stakeholder in the chain remaining without much benefit in the process.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The findings also revealed that among stakeholders involved in the medicine purchasing process, the medical scheme member is the only one unable to enjoy full protection of their interests.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Overall, co-payments appeared to be outcomes of an interplay between a number of factors, which included the following: profit-oriented stakeholders within the pharmaceutical supply chain; relationships between some stakeholders, excluding the purchaser; negative consumer perceptions about generics and low-priced medicines; purchaser&#x02019;s loyalty to certain brands of medicines; perceptions about availability of certain services and medicine stock at different types of pharmacies (corporate or chain pharmacies vs. independent pharmacies); fear of the patient to override the prescribing doctor&#x02019;s choice of prescription medicine; lack of active monitoring of the use of unintelligible language during communication of financial information between medical schemes and their members; absence of incentives for pharmacies to dispense the lowest-priced medicine; and limited protection of consumers from undesirable practices and relationships between stakeholders involved in the sale of medicines. It is reassuring, however, to note that universal health coverage, to be introduced in the form of National Health Insurance in South Africa, intends to provide financial risk protection to consumers and to eliminate, among other costs, user fees such as co-payments charged by service providers at private healthcare facilities.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The elimination of the fee for service model, which is currently in use in most private sector healthcare facilities, and the reintroduction of the reference price lists for services rendered, have potential to enhance efforts towards the achievement of National Health Insurance goals.</p><p>Interestingly, although co-payments were paid to pharmacists, medical scheme members were angry with medical schemes for refusing to co-pay on their behalf at pharmacies. This could be because pharmacy personnel explained co-payments to consumers in a manner that somehow rendered schemes responsible for causing co-payments rather than the pharmacies. These explanations about co-payments could even be distorted to make even pharmacies appear as victims to the decisions and rules of the schemes. Regulator views about legislative interventions and dispensing practices suggested that co-payments were caused by lack of policing and enforcement of medicine-pricing policies in South Africa. In the Netherlands, a study conducted by Wettermark et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> confirmed that most pharmaceutical policy strategies generally lacked thorough enforcement. It was interesting to note that the doctor&#x02019;s instructions were taken by members out of fear of the authority of the professional rather than out of having faith in their specialty. In hindsight, the researcher could have included prescribing doctors in the study population, to establish whether the prescriber does in any way feel obliged to comply with the scheme&#x02019;s reimbursement criteria and whether co-payments, paid by medical scheme members at pharmacies and formulary lists, are in some way considered prior to writing a prescription.</p><p>The sampling strategy used in this small study ensured the diversity of views about co-payments by insured patients attending retail pharmacies in the Pretoria area; however, it was a small sample. The study highlighted the need for consumers to be educated about medicine prices, particularly about information on generics. The importance of taking note of variations in prices of medicines that yield the same treatment outcome and the fact that branded generics may be far more expensive than unbranded medicines are some components of the information to be communicated regularly to consumers. A larger study would be of value to confirm these findings and to explore the contribution of prescribing doctors in the consumers&#x02019; exposure to co-payments.</p></sec><sec id="s0017"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study found that factors contributing to co-payments appeared to include perception-based and profit-driven decisions made by both purchasers and suppliers of pharmaceuticals. Lack of comprehension of co-payment information by medical scheme members was poor and improvements in the communication methods and channels used by medical scheme organisations are required. Active monitoring of stock at pharmacies, education about generic equivalence and price variations between similar medicines, regulation of the language used by schemes to communicate with their members and decisive introduction of already proposed National Health Insurance principles could collectively contribute towards the reduction of co-payments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank the management staff at pharmacies that opened their doors and allowed interviews to be conducted inside their premises.</p><sec id="s20018" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no financial or personal relationships that may have inappropriately influenced them in writing this article.</p></sec><sec id="s20019"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>N.M.M. designed the project, conducted all the interviews and authored most sections of the manuscript.
