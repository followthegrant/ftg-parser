However, it is an undeniable source of stress, with consequences for physical and mental health. The prevalence of depression and somatic complaints were assessed in 1,013 public workers using the Beck Depression Inventory and a questionnaire investigating for the presence of somatic problems designed by the research team. The results were related to demographic characteristics, history of previous depressive episodes, work schedule (day work, night and day rotating shift work, day rotating shift work), and duration of current work schedule. There were more cases of moderate depression in the day rotating shift workers (84%) than in those working at night (83%). More women had mild or moderate depression than men (22% and 4% versus 10% and 3%, respectively). Severe depression was found only in men. Nearly 10% of depressed individuals reported previous depressive episodes. A link between depression and somatic complaints was also found. In particular, 59% of depressed subjects reported gastrointestinal complaints and 41% did not (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). In conclusion, the occurrence of depressive symptoms could be facilitated by occupation. A history of depressive symptoms should not be neglected, given the risk of recurrence. Somatic complaints could represent a &#x0201c;wake-up call&#x0201d; regarding depression. Global assessment and effective support are fundamental for promotion of a better quality of life in the at-risk category of workers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>somatic complaints</kwd><kwd>previous depressive episodes</kwd><kwd>workers</kwd><kwd>work schedule</kwd><kwd>working period</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Occupation is a fundamental right, enabling social interaction and financial support for the individual.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies investigating this issue from a holistic point of view, simultaneously considering the multiple demographic, clinical, and working variables that could play a role in the occurrence of work-related health problems. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of depression in a sample of workers and its relationship with age, sex, marital status, somatic complaints, work schedule (day work, day rotating shift work, night and day rotating shift work), duration of current work schedule, and presence of previous depressive episodes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data collection</title><p>One thousand and thirteen public workers (706 men and 307 women, mean age 40.8&#x000b1;88 years) referred to the Occupational Health Unit by their employers for a check-up were enrolled consecutively from January 2009 to January 2010 and assessed using anonymous questionnaires.

Seven hundred and six (70%) were male and 307 (30%) were female. The mean age of the total sample was 40.8&#x000b1;8.8 (range 24&#x02013;64) years; the mean age was 41&#x000b1;8.6 years for men and 39.4&#x000b1; 9 years for women. Three age groups were formed as follows: 24&#x02013;35 years (n=313, 31%), 36&#x02013;50 years (n=547, 54%), and 51&#x02013;64 years (n=153, 15%, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ndt-10-519">Table 1</xref>). Eight hundred and twelve individuals (80%) were married, 43 (4%) were divorced, 143 (14%) were single, and 15 (1%) were widowed; 617 men (87%) and 195 women (63%) were married; 15 men (2%) and 28 women (9%) were divorced; 72 men (15%) and 71 women (23%) were single; and three men (0.4%) and 12 women (4%) were widowed.</p></sec><sec><title>Relationship between BDI score and sex, marital status, and age group</title><p>Of the 1,013 individuals in the study, 841 (83%) reported depression and 172 (17%) reported no depression. Specifically, 138 (14%) had mild depression, 31 (3%) had moderate depression, and three (0.3%) had severe depression. Females had higher rates of depression than men, (26% versus 13%). In terms of severity, they presented more cases of mild depression (22% versus 10%) and moderate depression (4% versus 3%). On the other hand, only men showed severe depression (0.4%).</p><p>The highest percentage of nondepressed individuals was found in the married category (85%), followed by those who were single (82%). The highest rates of mild depression were found in widowed (47%) and divorced (28%) subjects, and the highest rates of moderate depression were found in divorced subjects (7%), followed by married (3%) and single (3%) subjects. Severe depression was found in a few cases (0.2% of married and 0.7% of single subjects). A statistically significant difference was found when comparing the percentage of married nondepressed subjects (85%) and that of nondepressed divorced subjects (65%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05); a statistically significant difference was also found between rates of mild depression in married subjects (13%) and widowed subjects (47%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ndt-10-519">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The risk of depression increased with increasing age.

One case of moderate depression and one of severe depression were found in each age group; hence, these few cases have been grouped into a unique class (moderate-severe depression) while performing the statistical analysis pertaining the age groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ndt-10-519">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Relationship between BDI score and work schedule</title><p>Fifty-two (18%) day workers reported depression and 237 (82%) did not, 62 (17%) of night and day rotating shift workers reported depression and 296 (83%) did not, and 57 (16%) of day rotating shift workers reported depression and 309 (84%) did not. No marked differences in severity of depression were identified. Interestingly, there were more cases of moderate depression among day rotating shift workers (3%) than in night and day rotating shift workers (2%, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ndt-10-519">Table 4</xref>). Rates of depression were higher among women regardless of work schedule, except for severe depression, which was found only in men (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-ndt-10-519">Table 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Relationship between BDI score and duration of current work schedule</title><p>Three categories for duration of current work schedule were considered, from the most recent to the most distant, ie, workers who started working in 2005&#x02013;2010, those who started working in 1990&#x02013;2004, and those who started working in 1970&#x02013;1989.

For night and day rotating shift workers, the highest percentage of nondepressed individuals was found in the group that started working more recently (2005&#x02013;2010), but this percentage fell steeply with increasing duration of current work schedule (1990&#x02013;2004 and 1970&#x02013;1989, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t6-ndt-10-519">Table 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Relationship between BDI score and history of depressive episodes and somatic complaints</title><p>Previous depressive episodes and cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal problems were the most frequently reported complaints, so the statistical analysis was limited to these variables. Thirty-seven subjects in the whole sample reported previous depressive episodes; 17 (45%) suffered from depression according to the BDI and 20 (55%) did not.</p><p>A total of 247 subjects reported cardiovascular problems, particularly tachycardia, arrhythmia, and hypertension. Of these, 230 were not depressed (representing 27% of the total number of subjects without depression) and 17 were depressed (representing 10% of all depressed workers). One hundred and ten subjects complained of respiratory problems, particularly chronic bronchitis, cough, and dyspnea. Eighty-five of these were not depressed (10% of the total number of subjects without depression) and 25 were depressed (14% of all depressed workers).</p><p>In total, 386 workers reported gastrointestinal problems, particularly dyspepsia, epigastric pain, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome; of these 235 were not depressed (27% of the total number of subjects without depression) and 101 were depressed (59% of all depressed workers). Gastrointestinal disturbances (33%) were the most frequently reported somatic problem in the whole sample.</p><p>Cardiovascular disturbances were reported by 93% of nondepressed subjects and 7% of depressed subjects; respective percentages were 77% and 23% for respiratory disturbances and 70% and 30% for gastrointestinal disturbances.</p><p>The relationship between previous depressive episodes, somatic complaints, and current depression was investigated using Pearson&#x02019;s chi-squared test. Comparing individuals with and without depression (mild to severe) or previous depressive episodes, a statistically significant correlation was found between previous depressive episodes and current depression (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=48.261, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Gastrointestinal problems were the most common somatic complaints in individuals with depression, with 59% of depressed subjects reporting gastrointestinal complaints and 41% of depressed subjects not reporting such complaints (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and conclusion</title><p>Stress is associated with a variety of physical and mental health problems, including physiological hyperarousal, negative cognition, and negative mood.<xref rid="b18-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A high risk of hospitalization for depression has been demonstrated in human service workers.<xref rid="b19-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Moreover, a higher rate of antidepressant use has been found in employees undertaking a person-related work than in individuals doing non-person-related work.<xref rid="b20-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Our present findings suggest that marital status plays a role in the risk of depression. We found the lowest rate of depression among married individuals, and the highest rate of mild depression in individuals who were widowed. Age was also related to the presence of depressive symptoms, with a significantly higher prevalence of mild depression found among older subjects (aged 51&#x02013;64 years). In this study, approximately 10% of depressed subjects reported having had previous depressive episodes. Moreover, even though no statistically significant differences were found when considering depression and work schedule/duration of current work schedule, the raw values suggest some influence of these variables on the occurrence of depressive symptoms. A link between depression and somatic complaints (gastrointestinal disturbances in particular) was also found.</p><p>The prevalence of major depression in our sample of workers was higher than that in the general Italian population.<xref rid="b21-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Our data support the hypothesis that work represents an objective source of stress and could facilitate the occurrence of depressive symptoms. Several studies have reported that symptoms of depression are commonly perceived by patients as interfering significantly with their work performance. Moreover, epidemiologic research found that community workers with depression were at least five times more likely to miss work than workers with no symptoms of depression. Depressed patients being treated in primary care miss two to four more days of work per month due to disability than patients without depression.<xref rid="b22-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> These data underscore the importance of screening for symptoms of depression among workers.<xref rid="b23-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>As reported elsewhere in the literature,<xref rid="b24-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> in our sample, the frequency of depression in women (26%) was higher than that in men (13%). The higher prevalence of depression in female workers probably reflects their different role in society. In reality, women are exposed to a &#x0201c;double burden&#x0201d;, having to dedicate themselves to both work and family; paradoxically, they might prefer to work at night in order to have more time to take care of children.<xref rid="b25-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Hence, shift work might affect mental health in men and women in different ways.<xref rid="b26-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In addition, the woman traditionally stays home after the birth of a child, because she is the one mainly responsible for caring for children.<xref rid="b27-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> With regard to their role in the workplace, women usually report less decision-making opportunities and more work-related stress than their male colleagues.<xref rid="b28-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In contrast with data reported in the literature,<xref rid="b29-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> work schedule did not significantly influence the likelihood of depression, even though moderate depression was more frequent in day workers than in night and day rotating shift workers. For night workers in particular, the duration of the current work schedule has been suggested to play a role in the likelihood of depressive symptoms.<xref rid="b26-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The prevalence of depression was positively related to the duration of all current work schedules; however, the risk of having depressive symptoms was lower in day workers and day rotating shift workers who had been working these shifts for longer periods of time. In contrast, this risk did not decrease in night and day rotating shift workers, indicating that night shifts have some degree of long-term &#x0201c;depressogenic&#x0201d; effect. Night work can trigger disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle and difficulty in maintaining family and social relationships, with consequent negative influences on marital relationships, care of children, and social contacts, and deterioration of health that can manifest in disturbances of sleep and eating habits.<xref rid="b2-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Previous depressive episodes, as expected, increased the likelihood of depression, so represent a predictor of recurrent depressive episodes; therefore, a history of depression should not be underestimated.<xref rid="b30-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> A proportion of individuals complaining of cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal problems were found to be depressed. In particular, 30% of individuals complaining of gastrointestinal disturbances were depressed, and somatic complaints may be linked to an underlying psychiatric illness.<xref rid="b32-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> A previous study has reported a positive association between the characteristics of somatic symptoms (number, frequency, and associated disability) and severity of depression in patients with major depressive disorder.<xref rid="b33-ndt-10-519" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In view of this, when assessing workers, such complaints should be interpreted as a possible &#x0201c;wake-up call&#x0201d; for depression. Hence, global assessment and effective support are fundamental for promotion of better quality of life in this at-risk category of workers.</p><p>In conclusion, this work has some limitations but also some strengths. The main strength of this study lies in the large number of workers evaluated in terms of both somatic and mental conditions. Another strength of our study is that it included contemporaneous analysis of workers undertaking a variety of shift work schedules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate day workers, night and day rotating shift workers, and day rotating shift workers simultaneously while taking into consideration depression and somatic complaints. The main limitation of our study is that its design did not allow determination of the time of onset of depressive symptoms, which would be useful when correlating depression and work characteristics. Future prospective studies are necessary to confirm our results.</p><p>This paper highlights a need for careful psychiatric assessment of workers, in particular when treating them for somatic complaints. It is interesting to note that none of the workers who were found to be depressed were referred to the Occupational Health Unit by their employers for a suspected psychiatric illness, but only for a check-up. Psychological observation of workers should play an increasingly important role in the field of occupational medicine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This article is
