As of May 16, 55,992 cases had been reported and the outbreak was still spreading. Identification of newly affected locations is paramount to intervention activities, but challenging due to limitations of current data on the outbreak and on CHIKV transmission. We developed models to make probabilistic predictions of spread based on current data considering these limitations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Branching process models capturing travel patterns, local infection prevalence, climate dependent transmission factors, and associated uncertainty estimates were developed to predict probable locations for the arrival of CHIKV-infected travelers and for the initiation of local transmission. Many international cities and areas close to where transmission has already occurred were likely to have received infected travelers. Of the ten locations predicted to be the most likely locations for introduced CHIKV transmission in the first four months of the outbreak, eight had reported local cases by the end of April. Eight additional locations were likely to have had introduction leading to local transmission in April, but with substantial uncertainty.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Branching process models can characterize the risk of CHIKV introduction and spread during the ongoing outbreak. Local transmission of CHIKV is currently likely in several Caribbean locations and possible, though uncertain, for other locations in the continental United States, Central America, and South America. This modeling framework may also be useful for other outbreaks where the risk of pathogen spread over heterogeneous transportation networks must be rapidly assessed on the basis of limited information.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The authors confirm that, for approved reasons, some access restrictions apply to the data underlying the findings.

CHIKV is transmitted to humans by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes and can cause explosive outbreaks of fever and severe polyarthralgia affecting 30&#x02013;75% of the population <xref rid="pone.0104915-Sergon1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-Gerardin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-Sergon2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Prior to 2013, outbreaks of chikungunya had been reported in Africa, Asia, Europe, and islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. While CHIKV transmission had never been documented in the Americas, the potential for outbreaks had long been recognized because of the prevalence of the vectors and their efficiency at transmitting dengue viruses <xref rid="pone.0104915-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>As of May 16, 55,992 locally acquired and travel-related cases had been reported from fourteen islands in the Caribbean and French Guiana <xref rid="pone.0104915-Centers1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Although further spread is probable, the current extent of spread and risk is uncertain. Uncertainty arises from numerous factors including challenges in assessing the current prevalence of infection and travel patterns, the complexity of the transmission cycle, and stochasticity in outbreak propagation. Measuring the prevalence of CHIKV is challenging as cases might be unrecognized, confused with other diseases such as dengue, or not reported. Travel patterns are also difficult to capture in real-time and might change due to the outbreak itself. Transmission potential is difficult to predict due to differences in mosquito species, vector competence, and vector densities <xref rid="pone.0104915-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-Turell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-Tsetsarkin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-Vazeille1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-Dubrulle1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-Pesko1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-Tsetsarkin2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Lastly, epidemics are inherently stochastic; there may be numerous possible routes of spread, but by chance only some will actual occur. Given the many unknown entities, models considering both the available data and the associated uncertainty can provide insight on the most probable routes of spread and the locations where unrecognized cases may already be occurring.</p><p>To estimate the current risk of CHIKV spread, we utilized two branching process models <xref rid="pone.0104915-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The first model estimates the probability of at least one CHIKV infected traveler arriving somewhere as a single step process dependent on (1) the number of infected individuals in locations where transmission has occurred, (2) the probability of those individuals travelling, and (3) the duration of infection. The second model estimates the probability of CHIKV transmission spreading to new locations as a three-step process: (1) an infected traveler must arrive; (2) that traveler must infect at least one mosquito; and (3) at least one infected mosquito must infect at least one person. We incorporated uncertainties into these models using global sensitivity analysis and predicted the probability of infected travelers and the initiation of autochthonous transmission for each of the first five months of the outbreak (December 2013&#x02013;April 2014).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Models</title><p>Based on previous work <xref rid="pone.0104915-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, we estimated the probability of an infected traveler arriving in location (<italic>i</italic>) as a binomial process dependent on the number of infections (<italic>I</italic>) in each source location (<italic>s</italic> in <italic>S</italic>) in each month (<italic>m</italic> in <italic>M</italic>), the average duration of infection in humans (<italic>D</italic>), and the monthly probability of travel from each source location (<italic>p<sub>i,s,m</sub></italic>):<disp-formula id="pone.0104915.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104915.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>

Being able to identify areas at risk for the introduction and spread of CHIKV in a timely fashion is critical to alerting people to the risk of disease and to implementing control measures. Using branching process models with the current distribution of reported cases, probable travel patterns, and estimated uncertainties we predicted likely locations for introduction and autochthonous transmission of CHIKV. For instance, the models predicted high and increasing probabilities of introduction into St. Lucia and Haiti in recent months and cases were reported from those locations in early May <xref rid="pone.0104915-Centers1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, numerous other locations predicted by the models to have infected travelers and introduced transmission had not reported cases as of May 16. These differences between the model predictions and the current epidemiological data may reflect a lack of or delay in recognition of cases, the chance that a probable outcome does not occur, or model error.</p><p>Identification and reporting of early cases is challenging and slow as cases must be found, recognized, and confirmed. In many locations clinicians have never seen a chikungunya case and differentiating a rare case from more common dengue cases is difficult. Testing and reporting for chikungunya is also new for most of the affected and at-risk locations. These challenges cause a lag between the observed extent of spread and the true extent of spread, which we predict here. Stochasticity may also contribute to differences between the model and reality. Though an infected traveler or a local infection may be likely in the model and in reality, it is never guaranteed to happen. For St. Vincent and the Grenadines, for example, the mean cumulative probability of having local transmission was 0.44, i.e. similar to flipping a coin.</p><p>Uncertainty in the data and parameters leads to uncertainty in the model outcomes, captured here by global sensitivity analysis. These uncertainties had relatively little impact on the probability of infected travelers arriving in locations with high travel flow from affected areas. Thus, even under the most conservative estimates, it is highly likely that there have been unrecognized or unreported cases in travelers in numerous locations. There was much more uncertainty about the probability of local transmission. This is evident in the distribution of <italic>R</italic>
<sub>0</sub>, which encompassed <italic>R</italic>
<sub>0</sub> values from other models of CHIKV transmission <xref rid="pone.0104915-Boelle1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-Massad1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-Yakob1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> but also exhibited high variability reflecting uncertainties in key parameters and potentially diverse local mosquito populations. In areas where the risk of introduced transmission is high but uncertain, further work can be done to reduce uncertainty such as characterizing the number of travelers arriving from potential source locations, measuring the actual vector density, or assessing local vector competence.</p><p>Despite the limitations and uncertainties, eight of the ten locations predicted to be the most likely locations for introduced transmission by the end of March had documented cases by the end of April. One of these, the Dominican Republic, reported no cases in March and 7,537 in April <xref rid="pone.0104915-Pan5" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-Pan6" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This indicates that the model is capturing key characteristics of spread. However, it does not include every nuance of transmission and movement and is intended to provide guidance, not a definitive answer to how the epidemic is currently evolving. For example, the model could not predict spread to Jost Van Dyke (British Virgin Islands), an island with confirmed cases but no airport, where the virus must have arrived via infected travelers on a boat <xref rid="pone.0104915-GovernmentoftheVirgin1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Nonetheless, the model did predict the likely introduction to the British Virgin Islands.</p><p>Rapid assessment of the potential for outbreaks to spread based on limited information is critical to public health planning. Models to assess these risks must, by nature, simplify the complex dynamics of international travel and disease transmission. The models developed here leverage previous work suggesting that a branching process model of spread over a heterogeneous network could capture most of the variability in a more complex stochastic simulation model <xref rid="pone.0104915-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. One of the fundamental advantages of this approach is that predictions of current spread patterns may be made quickly based solely on knowledge of mobility networks, reported case counts, and coarse characterization of key transmission parameters.</p><p>The results presented here indicate that the CHIKV epidemic in the Americas is likely to be expanding, both now and in the future, as more cases occur and temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere increase. In all locations where the probability of imported cases is high, public health authorities should raise awareness in the healthcare community to identify and provide care for cases and to alert travelers to the potential risk of disease and appropriate prevention measures (e.g., use of mosquito repellant) <xref rid="pone.0104915-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104915-VanBortel1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Additionally, in areas where there is risk for local transmission, public health authorities and partners should begin to plan and consider implementing appropriate interventions (e.g., personal protection against mosquito bites or mosquito control) that could mitigate the risk of local transmission <xref rid="pone.0104915-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Implementing public health actions is critical for any outbreak and is ideally informed by careful assessment of risk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0104915.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>A supporting figure showing the distribution of simulated <italic>R</italic>
