Due to its phylogenetic position and age, it is important for studies focusing on the early evolution of both dinosaurs and sauropodomorphs. The osteology of <italic>Saturnalia</italic> has been described in a series of papers, but its cranial anatomy remains mostly unknown. Here, we describe the skull bones of one of its paratypes (only in the type-series to possess such remains) based on CT Scan data. The newly described elements allowed estimating the cranial length of <italic>Saturnalia</italic> and provide additional support for the presence of a reduced skull (i.e. two thirds of the femoral length) in this taxon, as typical of later sauropodomorphs. Skull reduction in <italic>Saturnalia</italic> could be related to an increased efficiency for predatory feeding behaviour, allowing fast movements of the head in order to secure small and elusive prey, a hypothesis also supported by data from its tooth and brain morphology. A principal co-ordinates analysis of the sauropodomorph jaw feeding apparatus shows marked shifts in morphospace occupation in different stages of the first 30 million years of their evolutionary history. One of these shifts is observed between non-plateosaurian and plateosaurian sauropodomorphs, suggesting that, despite also having an omnivorous diet, the feeding behaviour of some early Carnian sauropodomorphs, such as <italic>Saturnalia</italic>, was markedly different from that of later Triassic taxa. A second shift, between Late Triassic and Early Jurassic taxa, is congruent with a floral turnover hypothesis across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de S&#x000e3;o Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14/03825-3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langer</surname><given-names>Max C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>246610/2012-3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1542-3199</contrib-id><name><surname>Bronzati</surname><given-names>Mario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>170867/2017-0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1542-3199</contrib-id><name><surname>Bronzati</surname><given-names>Mario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos - FINEP, Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication, Brazilian Federal Government.

In early 1998, three skeletons were unearthed during two fieldwork campaigns in the locality commonly known as Cerro da Alemoa or Waldsanga (53&#x000b0;45&#x02019; W; 29&#x000b0;40&#x02019; S), located in the outskirts of Santa Maria, south Brazil, in the red mudstones of the Santa Maria Formation. These skeletons were assigned to a new species of sauropodomorph dinosaur, <italic>Saturnalia tupiniquim</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which was at the time the oldest known member of the group. For more than twenty years, the only cranial elements available for <italic>Saturnalia</italic> (from one of its paratypes) were the frontals, the left squamosal and postorbital, and the braincase, which were preserved exposed on the rock surface of the same block, along with isolated right lacrimal and left dentary. In the absence of detailed descriptions, some phylogenetic analyses (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) incorporated information collected first-hand from those partially exposed elements in their data matrices. In 2014, a Computed Tomography procedure revealed that the parietals and laterosphenoids were preserved inside the matrix of the same block containing the braincase elements. Later, in 2016, during further preparation of MCP-3845-PV, additional cranial bones were discovered underneath the pelvic girdle of the specimen, including left quadrate, prefrontal, and lacrimal, as well as partial left maxilla and right dentary. Herein, we describe all the available skull bones of <italic>Saturnalia</italic>, except for the braincase, described elsewhere (see [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Based on this new information, alongside recent fossil findings [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and a new principal co-ordinates analysis, we provide new insights on the early evolution of the sauropodomorph feeding behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Systematic Terminology</title><p>Here we follow the definitions of [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] for Sauropodomorpha (the most inclusive clade containing <italic>Saltasaurus loricatus</italic>, but not <italic>Passer domesticus</italic> or <italic>Triceratops horridus</italic>), Plateosauria (the most recent common ancestor of <italic>Plateosaurus engelhardti</italic> and <italic>Jingshanosaurus xinwaensis</italic>, and all its descendants), and Anchisauria (the most recent common ancestor of <italic>Anchisaurus polyzelus</italic> and <italic>Melanorosaurus readi</italic>, and all its descendants), of [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] for Massopoda (the most inclusive clade containing <italic>Saltasaurus loricatus</italic> but not <italic>Plateosaurus engelhardti</italic>), and of [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] for Sauropoda (the least inclusive clade containing <italic>Vulcanodon karibaensis</italic> and Eusauropoda).</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Referred material and justification</title><p>MCP-3845-PV: partial left maxilla, both frontals, parietals, lacrimals, postorbitals, and dentaries, left quadrate and prefrontal, apart from the braincase [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and a fairly complete postcranial skeleton [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to be described elsewhere. All the cranial elements were preserved disarticulated, except for those of the braincase [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, they can be safely assigned to MCP-3845-PV, because they were found in close association with the postcranial material of this specimen, which is isolated from other dinosaur skeleton found in the area (but see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Discussion</xref> below). Furthermore, the bones match in relative sizes and there are no duplicated elements.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>CT-Scan</title><p>A virtual preparation using computed tomography was preferred because the bones are preserved in heavily fractured blocks, in such a way that mechanical preparation could damage the fossils.

Skull size was inferred with the aid of linear regressions, based on measurements of other taxa known from more complete specimens (see details in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Results</xref> section below). Our estimates employed a value 15% greater than the preserved length (length as preserved = 29 mm) of the frontal, in order to account for uncertainties regarding the completeness of the anterior margin of the bone (see description below). Linear regressions were also employed to estimate the mandible length of <italic>Saturnalia</italic>, based on the preserved dentaries of MCP-3845-PV. In this case, the distance from the anterior tip of the mandible to the anterior margin of the external mandibular fenestra was used as a proxy to estimate the length of the lower jaw, also based on values measured for other taxa (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Results</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Discussion</xref> Below). Neither of the dentaries of <italic>Saturnalia</italic> is completely preserved. The left element is 51 mm long from the anterior end of the mandibular fenestra to the mesial margin of the anterior most preserved tooth, which is likely not at the very anterior tip of the dentary (see description below). The right element is c. 44 mm long as preserved, and it was probably not much longer based on the dentition pattern along its anteroposterior axis.

Even probably lacking a small part of its anterior tip (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec025">Discussion</xref> below), the frontal is c. 1.7 times longer than wide (maximal length estimated in ca. 29&#x02013;30 mm; maximal width ca. 17 mm).

Slightly posterior to this notch, a shallow, half-moon shaped depression is seen on the right frontal (&#x02018;pfas&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g002">Fig 2</xref>), which likely represents the surface of the frontal that was overlapped by the prefrontal. This depression extends for slightly more than one third of the anteroposterior length of the frontal and medially reaches half of the width of the bone in this region. Still on the dorsal surface of the frontal, the articulation area for the postorbital is located in its posterolateral corner (&#x02018;poas&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g002">Fig 2</xref>), anterolateral to the portion of the frontal that contributes to the anterior margin of the supratemporal fossa.

The frontal does not participate in the border of the supratemporal fenestra, but is excluded from that by an anterolateral projection of the parietal (see below) that likely contacted the laterosphenoid on the anterior margin of the fenestra. This condition is also observed in other sauropodomorphs such as <italic>Buriolestes</italic>, <italic>Plateosaurus</italic> spp, and <italic>Massospondylus</italic> spp. The participation of the frontal in the supratemporal fenestra of early sauropodomorphs has been recently discussed [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Based on our observations of <italic>Panphagia</italic>, we consider that the irregular shape of the posterior margin of its frontals is most likely due to breakage, and it is not possible to be sure about the presence of a triangular posterior projection reaching the fenestra (see Figure 2 in [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]).</p><p>In <italic>Saturnalia</italic>, a crest extends along the entire anteroposterior axis of the ventral surface of the frontal (&#x02018;cr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g002">Fig 2</xref>), setting two distinct surfaces apart, the orbital roof laterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and the endocranial surface medially. This configuration is also seen in the sauropodomorphs <italic>Efraasia minor</italic> and <italic>Plateosaurus</italic> spp. A different condition is observed in <italic>Panphagia</italic>, in which two parallel ridges separate the two regions [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The lateral margin of the frontal is formed by the surface corresponding to the roof of the orbit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This is more dorsally raised at its midpoint, following the general condition of the entire bone. Thus, the orbital roof is dorsally arched in lateral view. Likewise, it is ventrally concave in transverse section, raising dorsally towards the lateral margin at an angle of ca. 45 degrees to the endocranial roof. In ventral view, the lateral margin of the orbital roof parallels the crest that forms its medial limit (as defined above). Hence, the lateromedial width of the orbital roof remains constant along its entire anteroposterior length. Also, the orbital roof extends along the entire lateral margin of the frontal as preserved.</p><p>Two distinct fossae are present on the endocranial surface of the more complete right frontal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

The right parietal is broken and partially preserved in separate pieces, adding no extra anatomical information. The total length of the bone is ca. 22 mm, and its maximum width, from the posterolateral corner of the wing to the medial articulation to the counterpart, is 13 mm. The parietal is composed of two parts, the anterior body (&#x02018;abp&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g003">Fig 3</xref>), sometimes treated as the &#x0201c;main body&#x0201d; (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), and the parietal wing (&#x02018;pw&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The former corresponds to the portion extending from the anterior margin of the bone to the point where its transverse axis is twisted from a horizontal to a vertical plane. The parietal is isolated, but its anterior body probably contacted the frontal anteriorly, the supraoccipital posteromedially, the laterosphenoid lateroventrally, and possibly the postorbital laterally. The parietal wing would have contacted the supraoccipital medially, the paraoccipital process of the otoccipital ventrally, and the squamosal distally. In <italic>Saturnalia</italic>, the anteroposterior lengths of those two regions are nearly the same, as seen in <italic>Eoraptor lunensis</italic>.

The absence of clearer indicatives of an interdigitating suture between parietals and frontals could be a preservation bias. The bones are not preserved in articulation and the small and delicate projections of an interdigitating suture could have been lost during preservation. Another possibility is that the CT-Scan data did not allow reconstructing the delicate morphology of an interdigitating suture, as suggested for <italic>Lesothosaurus diagnosticus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The anterior body of the parietal has a triangular lateral projection at its anterolateral corner (&#x02018;lp&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g003">Fig 3</xref>). It is 5 mm long anteroposteriorly, which is about one fourth of the anteroposterior length of the anterior body of the parietal. The anterior margin of the projection is mostly straight, corresponding to one third of the total anterior width of the parietal. The projection is subtriangular in dorsal/ventral views and its anteroposterior axis is oblique to the horizontal, with the posterior margin being more ventrally positioned than the anterior. Its dorsal surface is part of the supratemporal fossa, and would be continuous with the part of the fossa entering the frontal, as described above. When the parietals and frontals are virtually articulated, the lateral projection of the former reaches the postorbital slot in the posterolateral margin of the latter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221387.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). Thus, we infer that the frontal was excluded from the margin of the internal supratemporal fenestra.</p><p>The dorsal surface of the anterior body of the parietal, excluding the anterolateral projection, is transversally convex and roughly sub-rectangular in shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g003">Fig 3</xref>), with a concave lateral margin and a retracted posteromedial corner (but this might be an artefact due to breakage). A low laterally-arching ridge (&#x02018;dri&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g003">Fig 3</xref>) extends lateroposteriorly from the anteromedial corner of the bone until half the length of the anterior body of the parietal and then turns medioposteriorly towards its posteromedial corner. This results in a half-moon shape for the portion of the parietal medial to the ridge, which forms the skull roof. The anterior part of this ridge marks the medial limit of the supratemporal fossa on the parietal. The ridge projects more dorsally than the medial margin of the anterior body of the parietal. Thus, with the parietals articulated, the dorsal surface of the pair, between the ridges, is depressed.</p><p>In ventral view, the surface of the anterior body of the parietal is transversely and anteroposteriorly concave, mainly following the corresponding convexity of the dorsal surface of the bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g003">Fig 3</xref>). A posteromedially to anterolaterally oriented ridge (&#x02018;vri&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g003">Fig 3</xref>) separates the anterior body from the parietal wing.

Its anteroposterior length is ca. 10 mm, but the long axis is ca. 18 mm. The ventral and dorsal margins parallel one another for ca. 90% of the long axis of the process, but the latter descents ventrally at the distal tip, approaching the ventral margin, which remains at about the same dorsoventral level. The lateral surface of the parietal wing forms the medial and posteromedial margin of the supratemporal fossa. Its ventral half is dorsoventrally concave, following the shape of the ventral portion of the anterior body of the parietal that forms the supratemporal fossa. The lateral portion of this concave surface represents the articulation area with the parietal ramus of the squamosal, where both bones joined to form the posterior margin of the supratemporal fenestra. A low ridge marks the dorsal limit of that concave region, dorsal to which the lateral surface of the parietal wing is dorsoventrally convex.

In lateral view, the main axes of these portions form a right angle at the level of the posterodorsal border of the antorbital fossa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0221387.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0221387.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Left lacrimal of the specimen MCP-3845-PV of <italic>Saturnalia tupiniquim</italic> in lateral (A), anterior (B), posterior (C), medial (D), and dorsal (E) views.</title><p><bold>Abbreviations</bold>: <bold>antfb&#x02014;</bold>border of the antorbital fenestra; <bold>antfo&#x02014;</bold>antorbital fossa; <bold>antr&#x02014;</bold>anterior ramus; <bold>cr&#x02014;</bold>crest; <bold>dme&#x02014;</bold>dorsomedial expansion; <bold>gr&#x02014;</bold>groove; <bold>grld&#x02014;</bold>groove associated with the lacrimal duct; <bold>jars&#x02014;</bold>articulation surface with the jugal; <bold>ldo&#x02014;</bold>lacrimal duct opening; <bold>nars&#x02014;</bold>articulation surface with the nasal; <bold>mxars&#x02014;</bold>articulation surface with the maxilla; <bold>orr</bold>&#x02014;orbital rim; <bold>pfars&#x02014;</bold>articulation surface with the prefrontal.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0221387.g005"/></fig><p>When the ventral margin of the lacrimal shaft is horizontally aligned, the anterior ramus is anteroventrally to posterodorsally oriented. The anterior ramus can be divided in two laminar portions: a dorsoventrally compressed dorsal portion and a mediolaterally compressed ventral portion, the lateral surface of which is slightly concave dorsoventrally. Together, these portions are L-shaped in anterior view, with the dorsal portion expanding laterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). However, this lateral expansion is seen only along the posterior two thirds of the anteroposterior axis of the ramus. Thus, its anteriormost portion corresponds only to a tall mediolaterally compressed lamina, which might represent the contact with the dorsal ramus of the maxilla. On the lateral surface of the lacrimal, a depression on the posterior portion of the anterior ramus, where it merges with the lacrimal shaft, corresponds to the posterodorsal corner of the antorbital fossa (&#x02018;antfo&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This part of the fossa is exposed in lateral view, as also observed in <italic>Eoraptor</italic> and <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic>. The dorsal portion of the anterior ramus of the lacrimal forms a roof over the posterodorsal corner of the antorbital fossa, where the dorsal surface of the bone is transversely concave. The posteriormost region of this concavity likely represent the surface that was overlapped by the prefrontal (&#x02018;pfars&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), whereas its anterior portion might represent the articulation surface with the nasal (&#x02018;nars&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p><p>The ventral third of the lacrimal shaft is a mediolaterally compressed lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Its lateral and medial surfaces are both anteroposteriorly and dorsoventrally concave and convex, respectively. At its ventral limit, the lacrimal shaft is ca. 10 mm long anteroposteriorly, and its ventrolateral surface likely represent to articulation areas with the posterior ramus of the maxilla anteriorly (&#x02018;mxars&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), and the anterior ramus of the jugal posteriorly (&#x02018;jars&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Dorsal to this laminar portion, the lacrimal shaft becomes shorter anteroposteriorly, with nearly half of the anteroposterior length of the ventral margin, but expands transversely at its posterior portion. The lacrimal shaft is not vertically straight. In posterior view, it is concave laterally and convex medially, with the change in the main axis orientation occurring exactly at the dorsal limit of the mediolaterally compressed ventral third described above, which also marks the ventral limit of a groove associated with the lacrimal duct (&#x02018;grld&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This grove extends dorsoventrally, ending dorsally in the lacrimal duct opening (&#x02018;ldo&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). On the opposite side of this groove, the anterior surface of the lacrimal is transversely concave and continuous with the part of the antorbital fossa formed by the anterior expansion of the medial portion of the lacrimal shaft, which is visible in lateral view. In this view, a small part of the fossa, at the mid-length of the dorsoventral axis of the lacrimal shaft, is hidden by a sheet of bone that folds anteriorly from the lateral margin of the lacrimal.</p><p>On the medial surface of the lacrimal, a crest extends along the posterior margin of the shaft. It separates the groove associated with the lachrymal duct on the posterior surface of the bone from another dorsoventrally oriented, and anteroposteriorly concave, groove (&#x02018;gr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) on the medial surface of the bone, which extends dorsally for half the length of the posterior groove. The dorsal half of the lacrimal shaft is anteroposteriorly convex, following the concavity of the antorbital fossa on the lateral side of the bone. The medial surface of the anterior ramus also mostly follows the curvature on the opposite side of the bone, being dorsoventrally convex, except for its concave proximal third. This is due to the medial expansion (&#x02018;dme&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5</xref>) of the dorsal surface of the anterior ramus in the region where it was likely overlapped by the prefrontal (&#x02018;pfars&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Postorbital</title><p>Left and right postorbitals of MCP-3845-PV are preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The left element is partially visible in the block, whereas the right element is completely hidden by matrix. The segmentation results show no differences in the morphology of the anterior and posterior rami of the left and right postorbitals. Thus, it is most likely that these rami are completely preserved in both bones. The description provided here is based solely on the left element, which possesses a more complete ventral ramus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The postorbital is a triradiate bone, with ventral (&#x02018;ventr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g006">Fig 6</xref>), posterior (&#x02018;postr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g006">Fig 6</xref>), and anterior (&#x02018;antr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g006">Fig 6</xref>) rami that would have respectively contacted the jugal, the squamosal, and the frontal.

In lateral view it is spike-like; wider proximally and tapering distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g006">Fig 6</xref>). It is also lateromedially compressed, being the thinnest of the three postorbital rami. It is nearly 9 mm long, and its distal portion would have fitted into an articulation socket located on the anterior ramus of the squamosal, together forming the dorsal margin of the lower temporal fenestra. Still in lateral view, an angle of c. 120 degrees is formed between the dorsal margins of the anterior and posterior rami of the postorbital, similar to the condition in <italic>Buriolestes</italic>, but different from that of <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic>, in which that angle is of approximately 180 degrees.</p><p>The anterior ramus is the broadest (transversally) of the three rami of the postorbital. From the centre of the bone, it projects anterodorsomedially, forming a dorsal arch, and has a length of ca. 15 mm. A socket (&#x02018;sopr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g006">Fig 6</xref>) in the medial surface accommodated the lateral tip of the anterolateral ramus of the parietal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221387.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). Anterolateral to this socket, a finger-like anterior process (&#x02018;frarp&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g006">Fig 6</xref>) tappers distally, fitting into the slot on the posterolateral corner of the dorsal surface of the frontal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221387.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). The ventral surface of the anterior ramus, which formed part of the orbital rim (&#x02018;orbr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g006">Fig 6</xref>), is 5 mm wide mediolaterally and concave in that same direction. At the orbital rim, where the anterior and ventral rami of the postorbital merge, the lateral margin of the bone expands anteriorly, forming a flange seen in anterior and lateral views (&#x02018;fg&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g006">Fig 6</xref>), similar to what is observed in <italic>Eoraptor</italic> (see Figure 40 in [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]) and <italic>Buriolestes</italic> (see Figure 9 in [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). Ventral to this flange, the ventral ramus of the postorbital is lateromedially narrower than at the junction of the three rami, with a width of approximately 3 mm. The ventral ramus is nearly 18 mm long, but its tip is broken. The articulation area for the jugal (&#x02018;jars&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g006">Fig 6</xref>) is located at the posterior surface of the ventral portion of the ramus and is a lateromedially concave slot with a dorsoventral length over 7 mm. As preserved, the surface for the articulation with the jugal extends for nearly 40% of the total length of the ventral ramus.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Squamosal</title><p>Only the left squamosal of MCP-3845-PV is preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The bone is partially visible in the matrix, but additional morphological details are seen in the CT- images. The squamosal is a tetraradiate element. It appears to lack the distalmost portion of the ventral ramus, but it is otherwise completely preserved. A ventral ramus (&#x02018;ventr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g007">Fig 7</xref>) formed the posterior margin of the laterotemporal fenestra and contacted the quadrate posteriorly (&#x02018;quars&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). The three additional rami converge to the head of the bone, which forms the posterolaterodorsal corner of the skull. The anterolateral ramus (&#x02018;antlatr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g007">Fig 7</xref>) contacted the postorbital, shaping the dorsal margin of the laterotemporal fenestra. The anteromedial ramus (&#x02018;antmedr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g007">Fig 7</xref>) contacted the parietal wing and, together with the anterolateral ramus, formed the posterolateral margin of the supratemporal fenestra.

The main axis of the preserved ventral ramus is straight, as observed in <italic>Eoraptor</italic> and <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic>. As its distalmost portion is lacking, it is not possible to assert if the tip of the ramus was curved posteriorly as in <italic>Plateosaurus</italic> spp.</p><p>Because all the cranial elements of MCP-3845-PV are disarticulated, it is not possible to precisely establish the orientation of the squamosal. However, based on the position of the slot for the articulation with the postorbital in the anterolateral ramus, it is most likely that the ventral ramus was not vertically oriented, but would bend anteriorly at an angle of c. 30&#x02013;45 degrees with the vertical axis. The posterior surface of the ventral ramus is transversally concave along its entire length, and a circular depression (&#x02018;pdep&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) of nearly 3 mm in diameter is seen where this surface meets the ventral surface of the posterior ramus. The posterior ramus of the squamosal projects posterolaterally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221387.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>), with its main axis forming an acute angle to that of the ventral ramus in lateral view. It is finger like, with a rounded tip, slightly compressed dorsoventrally, and has a maximum length of over 7 mm. Its lateromedial width is mostly constant along its length, but its transverse long axis is inclined in a way that the lateral margin is located dorsally in relation to the medial margin.</p><p>Another depression (&#x02018;adep&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g007">Fig 7D</xref>) is observed where the anterior surface of the ventral ramus meets the proximal parts of the anterolateral and anteromedial rami. In dorsal view, the proximal portion of the latter two rami diverge from one another at an angle of ca. 60 degrees. Together, the rami form an arch, as given by their concave surfaces that face one another, which is the posterolateral corner of the supratemporal fenestra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221387.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). The anteromedial ramus is a sharp lamina, c. 3.5 mm tall, inclined in a way that its dorsal margin is laterally displaced in relation to the ventral. Also, that ramus is ventrally curved at its distal half. It would probably have laterally overlapped the parietal wing.</p><p>The anterolateral ramus is 7.2 mm long as preserved. It bears a slot (&#x02018;posl&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) for the articulation with the postorbital on its lateral surface, which corresponds to an anteroventrally to posterodorsally oriented groove (c. 6 mm long). The slot tapers posteriorly, following the shape of the distal portion of the posterior ramus of the postorbital, and almost reaches the squamosal head, but it is not visible in dorsal view. The medial surface of the anterolateral ramus chiefly follows the curvature of the respective lateral surface, being dorsoventrally convex.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Quadrate</title><p>The specimen preserves only a partial left quadrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g008">Fig 8</xref>), including the quadrate shaft and the medial flange (i.e. the pterygoid ramus), and the lacking lateral flange (i.e., quadratojugal ramus).

Its posterior margins is gently dorsoventrally concave. The transverse width of the quadrate shaft is relatively constant along the dorsoventral axis, but it expands at its ventral fourth.

For instance, such a groove is clearly seen on the left dentary, but not in the right dentary of the specimen AMNH 6810 of <italic>Plateosaurus erlenbergensis</italic> (see e.g. Figures 31 and 32 in [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]).</p><fig id="pone.0221387.g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0221387.g010</object-id><label>Fig 10</label><caption><title>Right dentary of the specimen MCP-3845-PV of <italic>Saturnalia tupiniquim</italic> in lateral (A), medial (B), dorsal (C), and ventral (D) views.</title><p><bold>Abbreviations: alv&#x02014;</bold>alveolous; <bold>alv3 &#x02014;</bold>third alveolous; <bold>amgr&#x02014;</bold>anteromedial groove; <bold>fo&#x02014;</bold>foramen; <bold>gr&#x02014;</bold>groove; <bold>sym&#x02014;</bold>symphysis; <bold>to&#x02014;</bold>tooth; <bold>1 to 9</bold>&#x02014;preserved tooth crowns.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0221387.g010"/></fig><p>The anteroposterior length of the right dentary as preserved is nearly 46 mm, with a total of 21 to 22 tooth positions, a number that is mostly equivalent to seen in other early sauropodomorphs (e.g. <italic>Eoraptor&#x02013;</italic> 20 dentary teeth; <italic>Pampadromaeus&#x02013;</italic>minimum of 18 dentary teeth; <italic>Plateosaurus</italic> spp<italic>&#x02013;</italic>ca. 22 dentary teeth). The most posterior of the preserved alveoli is located almost at the posterior edge of the bone. Thus, based on comparisons with the tooth number and position of other sauropodomorphs such as <italic>Panphagia</italic> and <italic>Plateosaurus erlenbergensis</italic> (AMNH 6810) the right dentary of MCP-3845-PV was likely slightly longer than preserved. Eight teeth have completely or partially preserved crowns and one (4<sup>th</sup>) has only part of its root preserved inside the alveolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g010">Fig 10</xref>). The second, third, and fourth alveoli are two to three times larger than the others and the first four alveoli have a sub-circular shape, differing from the more elliptical posterior alveoli, which are slightly anteroposteriorly longer than wide.</p><p>There is no evidence of the presence of a predentary bone at the anterior portion of the dentary. The symphysis is short, only reaching the level of the third alveolus (&#x02018;alv3&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g010">Fig 10</xref>), and two foramina (&#x02018;fo&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g010">Fig 10</xref>) pierce the bone surface ventral to that. The anterior foramen is at the anteroposterior level of the first alveolus and more dorsally located in relation to the posterior, which is at the level of the second alveolus. Additionally, a large number of smaller unevenly distributed pits are present along the lateral surface of the symphyseal area, but these cannot be recognised in the digital model of the dentary. The alveolar margin of the symphyseal portion of the dentary slopes slightly ventrally as it proceeds anteriorly. Posterior to that, the alveolar margin is straight. The first dentary tooth has the tip of its crown exposed (&#x02018;1st&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g010">Fig 10</xref>), but this is not visible in lateral view, indicating that it was still not fully erupted. Nevertheless, the anterior border of the first alveolus is located at the anterior extremity of the dentary, and it is not broader than those of the other alveoli. Thus, as in <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic> and <italic>Buriolestes</italic>, there is no gap between the first tooth position and the anterior tip of the dentary, differing from the condition inferred for <italic>Eoraptor</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and <italic>Panphagia</italic>, and more clearly observed in later sauropodomorphs such as <italic>Plateosaurus</italic> spp and <italic>Massospondylus</italic> spp. In lateral view, the anterior tip of the dentary has a triangular shape, pointing forwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g010">Fig 10</xref>). This morphology is more similar to that of <italic>Buriolestes</italic> and <italic>Eoraptor</italic>, differing from that of <italic>Plateosaurus</italic> spp, which possesses a more rounded anterior margin of the dentary in lateral view.</p><p>In ventral view, it is possible to observe an anteroposteriorly oriented groove (&#x02018;gr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g010">Fig 10D</xref>) extending between the lateral and medial margins of the dentary. This likely represents the posterior portion of the meckelian channel, which must have been also enclosed medially by the splenial and angular. Anteriorly, adjacent to the posterior end of the symphysis, a posteroventrally to anterodorsally oriented groove (&#x02018;amgr&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g010">Fig 10B</xref>), nearly 4 mm long, is visible in medial view, which might represent the anterior portion of the meckelian groove. However, the ventral surface of the dentary is damaged anteriorly, in a way that it is not possible to safely infer the total anterior extension of the groove. There is no visible connection between the grooves at the anterior end of the dentary and on the ventral surface of its posterior portion, but that might be due to the bad preservation of the ventral portion of the bone.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Dentition</title><p>For the description, teeth were labelled (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g009">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g010">10</xref>) according to their relative position along the antero-posterior axis (i.e. anterior most preserved tooth was labelled as &#x02018;1&#x02019;) and not according to the position they would occupy in the tooth row of the living animal.</p><p>Eight teeth are preserved in the left maxilla (&#x02018;1&#x02013;8&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

This value nearly matches the anteroposterior length (c. 44.5 mm) of the tooth row in the element here identified as the right dentary of MCP-3845-PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Thus, if the tooth bearing area of both dentaries are similar in length, and considering the anterior most preserved impression in the left element as that of its original first tooth, the tooth row would extend slightly posterior to the anterior margin of the external mandibular fenestra in the left dentary. Nevertheless, a most likely scenario is that the morphology of <italic>Saturnalia</italic> would be more similar to that observed in taxa such as <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic>, <italic>Panphagia</italic>, <italic>Plateosaurus</italic>. spp., and the saurischian <italic>Tawa hallae&#x000b8;</italic> with the tooth row not extending posteriorly beyond the anterior margin of the mandibular fenestra.</p><p>The ratio &#x02018;anteroposterior length of the tooth row/length from the tip of the dentary anteriorly till the anterior margin of the external mandibular fenestra posteriorly&#x02019; corresponds to nearly 0.75 in <italic>Panphagia</italic>, 0.8 in <italic>Plateosaurus erlenbergensis</italic> (AMNH 6810), and 0.85 in <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic> and <italic>Tawa</italic>. In this case, if we assume that the condition of <italic>Saturnalia</italic> matches that of <italic>Panphagia</italic> (which has the comparatively shorter tooth row), the length of the region between the anterior tip of the dentary and the anterior margin of the external mandible fenestra in would be about 59.3 mm in the right element of MCP-3845-PV of <italic>Saturnalia</italic>. In this case, the anteroposterior length of this region of the right dentary would be nearly 15 mm longer than in the left element as preserved. This discrepancy could imply that left and right dentaries referred to MCP-3845-PV did not belong to the same individual. However, such discrepancy decreases if we assume that the condition in <italic>Saturnalia</italic> was more similar to that of <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic>. In this case, the length from the anterior margin of the dentary until the anterior margin of the fenestra of the right dentary would be nearly 52.35 mm; only c. 8 mm longer than the left element. It is, however, also necessary to consider the possibility that the anterior most preserved tooth impression of the left dentary might not correspond to the original first tooth&#x02014;an inference made partially based on the similarity observed between this impression and the first dentary tooth of <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic>. In this sense, the first impression left on the sediment associated with the left dentary of MCP-3845-PV could correspond to a more posterior tooth. Hence, the left element might have been somewhat longer, also decreasing the size discrepancy between left and right dentaries.</p><p>In sum, our estimates for the anteroposterior length of each dentary of MCP-3845-PV slightly differ, providing evidence against the assumption that they belonged to the same individual. However, such length estimates were made based on fragmentary bones without directly comparable parts.

These values are congruent with the minimal and maximal values of cranial length estimated based on the size of the right frontal, 89,5 and 103 millimetres.

Our results (see above) agree with that overall estimate by [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A reduced skull (i.e. anteroposterior length corresponding to less than two thirds of the femoral length) is typical of sauropodomorph taxa within the less inclusive clade containing <italic>Plateosaurus</italic> and sauropods [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As our estimates indicate that this condition was also present in <italic>Saturnalia</italic>, there are several alternative scenarios to explain the pattern of skull reduction within Sauropodomorpha, which are related to different phylogenetic arrangements for the Carnian taxa. In some phylogenetic hypotheses (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221387.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0221387.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]), <italic>Saturnalia</italic> is found more closely related to Carnian forms that lack the reduced skull (e.g. <italic>Buriolestes</italic>, <italic>Eoraptor</italic>, <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic>, <italic>Panphagia</italic>) than to later forms such as <italic>Plateosaurus</italic> and sauropods. In this case, the reduced skull of <italic>Saturnalia</italic> would correspond to an independent acquisition relative to that observed in the later taxa. This is also a possible scenario under one of the phylogenetic arrangements presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g012">Fig 12B</xref>), in which the <italic>Saturnalia</italic> + <italic>Chromogisaurus</italic> clade is recovered in a polytomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g012">Fig 12B</xref>). A different pattern emerges from phylogenetic hypotheses where <italic>Saturnalia</italic>, or the clade it forms with <italic>Chromogisaurus</italic> (for which no cranial remains are known), is found more closely related to later forms than to other Carnian taxa (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]); as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g012">Fig 12A</xref>. In this case, a single event at that clade including <italic>Saturnalia</italic> and such latter forms is required to explain the skull reduction in the lineage.</p><p>The short skull is a well-recognized sauropodomorph feature, but the driving force behind this anatomical modification still remains enigmatic. The only offered explanation was that a small skull on a long neck might have allowed an omnivorous animal to secure small prey items by rapid head and neck movements [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. If the reduction of the skull only happened once, at the least inclusive clade including <italic>Saturnalia</italic> and later sauropodomorphs, this idea gains support from both tooth and braincase anatomy of MCP-3845-PV. Some of its mandibular teeth are posteriorly curved and a middle maxillary tooth has small serrations set perpendicular to the tooth margin. This differs from the oblique coarse serrations that are correlated to more herbivorous diets [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], departing from an herbivorous or even omnivorous diet. Regarding neuroanatomical evidences, <italic>Saturnalia</italic> exhibits an enlarged part of the cerebellum associated with the floccular fossae lobe (sensu [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). Large tissue volumes (i.e. flocculus and paraflocculus) in this region of the brain would have increased gaze stability and the ability to coordinate head and neck movements [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], allowing a more effective predatory behaviour. For instance, predatory birds usually show higher volumes of these tissues in comparison to their non-predatory relatives [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Given its small body size and reduced head, <italic>Saturnalia</italic> was likely unable to prey on medium/large tetrapods of the time. However, a small, light skull on a relatively elongated neck could have allowed the rapid head movements require to pursuit small, elusive prey items, such as insects and small vertebrates [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>In the broader context of sauropodomorph evolution, the specialization inferred for <italic>Saturnalia</italic> can highlight an important aspect of the evolutionary process, exaptation [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that a series of evolutionary innovations were crucial for the high efficiency of the strictly herbivore lifestyle of sauropods [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Among these, skull reduction significantly reduced the biomechanical constraints for neck elongation [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In turn, an elongated neck allowed access to food resources that were unreachable for other herbivores and created a larger feeding envelope, reducing energy consumption during food intake [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, the idea that skull reduction was first acquired in a likely predatory member of the sauropodomorph lineage (i.e. <italic>Saturnalia</italic>) implies a scenario where a trait related to one habit (faunivory) was crucial for the evolution of a completely different lifestyle (herbivory) in a subsequently different selection regime.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Early evolution of the jaw feeding apparatus of sauropodomorphs</title><p>Based on recent fossil discoveries and reassessments of early dinosaur phylogeny, it is possible to trace a more detailed scenario for the evolution of the feeding behaviour of sauropodomorphs during the first 30 million years of their evolutionary history (see also [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]).

Yet, if <italic>Buriolestes</italic> is not the sister-group of all other sauropodomorphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g012">Fig 12B</xref>), its diet would have to be interpreted as a reversal to the saurischian plesiomorphic condition.</p><p>The phylogenetic position of the Carnian dinosaur <italic>Eoraptor</italic> is still on dispute [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], with analyses placing it as a member of either Theropoda [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] or Sauropodomorpha [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Recently, in a reassessment of its anatomy [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], Sereno et al. [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] stated that most aspects of its tooth morphology, such as the presence of a first dentary tooth offset from the anterior end of the mandible and suppression of crown curvature, indicate a partially, or even fully herbivorous diet. Yet, the former feature has been demonstrated not to be significantly correlated to the acquisition of an herbivorous diet in dinosaurs [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and if curvature is indeed absent in some <italic>Eoraptor</italic> teeth, it is not in all of them (pers. obs.). Thus, the diet assessment of <italic>Eoraptor</italic> is still inconclusive. Similarly, <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic> bears traits that hampers the recognition of a fully herbivorous or faunivorous feeding behaviour. For instance, the fourth premaxillary tooth has serrations at both, mesial and distal carinae, a trait that has so far been recognized only in <italic>Buriolestes</italic> among Carnian sauropodomorphs, but that is widespread in theropods and other carnivorous archosaurs [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, the maxillary and dentary tooth crowns of <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic> are slightly recurved, but also expanded at their base, forming a sigmoidal distal margin. This differs from the spear-like tooth crowns of post-Carnian sauropodomorphs [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. On the other hand, the denticles of <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic> teeth form oblique angles with the margin of the tooth crown, a trait also present in post-Carnian sauropodomorphs, for which a more herbivorous diet is inferred [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Despite the presence of few well-preserved teeth, some traits associated with a faunivorous feeding behaviour can be observed in MCP-3845-PV. The denticles are perpendicular to the margin of the tooth crown, as in <italic>Buriolestes</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Some of the preserved crowns have a posteriorly curved mesial margin (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g010">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g011">11</xref>), although others are convex mesially and distally, with leaf shaped labial/lingual views. Indeed, the presence of such features suggests an at least partially faunivorous feeding behaviour for <italic>Saturnalia</italic> (see also [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]).</p><p>The results of the morphological disparity analysis show that the jaw feeding apparatus morphospace of these early Carnian taxa (i.e. <italic>Buriolestes</italic>, <italic>Eoraptor</italic>, <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic>, <italic>Panphagia</italic>, <italic>Saturnalia</italic>) have no overlap with that occupied by later taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g013">Fig 13</xref>). Thus, even if an omnivorous diet is inferred for some of the Carnian forms such as <italic>Saturnalia</italic>, <italic>Eoraptor</italic>, and <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic>, their feeding behaviour was likely different from that of later omnivorous taxa (see below).</p><p>A new late Carnian sauropodomorph, <italic>Bagualosaurus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], shows that lanceolate teeth with coarse denticles, as more commonly seen in younger Triassic (e.g. <italic>Efraasia minor</italic>, <italic>Plateosaurus</italic> spp., <italic>Unaysaurus tolentinoi</italic>, <italic>Coloradisaurus brevis</italic>, <italic>Pantydraco caducus</italic>, <italic>Thecodontosaurus antiquus</italic>) and Jurassic (e.g. <italic>Massospondylus</italic> spp. and <italic>Adeopapposaurus mognai</italic>) sauropodomorphs, developed earlier than previously thought. Unlike these later taxa, <italic>Bagualosaurus</italic> has minor or no overlap between tooth crowns, but the results of the morphological disparity analysis show that, even with such differences, the jaw feeding apparatus of <italic>Bagualosaurus</italic> is more similar to that of later sauropodomorphs than to that of other Carnian taxa, expanding the jaw feeding apparatus morphospace of the sauropodomorphs from that time interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g013">Fig 13</xref>).</p><p>Except for <italic>Coloradisaurus</italic>, all Norian-Rhaetian sauropodomorphs included in the morphological disparity analysis are non-massopodan plateosaurians. These taxa exhibit a series of characteristics (i.e. coarse denticles, leaf-shaped crowns, overlap between tooth crowns, increase in body mass) that indicate a shift to a more herbivorous diet when compared to that of the bulk of Carnian taxa [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The results of the analysis show that the morphospace of <italic>Coloradisaurus</italic> falls into the range of their contemporary taxa rather than into that occupied by its closest relatives (i.e. massopodans). This is not unexpected, given that the skull morphology of <italic>Coloradisaurus</italic> resembles that of non-massopodan plateosaurians, and its placement among massospondylids is mostly supported by postcranial characters [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As such, the separation of the &#x02018;Norian-Rhaetian&#x02019; and &#x02018;Early Jurassic&#x02019; morphospaces observed in our PCoA results cannot be attributed to the phylogenetic position of the taxa within each time interval (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g013">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g014">14</xref>).

As for the phylogenetic groupings, features of non-anchisaurian massopods such as <italic>Coloradisaurus</italic> and <italic>Yunnanosaurus huangi</italic>, which also has a dentition markedly different from that of its closest relatives [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], contribute to the great morphospace range occupied by that assemblage of sauropodomorphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g014">Fig 14</xref>).</p><p>The differentiation between a fully faunivorous and an omnivorous diet cannot rely only on tooth morphology, and the same is true for the differentiation between omnivorous or fully herbivorous taxa [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition, various Late Triassic and Early Jurassic sauropod or near-sauropod taxa are known only from fragmentary or incomplete cranial materials (e.g. <italic>Vulcanodon karibaensis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]; <italic>Lessemsaurus sauropoides</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]; <italic>Antetonitrus longiceps</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; <italic>Pulanesaura eocollum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]; <italic>Ingentia prima</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). In this context, the acquisition of a fully herbivorous diet in Sauropodomorpha has been associated with the development of a fully quadrupedal stance, with the loss of grasping hands, and the increase in body sizes, enhancing the absorption of nutrients during digestion [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Prior to recent discoveries, the fossil record of sauropodomorphs indicated that the transition to a fully herbivorous diet was thus more likely to have happened in the Early Jurassic [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, recent findings have shown that sauropodomorph gigantism predates the Triassic-Jurassic boundary [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], with the transition to fully herbivorous diets, at least in some lineages, having occurred still during the Triassic. In this context, the relatively small jaw feeding apparatus morphospace range associated with Late Triassic forms in comparison to that of Early Jurassic taxa might be an artefact of the paucity of cranial material associated with those large Late Triassic sauropodomorphs (see also [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). Nevertheless, the occupation of a large jaw feeding apparatus morphospace by Early Jurassic sauropodomorphs can be interpreted as an additional evidence of niche partitioning, as previously suggested based on the differences in their postcranial skeleton [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Thus, a stronger correlation between dental and postcranial adaptations towards herbivory may have also been recorded for the Late Triassic if a larger and more even specimen sample was known.</p><p>Finally, it is also important to stress some of the caveats associated with the results of our PCoA analyses (see also [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]). The morphospace occupied by a set of taxa grouped based both on temporal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g013">Fig 13</xref>) and phylogenetic position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g014">Fig 14</xref>), varies largely across graphs based on different PCos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221387.s003">S3 Appendix</xref>). For instance, the separation between Late Triassic and Early Jurassic taxa is recovered (i.e. visually assessed) when PCo1 is plotted against PCo2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221387.g013">Fig 13</xref>), but not when some other PCos are plotted against one another (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221387.s003">S3 Appendix</xref>). Additionally, the morphospace of the sauropodomorphs more closely related to <italic>Saturnalia tupiniquim</italic> than to <italic>Bagualosaurus agudoensis</italic> shows some overlap with those of other clades when PCo1 is plotted against PCo3 (but not when PCo2 is plotted against PCo3). Nevertheless, the results of the npMANOVA, which was conducted taking information on all PCO&#x02019;s into account, indicate that the separations observed between the groups (both the temporal and phylogenetic groups here defined) when PCo1 is plotted against PCo2 are statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Part of the osteology of the Carnian (Late Triassic) dinosaur <italic>Saturnalia</italic> has been described in a series of papers [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

The newly described material provides stronger support for the inference that <italic>Saturnalia</italic> possesses a reduced skull, typical of later sauropodomorphs. Furthermore, when this information is analysed alongside other aspects, including dental and brain-tissues anatomy, it suggests that the initial skull reduction of sauropodomorphs might have been indeed associated with an increase in efficiency of a predatory lifestyle as previously suggested [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0221387.g015" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0221387.g015</object-id><label>Fig 15</label><caption><title>Reconstruction of the skull of <italic>Saturnalia tupiniquim</italic> in lateral (A) and dorsal (B) views, with preserved bones highlighted in green.</title><p>Abbreviations: <bold>anf&#x02014;</bold>antorbital fenestra; <bold>bo&#x02014;</bold>basioccipital; <bold>d&#x02014;</bold>dentary; <bold>emf&#x02014;</bold>external mandibulary fenestra; <bold>en&#x02014;</bold>external naris; <bold>f&#x02014;</bold>frontal; <bold>l&#x02014;</bold>lacrimal; <bold>lt&#x02014;</bold>laterosphenoid; <bold>ltf&#x02014;</bold>laterotemporal fenestra; <bold>m&#x02014;</bold>maxilla; <bold>orb&#x02014;</bold>orbit; <bold>p&#x02014;</bold>parietal; <bold>po&#x02014;</bold>postorbital; <bold>pp&#x02014;</bold>paroccipital process; <bold>prf&#x02014;</bold>prefrontal; <bold>q</bold>&#x02014;quadrate; <bold>so&#x02014;</bold>supraoccipital; <bold>sq&#x02014;</bold>squamosal; <bold>stf&#x02014;</bold>supratemporal fenestra.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0221387.g015"/></fig><p>The description presented here will be source for future phylogenetic and/or comparative studies dealing with the early evolution of dinosaurs and sauropodomorphs. The results of the two phylogenetic analyses highlight the uncertainty on the relations among Carnian sauropodomorphs, with the hypotheses showing differences on the affinity of taxa such as <italic>Buriolestes</italic>, <italic>Chromogisaurus</italic>, <italic>Eoraptor</italic>, <italic>Pampadromaeus</italic>, <italic>Panphagia</italic>, and <italic>Saturnalia</italic> (see also [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). Thus, the hypothesis that features associated with the acquisition of a more omnivorous/herbivorous diet appeared in a stepwise fashion among sauropodomorphs does not fit to all possible phylogenetic scenarios. Nevertheless, the dental anatomy of <italic>Saturnalia</italic> adds evidence that the group achieved a relatively broad ecomorphological disparity in the Carnian, what might explain their higher diversity when compared to other dinosaur groups in the oldest dinosaur-bearing strata in South America.</p><p>Based on the new data from <italic>Saturnalia</italic> and other recently discovered taxa, the early evolution of the sauropodomorph diet can be traced in more detail. Carnian sauropodomorphs show great variety in tooth morphology, but still seemingly correspond to at least partially faunivorous taxa. One exception is the recently discovered <italic>Bagualosaurus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the tooth and postcranial anatomy (i.e. increase in body size) of which shows that a shift to a more herbivorous lifestyle have happened still during the Carnian. Our PCoA analysis reveals marked shifts in the morphology of the jaw features associated with the feeding behaviour through time. These shifts are ultimately linked to transformations in the postcranial anatomy (see also [<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0221387.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), and highlight that the first 55 million years of sauropodomorph evolution, from the Late Triassic (Carnian&#x02013;c. 230 Ma) to the last stages of the Early Jurassic (Toarcian&#x02013;c. 175 Ma), were marked by important changes in the ecomorphology of the group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0221387.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Details of the phylogenetic analyses presented in this study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0221387.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0221387.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Part of the skull roof of <italic>Saturnalia tupiniquim</italic> MCP-3845-PV in dorsal view.</title><p>(JPG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0221387.s002.jpg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0221387.s003"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>Data matrix and additional results of the principal co-ordinates analysis.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0221387.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are thankful to Pedro L.
