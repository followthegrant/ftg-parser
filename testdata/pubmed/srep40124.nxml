Although several enzymes and regulators for starch biosynthesis have been characterized, a complete regulatory network for starch synthesis in cereal seeds remains elusive. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the rice <italic>Brittle1 (OsBT1</italic>) gene, which is expressed specifically in the developing endosperm. The <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant showed a white-core endosperm and a significantly lower grain weight than the wild-type. The formation and development of compound starch granules in <italic>osbt1</italic> was obviously defective: the amyloplast was disintegrated at early developmental stages and the starch granules were disperse and not compound in the endosperm cells in the centre region of <italic>osbt1</italic> seeds. The total starch content and amylose content was decreased and the physicochemical properties of starch were altered. Moreover, the degree of polymerization (DP) of amylopectin in <italic>osbt1</italic> was remarkably different from that of wild-type. Map-based cloning of <italic>OsBT1</italic> indicated that it encodes a putatively ADP-glucose transporter. <italic>OsBT1</italic> coded protein localizes in the amyloplast envelope membrane. Furthermore, the expression of starch synthesis related genes was also altered in the <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant. These findings indicate that <italic>OsBT1</italic> plays an important role in starch synthesis and the formation of compound starch granules.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Starch is the main storage carbohydrate in higher plants and not only is the primary source of calories in human diet but also has great value in industrial applications. Because its starch content, rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.) is one of the most important staple foods for more than half of the world&#x02019;s population. Starch synthesis and accumulation occur in the amyloplasts that exist in tubers, cotyledons, and endosperms, and is also an important determinant for crop yield<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Starch comprises two major components, amylose and amylopectin. A series of key enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis have been identified. ADP-glucose (ADPG) is the substrate for starch synthesis, which is converted from glucose-1-phosphate by ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase). Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI), which is encoded by the <italic>Waxy</italic> gene is required for the synthesis of amylose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. On the other hand, a series of starch synthases (SSI, SSII, SSIII, and SSIV), starch branching enzymes (BEI and BEII), and starch debranching enzymes (ISA and Pullulanase) control the synthesis of amylopectin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Mutants defective in these genes show abnormal characteristics of endosperm stored starch. For instance, mutations in <italic>OsAGPL2</italic> and <italic>OsAGPS2b</italic> (encoding a large and small AGPase subunits, respectively) cause a shrunken endosperm, due to a significant reduction in starch synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Loss-of-function mutations of the rice <italic>GBSSI (Waxy</italic>) gene produce an amylose-free endosperm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. A deficiency of <italic>SSIIIa</italic> leads to abnormal amylose content, amylopectin structure, and starch granule properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Loss-of-function mutation of <italic>ISA1</italic> produces a sugary endosperm and a dramatic alteration of polyglucan structure from amylopectin to phytoglycogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Mutation of <italic>BEIIb</italic> in the <italic>amylose-extender (ae</italic>) mutant generates a chalkiness endosperm and alterations in the structure of amylopectin and in the gelatinization properties of starch granules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Besides these key enzyme genes, several regulators are known to indirectly regulate starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm. For instance, FLO2, a tetratricopeptide (TPR) domain-containing protein, regulates the expression of genes involved in the production of storage starch and storage proteins in the endosperm <italic>via</italic> interaction with a bHLH protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. <italic>FLO6</italic>, encoding a CBM48 domain-containing protein, is involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis putatively through interaction with ISA1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. <italic>Grain Incomplete Filling 1 (GIF1</italic>) encodes a cell-wall invertase that regulates sucrose unloading, and the mutation of <italic>GIF1</italic> leads to significantly reduced starch content and grain weight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Mutant for the <italic>OsAlaAT1</italic> gene, encoding an alanine-aminotransferase, also displays altered amylose content and amylopectin structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP58 can regulate the expression of six starch-synthesizing genes by directly binding to their promoters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. <italic>Rice Starch Regulator (RSR1</italic>), encoding an AP2/EREBP family transcription factor, negatively regulates the expression of type I starch synthesis genes, and <italic>RSR1</italic> deficiency results in enhanced expression of starch synthesis genes in seeds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Despite all these advances, the identification of novel genes involved in starch synthesis is necessary to understand the molecular network underlying starch synthesis and seed quality formation in rice.</p><p>As the substrate for starch synthesis, ADPG needs to be transported into amyloplasts from the cytosol by an ADPG transporter located in the envelope membrane of amyloplasts. Sullivan <italic>et al</italic>. first proposed BT1 proteins as ADPG transporters in cereal endosperms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. These BT1 proteins belong to the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Although MCF proteins are presumed to be targeted to the mitochondrial inner membrane in plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, some also occur in peroxisomes, glyoxysomes, plasma membrane, and plastids and are involved in the transport of diverse solutes across these organelle membranes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Transport studies have shown that maize ZmBT1, barley HvNST1, and wheat TaBT1 are able to transport ADPG in counter exchange with ADP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. OsBT1 corresponds to the rice orthologue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> which may also function to transport ADPG.</p><p>In this study, we characterize a white-core endosperm mutant, <italic>osbt1</italic>. Map-based cloning showed that <italic>OsBT1</italic> encodes an ADPG transporter which locates in the amyloplast envelope membrane and functions in the regulation of starch biosynthesis and compound starch granule formation during rice seed development.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The rice <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant has a defect in endosperm appearance and grain weight</title><p>Numerous mutants with chalky endosperm induced by tissue culture were screened and a mutant with white core was obtained and later named <italic>osbt1</italic>. The endosperm of <italic>osbt1</italic> was opaque and presented a white-core in the centre region of the seed, while the periphery region was translucent compared to that of wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b,e,f</xref>). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of transverse sections indicated that the starch grains (SGs) in both central and periphery regions of the wild-type endosperm cells were polyhedral and densely packed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). The SGs in the endosperm peripheral cells of the <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant were similar to those of the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>), while those in the inner endosperm cells of the mutant were loosely packed with spherical or oval and smooth surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Quantification of seed size showed no significant differences between wild-type and <italic>osbt1</italic> in terms of seed length, width, and thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i&#x02013;k</xref>), though 1000-grain weight in <italic>osbt1</italic> was significantly decreased compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1l</xref>). Besides the endosperm defect and lower grain weight, <italic>osbt1</italic> plants did not display any visible differences from wild-type during the whole growth period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The compound starch granules in <italic>osbt1</italic> endosperm cells are abnormal</title><p>Semi-thin sections of developing endosperms at 9 days after fertilization (DAF) were prepared to compare the formation of compound starch granules in endosperm cells between <italic>osbt1</italic> and wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The results showed that the amyloplasts in wild-type endosperm cells were composed of several polyhedral, sharp-edged, and easily separable granules, forming well developed compound starch granules. The entire central region of the wild-type endosperm was almost filled with compound starch granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). However, abundant single starch granules were observed in the centre of the <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant endosperm. In addition, some abnormal weakly stained granules were also observed in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). By contrast, the endosperm peripheral cells of <italic>osbt1</italic> were similar to those of wild-type, both having fewer well developed compound starch granules and some immature amyloplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,f</xref>).</p><p>Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis was further carried out to observe the development of compound starch granules. The amyloplasts in the endosperm peripheral cells of both wild-type and <italic>osbt1,</italic> and the central endosperm cells of wild-type were filled with about a dozen of polyhedral starch granules and the space between the starch granules was gradually occupied during seed development, to eventually form normal compound starch granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;e</xref>). However, in the <italic>osbt1</italic>, the amyloplasts were disintegrated at early developmental stages and the starch granules were dispersive through the central endosperm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f&#x02013;h</xref>), which was consistent with the results observed in the semi-thin sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Starch physicochemical properties are altered in the <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant</title><p>An analysis of the physicochemical characteristics of the starch was performed in wild-type and the <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant. The total starch and amylose contents were significantly decreased in <italic>osbt1</italic> compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). The protein content was lower, while the lipid content was clearly higher than those in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). To further examine the fine structure of amylopectin, the chain length distribution of amylopectin was also determined. Compared to wild-type, the proportion of short chains with degree of polymerization (DP) values between 7 and 17 were elevated in the mutant, whereas the proportion of intermediate chains with DP values between 18 and 30 were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p><p>The starch pasting properties were analyzed with a rapid visco analyzer (RVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). The starch pasting characteristics in wild-type showed distinct parameters represented by a peak viscosity, a fast viscosity increase when the temperature decreased and a high final viscosity value. The viscosity pattern of the <italic>osbt1</italic> starch presented a trend similar to wild-type, but was maintained at lower levels, with a final viscosity of 68% of that of wild-type. The thermal gelatinization temperature of endosperm starch from wild-type and <italic>osbt1</italic> were analyzed and the result showed that the onset (To), peak (Tp), and conclusion (Tc) temperatures of gelatinization of endosperm starch in the <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant were all about 3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C lower than those in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). The gelatinization properties of the SGs were also examined by measuring solubility in urea solutions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Various concentrations (0&#x02013;9&#x02009;M) of urea solutions were added to powdered starch. The result showed that the gelatinization characteristics of <italic>osbt1</italic> starch have most significant differences in 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;M urea from that of wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>). In summary, the starch physicochemical characteristics of <italic>osbt1</italic> were obviously different from those of the wild-type.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Map-based cloning and complementation of the <italic>OsBT1</italic> gene</title><p>Map-based cloning was carried out to identify the gene affected in the mutant. An F<sub>2</sub> segregating population was created by crossing the <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant (<italic>japonica</italic>) with NJ-11 (<italic>indica</italic>). The mutated locus was first mapped to a short arm in chromosome 2 between the simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers RM12669 and RM12679. Based on three SSR markers and three newly-developed insertion/deletion (Indel) markers, the <italic>osbt1</italic> locus was further narrowed down to a 39.5-kb region between markers Ind3 and Ind10 by using a total of 1,222 recessive homozygous individuals. Seven open reading frames (ORFs) were included in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). Sequence analysis revealed that there was a 18-bp repeat insertion in ORF2 (<italic>Os02g0202400</italic>) in the mutant, which lead to a six amino acid increase in the encoded protein compared to the wild-type sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). The three-dimensional structures of OsBT1 in wild-type and <italic>osbt1</italic> were predicted using Protein Homology/analogy Recognition Engine V 2.0 (Phyre2) web portal, the result showed that the OsBT1 protein cannot be normally folded due to six amino acids added in <italic>osbt1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>To test whether <italic>Os02g0202400</italic> corresponds to the candidate <italic>OsBT1</italic> gene, a vector bearing the <italic>OsBT1</italic> genomic sequence including its native promoter and a vector bearing the <italic>OsBT1</italic> coding region driven by the <italic>Actin1</italic> promoter were constructed and introduced into the <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant. The expression of <italic>OsBT1</italic> in complementary and overexpressing lines was significant higher than that in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). Seeds produced by independent positive transgenic T<sub>1</sub> lines showed to the wild-type appearance restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). The 1000 brown grains weight in complementary and overexpressing lines also restored to wild-type level and the brown grain length, width, and thickness had no significant differences compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). The SGs in endosperm cells of these positive transgenic lines also presented the polyhedral and densely packed granules morphology, similar to those of wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). A further validation was obtained by analyzing <italic>Os02g0202400</italic> RNAi knock-down plants (Ri) generated in a wild-type genetic background which showed reduced expression of <italic>OsBT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>).

In addition, the quantitative trait locus <italic>Chalk5</italic> was also identified to influence grain chalkiness in rice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Most of these mutants show decreased amylose content and changed amylopectin structure, and some also exhibit slower grain-filling and decreased 1000-grain weight.</p><p>In this study, we isolated and characterized the <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant, which exhibits white-core endosperm, abnormal compound starch granules formation, decreased starch content, altered amylopectin structure and physiochemical properties and significant reduced final grain weight. These data indicate that starch synthesis in <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant endosperm is seriously affected. In addition, the morphology of the compound starch granules in amyloplasts of some endosperm-defective mutants has also been reported to be abnormal. For example, mutations in <italic>SSG4</italic> and <italic>SSG6</italic> develop enlarged amyloplasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, while <italic>flo6</italic> endosperm contains smaller and abnormal compound granules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In our case, the amyloplasts were disintegrated at early developmental stages and the starch granules were dispersive (not compound) in the central endosperm cells of <italic>osbt1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). We propose that <italic>OsBT1</italic> plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the structure of the amyloplast envelope membrane.</p><p>Usually, regulators of starch synthesis affect the expression level of genes encoding key enzymes of the starch synthesis pathway. For example, <italic>RSR1</italic> negatively regulates the expression of type I starch synthesis genes (i.e. the expression of most starch synthesis genes is higher in the <italic>rsr1</italic> mutant and repressed in <italic>RSR1</italic>-overexpressing lines)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. When another starch biosynthesis regulator, <italic>OsbZIP58,</italic> was inactivated, the expression of <italic>OsAGPS2b, OsAGPL2, OsSSI, OsSSIIIa, OsSSIVb, OsBEIIb</italic>, and <italic>OsISA2</italic> was distinctly up-regulated, while that of <italic>OsAGPL3, OsPHO1, Wx</italic>, and <italic>SBE1</italic> was down-regulated, leading to a reduced content of total starch and amylose. Also, the fine structure of amylopectin is altered in the <italic>osbzip58</italic> mutant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. When <italic>Chalk5</italic>, which encodes a vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-translocating pyrophosphatase influencing grain chalkiness in rice, is over-expressed, the transcript levels of eight genes involved in starch metabolism are significant elevated in seeds at 5 DAF, implying a feedback regulation of <italic>Chalk5</italic> expression in controlling grain chalkiness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. In our study, the expression of several key starch synthesis genes was significantly enhanced in the endosperm of <italic>osbt1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). Expression changes of some starch synthesis related genes may alter the structure of amylopectin that further changes the crystalline structure of the starch granule, consequently affecting the physicochemical properties of starch. For example, SSI appears to be primarily responsible for synthesizing shorter chains of amylopectin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, whereas BEIIb functioned in the branching of short chains, as revealed by <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. So the increased short chains in <italic>osbt1</italic> may result from enhanced <italic>OsSSI</italic> and <italic>OsBEIIb</italic> expression. In our study, the increased short chains lead to a lower gelatinization temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>), which was consistent with what was observed in the <italic>sbe1</italic> mutant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. For these starch synthesis related genes located downstream of <italic>OsBT1</italic>, mutation of <italic>OsBT1</italic> results in lack of enough substrate for starch synthesis, so the elevated expression of starch synthesis related genes likely involve a physiological feedback regulation, which is similar to that in the <italic>osbzip58</italic> and <italic>rsr1</italic> mutant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>As the predominantly product of photosynthesis, sucrose occurs in source leaves, which is then transported into endosperm cells to be used as carbon source for starch synthesis. Sucrose is divided and converted into ADPG, G6P, and Glc and then imported into amyloplasts by their corresponding transporters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>). The glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT), which is located on the endosperm plastid envelope membranes, is responsible for transporting G6P into plastids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. The plastidic glucose transporter (pGlcT) located in the envelope of chloroplasts has a role in the export of glucose, and also is located in the envelope of endosperm amyloplast with the role to import glucose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. As substrate of starch synthesis in endosperm cells, ADPG needs to be transported into the amyloplast by the ADPG transporter located in its envelope from the cytosol. The designation of BRITTLE-1 (BT1) protein as the ADPG transporter in cereal endosperms was first proposed by Sullivan <italic>et al</italic>. (1991)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and then characterized in maize, barley, and wheat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In this study, the rice <italic>OsBT1</italic> gene was identified using a forward genetics approach. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OsBT1 is located to the envelope membrane of amyloplasts. Thus, we proposed that OsBT1 is the ADPG transporter in rice endosperm cells. To validate our hypothesis, we carried out import studies using [<sup>14</sup>C] ADPG into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells harboring recombinant OsBT1, however this assumption was also recently confirmed by Cakir <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Together, these data demonstrate that OsBT1 is the rice ADPG transporter which transports the substrate ADPG into amyloplasts from the cytosol of endosperm cells.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that <italic>OsBT1</italic> has an essential role in starch synthesis and compound starch granule formation. Ongoing efforts are still needed to identify new regulatory steps of starch biosynthesis as means to aid breeders and biotechnologists to improve quality in crops.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>osbt1</italic> mutant was generated from <italic>Oryza sativa japonica</italic> cv.
