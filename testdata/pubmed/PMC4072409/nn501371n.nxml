Here we report a simple and versatile coaxial turbulent jet mixer that can synthesize a variety of NPs at high throughput up to 3 kg/d, while maintaining the advantages of homogeneity, reproducibility, and tunability that are normally accessible only in specialized microscale mixing devices.

The velocity ratio defines how fast the inner fluid emerges relative to the outer fluid, while the Reynolds number captures the effect of fluid inertia relative to viscous forces. In our experiments, flow rates of inner (<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) and outer (<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>) fluid streams were controlled by using syringe pumps to vary <italic>Re</italic> and <italic>R</italic> (<xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information eq S1 and S2</xref>).</p><p>Fluid flow and mixing in the device was visualized using a phenolphthalein solution as the inner fluid, which becomes colorless upon mixing with the acidic outer stream (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b). The flow behavior was categorized into laminar, transition, vortex and turbulence, and turbulent jet regimes as summarized in the phase diagram (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c) obtained by analyzing the flow images (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b) and videos (<xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information Video S1</xref>). When <italic>R</italic> &#x0003c; 1, the inner fluid is focused by the outer fluid and the lower velocity of the inner fluid stream at the tip of the needle creates recirculating vortices at low <italic>Re</italic>. Mixing time is difficult to quantify in this regime due to entrainment of the fluid in vortices. In this regime the flow rate of the inner fluid is very low (<italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &#x02272; 0.01 <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>), making it less desirable for NP synthesis. This regime transitions to vortices and turbulence at higher <italic>Re</italic>, where a microvortex is generated at the tip of the needle and turbulence is developed downstream. At higher velocity ratios (<italic>R</italic> &#x02273; 1), the flow remains laminar at low <italic>Re</italic> and a stable stratified flow is maintained.

The coaxial turbulent jet mixer can be prepared within 30 min without any specialized equipment, microfabrication facilities, or specialized skills. In addition, the coaxial turbulent jet mixer can be made from standard fittings and materials that exhibit good solvent resistance. The fluid flow and mixing process does not require very precise alignment of the inner and outer tubes. To ensure that the inner tube is coaxially aligned with the outer tube (typically within 0.5 mm of the axis of the outer tube) we used metal syringe needle as the inner tube and fixed the outer flexible tubing on a rigid plate. The flow behavior in the coaxial turbulent jet mixer was captured as images and videos by systematically changing <italic>R</italic> and <italic>Re</italic> and summarized as phase diagram (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c). If there are significant differences in relative densities and viscosities of the inner and outer fluid, the inner stream can touch the inner wall of outer tube in the laminar flow regime. In the vortex and turbulence regime and turbulent jet regime, on the other hand, this effect is negligible because of fast lateral flow velocity of fluids. Since the coaxial turbulent jet mixer was operated in the turbulent jet regime for NP synthesis, the effect of small differences in relative densities and viscosities on NP synthesis is negligible. By flowing NP precursor and nonsolvent through inner and outer tubes, respectively, we can fix the ratio of NP precursor and nonsolvent, which is one of the important parameters that determines the NP size distribution. As proof of concept, we demonstrated the synthesis of PLGA&#x02013;PEG NPs, lipid vesicles, iron oxide NPs, polystyrene NPs, and siRNA/PEI polyplex NPs, which are the major types of NPs widely used in biomedical applications. In addition, we demonstrated single-step encapsulation of various functional agents including anticancer drug, insulin, fluorescent dyes, and siRNA. The synthesized NPs could be easily recovered and separated by using ultrafiltration or freeze-dry method. We expect that this mixer design can be used to synthesize other types of NPs and microparticles.</p><p>The coaxial turbulent jet mixer can resolve the production rate issue without compromising on the controllability and reproducibility offered by microfluidic platforms. NP precursors are introduced through inner stream that is surrounded by the outer stream, mitigating direct precipitation on the surfaces. Moreover, since the high flow speed of the fluid washes away all precipitates toward collection bath, there is no buildup of precipitate onto the channel wall even after operation for a long time (<xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information Figure S4</xref>). The coaxial turbulent jet mixer could achieve a production rate up to 2.19 g/min, which is equivalent to 3.15 kg/d and 1.15 ton/yr. Considering that the production rates typically required for drug delivery applications in clinical studies and industrial-scale production of NPs are on the order of 0.1 and 1 kg/d, respectively, it is noteworthy that a single coaxial turbulent jet mixer can meet both requirements. In addition, controlled and rapid mixing in the coaxial turbulent jet mixer leads to more homogeneous and smaller NPs compared to those synthesized by conventional bulk synthesis methods. Since smaller NPs can penetrate more deeply into solid tumors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> the coaxial turbulent jet mixer has the potential to synthesize NPs with better drug delivery performance compared to conventional bulk methods. As a proof of concept, siRNA/PEI polyplex NPs were formulated using the coaxial mixer device, which could knock down the target gene more effectively as compared to a commercially available transfection agent at lower siRNA dose (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b). The coaxial turbulent jet mixer also allows for reproducible synthesis of NPs from quantities suitable for <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (requiring only a few seconds for synthesis) all the way up to industrial-scale production. One can also envision directly jetting the inner fluid into a stirred beaker for rapid mixing to provide better control over conventional nanoprecipitation in bulk, although the nanoprecipitation conditions will vary as the composition of the solution in the beaker changes with time. The ability to synthesize NPs at quantities over the entire range from initial benchtop screening all the way to manufacture obviates many of the issues regarding reoptimization of NP synthesis processes to account for changes in NP properties that usually occur with scale-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We reported a simple and versatile coaxial turbulent jet mixer that can synthesize various types of NPs with high production rates up to 3.15 kg/d.

Docetaxel loading in the PLGA&#x02013;PEG NPs were measured by HPLC (Agilent Technologies, 1100 Series) using established procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> Insulin loading in the PLGA&#x02013;PEG NPs was measured by a protein bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Lamda Biotech). Fluorescence images of lipid vesicles and polystyrene NPs were acquired using an epi-fluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE 2000-U, Nikon). The typical sample volume for characterization was 15 and 1.1 mL for coaxial turbulent jet mixer and bulk synthesis method, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.9"><title><italic>In Vitro</italic> Transfection</title><p>All the <italic>in vitro</italic> transfection experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Dual-Luciferase (Luc) HeLa cells were grown and then seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10000 cells/well 18 h before transfection. The cells were incubated for 24 h with various amounts of siRNA/PEI polyplex NPs in media without FBS. For all the NP treatments encapsulating GL3 siRNA, scrambled siRNA/PEI polyplex NP was used as negative control. Lipo2000/siRNA complex was formulated following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (Invitrogen) and was used as a positive control for transfection. After the incubation period, the cells were washed with growth media and allowed to grow for a period of 24 h. The HeLa cells were then analyzed for expression of firefly and renilla luciferase signals by using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The luminescence intensity was measured using a microplate reader (BioTek).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the Koch-Prostate Cancer Foundation Award in Nanotherapeutics (R.L. and O.C.F.), by the Concept Development Grant 5P50CA090381&#x02013;09 from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Prostate SPORE (O.C.F.), by NIH Grants EB015419 (O.C.F. and R.K.), CA119349 (R.L. and O.C.F.), and EB003647 (O.C.F.).
