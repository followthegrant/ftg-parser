Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated HNSCC, which represents 20% of all HNSCC, demonstrates good responses to standard anti-cancer therapies with disease-specific survival rates of &#x02265; 80% [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Conversely, half or more of all patients diagnosed with advanced-stage carcinogen-associated HNSCC will die from their disease within 5 years. Further, current treatment strategies often functionally disable patients that do respond well to therapy and lead to long-term quality of life impairment [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Clearly, more efficacious treatment options are needed for this patient population.</p><p>Emerging data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has identified genomic changes associated with the development of HNSCC [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Alterations in <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>FGFR1/3</italic>, <italic>IGFR</italic>, <italic>PIK3CA</italic> or <italic>RAS</italic> genes are found in 60% of HPV-negative HNSCC and drive direct or cross-talk activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular related signal kinases 1 and 2 (MEK/ERK1/2) pathways [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As such, therapeutic inhibition of these pathways with small molecule inhibitors in models of head and neck cancer have been extensively investigated [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Benefit versus toxicity from therapy targeting the PI3K/mTOR and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways alone or in combination is a concern [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Given the important role of these signaling pathways in a number of physiologic systems, targeted therapies can have both desirable, inhibitory effect on cancer cells as well as undesirable effects on other cell types. No where is this more evident than on cells of innate and adaptive immunity, where different targeted therapies may directly suppress a number of different stimulatory and effector functions [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The majority of pre-clinical investigation involves the use of xenograft models, which to do not allow the study of how systemic agents affect adaptive immunity activation. Recognition of how different anti-tumor agents affect immune cell function is critical given the interest in combining targeted and immune-activating anti-cancer therapies [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but poorly studied.</p><p>The murine oral cancer (MOC) model is a syngeneic model that allows study of host anti-tumor immunity. Previous work has demonstrated that MOC1 cells, which exhibit a high genomic alteration rate, generate tumors with increased CD8 T-cell infiltration and increased interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN&#x003b3;), MHC class I and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression compared to MOC2 tumors in immune-competent mice [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similar to MOC1, roughly two-thirds of HNSCC tumors demonstrate a high degree of genomic alterations and increased immunoreactive infiltrates. Conversely, similar to MOC2, human HNSCCs include a subset of <italic>RAS</italic> mutant tumors with low frequency of genetic alterations and limited immunogenicity [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The effects of PI3K/mTOR and MAPK pathway targeting agents on anti-tumor immunity are of interest given the demonstrated activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the potential for enhanced patient responses with combining these immune-modulators with targeted therapies.</p><p>Here, we characterized the anti-tumor and immune effects of rapamycin, an FDA-approved inhibitor of mTOR signaling, and an investigational MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901 in these syngeneic MOC1 and 2 murine models of <italic>Ras</italic>-mutant oral cavity cancer. We validated on-target effects of these agents both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and the ability of both drugs to suppress primary tumor growth while on-treatment, yet demonstrated that MEK inhibition alone consistently resulted in measurable altered MOC cell viability and function with little effect following mTOR inhibition. Paradoxically, mTOR but not MEK inhibition resulted in durable tumor control following cessation of therapy in immunogenic MOC1 but not poorly immunogenic MOC2 tumors. We demonstrated that this differential response is not due to enhanced tumor cell-specific effects of <italic>in vivo</italic> mTOR inhibition but rather due to preservation of antigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses that are suppressed following MEK inhibition. We experimentally validate the relative preservation of T-cell expansion and activation following mTOR inhibition and significant suppression following MEK inhibition. Finally, we mechanistically demonstrated that <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth suppression following mTOR inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic> is CD8 cell dependent. These data have significant implications in the design of future experiments combing in these agents with immune-activating therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>MEK but not mTOR inhibition directly alters viability and function of MOC cells <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>As Murine Oral Cancer (MOC) cells carry activating <italic>Ras</italic> mutations secondary to DMBA-induced carcinogenesis, we hypothesized that MOC cells would demonstrate variable sensitivity to rapamycin and PD901 treatment <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Conversely, mTOR inhibition with rapamycin failed to reach an IC<sub>50</sub> dose in either cell line despite treatment with concentrations as high as 20 &#x003bc;M, indicating that MEK but not mTOR inhibition is directly cytotoxic to MOC1 and 2 cells.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title><italic>In vitro</italic> characterization of the effects of MEK and mTOR inhibition on MOC1 and 2 cells</title><p><bold>A.</bold> XTT assay data, following treatment with rapamycin or PD901 at the doses indicated for 48 hours.

For these experiments, the IC<sub>50</sub> dose of PD901, which falls within the serum concentration achieved in patients [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], was used. As no IC<sub>50</sub> dose of rapamycin was achieved, a concentration of 1 &#x003bc;M was used for these experiments. Treatment with PD901 resulted in reduced phosphorylation of downstream ERK1/2 (T202/Y204) as expected, but also reduced phosphorylation of AKT (both residues) and S6K (S240/244) downstream of mTOR in MOC1 cells. Interestingly, MEK inhibition increased phosphorylation of AKT at the T308 residue and only modestly limited S6 phosphorylation in MOC2 cells, consistent with enhanced signaling though PI3K/PDK1 [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Rapamycin treatment suppressed phosphorylation of S6K as expected, but enhanced cross-activation of ERK to a greater degree in MOC2 than MOC1. Rapamycin also reduced phosphorylation of AKT at residue S473, consistent with mTORC2 suppression, but increased AKT T308 phosphorylation in MOC2 &#x0003e; MOC1, suggesting enhanced PI3K signaling through release of mTOR/S6K mediated negative-feedback inhibition [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Neither drug appeared to alter phosphorylation of RelA/p65 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Together, the compensatory activation of ERK and AKT provide a potential explanation for the limited anti-proliferative effects of rapamycin observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Indeed, combination treatment induced significant suppression of both ERK and S6K phosphorylation. Thus, PD901 and rapamycin individually block phosphorylation of signaling proteins downstream of their expected targets, and observed compensatory activation of the untargeted pathway may be overcome with combination therapy.</p><p>HNSCC cells express angiogenic cytokines such as CXCL1 and VEGF downstream of PI3K and MAPK signaling [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The production of both cytokines was significantly higher at baseline in MOC2 than MOC1 cells (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In MOC1 cells, PD901 but not rapamycin consistently inhibited expression of CXCL1 and VEGF. In MOC2 cells, both rapamycin and PD901 significantly reduced CXCL1 and VEGF expression. In MOC cells, expression of adhesion and stem cell marker CD44 is tightly linked to ERK1/2 signaling [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Treatment with PD901 significantly reduced CD44 cell surface expression on both MOC1 and MOC2 cells, whereas rapamycin enhanced CD44 expression on MOC2 cells following treatment (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). To assess alterations in migratory capacity, an <italic>in vitro</italic> wounding assay was performed (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). PD901 but not rapamycin inhibition consistently reduced MOC cell migratory capacity in both MOC1 and 2 cells. Taken together, these data indicate that while both PD901 and rapamycin are able to block signaling through their respective targets, cytotoxicity is induced, cytokine and CD44 expression is altered and cellular migration is reduced following MEK but not mTOR inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic>. The predominant dependence of these cellular features on MEK signaling is consistent with the <italic>Ras</italic>-mutant genotype of MOC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Both MEK and mTOR inhibition significantly reduce MOC primary tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Anti-cancer therapies often demonstrate effects in the complex tumor microenvironment beyond what is observed in culture. Above, we established that MEK significantly alters MOC1 and 2 cell viability and function. Conversely, mTOR inhibition appears to have little direct effect on MOC cells. To assess the effect of MEK and mTOR inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic>, MOC1 and MOC2 cells were transplanted into the flanks of immune-competent C57BL/6 mice and treated with PD901 and rapamycin alone or in combination. Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> demonstrates MOC1 and MOC2 tumors excised following 21 days of treatment with drug or control (MOC1 day 50, MOC2 day 34), highlighting differences in tumor size and vascularity with treatment. In immunogenic MOC1 tumors, treatment with either drug alone significantly reduced primary tumor growth (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, graph and table). Since either drug alone had significant effects, combining PD901 and rapamycin did not significantly enhance primary growth suppression in MOC1. Conversely, the combination of drugs significantly reduced primary tumor growth over either drug alone in poorly immunogenic MOC2 tumors. MEK blockade alone inhibited primary tumor growth more than mTOR blockade alone in MOC2 tumors, though the difference did not reach statistical significance. Combination rapamycin and PD901 was well tolerated with no treatment-associated weight loss while on treatment in either group, contrasted with MOC2 control mice that began to lose weight due to tumor associated cachexia toward the end of the treatment period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig S1</xref>). These data suggest that while active MEK inhibition suppresses the growth of primary MOC1 and 2 tumors as expected, mTOR inhibition alone results in significant primary tumor growth inhibition in immunogenic MOC1 tumors despite there being no evidence of direct MOC1 cell cytotoxicity following mTOR inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Alteration of primary tumor growth following MEK and mTOR inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p><bold>A.</bold> Representative photographs of MOC1 (day 50) and MOC2 (day 34) tumor-bearing mice and corresponding excised tumors. <bold>B.</bold> Primary tumor growth curves for MOC1 and MOC2 tumors with indicated 21-day treatment period.

In MOC2 tumor-bearing mice, primary tumors grew rapidly following cessation of treatment with PD901 treated mice reaching euthanization criteria due to either primary tumor size (&#x0003e;2 cm diameter) or moribund status within one week (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). MOC2 mice treated with rapamycin or combination demonstrated modest but statistically significant enhanced survival beyond control or PD901 treated mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Similarly, MOC1 tumor-bearing mice treated with PD901 demonstrated aggressive tumor growth rebound following cessation of treatment with statistically significant but minimal prolonged survival compared to control. Interestingly, the majority of MOC1 tumor-bearing mice treated with rapamycin alone or in combination with PD901 demonstrated durable primary growth suppression and survived to the end of the experiment (100 days). Combining PD901 with rapamycin appeared to attenuate the delayed growth and survival advantage over that observed with rapamycin alone. Again, despite having no direct cytotoxic effects <italic>in vitro</italic>, rapamycin appears to promote more durable primary tumor growth control and survival beyond that observed with PD901 in mice bearing RAS-mutant MOC tumors. Interestingly, this durable treatment effect of rapamycin is notably more pronounced in immunogenic MOC1 tumors than in poorly immunogenic MOC2 tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>MEK but not mTOR inhibition consistently results in decreased proliferation and induction of apoptosis in MOC tumors</title><p>To investigate mechanisms to explain the differences in response to therapy between MEK and mTOR inhibition in MOC tumor bearing mice, we wished to validate the on-target effects of PD901 and rapamycin treatment <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> data, MEK inhibition with PD901 significantly reduced the phosphorylation of ERK and S6 in MOC1 and MOC2 tumors (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Rapamycin treatment suppressed phosphorylation of S6 and either did not alter (MOC1) or enhanced phosphorylation of ERK (MOC2), similar to effects <italic>in vitro</italic>. Enhanced phosphorylation of ERK following rapamycin treatment in MOC2 tumors was suppressed when combined with PD901. High baseline tumor cell CD44 expression in MOC2 was significantly reduced with PD901 but enhanced (by mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) with rapamycin treatment (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Again, this enhancement was reversed with combination therapy. Cumulatively, the alterations in phospho-targets and CD44 expression following treatment <italic>in vivo</italic> largely mirror those observed <italic>in vitro</italic> and suggest that both PD901 and rapamycin exert expected on-target effects on tumor cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and that compensatory activation of non-targeted pathways, which is pronounced in MOC2, can be reversed with combination therapy.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title><italic>In vivo</italic> on-target effects of MEK and mTOR inhibition in MOC tumors</title><p>Representative photomicrographs (20x) of immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections from MOC1 and MOC2 tumors following 21 days of treatment with rapamycin and PD901 for <bold>A.</bold> S6K (S240/244), <bold>B.</bold> ERK1/2 (T202/Y204). <bold>C.</bold> flow cytometric analysis of cell surface CD44 expression on MOC1 and MOC2 tumors after treatment.

Treatment with PD901 but not rapamycin consistently and significantly reduced MOC2 tumor vascularity. Since a subset of CD31 cells in the tumors are also CD45+ and represent immature myeloid cells and not mature vascular cells, CD31 immunostaining was performed and revealed a pattern of intense mature vascularization in MOC2 tumors as measured by vessel count per HPF that was differentially altered by rapamycin and PD901 treatment. To determine if alterations in tumor vascularity correlated with changes in expression of angiogenic cytokines, RNA and protein levels of CXCL1 and VEGF were measured from MOC tumor lysates (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). While baseline protein levels of VEGF were similar between MOC tumors, baseline CXCL1 was significantly higher in the MOC2 tumor microenvironment (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Treatment with PD901 reduced VEGF in both MOC1 and MOC2 tumors, but rapamycin led to reduced VEGF in MOC2 tumors only. Lower baseline CXCL1 expression in MOC1 tumors was largely unaffected by either drug. Conversely, higher baseline CXCL1 in MOC2 tumors was reduced modestly by rapamycin and significantly by PD901. Interestingly, while CXCL1 RNA and protein levels were congruent, significant differences between VEGF RNA and proteins levels suggests a greater degree of post-transcriptional regulation of VEGF in MOC tumors. Further, cytokine measurements from MOC tumor lysates and from MOC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> differ significantly and suggest stromal or other microenvironment contributions to cytokine levels <italic>in vivo</italic>. Again, MEK but not mTOR inhibition results in consistently altered tumor vascularity and angiogenic cytokine/chemokine expression in MOC tumors. Cumulatively, the above experiments demonstrating altered tumor cell viability, proliferation, CD44 expression and MOC tumor vascularity and chemokine expression following MEK inhibition do not explain the durable treatment response observed in MOC1 but not MOC2 tumors following withdrawal of mTOR inhibition.</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Variable alteration of <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor vascularity and angiogenic cytokine expression following MEK and mTOR inhibition</title><p><bold>A.</bold> flow cytometric analysis of CD45-CD31+ cells in MOC1 and MOC2 tumors along with representative 20x photomicrographs of MOC1 and MOC2 tumor CD31 IHC to visually assess CD31+ blood vessels.

Interestingly, 20&#x02013;30% of FoxP3+ CD4 cells in both tumors were CD25+ (compared with 70&#x02013;80% of all splenic CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs), indicating that the majority of Tregs in MOC tumors are induced and not of thymic origin [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

MEK but not mTOR inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> induced cytotoxicity, reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion and CD44 expression and reduced migratory capacity in MOC1 and MOC2 cells, consistent with the <italic>Ras</italic>-driver mutations shared by these carcinomas. Remarkably, different effects of these drugs were observed in MOC derived tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. Both drugs alone or in combination significantly inhibited primary tumor growth, indicating a role for targeting MAPK and/or PI3K/mTOR signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with direct anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects observed <italic>in vitro</italic>, MEK inhibition suppressed growth during the 21 days of treatment, but withdrawal led to rapid rebound of primary tumor growth and minimal improvement in survival in both MOC1 and MOC2 tumor-bearing mice. While mTOR inhibition had limited effects <italic>in vitro</italic>, rapamycin potently inhibited tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> and subsequent drug withdrawal after 21 days of treatment was followed by a more durable response in a significant subset of tumor bearing mice with resulting prolonged survival compared to MEK inhibition. This treatment durability after withdrawal of therapy and survival effect of mTOR inhibition relative to MEK inhibition appeared to be more pronounced in immunogenic MOC1 tumor bearing mice compared to MOC2 tumor bearing mice.</p><p>Several observations from this and prior studies support the hypothesis that the enhanced durability of primary tumor control and prolonged survival in rapamycin treated MOC1 tumors could be due to differences in basal and drug effects on tumor microenvironment immune infiltration and/or activation. This differential effect did not appear to be due to enhanced <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibition of phospho-targets, reduced cell surface CD44 expression (known to correlate with MOC cell aggressiveness [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), reduced tumor cell proliferation, reduced tumor vascularization or expression of angiogenic cytokines or enhanced tumor cell apoptosis, all of which were similarly or more significantly altered by MEK inhibition. The use of a syngeneic model allowed assessment of the infiltration and functional status of cells of innate and adaptive immunity that is limited in immunodeficient models. Treatment with PD901 alone or in combination was not associated with durable survival in immunogenic MOC1 tumors. PD901 inhibited tumor infiltration of mature macrophages and reversed TAM polarization toward an M2 phenotype in MOC1 tumors. Mature macrophages producing TNF may be important in the inhibition of immunogenic tumors such as MOC1 [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Importantly, PD901 treatment appeared to inhibit total CD4 and CD8 T-cell and antigen-specific CD8 T-cell infiltration into MOC1 tumors as well as antigen-specific T-cell activation/degranulation as assessed by CD107a cell surface staining. In response to these results, we experimentally measured the relative suppression of activated T-cell expansion and activation, as measured by IFN&#x003b3; secretion and CD69/CD44 expression, and found potent suppression following MEK inhibition. Thus, blockade of adaptive T-cell responses and functional immunity following PD901 treatment provide a mechanistic explanation for the rapid rebound of primary tumor growth in MOC1 tumor bearing mice following cessation of treatment. To validate that the primary mechanism of rapamycin-induced MOC1 primary tumor growth inhibition was immunogenic, given the lack of measurable alteration in MOC1 cancer cell function, we depleted CD8 Cells in MOC1 tumor bearing mice and found that this essentially completely abrogated the growth inhibitory effects of rapamycin. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate a primarily immune-dependent mechanism of rapamycin-induced tumor growth inhibition. In MOC2 tumors, which have very high immunosuppressive myeloid and lymphoid immune infiltration at baseline, several desirable changes were observed including reduced MDSC accumulation with combination therapy and a skewing of TAMs toward an M1 phenotype and reduced Treg tumor infiltration following MEK inhibition. However, we were unable to induce an adaptive response (recruitment of CD8 T-cells) within the tumor with either drug despite apparent enhancement of systemic antigen-specific CD8 T-cells. Investigations into how to best enhance the immunogenicity of MOC2 tumors are underway.</p><p>Signaling through the MAPK pathway is known to be critical to T-cell function [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and our findings support the work of others demonstrating blockade of T-cell proliferation, cytokine expression and antigen-specific expansion <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> following MEK but not Raf inhibition [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] that may be model dependent. Our data strongly supports the need for further investigation into the effects of MEK inhibition in immunogenic tumors, where blockade of T-cell function may abrogate an existing anti-tumor immune response. Similarly, despite that rapamycin is used for immunosuppression following solid organ transplantation, rapamycin has shown anti-tumor activity in a variety of solid tumor types [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Rapamycin enhances development of memory T-cell populations, perhaps at the expense of effector populations, and induces development of FoxP3+ Tregs [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These findings with ours support the context dependent immunosuppressive properties of rapamycin. Together with evidence that combination mTOR and MEK blockade enhanced on-treatment growth suppression of non-immunogenic MOC2 tumors, our findings of altered tumor immunity following MEK inhibition and preserved immunity following mTOR inhibition in immunogenic MOC1 tumors suggests the need for individual patient anti-cancer therapies to be tailored not only to identified oncogenic pathways but also to the immune status of the tumor. Patients with immunogenic tumors may benefit more from therapies that preserve existing anti-tumor immune responses, especially when combined with an immunotherapy such as a tumor vaccines or checkpoint inhibitor. Approximately 50&#x02013;70% of patients with HNSCCs harbor immunogenic tumors as defined by CD8 T-cell tumor infiltration [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a lymphocyte &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; signature [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and PD-L1 expression [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and would be modeled by MOC1 tumors. Conversely, poorly immunogenic tumors may be modeled by MOC2 tumors, for which the relative paucity of antigenic genomic alterations and high degree of local immune suppression may limit the effectiveness of immune-stimulating therapies.</p><p>For poorly-immunogenic tumors such as MOC2, with genomic alterations co-activating MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways, combination MEK and mTOR inhibition maybe needed. Compensatory MAPK pathway activation and CD44 cell surface expression following mTOR inhibition alone was observed both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in MOC2 cells and tumors. This was reversed with combination therapy and may explain in part why combination treatment was needed to effectively suppress on-treatment primary tumor growth in MOC2 tumors. The concept of co-activated signaling pathway enhancement as a mechanism of targeted therapy resistance is well documented, and our data validates the principle of using combination therapy to block compensatory signaling through non-targeted but co-activated oncogenic pathways [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The combination of rapamycin and PD901 was well tolerated in this model with no appreciable weight loss or significant side effects from treatment.</p><p>Several limitations to our study exist. First, cell lines in the MOC model are RAS mutant and PIK3CA wild-type, similar to only a small subset of human HNSCC [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, growth factor receptors and Ras activate PI3K, and this model exhibits co-activation of both PI3K/mTOR and MAPK pathways similar to the majority of human HNSCC. Indeed, the overall genomic landscape between MOC tumors and human HNSCC is highly conserved [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Additionally, we observed durable, immune-based responses following mTOR inhibition in MOC tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> despite the fact that they are <italic>Ras</italic> mutant. Next, tumor tissue used for the immune analyses were studied after prolonged treatment, and it is possible that the immune profile of MOC tumors is different in earlier stages of tumor progression and treatment. Additionally, mTOR and MEK inhibition may alter the interaction between tumor and other immune or stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts, that were not evaluated here. These models may enable further experiments exploring different mechanisms of immune activation or suppression following treatment with different therapies, which are ongoing in our laboratory.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates the utility of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD901 in syngeneic models of oral cavity cancer. Not only do we validate the on-target effects of each drug both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we demonstrate different mechanisms of primary tumor growth control between immunogenic MOC1 and poorly immunogenic MOC2 tumors. We experimentally show that MEK inhibition inhibits but mTOR inhibition relatively preserves anti-tumor T-cell responses both via tetramer-based flow cytometry in MOC1 tumor tissue and in an <italic>in vitro</italic> T-cell proliferation and activation assay. Our finding that mTOR inhibition leads to a CD8 cell dependent anti-tumor response in RAS-mutant, immunogenic MOC1 tumors is novel and suggests that mTOR targeting therapies may be useful in multiple tumor types regardless of underlying driver mutations. Further, these results have significant implications for future clinical trial planning involving combinations of these targeted therapies, as well as highlight the need for enhanced understanding of how different anti-cancer therapies alter tumor immunity to allow the rational design of anti-cancer and immunotherapy combinations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Murine Oral Cancer (MOC) cells were generated and maintained in culture in complete media as described previously [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Control mice were treated with drug carriers alone (2% ethanol, 5.2% tween 80 and 5.2% PEG 400 in water for rapamycin and 0.5% HPMC and 0.2% tween 80 in water for PD901). Following 21 days of therapy, treated and control tumor-bearing mice were euthanized and tumors were surgically removed. Tumor tissue used for RT-PCR or ELISA was snap frozen, tissue used for immunohistochemistry was fixed with 4% formalin for 24 hours and stored in 70% ethanol until use, and tissue for flow cytometric analysis was used fresh. In some experiments, systemic CD8 cell depletion was performed via IP injection of 200 &#x003bc;g of anti-CD8 antibody (clone YTS169.4, BioXCell, Lebanon, NH) twice weekly.</p></sec><sec id="s4_7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were sectioned (6 micron thickness) by a third party vendor (Histoserv, Germantown, MD). Sections were deparaffinized with Histoclear and rehydrated with an ethanol gradient. Following quench of endogenous peroxidase with diluted hydrogen peroxide, and blocking with serum of the species of the secondary antibody, primary antibodies at pre-titrated concentrations were incubated overnight at 4C. All primary antibodies with the exception of CD31 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and the isotype controls (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Following incubation for 1 hour with a biotinylated secondary antibody, signal was amplified with an ABC kit per manufacturer's protocol and colorimetric staining was developed with DAB (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Washes between each step were performed with a PBS based wash solution. Developed samples were counterstained with Hematoxylin QS (Vector Labs, cat# H-3404) and coverslips were mounted with Permount. Whole slides were digitized for analysis using the Aperio ScanScope CS system and quantified using the Aperio ImageScope Viewer software's positive pixel count v9 algorithm or nuclear staining algorithm. Pancytokeratin staining was performed on each tissue block to ensure differentiation of tumor and stromal tissue, and isotype control stains were performed with each assay to ensure specific antibody staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4_8"><title>TUNEL</title><p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sections were stained via a standard TUNEL assay protocol using an alkaline phosphatase enzyme label and a fuchsin (red) substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s4_9"><title>RTPCR</title><p>Tumor lysates were generated using the Tissue Lyser II and total RNA was purified using the RNEasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized utilizing a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA).

After filtering the tumor suspension through a 100 &#x003bc;M filter and several washes with a 1% BSA in 1xPBS solution, cell surface staining was performed using flourophore conjugated anti-mouse CD45.2 clone 104, Gr1 clone RB6&#x02013;8C5, Cd11b clone M1/70, Ly6C clone HK1.4, F4/80 clone BM8, I-A/I-E clone M5/114.15.2, CD206 clone C068C2, CD3 clone 145&#x02013;2C11, CD4 clone GK1.5, CD8 clone 53&#x02013;6.7 or KT15, CD25 clone PC61, PD1 CLONE RMP1&#x02013;30, CD107a clone 1D4B antibodies (Biolegend) as indicated. H2Kb:KSPWFTTL tetramer was purchased from MBL (Woburn, MA). Use of anti-CD8 antibody close KT15 was required with tetramer staining sue to epitope compatibility, and specificity of tetramer staining was validates with KSPWFTTL peptide vaccination of na&#x000ef;ve C57BL/6 mice (data not shown). Intracellular staining for FoxP3 in CD4+ T-lymphocytes was performed using the eBioscience (San Diego, CA) Treg staining kit #1 per manufacturer's protocol. Specific staining of each antibody used was validated with the use of isotype control antibodies and a &#x0201c;fluorescence minus one&#x0201d; method of antibody combination validation. Dead cells were excluded with 7AAD staining if cell surface staining only and via LIVE/DEAD fixable viability dye staining (Life Technologies) for intracellular staining.
