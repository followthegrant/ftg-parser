However, there is lack of standardization in empiric management of (1) anaerobes, (2) enterococci, (3) fungi, and (4) multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). The recommendation is to institute empiric coverage for some of these organisms in &#x0201c;high-risk community-acquired&#x0201d; or in &#x0201c;healthcare-associated&#x0201d; infections (HCAI), but exact definitions are not provided.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods.</title><p>Epidemiological study of IAI was conducted at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center (May&#x02013;November 2013). Logistic and Cox regressions were used to analyze predictors and outcomes of IAI, respectively. The performances of established HCAI definitions to predict MDRO-IAI upon admission were calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results.</title><p>After reviewing 8219 discharge notes, 253 consecutive patients were enrolled (43 [17%] children). There were 116 patients with appendicitis, 93 biliary infections, and 17 with diverticulitis. Cultures were obtained from 88 patients (35%), and 44 of them (50%) yielded a microbiologically confirmed IAI: 9% fungal, 11% enterococcal, 25% anaerobic, and 34% MDRO. Eighty percent of MDRO-IAIs were present upon admission, but the area under the ROC curve of predicting MDRO-IAI upon admission by the commonly used HCAI definitions were low (0.73 and 0.69). Independent predictors for MDRO-IAI were advanced age and active malignancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions.</title><p>Multidrug-resistant organism-IAIs are common, and empiric broad-spectrum coverage is important among elderly patients with active malignancy, even if the infection onset was outside the hospital setting, regardless of current HCAI definitions. Outcomes analyses suggest that empiric regimens should routinely contain antianaerobes (except for biliary IAI); however, empiric antienterococcal or antifungals regimens are seldom needed.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords.</title><kwd>biliary infection</kwd><kwd>MDRO</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>nosocomial infections</kwd><kwd>surgical infection.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>Fall 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Intra-abdominal infections (IAI) constitute the primary diagnosis in 8% of hospitalizations [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and they are the second most common infectious etiology associated with mortality in intensive care units [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, IAI covers a broad spectrum of different syndromes, with diverse levels of severity, ie, from relatively simple and limited infections such as appendicitis to life-threatening complex infections that invade parenchymal organs and involve the peritoneal cavity [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p content-type="indent">Several factors influence the outcomes of IAI, amongst them the delay in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (DAAT) [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, DAAT is frequent in IAIs [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>]. Despite the establishment and distribution of treatment guidelines [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], there is still lack of standardization in empiric management, specifically for certain indications where DAAT is most common [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>]: ie, for anaerobes, fungi (almost exclusively <italic>Candida</italic> species), <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species (eg, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>), and multidrug-resistant organisms ([MDRO] eg, methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [MRSA], extended-spectrum &#x003b2;-lactamase [ESBL]-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, and more) [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;13</xref>]. The aforementioned organisms are 4 groups of pathogens that may or may not be covered by empiric treatment regimens depending upon clinician discretion. Guidelines recommend institution of empiric coverage for these pathogens in &#x0201c;healthcare-associated infections&#x0201d; (HCAI), but the number of &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; parameters required to support a definition for HCAI is not provided in these specific guidelines [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p content-type="indent">There are various commonly used definitions for HCAI in the literature: the most commonly used are the &#x0201c;Duke-2002&#x0201d; [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the &#x0201c;modified Duke-2002&#x0201d; [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Duke-2002 HCAI definition describes an infection that is present at hospital admission or within 48 hours of admission in patients that fulfilled any of the following criteria: (1) received intravenous therapy at home or wound care or specialized nursing care in the previous 30 days; (2) attended a hospital or hemodialysis clinic or received intravenous chemotherapy in the previous 30 days; (3) hospitalized in an acute care hospital for &#x02265;2 days in the previous 90 days; or (4) resided in a nursing home or long-term care facility. The modified Duke-2002 definition simplified these criteria by altering the hospitalization criteria to &#x02265;2 days in an acute-care hospital in the past year as the single criterion [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the performance of these definitions on an IAI cohort has not been measured or validated. Furthermore, IAI guidelines do not specifically provide treatment recommendations based on a particular HCAI definition [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p content-type="indent">There is an ongoing treatment decision conundrum between (1) initial prescribing of antibiotics targeting all possible causative pathogens and (2) strict adherence to antimicrobial stewardship guidelines to curb the continued emergence and spread of MDROs [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of IAIs and focus specifically on the role of anaerobes, fungi, enterococci, and MDROs in their causation. In addition, we tested the performances of the most established HCAI definitions [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], to predict MDRO-IAI among our cohort of patients.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study Setting and Design</title><p>A retrospective study was conducted between July 2013 and October 2013 at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center ([AHMC] a referral university-affiliated 848-bed tertiary care facility), Israel.

Because the diagnostic coding system (eg, <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision</italic>) is neither sensitive nor specific enough to detect all IAIs [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], all discharge notes of patients who were admitted to AHMC during this entire period were reviewed by trained personnel. All patients (children and adults) with IAI (complicated and uncomplicated) per established criteria [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were included.</p><p content-type="indent">Possible IAIs included appendicitis, diverticulitis, infections of the biliary tract (eg, cholecystitis, cholangitis, &#x0201c;biliary pancreatitis&#x0201d;), colorectal infection (eg, epiploic appendagitis, typhlitis), and abdominal abscesses or peritonitis. All surgical-site infections [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], including deep organ space infections (with no evidence of infection of the surgical site itself), were excluded.

Vitek-2 (bioMerieux, Marcy I'Etoile, France) was the automated system in use at AHMC throughout the study period, to determine pathogens&#x02019; identification and their susceptibilities to various agents. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy was defined based on the in vitro susceptibilities of the pathogen, as distributed by the Microbiology laboratory&#x02019;s formal report.</p><p content-type="indent">There are uniform standards for obtaining microbiological cultures at AHMC. As per established criteria [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], blood cultures are always obtained from complicated and/or nosocomial IAI, and both aerobic and anaerobic bottles are filled with 10&#x02013;20 mL of blood. For cultures obtained at the operating room or radiology services, the practitioners are instructed to fill the sample in either blood cultures bottles (always fill both aerobic and anaerobic bottles) or in sterile packages, which is usually the same package being used to transport urine cultures. When sample is obtained through a sterile package, it is not being transported nor processed in anaerobic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The descriptive epidemiology, along with risk factors and outcomes analyses (for anaerobic, fungal, enterococcal, and MDRO infections), were analyzed by logistic and Cox regressions, respectively.

Despite official guidelines [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], there is a lack of evidence from controlled trials pertaining to empiric coverage for <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, fungi, anaerobes, and MDROs. One of the reasons for the lack of standardization is that no exact definitions are provided. In this study, 253 consecutive patients with IAI were enrolled, while meticulously avoiding selection bias commonly associated with computerized diagnostic coding [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Approximately 17% were children, with the vast majority of them suffering from acute appendicitis.</p><p content-type="indent">According to our analyses, empiric enterococcal coverage is seldom needed [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These isolates were recovered only from 11% of microbiologically confirmed IAI (5 patients), and the outcomes associated with these infections were not worse compared with the other infections, even when active treatment was delayed (ie, for 72 hours, until culture results became available). Guidelines do not recommend routine usage of enterococcal coverage, at least not for &#x0201c;community-acquired&#x0201d; IAI [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>Enterococcus</italic> was only 1 of several pathogens isolated in 60% of the patients, and it is debatable whether enterococcal coverage should be instituted in those circumstances [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p content-type="indent">The incidence of fungal infections (all <italic>Candida</italic> spp, all polymicrobial infections) was even lower (9% of microbiologically confirmed IAI, n = 4). Official guidelines recommend complete avoidance of antifungals for community-acquired infections, although according to our analysis, despite the small sample size, in patients presenting with IAI after a gastrointestinal endoscopic procedure, it is reasonable to consider the empiric usage of antifungals, even though <italic>Candida</italic> was only one of the isolated pathogens in all patients (100%). One can argue that peritonitis after an endoscopic procedure, even if conducted in ambulatory setting, is a &#x0201c;healthcare-associated&#x0201d; event per guidelines and not a community-acquired event. However, this differentiation between definitions is not depicted clearly in the guidelines [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Of note, 3 of 4 patients were diagnosed with non-<italic>albicans Candida</italic> species, and in 2 of 4 patients the <italic>Candida</italic> was nonsusceptible to fluconazole, which is the most commonly used empiric antifungal agent [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Indeed, patients with fungal IAI in our cohort suffered from significant delays in initiation of active therapy and from significantly worse morbidity (but not mortality) outcomes. A detailed and much larger analysis of fungal IAI is warranted, with controlled analyses of independent predictors and outcomes. Such investigation could guide the appropriate empiric management of fungal IAI, stratified by the exact clinical syndrome and/or scenario, since the epidemiology of fungal IAI evolved considerably in the past years [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p content-type="indent">According to this analysis, it seems that anaerobic empiric coverage is indeed an appropriate practice in many IAIs. Despite probable underdiagnosis due to suboptimal transport and/or processing anaerobic conditions (particularly for samples obtained at the operating room), there were still 25% (n = 11) of patients with anaerobic-confirmed IAI. The outcomes of patients with anaerobic IAI were worse, although the majority had received appropriate early antibiotics. This again highlights the importance of instituting early antianaerobic coverage for every IAI, regardless of the exact IAI type, except in biliary-originated IAI [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In our analysis, none of the biliary IAIs were caused by anaerobic pathogens, which justify this practice.</p><p content-type="indent">As been clearly demonstrated in many other recent reports, MDROs (particularly <italic>P aeruginosa</italic>, ESBLs, and MRSA) should be suspected even in community-onset IAI [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref>]. According to our analyses, empiric coverage of MDRO is specifically important and justified among the elderly with an active malignancy. Patients with MDRO-IAI have been shown to suffer from worse outcomes, including a significant association with increased 90-day mortality rate [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The guidelines again (such as in the case of fungal and enterococcal infections) suggest considering MDRO only in HCA infection (with no exact definition provided), based on the local epidemiology [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In our analysis, 80% of MDRO IAIs were among patients with community-onset (not necessarily community-acquired) infection. When we tested the performances of the most established and widely used HCA infection definition, the Duke-2002 [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], to predict the likelihood of MDRO infection, the performances were relatively low with ROC AUC of only 0.73. We tested the performances of an additional widely used definition, the modified Duke-2002 [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and performances were even lower (ROC AUC 0.69). This implies that current guidelines do not assist clinicians in anti-MDRO empiric coverage, particularly because an HCA definition is not provided in the guidelines [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A validated analysis to predict MDRO-IAI among patients with community-onset infection, upon admission to an acute-care hospital, is definitely warranted, to guide clinicians on this important and common matter. A validated HCA definition, with higher performances in predicting MDRO, could improve patients&#x02019; outcomes (by reducing the frequent delays in initiation of appropriate therapy), while avoiding broad-spectrum (and sometimes toxic) therapeutics administered to the &#x0201c;wrong population&#x0201d;, ie, patients with IAI caused by susceptible pathogens. It is important to note that current guidelines also do not differentiate nosocomial IAI from community-onset HCA IAI. It is obvious per guidelines that nosocomial IAI are HCA and therefore MDRO coverage should be considered (based on local epidemiology) [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Indeed, all 3 microbiologically confirmed nosocomial IAIs in our cohort were caused by an MDRO.</p><p content-type="indent">Our study suffers from several obvious limitations. Its retrospective chart review-based design imposes possible confounders associated with availability and accuracy of the captured data. In addition, IAI is a very broad clinical entity, composed of various &#x0201c;different diseases&#x0201d;, depending on age (eg, adults vs pediatrics) and the exact clinical syndrome (eg, appendicitis vs diverticulitis). By stratifying our cohort of over all 253 patients, we were underpowered to conduct additional subanalyses that could have potentially strengthened our findings. In addition, it is a single-center analysis, and geographical differences in carriage of organisms and regional susceptibility patterns could alter its conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>We conducted detailed epidemiological analyses on a cohort of 253 patients with a variety of IAIs, focusing specifically on few knowledge gaps in terms of therapeutic management of IAI among hospitalized patients. We believe that our analyses show, although limited by small sample size, that further analyses pertaining to the therapeutic management of fungal IAI among adults are needed. In addition, MDROs are becoming common causative agents of IAI, particularly among adults. Patients with MDRO-IAI suffer from significant delays in initiation of appropriate antibiotics and from significantly worse outcomes, including mortality. Current guidelines are unclear as to when to institute empiric coverage for MDROs, and our analyses also prove that currently used definitions do not effectively direct the management of these infections. A clear definition for HCAI and clear recommendations for empiric MDRO coverage are needed, to improve patients&#x02019; outcomes, particularly among the elderly.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was performed by Samuel Levy in partial fulfillment of the MD thesis requirements of the Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.</p><p>
