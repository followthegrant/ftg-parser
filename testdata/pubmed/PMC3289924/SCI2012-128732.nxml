The transplanted cell suspension was a primary culture of neurospheres from adult pig subventricular zone (SVZ) which had been labeled <italic>in vitro</italic> with BrdU or lentivirally transferred fluorescent protein. Lesion-induced loss of leg extension on the thigh became definitive in controls but was reversed by 45&#x02013;90 days after neurosphere-filled vein grafting. Electromyography showed stimulodetection recovery in neurosphere-transplanted pigs but not in controls. Postmortem immunohistochemistry revealed neurosphere-derived cells that survived inside the venous graft from 10 to 240 post-lesion days and all displayed a neuronal phenotype. Newly formed neurons were distributed inside the venous graft along the severed nerve longitudinal axis. Moreover, ANSC transplantation increased CNPase expression, indicating activation of intrinsic Schwann cells. Thus ANSC transplantation inside an autologous venous graft provides an efficient repair strategy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Nerve injuries which are frequent in civil practice [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and catastrophe-like earthquake [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or tsunami [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] combine associative lesion with crush syndrome. War improves the risk of gap and of treatment delay with ballistic wounds [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] because these ones are less prone to emergency than vascular injuries [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This risk pertains after war with remanent explosive [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The functional pronostic is dependent on the type of wound: transsection, crush, or gap, which has been further categorized according to the length of the gap, the type of nerve (sensitive, motor or mixed), localization, association of injuries, and patient's ageing, time of surgery, and vascular environment [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Neuroguides and especially vein grafts are regularly used to bridge small nerve gaps shorter than 3&#x02009;cm; for long nerve gaps, autologous nerve graft has become the gold standard since the second war [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. But nerve repair outcome depends on fascicle concordance [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and scar development, so expected alternatives for long nerve gaps remain a challenge to improve recovery after this type of lesion. Surgical trials to improve nerve repair have mainly targeted diversification of grafted neuroguides with resorbable materials [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The outcome has been improved by neuroguide preloading with extracellular matrix components [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], growth factors [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or cultured regeneration-enhancing cells. The latter strategy, or cell therapy, has been attempted with primary cultures of Schwann cells [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], olfactory bulb enshealting cells [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], or various types of stem cells [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In these studies, progenies of grafted stem cells mostly proved to be glial cells, which indirectly enhance axonal regeneration [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Neural stem cells from adult brain (ANSC) have been scarcely assayed to help postlesional repair of peripheral nerves, despite their strong potential of integration and development into neurons [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The present study is based on the hypothesis that ANSC grafting inside a venous neuroguide might be efficient to bridge a long nerve gap in adult. We tested this hypothesis in the pig, which is the non-primate animal species most closely related to human and is prone to surgery and anesthesia conditions very close to human protocols in clinic [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To this aim, we have characterized primary cultures of neural stem cells from adult pig brain, by optimizing the neurosphere assay on subventricular zone explants [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the present study, we labeled such primary expanded ANSC <italic>in vitro</italic> with either BrdU or lentiviral green fluorescent protein gene transfer, and we grafted labeled neurospheres into an autologous venous bridge after a surgical 30&#x02009;mm long gap in adult pig <italic>nervi cruralis</italic>. We compared neurosphere-grafted and control pigs for functional recovery and assessed the fate of grafted cells inside the lesioned nerve at various post-lesion intervals. </p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Animals</title><p>Twenty-four adults, 4-month-old Large White Landrace pigs were used in the present study. They were housed with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to water and standard food pellets, in lodges that comprised one yard and one hard infrared-heated shelter. All <italic>in vivo </italic>experimental protocols were approved by the local Ethics Committee on the protection of animals used for scientific activities with the protocol number 31/2006/IMTSSA/UCPE. Personal protocol number for surgery and experimentation with pigs was 2007/29/DEF/DCSSA (to O. Liard). All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Anesthesia</title><p>Deep anesthesia was initiated by intramuscular premedication with 30&#x02009;mg/kg ketamine (Imalgene 1000, Merial, Lyon, France), 0.1&#x02009;mL/kg acepromazine (Vetranquil, Calmivet, Bayer, Puteaux, France), and 25&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg atropine sulphate (Meram, Melun, France). The animal was then equipped with a peripheral intravenous perfusion delivering Ringer-lactate-5% glucose serum at 5&#x02013;7&#x02009;mL/kg/h, with adhesive electrocardiographic electrodes in CM5-SpO2 (ECG monitor S5, Datex Ohmeda, Madison, WI, USA), and with an artificial oxygenator. Anesthesia induction was performed by intravenous injections of 2&#x02009;mg/kg propofol (Diprivan, Bayer) during 30&#x02009;sec slowly, and of sufentanil (Sufenta, Bayer) three times at 1.5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg. Local glottis anesthesia was made with 5% lidoca&#x000ef;ne spray (Xylocaine, Bayer), before orotracheal intubation with a monolight cannula (internal diameter 6.5&#x02009;mm). Ventilation of lung parenchyma was checked with a stethoscope and mechanically assisted. General anesthesia was sustained with electrically driven intravenous infusion of propofol 2&#x02009;mg/kg/h (Diprivan, DCI), sufentanil 1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg/h (Sufenta, DCI) and rocuronium bromide 0.15&#x02009;mg/kg/h (Esmeron, DCI); curarisation was supervised by means of a S5 monitor (Entropie module) but was not released for EMG. Antibioprophylaxy was administered. All along surgery, the cardioventilatory parameters (heart and ventilation rates, electrocardiogram, blood oxygenation, ventilation pressure and volume, MAC, temperature, hemoglucotest) as well as the sleep threshold were constantly watched with the S5 monitor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Brain Tissue Sampling for Primary Neural Stem Cell Culture from Adult Pig</title><p>Separate animals were dedicated for primary culture and <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion of neural stem cells from brain subventricular zone (SVZ) as previously described [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. On each deeply anesthetized pig, the dorsal face of the skull was cut with an electric saw and removed. A 15&#x02009;mm thick coronal slice of the brain was performed with a scalpel at the commissural level of midbrain, manually explanted and transferred at 4&#x000b0;C on ice bed-laid sterile metal plate, beside a Bunsen flame for atmosphere sterilization. The experimental animal was thus alive until the explantation of the brain tissue slice. Each pig was sacrificed immediately after brain tissue sampling by intravenous injection of Dolethal (R) pentobarbital (DCI) at 1.5&#x02009;mL/kg.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Primary Culture of SVZ Neural Stem Cells (&#x0201c;Neurosphere Assay&#x0201d;)</title><p>As previously described [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], SVZ pieces were quickly microdissected from the thick midbrain slice (above) along the ventrolateral floor of lateral brain ventricles in low-calcium artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF: 124&#x02009;mM NaCl, 5&#x02009;mM KCl, 3.2&#x02009;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1&#x02009;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26&#x02009;mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 100&#x02009;mM glucose, and pH 7.38). Tissue samples were rinsed twice with aCSF and digested first in 40&#x02009;U cystein-EDTA-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-mercaptoethanol-preactivated papain (Sigma, L'Isle D'Abeau, France) for 10&#x02009;min at 37&#x000b0;C, then in 250&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L undiluted TrypLE Express solution (heat-resistant, microbially produced, purified trypsinlike enzyme, Gibco # 12604-013, Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) for 10&#x02009;min at 37&#x000b0;C.

All neurospheres displayed fluorescent GFP labeling in most, but not all, cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). At either 45, 90, 180, or 240 days after lesion, sphere transplantation, each vein-bridged and LV-GFP sphere-transplanted nerve segment displayed a number of GFP-fluorescent cells which were exclusively localized inside the nerve fascicles (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(b)</xref>) and absent in nontransplanted control bridges (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(d)</xref>). Combined immunohistofluorescent labeling of either NeuN or neurofilament NF-68 revealed that most of GFP fluorescence was colocalized with these neuronal markers (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(c)</xref>). By contrast, GFP fluorescence did not colocalize with either of the glial markers assessed: S-100b (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(d)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7(f)</xref>), GFAP, CNPase. </p><p>Interestingly, at 180 and 240 days after nerve lesion and GFP-expressing neurosphere transplantation, CNPase immunohistofluorescent labeling was much higher than in vein-bridged lesioned controls which had not received neurosphere transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Both the number of CNPase-immunoreactive Schwann cell processes and their labeling intensities were higher in neurosphere-grafted nerves than in controls. By densitometric quantification with the ImageJ software, immunohistochemical CNPase labeling of neurosphere-grafted lesioned nerves, at 240 days after lesion, reached 276 &#x000b1; 2% of the 100 &#x000b1; 2.9% value of lesioned controls which were devoid of neurospheres; this difference being statistically significant at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 by Anova.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Degeneration of the distal axon segment is the consequence of axotomy and the challenge of nerve repair is to connect the proximal stump to this distal segment. For long nerve gap, it is a race between axon regeneration and distal degeneration with phenotypic change of Schwann cells [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Autologous nerve graft is the gold standard but results are not satisfactory [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Any alternative is currently believed to require a neuroguide, providing a permissive microenvironment to increase axonal regeneration and to preserve supportive cells and distal axons. Stem cells have already been studied but differentiation was mostly towards supportive cells. Neural stem cells have been reported to become integrated and provide new neurons after transplantation within central nervous system with permissive microenvironment [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In order to test the efficiency of this type of graft for postlesional repair of peripheral nerves, we have established a primary culture of adult pig neural stem cells which generate neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> in our previous report [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the present study, we show for the first time in adult pig that transplantation of <italic>in vitro</italic> preexpanded adult neural stem cells into a peripheral nerve gap inside a venous bridge both leads to genesis of longitudinally aligned neurons and improves functional recovery.</p><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec4.1"><title>4.1. Methodological Considerations</title><p>The present experimental protocol of nerve lesion: transsection and 30&#x02009;mm long nerve substance removal, has been chosen to mimic the common cases of long nerve injury in human clinics. In these cases indeed, whatever be the initial type of injury (section, tearing, crush), the surgical regularization of both nerve stumps corresponds to a model of transsection.</p><p>Autologous vein segment graft as a nerve conduit has been established as an effective treatment for the repair of nerve gaps less than 3&#x02009;cm [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; it is used in hand surgery [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and in pediatrics [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In a recent study [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], histomorphological examination of the sections proximal to, from, and distal to the repair zone over three months revealed less epineural scarring, a thinner epineurium, more regenerated axons and fewer inflammatory cells in groups where vein grafting was used, because the vein graft provided additional mechanical and chemical support in the size discrepancy of the nerve regeneration. A small vein graft keeps its property for end-to-side neurorrhaphy [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but size discrepancy between the donor and recipient nerves and length of the bypass are another problem with the risk of collapse. Vein bridging also gives excellent results in secondary repair of neglected injuries [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The present protocol is routinely realized in adult pig, as a convenient training system for human-operating surgeons.</p><p>The present postlesional cell therapy attempt used an <italic>in vitro</italic> expanded primary culture of adult pig brain neurospheres which had been extensively characterized in a previous study [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We had indeed shown that the present protocols of adult pig subventricular zone sampling and neurosphere assay allow to purify and maintain true neural stem cells with unlimited proliferative potential, self-renewal capacity, and ability to generate all neural cell types [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In particular, these neurospheres from adult pig SVZ displayed the same proportions of neurons (25%), astrocytes (70%), and oligodendrocytes (5%) as neurospheres from various adult rodent brain structures [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>The procedure for fluorescent lineage labeling of grafted neurospheres used a lentiviral vector of GFP which has been validated previously [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Freshly prepared lentiviral particles were quantified by multiplicity of infection (MOI) determination using routine virologist assays, for optimization of the neurosphere labeling. We checked that this <italic>in vitro</italic> procedure allowed extensive labeling of adult pig neurospheres without alteration of their cell dynamics. It allowed subsequent identification of grafted cell progenies <italic>in situ</italic> merely by histofluorescence, which easily enabled to perform phenotype characterization by immunohistochemistry as revealed with different fluorophores.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec4.2"><title>4.2. Functional Recovery Enhancement by Vein-Guided Neurosphere Transplantation</title><p>Electromyographic evaluation of the muscle which is innervated by the lesioned nerve demonstrated that our protocol of venous-graft-assisted neurosphere transplantation strongly improved functional recovery at 6 months after lesion, as compared to controls. Our subsequent histofluorescent analyses provided putative cytological substrates for such positive influence of grafted ANSC-derived cells.</p><p>In the same time, clinical evaluation was based on a simple observation. The section of the crural nerve pulled a deficient flexion of the thigh on the pond. The only recoveries of normal step were observed on the transplanted animals. The main question was to know if this recovery was bound to accelerated axonal regrowth or to the creation of a functional intermediate neuronal bypass. In fact we have a double observation of neurons and regrowth of the axons of the host.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec4.3"><title>4.3. Neuronal Outcome of Grafted Neurospheres inside the Venous Bridge</title><p>In the present cell therapy attempt, the grafted neurospheres yielded exclusively neuronal progenies whatever be the postlesional delay. This outcome is striking since the neuronal yields from adult SVZ neural stem cells are known to reach only 25% neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and 75% in the olfactory pathway <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The present <italic>in vivo</italic> result indicates that the venous graft provided an efficient proneurogenic environment for the transplanted neurospheres. It is in keeping with the recent demonstrations that vascular walls favor neurogenesis from adult neural stem cells [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which is mediated in some rodent models by the vascular endothelium-derived growth factor (VEGF) [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our results suggest that choosing a venous trunk versus an artificial neuroguide to bridge a nerve gap is an interesting solution because of intrinsic property. Furthermore, all surgeons are able to take a vein trunk on superficial vein network and this is much less expensive than neurotubes in emergency conditions. At the same time, to understand mechanism of interaction between endothelial cells and grafted neural stem cells will allow progress for the development of new artificial neurotubes. More generally, local tissue microenvironment has been formally demonstrated to be determinant on the phenotypic fate of stem-cell-derived progenies: for instance, nonneurogenic neural stem cells from the adult spinal cord generated neurons exclusively, once transplanted into the hippocampus [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>These newly formed neurons survived at long delays after the original transplantation, which indicates they have been successfully integrated inside the severed nerve. Further, the linear distribution of these neuronal perikarya, parallel to the longitudinal axis of the lesioned nerve, suggests that the new neurons might be interconnected into multisynaptic nets bridging the lesional gap of preexisting nerve fibers. This multisynaptic nets have been described after neural stem cells graft [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] This interpretation is also supported by the evolution of transplanted cell clusters across time inside the venous graft, that is, from spherical assemblies in the first week after lesion to linear chainlike successions of sparse cells at longer delays. Such outcome arises apart of the strategies for peripheral nerve repair which have been worked out thus far and consist in stimulating either axonal regrowth into the distal nerve end or remyelination with additional Schwann cells [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The present results contrast with previous ones using different kinds of transplanted cells, like f&#x00153;tal neural stem cells, which triggered Schwann cell like proliferation in the lesioned peripheral nerve [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], promoting in turn myelinisation and indirectly regeneration [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, transplantation of immortalized C17.2 cells from postnatal cerebellum, which were shown to be distinct of neural stem cells [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], has been reported to trigger tumor formation in a rat model of injured sciatic nerve [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Adult neural stem cells are especially relevant for cell therapy from this viewpoint, because they were demonstrated to display exceptionally high resistance to tumorigenesis and senescence [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec4.4"><title>4.4. Possibility to Graft New Neurons into a Peripheral Nerve Gap</title><p>There are two approaches, either to transplant neurons, or to transplant stem cells possessing neuronal differentiation potential. For primary neurons, dorsal root neurons can be prepared <italic>in vitro</italic> and their axons stretch-growth [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, engineered nervous tissue construct consisted of longitudinally aligned axonal tracts spanning two neuronal populations, embedded in a collagen matrix and inserted in a PGA tube [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] demonstrated neuronal survival during 112 days after surgical repair of the sciatic nerve in the rat. But only studies on the big animals allow the study of nerve gaps in good conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec4.5"><title>4.5. High Survival Rate of Allogenic Transplants</title><p>In our study, adult neural stem cells were prepared <italic>in vitro</italic> after explantation of SVZ cells from another pig, and allogenic grafted cells were integrated without immunosuppressive therapy. The same observation was noted for embryonic rat progenitors for the adult rat sciatic nerve [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and with xenograft of embryonic rat neural stem cells into a collagen conduit for the rabbit facial nerve injury model [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In these attempts, grafted cells were expanded <italic>in vitro</italic> before transplantation, like in the present study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec4.6"><title>4.6. Activation of Intrinsic Schwann Cells by Neurosphere Transplantation</title><p>Phenotypic characterization of grafted cell progenies showed that our transplanted neurospheres generated no Schwann cell directly, but they triggered increases of the number and activity of this cell population as compared to controls. CNPase+ cells were observed along axonal regeneration but were always LV-GFP-. This result is in keeping with a previous report showing that venous graft favored Schwann cells proliferation after nerve lesion [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, since in the present study controls have received a neurosphere-devoid venous graft, our results indicated that neurosphere cells emit diffusible signals that stimulate Schwann cells. Neurospheres have indeed been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to secrete neurotrophic factors [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>The positive impact of the present cell therapy protocol can be attributed to genesis and integration of new neurons inside the lesioned nerve and/or to indirect activation of intrinsic Schwann cell population. However, Schwann cell activation was previously shown to occur after grafting a venous segment onto the lesioned nerve without neural stem cells inside. Therefore, the specific benefit of the present procedure is likely caused by the neurosphere transplantation, and hence by the genesis of new neurons inside the lesioned nerve. LV-GFP is confirmed to provide an excellent marker for grafted cells across long-time studies. Both new neuron genesis and host Schwann cell proliferation contributed to regenerate new axon fascicles in the host to bridge the long nerve gap, and the functionality of this histological repair was demonstrated in the same animals by electromyography and clinics. Large animals, and especially the pig, allow repair and study of long nerve gap with clinical conditions close to human. These results were obtained without adjunction of extracellular matrix or extrinsic growth factor. The present study thus provides a hope for improvement in human clinics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>These studies were supported by D&#x000e9;l&#x000e9;gation G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;rale pour l'Armement (DGA, France; REPAR Project, Grant 08co205).
