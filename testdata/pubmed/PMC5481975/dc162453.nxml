However, GDM confers a higher risk of preterm delivery compared with maternal obesity not complicated by diabetes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and maternal glycemia and BMI have an additive effect on birth weight and fetal adiposity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).

Whether the maternal metabolome associated with maternal BMI and glycemia varies, given their common and independent effects on pregnancy outcomes, is not known, nor is the similarity of these associations across ancestry groups with different genetic backgrounds and environments.</p><p>To address these questions, we used targeted metabolomics to compare associations of maternal metabolites with maternal BMI and glycemia in mothers from four ancestries and environments and determine whether common associations exist despite varied genetic and extrinsic factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Data and Sample Collection</title><p>Maternal blood samples were obtained during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between 24 and 32 weeks gestation during the population-based Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study conducted during 2000&#x02013;2006 at 15 international field centers (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Fasting and 1-h glucose and C-peptide were measured.

Maternal BMI was calculated using height and weight at OGTT. For 1,412 mothers in this study with self-reported pregestational weight, there was 92.4% correlation of OGTT BMI with pregestational BMI calculated using measured height and reported pregestational weight. Gestational age was calculated as previously described (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>); self-identified ancestry, parity, and other demographic data were ascertained via questionnaire.</p><p>Metabolites were measured in maternal fasting and 1-h serum samples from 400 mothers of Afro-Caribbean, Mexican American, Northern European, and Thai ancestry.

In brief, conventional metabolites (lactate, triglycerides, &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate, glycerol, and nonesterified fatty acids [NEFA]) were measured on a Beckman-Coulter Unicell DxC 600 clinical analyzer. Targeted metabolomics assays for acylcarnitines and amino acids used tandem mass spectrometry with addition of known quantities of stable isotope-labeled internal standards on an Acquity TQD Triple Quadrupole system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). Sixty-two conventional and targeted metabolites were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><sec id="s6"><title>Per-Metabolite Analysis</title><p>Acylcarnitine and &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate levels were log transformed for analysis. Outlying metabolite values, defined as five or more SDs from the mean, were excluded from analysis.</p><p>Metabolite levels were compared across ancestries using ANOVA, and K-means clustering was used to illustrate patterns in metabolite means across ancestries, with inputs consisting of differences between ancestry-specific and overall means, divided by ANOVA residual SE for each metabolite. K-means clustering is a method for partitioning data into groups that minimizes differences in values within clusters. Initially, data points are randomly placed into one of a prespecified number of groups. The mean value of the observations in each group is calculated, and points are reassigned to the group with the closest mean. This process proceeds iteratively until the mean value of each group no longer changes. To avoid arbitrarily prespecifying the number of groups (K), the &#x0201c;NbClust&#x0201d; R package was used (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This package provides 30 data-driven indices for identifying the optimal number of clusters from a dataset. K was chosen to be the number most frequently identified among these 30 indices.</p><p>Associations between phenotypes and metabolites were identified using linear regression within ancestry group, treating maternal phenotypes as predictors and maternal metabolites as outcomes, adjusting for baseline covariates: field center, mean arterial pressure, maternal age, neonatal sex, sample storage time, and gestational age at OGTT. Maternal phenotypes included BMI (with and without glucose adjustment), fasting and 1-h glucose (with and without BMI adjustment), and insulin sensitivity (with and without BMI adjustment). False discovery rate (FDR) correction (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) was applied to ancestry-specific analyses; FDR-adjusted <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p><p>Since comparison of regression model betas across maternal phenotypes and metabolites is complicated by different units of measurement and amounts of variability, partial correlation estimates (<italic>r<sub>p</sub></italic>) were calculated for maternal phenotypes and metabolites, after adjusting for model covariates, to assist in interpreting strength of associations. Partial correlation estimates range in magnitude from 0 to 1 (no to perfect association) and represent association strength on a comparable scale for all maternal phenotypes and metabolites. Sample sizes of 400 for within-ancestry analyses afforded 90% power at two-sided &#x003b1; = 0.001 (roughly consistent with FDR adjustment for 62 metabolites to maintain overall 5% type I error) to detect partial correlations of 0.24, assuming up to 0.30 correlation of maternal phenotypes with other model covariates.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Meta-analysis</title><p>To combine effect estimates across analyses conducted for each ancestry group for a combined measure of association across all groups, random-effects meta-analysis was performed.

Isoleucine/leucine, carnitine esters of their catabolites, and phenylalanine were associated with insulin resistance or both BMI and insulin resistance. Carnitine esters of arachidonate and several saturated fatty acids were associated with FPG, whereas tyrosine, glycine, and 3-hydroxybutyrate and its carnitine ester, as well as carnitine esters of polyunsaturated fatty acids, were associated with BMI. Overall, BMI demonstrated the most unique associations with fasting metabolites. FPG was associated with an intermediate number of unique metabolites, whereas insulin sensitivity had roughly equal overlap with BMI and glucose.</p><p>At 1 h, several metabolites were common across phenotypes, including glycerol, phenylalanine, arginine, glutamine/glutamate, asparagine/aspartate, and the carnitine ester of palmitoleate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). Additional metabolites were associated with both BMI and 1-h glucose, including 3-hydroxybutyrate and its carnitine ester, BCAAs, and carnitine esters of several saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids.

These were largely carnitine esters of fatty acids; however, tyrosine was associated with BMI whereas glycine and citrulline were associated with 1-h glucose.

Using targeted metabolomics in a multiancestry cohort of pregnant women, we have demonstrated that maternal BMI and glycemia have metabolic signatures that are, in part, shared but also unique to each phenotype and that these signatures largely remain consistent across ancestry groups. These analyses suggest that metabolites associated uniquely with maternal hyperglycemia or obesity may contribute to their independent effects on newborn outcomes and complement previous work demonstrating associations between the maternal metabolome and newborn outcomes in HAPO European ancestry mothers (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Fatty acids and their metabolites are important for fetal growth and development (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Many of the metabolites associated with both maternal BMI and glycemia were lipid related, including NEFA and carnitine esters of several mono- (C10:1 to C18:1) and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Declining levels of free carnitine, acetylcarnitine, and short-chain carnitine esters and stable levels of medium- and long-chain carnitine esters during pregnancy have been reported (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), but their association with maternal phenotypes has not. We observed negative association of fasting NEFA and acylcarnitines with FPG but positive association with BMI. In contrast, 1 h postglucose, many of these same metabolites (e.g., AC C10:1 to C16:1 and NEFA) were positively associated with both maternal BMI and 1-h glucose.</p><p>Fatty acid oxidation is a primary source of carnitine esters, and lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation increase as plasma glucose decreases during fasting in pregnancy (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Thus, the negative association of carnitine esters with FPG may reflect increased fatty acid mobilization and oxidation as glucose declines. Postglucose, greater insulin resistance, reflected by higher maternal BMI and 1-h glucose, may result in higher levels of fatty acids and their metabolic by-products secondary to inefficient suppression of lipolysis and incomplete fatty acid oxidation due to mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction associated with higher maternal BMI and insulin resistance in the fasting state could also underlie the positive association of maternal BMI with by-products of fatty acid oxidation. One hour postglucose, additional lipid-related metabolites, e.g., glycerol and 3-hydroxybutyrate and its carnitine ester AC C4-OH, were also associated with both phenotypes. Similar to nonpregnant populations (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), BCAAs leucine/isoleucine were positively associated with both maternal BMI and 1-h glucose, presumably reflecting the impact of insulin resistance.</p><p>A novel aspect of this study is identification of metabolic signatures uniquely associated with maternal BMI and glycemia, including differences in metabolites most strongly associated with these phenotypes. Among metabolites positively associated with both fasting and 1-h glucose but not BMI were gluconeogenic substrates lactate and alanine, consistent with our earlier findings (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Similar to findings with the monounsaturated long-chain acylcarnitines, carnitine esters of several medium- and long-chain saturated fatty acids were negatively associated with FPG and positively associated with 1-h glucose. This association of saturated fatty acid metabolites with maternal glucose is similar to findings in nonpregnant populations where higher levels of ACs C8, C10, and C12 trended with worse dysglycemia (normal vs. impaired FPG or glucose tolerance vs. type 2 diabetes), but no association with percent body fat was observed (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Another fatty acid metabolite uniquely associated with maternal glycemia was the carnitine ester of arachidonate (AC C20:4). Arachidonate is important for fetal development and derived, in part, from transplacental transfer (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We found a negative association of its carnitine ester with fasting and 1-h glucose, contrasting with higher levels of fasting arachidonate reported in women with GDM and impaired glucose tolerance (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). One potential explanation for this dichotomy would be impaired maternal arachidonate metabolism in the setting of maternal hyperglycemia resulting in higher arachidonate levels overall but lower levels of its carnitine ester.</p><p>Like maternal glucose, maternal BMI also has a unique metabolic signature that includes a number of carnitine esters, although with more mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids than seen with glucose. Recently, the association of several plasma metabolites with maternal prepregnancy BMI across gestation in a cohort of 167 non-Hispanic and Hispanic ancestry women was reported (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the third trimester, associated metabolites included two n-6 long-chain fatty acids and 3-hydroxybutyrate. In contrast to findings in our larger cohort, no acylcarnitines or amino acids, except asparagine, were significantly associated in the third trimester (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Similar to that report, we found an association of fasting 3-hydroxybutyrate and its carnitine ester with maternal BMI, but we found an association of additional lipid-related metabolites in the third trimester, e.g., glycerol and triglycerides, and amino acids, most notably the aromatic amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine and by-products of BCAA metabolism (ACs C5:1, C5, and C5-OH/C3-DC). At 1 h, maternal BMI was associated with tyrosine, valine, and BCAA metabolic by-products (ACs C5:1, C5, and C5-OH/C3-DC). Aromatic amino acids together with BCAA are associated with type 2 diabetes risk (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Metabolites uniquely associated with either maternal glycemia or BMI may account, in part, for the independent effect of these phenotypes on pregnancy outcomes.</p><p>We also examined insulin resistance. Maternal BMI, glycemia, and insulin resistance are interrelated; however, unlike maternal BMI and glycemia, insulin resistance is not associated with newborn outcomes after adjusting for maternal BMI (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Multiple metabolites demonstrated joint association with insulin resistance and either maternal BMI or glycemia, but only fasting leucine/isoleucine and BCAA metabolite AC C4/C<italic>i</italic>4 were uniquely associated with maternal insulin resistance. An earlier study demonstrated no association of metabolites with insulin resistance, but cohort size may explain this difference (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>A second novel aspect of our study was determination of metabolite levels in women of different ancestries and environments who have varying intrinsic (e.g., genetic) and extrinsic (e.g., diet, exercise, and environment) exposures (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Metabolomic studies across ancestry groups have been limited. In a previous study of urinary metabolites in cohorts from China, Japan, and Chicago, principal components analysis distinguished between metabolite profiles in the three cohorts, consistent with genetic, dietary, and gut microbiome differences across populations (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). A study comparing Hispanic and non-Hispanic pregnant women demonstrated similarities and differences in metabolite levels between the two populations across gestation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This is consistent with our findings of differences and similarities in metabolite levels between populations in the third trimester. Despite some differences in levels across ancestry groups, our meta-analyses identified multiple metabolites associated with maternal phenotypes. For example, whereas many metabolites associated with BMI were not associated within the Thai cohort, significance on meta-analysis suggests similar trends among all four cohorts, even when heterogeneity of effect size was detected. These data suggest that associations of maternal BMI, glucose levels, and insulin resistance with maternal metabolites are largely similar regardless of ancestral background and environment, consistent with intrinsic factors having a significant impact on the response of maternal metabolites to pregnancy. Determining whether these are genetic or other factors will require future studies.</p><p>Our study had multiple strengths. First, it included four ancestry groups, ensuring that results are applicable to diverse populations. Second, samples obtained both fasting and 1 h after glucose provided insight into two metabolic states. Third, a large sample size from each ancestry group was available. One limitation is that the metabolic signatures associated with the different phenotypes were based on data limited to a single time point early in the third trimester. Levels of some metabolites are dynamic during pregnancy (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and trimester-specific associations of some metabolites with maternal BMI have been demonstrated (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A second limitation was use of BMI measured at the OGTT, as this reflects fetal and placental elements together with maternal elements. However, as noted, OGTT BMI showed a 92.4% correlation with calculated pregestational BMI in our cohort.</p><p>In summary, consistent with clinical observations that associations of maternal BMI and glucose with adverse pregnancy outcomes are, in part, independent, these two phenotypes are associated with unique sets of metabolites. Although there is clear overlap in classes of metabolites associated with each phenotype, the metabolic signature of maternal glucose is enriched for gluconeogenic substrates whereas maternal BMI is associated with a number of lipid-related metabolites. Importantly, similar to nonpregnant populations, our findings are consistent with pregnancy-induced insulin resistance and its related phenotypes being associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The relatively consistent associations across ancestry groups and environments suggest a common response of maternal metabolites to the metabolic changes of pregnancy.</p></sec>
