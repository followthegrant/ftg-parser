Introduction</title><p>Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons provide connectivity between peripheral targets and the spinal cord. These neurons show significant heterogeneity in relation to their morphology, functional properties, growth factor dependence, and transcriptional profile.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup> This reflects the highly specialised nature of these neurons subserving distinct sensory modalities, including temperature, pain, itch, touch, and proprioception. Recent single-cell RNA-seq studies have provided a means to classify these neurons and have identified multiple DRG neuron subgroups.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> Pathologies of DRG neurons&#x02014;for instance, in the form of acquired or inherited peripheral neuropathies&#x02014;have a significant impact on human health as a consequence of sensory loss and neuropathic pain<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and are destined to become more common with an ageing population and increased prevalence of type II diabetes.</p><p>A wide variety of injuries applied to sensory neurons, whether traumatic or metabolic, result in marked alterations in transcription of protein-coding genes.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Such changes can have either beneficial or maladaptive outcomes, including increased expression of regeneration-associated genes<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> and altered expression of ion channels resulting in enhanced DRG neuronal excitability and neuropathic pain. The DRG has therefore become a model system to study the transcriptional changes after injury. This focus on RNAs' encoding proteins is understandable, given their obvious link with function. However, there are other types of RNA and one of these, long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) has been relatively neglected and little studied in the context of sensory neurones.</p><p>LncRNAs are usually multiexonic transcripts of more than 200 base pairs that can modulate gene expression through <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> signalling, and have important functional effects.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup> The mechanisms by which LncRNAs may alter gene expression are very diverse, including: complementary binding of antisense LncRNAs, transcriptional interference at promoter sites, altered chromatin structure, competing for miRNA binding, and binding to transcription factors.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref></sup></p><p>Ion channels are key determinants of the excitability and hence the functional properties of sensory neurons. Antisense LncRNAs have previously been identified to the voltage-gated potassium channel, KCNA2,<sup><xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref></sup> and the voltage-gated sodium channel, SCN9A.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In the former case, induction of the antisense LncRNA after nerve injury was shown to result in reduced expression of KCNA2 (which acts as an excitability break), leading to sensory neuronal hyperexcitability and the development of neuropathic pain. These are selected examples of functionally relevant LncRNAs that illustrate the important role they can play. However, there has, to date, been no comprehensive analysis of LncRNA expression within the DRG partly because LncRNAs are typically expressed at low levels and are known to vary by species, tissue, and developmental stage.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> Our aim was to use high-coverage RNA-seq combined with a dedicated bioinformatics platform to identify as comprehensively as possible LncRNAs expressed in the DRG. We compared rats and 2 different mouse strains (which show differing degrees of mechanical hypersensitivity after nerve injury<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>). We wished to determine whether LncRNAs were expressed in a cell-type&#x02013;specific manner and also to assess the effect of nerve injury on LncRNA expression. In addition, we also assessed LncRNA expression in human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell &#x02013;derived sensory neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2.

Animals were group housed in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms where food and water was available ad libitum, with a 12-hour light&#x02013;dark cycle. The welfare of all animals was continually assessed throughout all procedures. In total, 24 rats were used.</p><p>Rats were humanely culled.

We selected SJs covered with &#x0003e;2 reads and with lengths &#x0003e;20 and &#x0003c;100,000. We discarded all reads overlapping annotated gene models. We then used the remaining subset of RNA-seq reads to identify I.o.E outside known gene models using a coverage window approach. Gene models were extended by 1000 bp in each direction to ensure that elongated untranslated regions (UTRs) or not yet annotated exons would not be considered putative novel genes. We selected continuous regions above the coverage threshold of more than a read-mate length to ensure that overlapping read mates would not artificially increase coverage. For I.o.E length &#x02265;100 and depth &#x0003e;2, I.o.E were identified using the function &#x0201c;BAM_to_IOE.&#x0201d; Islands of expression were collapsed and clustered as co-overlapping features connected by SJs. A connectivity matrix was created holding all interconnecting I.o.E. In each cluster, consensus introns were calculated by the relative frequency of each discrete segment of a set of SJs. We then subtracted the genomic intervals of these consensus introns from the genomic intervals of the grouped (I.o.E) to reconstruct full-length putative LncRNAs. For novel I.o.E with no overlapping SJs, we first selected only the intersect of the respective genomic regions across all samples. Then, monoexonic putative LncRNAs were kept for further analysis only if the length-normalised coverage had Pr (&#x0003e;<inline-formula/>) &#x0003c; 0.1.

In situ hybridization was performed using the RNAScope 2.5 RED chromogenic assay kit and by following the manufacturer's instructions (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA). Briefly, slides containing tissue sections were removed from the &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C freezer, allowed to equilibrate to RT and rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

Novel long noncoding RNAs expressed in the rodent dorsal root ganglion</title><p>To identify unknown transcribed regions outside known gene models (ie, representation of RNA transcripts produced by a gene) and then group them into transcriptional units representing putative novel LncRNAs on the gene level, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) of DRG tissue harvested from animal models of nerve injury vs sham controls. We profiled novel LncRNAs alongside known annotated protein-coding genes and LncRNAs from the ENSEMBL genome database.<sup><xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref></sup> To obtain computational predictions of novel LncRNAs, we used a reference-based customised pipeline<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> that relies on a reference genome and gene set annotations. It uses the output of the STAR<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> aligner, and the quality of predictions is dependent on the aligner accuracy, the quality of the reference genome, and the completeness of the gene set annotation. A coverage threshold is used<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> to identify nonannotated continuously transcribed regions,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> ie, I.o.E., and then clustered together and trimmed these regions using de novo identified SJs from mapping the RNA-seq reads to the organism's genome. We also applied a signal processing, smoothed <italic>z</italic>-score thresholding algorithm to further identify coverage drops (putative introns and transcription ends) and peaks (putative exons). To identify nonannotated I.o.E and to differentiate them from UTRs or not-yet-annotated exons belonging to known gene models, we filtered out reads overlapping ENSEMBL and RefSeq annotations as well as genomic regions of 1000 bp from the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end of known gene models. Doing so, we have excluded any predictions overlapping with a region of 1000 bp from both ends of annotated gene models. The mean length of 3&#x02032; UTRs is 424 bp and 524 bp in rodents and humans, respectively. For the 5&#x02032; UTRs, mean lengths are 127 bp in rodents and 146 bp in humans.<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> We should note that we used both major annotation consortia, so an incomplete gene annotation (ie, missing exons, UTRs, and isoforms) in just one of the annotated gene sets would not influence results. Given the fact that we discarded all predictions overlapping annotated genes, we could not also identify extracoding RNAs, as these overlap protein-coding genes on the sense strand.<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup></p><p>32.6% of read pairs on average were overlapping regions outside gene models (as we used paired-end data, the units of evidence for gene expression are always pairs of reads). This finding is consistent with <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Ref. 22</xref>.</p><p>To acquire a complete representation of the nonannotated transcribed regions, we intentionally applied a low coverage threshold (&#x0003e;2 sequence coverage for the region) for at least the length of an RNA-seq read (&#x02265;100 bp). The cutoff threshold is similar to the one applied in <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Ref. 22</xref>. Then, we clustered and trimmed these regions using splicing information from novel SJs identified by at least 2 RNA-seq read-pairs and a smoothed <italic>z</italic>-score over a rolling window to identify coverage drops.

RNA-seq quality was good for both experiments (supplementary tables 1&#x02013;4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676">http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676</ext-link>). Quality was assessed based on: the percentage of uniquely mapped reads (89% for mice and 72.51% for rats), the number of properly and concordantly paired reads, the average Phred score for read quality (32.2 for mice and 34.3 for rats), the base calling at the extremities of reads (0.08 for mice and 0 for rats, low Phred scores at the end of reads), the median of the insert between paired read mates (192.1 for mice and 153.4 for rats), and the GC content of reads for all sequencing lanes and samples (48.2% for mice and 51.4% for rats). Two mouse samples were excluded because they had much lower mapped reads (sample 59: 73.3%), a very high percentage of unmapped reads because they were too short (sample 59: 18.1%), much more reads mapped to multiple loci (sample 66 and sample 59), and higher Cook's distance (supplementary figure 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676">http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676</ext-link>).

When we removed the outlying distant TSS&#x02014;ie, more than 1.5 times the interquantile range of the distribution&#x02014;the mean distance of TSS and novel LncRNAs was 119 bp upstream of the predicted transcript. In a GENCODE study,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> 15% of identified LncRNAs in humans had a TSS on their 5&#x02032; end. These results highlight how close the 5&#x02032; end of novel LncRNAs was to experimentally determined TSS. Due to the fact that only a fraction of TSS were mapped to the current mouse genome, these data are likely to be an underestimate. These findings are in concordance with those of <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Ref. 17</xref>.

Of the 449 genes in the database, we have found 13 novel LncRNAs antisense to pain genes in mice and 19 in rats (supplementary tables 5 and 6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676">http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676</ext-link>). Twenty-three intergenic LncRNAs had a pain gene as their closest genomic neighbour in mice and 57 in rats (supplementary tables 7 and 8 available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676">http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676</ext-link>). Ion channels are key determinants of sensory neuron excitability. We identified LncRNAs antisense to voltage-gated sodium channels, potassium channels, calcium channels, chloride channels, and TRP channels, within the mouse and rat DRG, as shown in supplementary tables 9 and 10 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676">http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676</ext-link>).</p><p>In general, we had modest syntenic conservation (ie, in equivalent genomic positions) between species.

We lifted genomic coordinates from rn5 to rn6 genome and found in total 912 conserved synteny blocks in humans and mice and 443 uniquely mapped in the current rat genome. Eight hundred (18.5%) novel LncRNAs in rats and 1271 (47%) in mice were in these syntenic blocks conserved between the 3 species. Moreover, 649 LncRNAs in mice and 782 in rats were in 200 common syntenic blocks between the 2 species (supplementary data available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6508205">http://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6508205</ext-link>, S.

To consider a gene or LncRNA neuron subtype&#x02013;specific, we also imposed a cutoff mean expression threshold of &#x0003e;3 log2-normalised read pairs across all samples of a neuronal subtype. Eighty-seven novel LncRNAs, 119 annotated LncRNAs, and 597 protein-coding genes were neuron subtype&#x02013;specific.

This quantification of the DRG subtype specificity confirms that LncRNAs' expression pattern is more tissue specific than protein-coding genes'.

Discussion</title><p>We used high-depth RNA sequencing and a dedicated bioinformatic pipeline to identify thousands of known and putative novel LncRNAs expressed in the mouse and rat DRG and human IPSC&#x02013;derived sensory neurons. Many of these LncRNAs were antisense or adjacent to known pain and ion-channel genes. A significant proportion demonstrated selective expression in DRG neuron subtypes. Novel LncRNAs were DE after peripheral nerve injury in a species- and strain-dependent manner, including novel antisense LncRNAs with opposite transcriptional changes to their sense genes and intergenic LncRNAs highly correlated with their adjacent gene. Thus, LncRNAs that have been a relatively unexplored part of the DRG transcriptome demonstrate remarkable complexity in terms of their relationship to genes known to impact on sensory function, DRG cell-type&#x02013;specific expression, and the transcriptional response to nerve injury.</p><p>LncRNAs have been shown to be: smaller than protein-coding genes, spliced, biexonic, transcribed as independent transcription units, expressed at a lower level than protein-coding genes, and show highly spatially constrained correlation with their antisense and adjacent genes.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref></sup> These characteristics are highly consistent with the antisense and intergenic LncRNAs that we identified in this study as being expressed in the DRG.</p><p>No previous attempts have comprehensively determined LncRNA expression within the DRG. Previous studies have undertaken a candidate gene approach,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref></sup> whereas others have used a high-throughput approach such as RNA-seq but have only interrogated the expression of previously annotated LncRNAs.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></sup> As we have shown, this strategy will miss thousands of unannotated and potentially important LncRNAs. In fact, 8% of genes within the Pain Genes Database in the mouse, 16% in the rats, and 7% in human IPSC were found to have an antisense or neighbouring intergenic LncRNA. Furthermore, LncRNAs antisense to ion channels were not limited to KCNA2 and SCN9A, but could also be identified to other sodium, potassium, calcium, and also TRP channels, all of which have key roles in modulating sensory neuron function. As with all computational predictions, this study has the limitation of the possible inclusion of false positives in our list of novel LncRNAs; however, we have validated the expression of a number of novel LncRNAs using the independent technique of qPCR.</p><p>It is known that LncRNAs can be highly tissue- and cell-type&#x02013;specific.<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> Dorsal root ganglion cells are heterogeneous in terms of their physiology, anatomy, and connectivity; recent single-cell analysis shows how gene expression relates to such specialised features but also reveals even greater complexity in DRG subtypes based on molecular profiling.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> We showed that both novel and annotated LncRNAs demonstrate selective expression within sensory neuron subtypes. As such, identification of LncRNAs may help in the molecular classification of DRG cells. Moreover, both novel and annotated LncRNAs were significantly enriched in neuron-subtype&#x02013;specific genes vs protein-coding genes. The functional specialisation of different neuron subtypes will principally arise due to the neuron subtype&#x02013;dependent expression of protein-coding genes; however, such expression may be sculpted by LncRNAs.</p><p>We have also defined LncRNAs expressed in human IPSC-derived sensory neurons. Advantages of studying LncRNA expression in this model (rather than, eg, cadaveric human DRG) is the ready source of high-quality RNA from a pure sensory neuronal population (with very few contaminating Schwann cells) and the ability to compare expression to the parent IPSC line. Disadvantages include the fact that although subpopulations of sensory neurons exist in these cultures, these are not as diverse as native DRG cells and are less mature given the lack of target interactions.</p><p>We identified almost 2000 previously annotated and over 2000 novel putative LncRNAs, which were DE when comparing IPSC-derived sensory neurons and parent IPSC lines. These demonstrated many characteristics of the LncRNAs expressed in the rodent DRG. Twenty-nine percent of genes in the Pain Genes Database had a potentially relevant relationship to a novel or annotated LncRNA either antisense LncRNAs on the opposite strand or adjacent to an intergenic LncRNA. Interestingly, some of these LncRNAs may have a role in shaping the expression of the sense pain gene during differentiation, as both novel and annotated, DE antisense LncRNAs demonstrated anticorrelated expression changes to their DE sense pain gene. We also identified human LncRNAs that were antisense to voltage-gated ion channel genes. It has been shown that many LncRNAs overlap genome-wide association studies' traits, and LncRNAs overlapping trait-associated SNPs are specifically expressed in cell types relevant to the traits.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The identification of human LncRNAs expressed in IPSC-derived sensory neurons may therefore enable investigation of the genetic basis of chronic pain states in humans, especially under conditions of neuropathic pain wherein maladaptive plasticity in the DRG is an important pathophysiological driver. A recent study has mapped eQTLs in the human DRG,<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and a number of SNPs that impacted on gene expression were found to be within annotated LncRNAs. In our data, 9 LncRNAs expressed in IPSC-derived sensory neurons were overlapped by eQTLs. Three of the novel and 3 of the known were also DE in IPSC-derived neurons vs IPSC. Dorsal root ganglion eQTLs identified by <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Ref. 52</xref> were found among hits in numerous genome-wide association studies. Such studies highlight the utility in identifying LncRNAs, in this case by providing explanatory power as to how an SNP linked to complex disorders may impact on gene expression and phenotype. As more tissue becomes available for RNA-seq, it will also be possible to extend LncRNA discovery to the postmortem human DRG.<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup></p><p>Nerve injury is known to elicit remarkable transcriptional changes within the DRG, which has deleterious consequences such as neuropathic pain, but in certain contexts can also be adaptive; eg, by promoting nerve repair.<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> We investigated the expression of LncRNAs in Wistar rats after SNT and in 2 different mouse strains after SNI. The BALB/c strain was previously shown to develop greater levels of mechanical hypersensitivity after SNI vs the B10.D2 strain.<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> Hundreds of LncRNAs were DE in both rats and mice after nerve injury. We found that more protein-coding genes, annotated LncRNAs, and novel LncRNAs were DE in the high pain BALB/c strain compared with the low pain B10.D2 strain. Most of the variance of the LncRNAs' expression in our data set was between strains and not conditions; namely, LncRNAs demonstrated strain-dependent expression plasticity after nerve injury. Twenty-seven percent of LncRNAs were significantly DE between mouse strains compared with 12.2% for ENSEMBL protein-coding genes. Considering the rapidly increasing literature on sex differences in pain processing<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> that there were sex-dependent effects on LncRNA expression.</p><p>Weighted gene coexpression network analysis revealed that novel LncRNAs in the mouse DRG were in network modules related to RNA-processing and some of them in modules related to myelination, development, and regeneration of the nervous system, immune response, and signalling. This could indicate that these LncRNAs function together with genes acting as transcriptional regulators associated with posttranscriptional modifications. This enrichment is different from that observed in the ENSEMBL annotated gene set, where terms related to axon guidance, ion channel transport, regulation of synapse assembly and of neuron apoptotic process, nervous system development, and memory were significantly enriched. These findings are similar to known biological processes enriched after nerve injury<sup><xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></sup> and in pain genes.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup></p><p>Enrichment in biological processes of splicing, mRNA processing, and polyadenylation (ie, parent, child, and related terms to RNA-processing) has however been reported.<sup><xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref></sup> Our finding that the expression of novel LncRNAs changes together with annotated genes regulating RNA-processing is consistent with known mechanisms by which LncRNAs alter gene expression (discussed below).</p><p>LncRNAs can regulate expression in <italic>cis</italic> and in <italic>trans</italic>,<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> but the genomic context of LncRNAs is important for both antisense transcripts regulating the gene on the sense strand or intergenic LncRNAs. Intergenic and antisense LncRNAs, which tend to lie in genomic regions populated with genes,<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> have correlated expression patterns with their adjacent genes and may regulate gene expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> We found that the shorter the distance, the stronger the correlation in all species, both for known and annotated LncRNAs. However, the network analysis we performed allowed us to identify in an unbiased way modules of highly correlated genes and LncRNAs across all samples. Thus, these LncRNAs are putative both <italic>in-cis</italic> and <italic>in-trans</italic> regulators. Regarding the relation of LncRNAs with their genomic context, we found that more than 45% of antisense LncRNAs had anticorrelated&#x02014;opposite expression changes in respect to the sense gene, whereas only 10% of intergenic LncRNAs had negative correlation with the expression of their closest genomic neighbour. Twelve pairs of antisense LncRNA/sense gene with opposite LFCs reached significance between pain models and control animals. These antisense LncRNAs fit into the paradigm of <italic>Kcna2</italic> antisense,<sup><xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref></sup> which silences the gene on the opposite strand. LncRNAs are also known for regulating clusters of imprinted genes or close genes such as the <italic>Hoxd</italic> cluster.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref></sup> One of these LncRNAs, HAGLR, was the most upregulated and stronger expressed LncRNA in human IPSC&#x02013;derived neurons and was also found by in situ hybridization to be expressed in the mouse DRG and significantly downregulated in both mouse strains after nerve injury (supplementary table 12, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676">http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A676</ext-link>).</p><p>We used qPCR to validate the expression of a number of novel LncRNAs in close genomic relationship to protein-coding genes of relevance to sensory function: A novel LncRNA antisense of Nefl gene implicated in the Charcot&#x02013;Marie&#x02013;Tooth disease,<sup><xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref></sup> and an intergenic LncRNA close to and highly correlated with the pain gene Oprd1 was found DE and validated with qPCR. We also describe a novel intergenic LncRNA in close proximity to the Lrrc4 gene that relates to axon guidance and synapse organisation,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> and finally, a significantly DE intergenic LncRNA was validated close to the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit Scn4b. The majority of LncRNAs validated by qPCR were found to be more highly expressed in the DRG than brain. LncRNAs are putative therapeutic agents that could regulate the expression of target genes related to disease.<sup><xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> Although application of such therapeutics to pain would need to overcome the hurdle of delivering therapeutics to DRG cell bodies.</p><p>In summary, we have provided a resource, in which we have defined LncRNA expression within the DRG across species. We show that marked changes in LncRNA expression occur after nerve injury and during sensory neuron differentiation. LncRNAs' expression is DRG subtype&#x02013;specific, and there is often highly spatially constrained correlation/anticorrelation with their antisense and adjacent genes.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1615" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ai" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s002.ai" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1616" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s003.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1617" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s004.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1618" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s005.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1619" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s006.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1620" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s007.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1621" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s008.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1622" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s009.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1623" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s010.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1624" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s011.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1626" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s012.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1627" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s013.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1628" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s014.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1629" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s015.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1630" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s016.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1631" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s017.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1632" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s018.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1633" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s019.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1634" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="doc" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s020.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1635" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jop-160-463-s021.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1636" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The project was supported by a strategic award from the Wellcome Trust (Ref. 102645); D.L.
