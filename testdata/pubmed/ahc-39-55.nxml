However, the molecular characteristics of TSCs remain unknown, because of the difficulties in analyzing them due to their paucity. By using our previously reported method of selectively and efficiently collecting TSCs, we have analyzed the difference in expression patterns of lysophospholipid (LPL) receptor genes (<italic>LPA</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>LPA</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>LPA</italic><sub>3</sub>, <italic>S1P</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>S1P</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>S1P</italic><sub>3</sub>, <italic>S1P</italic><sub>4</sub>, and <italic>S1P</italic><sub>5</sub>) between TSCs and myelinating Schwann cells (MSCs). LPL, which includes lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), is the bioactive lipid that induces a myriad of cellular responses through specific members of G-protein coupled receptors for LPA.

The effects of LPL are mediated through distinct G-protein coupled receptors that are encoded by a different gene family. The first lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor gene identified was the &#x0201c;ventricular zone gene-1 (<italic>vzg-1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>LPA</italic><sub>1</sub>)&#x0201d;, which was abundantly expressed in the ventricular zone of the embryonic cerebral cortex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

Especially, Weiner and Chun demonstrated that <italic>LPA</italic><sub>1</sub> was expressed by postnatal SCs, and that LPA promotes SC survival via <italic>LPA</italic><sub>1</sub> activation and a pathway including Gi, PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase) and Akt &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In the peripheral nervous system, SCs play important roles in the axonal regeneration following nerve injury. It is well known that there are two types of SCs, myelinating Schwann cells (MSCs) and terminal Schwann cells (TSCs). TSCs are located at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and the number of TSCs is usually 2&#x02013;6 cells at individual NMJs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Following partial denervation, processes of TSCs extend to the neighboring NMJ and induce the axonal regeneration from the neighboring NMJ &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

These differences in post-injury reaction between TSCs and MSCs may reflect the physiological significance of each type of SCs. However, the analysis of TSCs is difficult due to the paucity and the intricacy of collecting TSCs. We have previously devised a novel method of obtaining TSCs at the single cell level and found a TSC-specific gene, <italic>Herp</italic>, by applying PCR-differential display &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In order to elucidate the molecular characteristics of TSCs when compared to MSCs, we have studied the expressions of LPL receptors by single cell RT-PCR and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods"><title>II.&#x02003;Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Adult Wistar rats (9- to 10-week-old female) were purchased from a breeder (SLC, Japan) 4 days prior to treatment, and maintained in a temperature- and humidity-controlled animal facility with a 12:12-hr light:dark cycle. The studies were approved by the Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and all the experiments were carried out in full compliance with the Rules and Regulations for the Experimental Use and Care of Laboratory Animals at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of total RNA from skeletal muscle and Schwann cells, and of genomic DNA</title><p>Total RNAs from soleus muscle and kidney were extracted and purified with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. Total RNAs from terminal Schwann cells and myelinating Schwann cells were prepared as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Briefly, single terminal Schwann cell was isolated as follows. The soleus muscle was dissected out from the animals after deep anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital. The muscle was trimmed in a central portion at the entry point of the sciatic nerve branch and embedded in a low-melting temperature agarose gel. Cross sections, 500 &#x000b5;m in thickness, of the muscle were prepared with a microslicer. The sections that include the nerve branch were selected for further studies. NMJs were stained with a fluorescent dye, 4-(4-diethylaminostyryl)-<italic>N</italic>-methyl-pyridinium iodide (4-Di-2-ASP, Molecular Probes, USA). After enzymatic treatment for cell dissociation, individual cells were collected carefully with microcapillaries under an epifluorescent stereomicroscope (Nikon, Japan) and transferred into small tubes containing the cell lysis buffer in Strataprep total RNA microprep kit. Myelinating Schwann cells were prepared from the sciatic nerves of adult Wistar rats. Sciatic nerves, free of perineurium and epineurium, were incubated with collagenase and trypsin to obtain dissociated cells. The cells were collected and transferred into the lysis buffer by using microcapillaries under conventional phase contrast microscope. After adding yeast tRNA (50 ng) to the above cell lysates, total RNA from each single cell was purified according to the instruction manual in the kit. Genomic DNA from kidney was purified with DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction.</p></sec><sec><title>cDNA synthesis</title><p>Total cDNAs from each type of single cell were synthesized and amplified using SMART cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech, USA) as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x0005d;. The optimized number of thermal cycling was set at 18.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, we obtained total cDNAs fractions from each type of Schwann cell. Some of the amplified cDNAs fractions were insufficient (such as T1 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Such total cDNAs fractions were not used for the following analysis. Then, the expression of three genes, including <italic>Herp</italic> (a marker of terminal Schwann cell, as demonstrated in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x0005d;), <italic>S-100</italic>&#x003b2; (a marker of Schwann cell) and <italic>GAPDH</italic> (a housekeeping gene) in each cDNA fractions was confirmed by PCR (as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). The total cDNAs fractions expressing three genes mentioned above were used for analyzing the expression of LPL receptor mRNAs.</p><p>We compared the pattern of mRNA expression of LPL receptor family genes between terminal Schwann cells and myelinating Schwann cells. PCR reactions were carried out using each set of the family member gene-specific primers and the total cDNAs prepared as described above. Amplification target sequence of each gene except for <italic>LPA</italic><sub>2</sub> was included within a single exon of each gene. Rat genomic DNA, therefore, was used as a positive control template for each PCR reaction. For <italic>LPA</italic><sub>2</sub>, however, rat kidney cDNAs were used as a positive control. Because each primer for <italic>LPA</italic><sub>2</sub> is located in different exons of the gene, the amplification condition of PCR conducted for cDNA template was not applicable to genomic DNA template. Hence, cDNAs from adult rat kidney where <italic>LPA</italic><sub>2</sub> mRNA is known to be expressed was used as the positive control template. On the other hand, reverse transcriptase-omitted reaction product as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) was used as a negative control template.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C, <italic>LPA</italic><sub>3</sub> was expressed only in TSCs, whereas <italic>S1P</italic><sub>1</sub> was expressed in TSCs and skeletal muscle, but not in MSCs. Neither <italic>LPA</italic><sub>2</sub> nor <italic>S1P</italic><sub>5</sub> was detectable in either type of Schwann cell. Other types of LPL receptor genes, including <italic>LPA</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>S1P</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>S1P</italic><sub>3</sub>, and <italic>S1P</italic><sub>4</sub>, were expressed in both types of Schwann cells. None of the LPL receptor family genes showed MSC-specific expression.</p><p>To confirm whether <italic>LPA</italic><sub>3</sub> was expressed selectively in TSCs, we have performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization in NMJs of adult rat soleus. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization was carried out for the longitudinal sections of adult rat soleus muscle, according to a whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization protocol. With antisense probe, strong signals were detected specifically in the cell bodies located on top of motor nerve terminals, but not in nerve terminals themselves, axons, or postsynaptic areas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B, C). No signal was detected using sense probe as a negative control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>IV.&#x02003;Discussion</title><p>The present study demonstrated the specific expression of <italic>LPA</italic><sub>3</sub> in TSCs present in NMJs of adult rat soleus, with single-cell based RT-PCR as well as <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. We have also demonstrated by RT-PCR that none of the LPL receptor family genes showed MSCs-specific expression.</p><p>In the peripheral nervous system, there are two types of Schwann cells, TSCs and MSCs. Both types of Schwann cells share the same lineage of cell origin, that is, neural crest cells, but behave in a different manner after maturation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x0005d;. MSCs are known to contribute to axonal outgrowth and guidance in the regeneration process following nerve injury &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x0005d;. On the other hand, TSCs appear to play pivotal roles in maintaining the structure and function of NMJs as well as in the repair process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, Son and Thompson and Son <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that processes of TSCs extend to the neighboring NMJ following partial denervation and the axonal regeneration was observed along the processes of TSCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The mode of nerve sprouting at NMJ is different from that at the nodes of Ranvier following injury. The regenerating sprouts which emerge from the nodes of Ranvier always extend distally within the basal lamina of MSCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x0005d;. On the other hand, the terminal nerve sprouts penetrate their own Schwann cell basal lamina tubes and grow toward the neighboring NMJ &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>&#x0005d;. These different modes of nerve sprouting may reflect different properties of Schwann cell resources, i.e., TSCs and MSCs. However, there are few studies on the comparative aspects of physiological as well as pathological characteristics of TSCs and MSCs. We previously devised a method of isolating and collecting TSCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x0005d; and this method enabled us to analyze gene expression in TSCs by RT-PCR. Here, we have applied a similar method to elucidate the expression of LPL receptor family genes in TSCs and compared the expression between TSCs and MSCs.</p><p>LPL is a phospholipid signaling molecule that has intercellular signaling pathways and has the broad biological functions such as cell proliferation, myogenesis, stress fiber formation, neurite retraction and increase of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x0005d;. The LPL receptor family of G-protein coupled receptors comprises two groups: LPA receptors and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. LPA receptors consist of LPA<sub>1</sub> (Edg-2&#x0002f;lp<sub>A1</sub>&#x0002f;vzg-1&#x0002f;rec1.3), LPA<sub>2</sub> (Edg-4&#x0002f;lp<sub>A2</sub>) and LPA<sub>3</sub> (Edg-7&#x0002f;lp<sub>A3</sub>), and S1P receptors include S1P<sub>1</sub> (Edg-1&#x0002f;lp<sub>B1</sub>), S1P<sub>2</sub> (Edg-5&#x0002f;lp<sub>B2</sub>&#x0002f;AGR16&#x0002f;H218), S1P<sub>3</sub> (Edg-3&#x0002f;lp<sub>B3</sub>), S1P<sub>4</sub> (Edg-6&#x0002f;lp<sub>B4</sub>), and S1P<sub>5</sub> (Edg-8&#x0002f;lp<sub>B5</sub>&#x0002f;nrg-1). Weiner and Chun studied the expression of LPL receptors in Schwann cells (SC) <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> using total RNA by Northern blot analysis, and reported that <italic>LPA</italic><sub>1</sub> was expressed at high level by SCs <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas <italic>S1P</italic><sub>1</sub> was only expressed in SCs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Neither <italic>LPA</italic><sub>2</sub> nor <italic>S1P</italic><sub>2</sub> was detectable, although <italic>S1P</italic><sub>3</sub> was expressed in SCs <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x0005d;. On the contrary, we were unable to detect the expression of <italic>S1P</italic><sub>1</sub> in isolated MSCs. This difference might be caused by the sampling method, because Weiner and Chun recognized expression of <italic>S1P</italic><sub>1</sub><italic/><italic>in vivo</italic>. Considering the fact that MSCs and TSCs behave differently after nerve injury, it would be worth studying changes of expression of each member of LPL gene family after nerve injury. Those studies are currently underway.</p><p>In conclusion, we studied the differential expression of LPL receptor gene family in TSCs and MSCs at single cell-based RT-PCR and found that <italic>LPA</italic><sub>3</sub> is specifically expressed in TSCs as confirmed by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. This differential expression of LPL receptors in TSCs and MSCs may underlie the behavior of each type of Schwann cells after nerve injury.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>V.&#x02003;Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (to SO) and by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (to TY) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.</p></ack><ref-list><title>VI.&#x02003;References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chun</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>J.
