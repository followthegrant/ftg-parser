in modulating the immune cell functions through the TLR pathway has
been tested and reported previously. However, the cellular signaling
involved in the stimulation of macrophages by natural, CpG
motif-containing adjuvant and the effector functions modulated by such
stimulation has not been well studied. Here, we used <italic>in
vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> murine macrophage
assay systems, and mouse model of <italic>in vivo</italic> stimulation
to explore the signaling pathway and the effector functions mediated
by BC01. Results show that BC01 can induce the production of TNF-&#x003b1; and
MCP-1 in macrophages by up-regulating the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and
MAPKs signaling pathway, and elevated the expression of MHC-II, CD40,
CD80, and CD86. Upon stimulation with BC01, the peritoneal macrophages
isolated from TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice produced significantly low
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, attenuated the activation of
NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPKs signaling pathways, and showed reduced phagocytosis.
Following <italic>in vivo</italic> stimulation with BC01, the
TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice produced significantly lower levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and lymph nodes showed reduced
cell proliferation. These results indicate that BC01 is an efficient
agonist of TLR9 that can significantly enhance the host-protective
immune functions of macrophages.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Adjuvant</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>MAPKs pathway</kwd><kwd>NF-&#x003ba;B pathway</kwd><kwd>TLR9</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1753425919879997"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adjuvants are immune modulators that have been used for many decades in the
treatment of various clinical manifestations. The incorporation of adjuvants
into vaccine formulations is aimed at enhancing, accelerating, and
prolonging antigen-specific immune responses. However, most of the vaccine
adjuvants available for human or animal use were developed empirically,
without a clear understanding of their cellular and molecular mechanism of
action. Studies have shown that most of these adjuvants enhance the host T-
and B-cell responses by engaging the components of the innate immune system,
rather than directly affecting the respective lymphocytes
themselves.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr3-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr4-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>TLRs have been well demonstrated to play a critical role in the induction of

as macrophages and dendritic cells, can recognize incorporation of PAMPs
expressed on a wide array of microbes, as well as endogenous
danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from dying cells; both
PAMP and DAMP are capable of activating the host innate immune

has been an increasing focus on TLR research to develop and use the natural
ligands or synthetic agonists as an adjuvant for immune stimulation, and
several of these potential TLR adjuvants are in clinical or late
pre-clinical stages at present.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>TLR9 is thought to be able to activate the innate immune cells by detecting the
unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, which are common in the genomes of most of
the bacteria and DNA viruses. These CpG motif-containing regions are highly
methylated in the vertebrate genomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="bibr18-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr19-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr20-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr21-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> BC01, used in this
study, was derived from unmethylated CpG motif-containing DNA fragment from
the genome of BCG (BCG CpG DNA Combination adjuvants system 01). It has the
following characteristics: (1) unmethylated CpG motifs: 15.75%&#x02013;24.75%; (2)
relative MW range: 3000&#x02013;10,000 base pairs; (3) natural bases and more
stable; and (4) no species differences. However, it has been well documented
that synthetic oligonucleotides, such as CpG-oligo-deoxynucleotides
(CpG-ODNs), contain unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, in particular sequence
contexts (CpG motifs). These CpG motifs are present at a 20-fold higher
frequency in bacterial DNA compared with mammalian DNA. Their relative MW
range is 20&#x02013;30 bases, such as ODN 2395 (5&#x02019;-tcgtcgttttcggcgcgcgccg-3&#x02019;,
22mer); although these synthesized CpG are phosphorothioate-modified to
improve their function and bioavailability, they are easily degradable and
show species differences simultaneously. Nonetheless, ODNs containing
unmethylated CpG motifs can act as immune adjuvants to up-regulate and
activate Th1 response, associated with production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, and support the maturation of APCs in humans and animal
models.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="bibr23-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr24-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr25-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Successful engagement of TLR ligands with cognate receptors triggers a signal

a series of steps involving TRAF-6, leads to the activation of

of BC01 as an adjuvant component to recombinant tuberculosis vaccine is
being tested in clinical trials, the mechanisms and signaling pathway
underlying the host immune activation by BC01 remain unclear. Therefore, the
main objective of this study was to identify and explore the molecular
signaling mechanism of BC01 in the activation of macrophages, which are
primary APCs of the innate host immunity. We wanted to test the effect of
BC01 on macrophage responses, explicitly mediated by the NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK
pathways since these are major regulatory factors involved in host
inflammation and innate immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods" id="sec2-1753425919879997"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec3-1753425919879997"><title>Mice and cell line</title><p>Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice and TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice

a size between 3 and 10 kbp. The DNA fragments were extracted from the
BCG vaccine by Q Sepharose HP ion-exchange chromatography (Figure S2).
To demonstrate that these DNA fragments contain unmethylated CpG
motif, first, we treated the BC01 with CpG methyltransferase (M.SssI),
an enzyme that methylates all cytosine residues in a double-stranded
DNA fragment. This was followed by restriction digestion of
M.SssI-treated BC01 with HpaII (a specific restriction endonuclease
that recognizes the sequence 5'-CCGG-3'). The rationale for this step
is that nucleotides in the DNA that have been methylated by M.SssI
will not be cleaved/restricted by HpaII. As shown in Supplemental
Figure 1 treatment with HpaII cleaved the native BC01 (lanes 3 and 7)
from the size between 3&#x02013;10 kbp to 100&#x02013;250 bp (lanes 4 and 8). However,
in BC01 methylated with M.SssI, the larger DNA fragment (3&#x02013;10 kbp)
remains intact and not cleaved by HpaII (lanes 2 and 6). We also show
that M.SssI treatment did not shear the 3&#x02013;10 kb DNA fragments (lanes 1
and 5). Based on these observations, we believe that BC01 contains a
large amount of unmethylated CpG motif-containing DNA of BCG. The
purity values of BC01 as determined by spectrophotometer are
A260/280&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.8 and A260/230&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.2. The detailed biochemical analysis

effector phases of a more specific, adaptive immune response. Therefore, the
ability to optimally activate the innate immune response has been one of the
critical indicators for evaluating the performance of vaccines and
adjuvants.</p><p>Engagement of TLRs by exogenous and endogenous signaling molecules, such as
PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively, leads to activation of macrophage effector
functions, which play crucial roles in regulating the host innate and
adaptive immunity during disease conditions. In the present study, we showed
that the activation of murine macrophages with an adjuvant, BC01,
significantly increased the production of TNF-&#x003b1; and MCP-1. In addition, the
loss of macrophage-stimulating activity of BC01 after digestion with DNase I
indicates that BC01-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was not
due to the presence of proteins or polysaccharides, but rather a specific
property of the unmethylated CpG motif-containing DNA fragments extracted
from BCG genome. Consistent with Diesel et&#x000a0;al., our data suggest that
binding of BCG DNA to TLR receptors is a key signaling event that induces
cytoskeletal changes and associated macrophage cell activation.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> However, the precise mode of action of TLR agonists (BC01, ODN 2395)
and antagonists (ODN 2088) and the structural requirement of these molecules
in stimulating TLR signaling and subsequently inducing pro-inflammatory
molecules remains unknown. Unraveling the mechanism of action of TLR
agonists/antagonists and comparing their nanoparticulate structures
associated with induction of large amounts of TNF-&#x003b1; is worth further

showed significant induction in the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B p65. This
observation is consistent with the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
such as TNF-&#x003b1; and MCP-1. These activities were inhibited significantly when
BC01 was co-incubated with JSH-23, which indicates the BC01 induced the
NF-&#x003ba;B p65 nuclear translocation, which in turn activated the NF-&#x003ba;B signal
pathway, and promoted pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.</p><p>In mammalian cells, the structure of NF-&#x003ba;B structure consists of five

motif-containing DNA fragments derived from the genome of BCG as described
in this study.</p><p>In addition to NF-&#x003ba;B, the MAPKs pathway is another signaling cascade that
regulates immune response to external stimuli. In mammalian cells, the MAPK
system comprises a family of protein-serine or threonine kinases. The p38,
SPAK/JNK, and Erk1/2 kinases link the extracellular signals from activated
receptors, located in the plasma membrane, to the nucleus. This signal
initiates various cellular responses such as cell proliferation and
differentiation, survival, death, and apoptosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr59-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="bibr60-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> Studies have shown

invasion/survival of these pathogens. Phosphorylation of molecules involved
in the MAPKs signaling pathway ultimately results in the expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our studies indicate that BC01 stimulation of
macrophages can activate SPAK/JNK and Erk1/2 that can induce TNF-&#x003b1; and MCP-1
expression <italic>via</italic> the TLR9 pathway. Further, specific
inhibitors in this pathway significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of
SPAK/JNK andErk1/2 kinases, and ultimately reduced the expression of TNF-&#x003b1;
and MCP-1 in the RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, the levels of phosphorylated
p38, SPAK/JNK, and Erk1/2 were increased in the RAW 264.7 cells following
the BC01 stimulation. Consistently, low, basal-level phosphorylation was
observed in the peritoneal macrophages of C57BL/6 mice that were pre-treated
with p38, SPAK/JNK, or Erk1/2 inhibitors. Moreover, the MAPK-mediated
pro-inflammatory cytokine induction was abolished in RAW 264.7 cells, when
TLR9 inhibitor was added along with BC01 in the culture, and the peritoneal
macrophages obtained from TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Taken together, our
findings suggested that BC01 stimulation is capable of activating several
innate immune signaling pathways in murine macrophages, by primarily
engaging TLR9, which culminates in the elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine
production.</p><p>Among various innate immune responses, macrophage-mediated phagocytosis is a
crucial process to remove pathogens<sup><xref rid="bibr65-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="bibr66-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> and cell debris.<sup><xref rid="bibr67-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> Therefore, the ability to enhance macrophage function has become an
important indicator to assess the performance of adjuvants that are capable
of stimulating innate immunity. In this study, we evaluated BC01 ability to
enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages, and our results indicated
that BC01 and ODN 2395 could significantly improve phagocytosis by
macrophages from 27.7% (untreated) to 52.3% (BC01) and 58.7% (ODN 2395).
However, when the macrophages were pre-treated with a TLR9 antagonist, their
phagocytic activity was significantly decreased. These results were also
consistent with similar experiments performed using primary cells, in which
we observed that BC01 enhanced the phagocytic activity of peritoneal
macrophages in a TLR9 pathway-dependent manner. Consistent with these
phagocytosis experiments, BC01 stimulation of macrophages increased the
expression of MHC-II and cell-surface co-stimulating molecules in a
TLR9-mediated manner. This phenomenon was also confirmed in experiments
performed with peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 and TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>
mice.</p><p>In our studies, the purpose of <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in mice was
to verify and extend our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings that BC01
treatment can activate a signaling pathway that induces pro-inflammatory
chemokines and cytokines in mice. In addition, we used TLR9 knockout mice to
show that the BC01-mediated immune changes on the host are associated with
TLR9.</p><p>In the pilot experiments, we have studied the expression levels of various
cytokines in mice at different time points after single-dose administration
of BC01 (Figure S4). Surprisingly, we found that a single dose was not
sufficient to stimulate the TLR9 knockout mice to mount an immune response.
In addition, a previous study has shown that BC01 treatment promotes the
proliferation of mouse T and B lymphocytes, enhances NK cell killing
activity, increases the content of CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and
CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen, and restores the immune
function of T and B lymphocytes in the immune-compromised animals.<sup><xref rid="bibr68-1753425919879997" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> Therefore, it appears that, in addition to acting as a vaccine
adjuvant, BC01 can also function as an immunomodulatory molecule. Based on
this knowledge, we performed a booster dose to test if we can improve the
immune response induced by BC01. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1753425919879997">Figure 13(b)</xref>, the cascade of
systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by booster stimulation with
BC01 was significantly lower in the TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared with the
wild type mice, which further proves that TLR9 function is essential for the
BC01-mediated activation of the host innate immune response. In addition,
evaluation of the composition of APCs in the lymph node of mice indicated
that BC01 stimulation significantly induces B lymphocyte and macrophage
proliferation in the wild type C57BL/6 mice compared with the
TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that BC01 is a potent TLR9 agonist,
induces innate immunity, and up-regulates the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines upon stimulation of macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> or
<italic>ex vivo</italic>, and in a mouse model of <italic>in
vivo</italic> stimulation. We also show that the innate immune
activation properties of BC01 involve NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPKs signaling pathways.
These observations provide a better understanding of the immunoregulatory
mechanisms of BC01 that is vital to accelerate the clinical utility of this
molecule to boost innate host immunity against invading pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="suppl1-1753425919879997"><caption><title>INI879997 Supplemental Material1 - Supplemental material for
