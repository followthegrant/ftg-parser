The therapeutic aim of SRP is the removal of plaque and calculus to minimize subgingival bacteria below a threshold level which is capable of inducing clinical inflammation. The prosperity of instrumentation is determined by the evaluation of the periodontal tissues after treatment and during the maintenance phase of the therapy.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Using topical antibacterial agents to reduce bacterial plaque may be advantageous for the prevention and treatment of gingivitis in some patients. A number of these agents in oral rinses and dentifrices have been examined in clinical trials.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Chlorhexidine (CHX) digluconate is considered to be one of the most frequently used compounds; since 1950, it has been used as a potent broad-spectrum antiseptic agent in medicine with a pronounced antimicrobial effect on both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as on fungi and some viruses. Moreover, the ability of CHX to inhibit the formation and development of bacterial plaque for several hours was demonstrated in 1970's because of its high affinity for oral surfaces.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In addition, CHX is a positively charged cationic bisbiguanide that can be adsorbed to a variety of negatively charged sites, including mucous membranes, salivary pellicle on teeth, as well as several components of the biofilm on the tooth surfaces, e.g., bacteria, extracellular polysaccharides, and glycoproteins.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that, in low concentrations, CHX causes destruction to the cell membrane and low molecular weight molecules escape from the microorganisms. On the other hand, a higher concentration of CHX causes precipitation and coagulation of the proteins in the cytoplasm of the exposed microbes. These properties interfere with biofilm formation and prevent its growth.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) has been used in dentistry in combination with salts or alone for more than 70 years.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Therapeutic delivery of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to prevent periodontal disease requires mechanical access to subgingival pockets. Furthermore, wound healing following gingival surgery is enhanced because of the antimicrobial effects of topically administered H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. For most subjects, beneficial effects have been seen with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels above 1%. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been shown to possess a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity because it is active against bacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, and spores.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Moreover, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is an oxidizer that has been employed in plaque control. Applications of oxygenating agents include the control of supragingival plaque and the treatment of acuteulcerative gingivitis with no side effects to the tissues.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In 1982, Wolff <italic>et al</italic>., studied the effect of 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on gingival inflammation and concluded its effectiveness in reducing pocket depth of more than 4 mm, however, it showed no effect on bleeding and other gingival indices.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Considering the side effects of CHX that include brown discoloration of the teeth, restorative materials and dorsum of tongue,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] as well as the role of anaerobic bacteria in periodontal diseases and the ecosystem in periodontal pockets that allows microbial growth, it was decided to evaluate the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a mouthwash in comparison with CHX in chronic periodontitis patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients' selection</title><p>Forty-five patients participated in this study.
