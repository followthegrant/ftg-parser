The data were explored in a number of innovative ways using a variety of networks types, pathway maps, enrichment statistics, reporter metabolites and a flux simulation model, revealing different aspects of the genome-scale response in an integrative systems biology manner. The importance of the subcellular localisation in the transcriptomic response is emphasised here, revealing new insights. As was previously reported by others using a rich medium, we show that peroxisomal fatty acid catabolism was dramatically up-regulated in a defined xylose mineral medium without fatty acids, along with mechanisms to activate fatty acids and transfer products of &#x003b2;-oxidation to the mitochondria. Notably, we observed a strong up-regulation of the 2-methylcitrate pathway, supporting capacity for odd-chain fatty acid catabolism. Next we asked which pathways would respond to the additional requirement for NADPH for xylose utilisation, and rationalised the unexpected results using simulations with Flux Balance Analysis. On a fundamental level, we investigated the contribution of the hierarchical and metabolic regulation levels to the regulation of metabolic fluxes. Metabolic regulation analysis suggested that genetic level regulation plays a major role in regulating metabolic fluxes in adaptation to xylose, even for the high capacity reactions, which is unexpected. In addition, isozyme switching may play an important role in re-routing of metabolic fluxes in subcellular compartments in <italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001321</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TTK20110831000026600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schabort</surname><given-names>Du Toit WP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (ZA), CSPG - Thuthuka (PhD Track) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nrf.ac.za/">http://www.nrf.ac.za/</ext-link>), Reference: TTK20110831000026600, UID: 80657, awarded to Mr. WPD Schabort.

These characteristics include thermotolerance and the ability to utilise a wide variety of sugars, including the pentose xylose, that are abundant in lignocellulosic biomass. Moreover, it is probably the fastest growing eukaryote on Earth [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Previous studies of this yeast highlighted the large physiological variation among <italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic> strains, in terms of their proneness to fermentation and ability to utilize various substrates, suggesting genetic diversity within the species [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Our strain UFS-Y2791 produces a significant amount of ethanol even under aerobic conditions, suggesting that this strain is not typically Crabtree negative. We recently assembled a draft genome of strain UFS-Y2791 from our University of the Free State MIRCEN yeast culture collection. The strain was originally isolated from juice prepared from the arid region succulent <italic>Agave americana</italic>. To enable metabolic engineering of <italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic> and other yeasts, it is important to understand genetic responses to environmental factors and different substrates. Such an understanding requires both advanced high-throughput omics methods as well as various integrative computational methods. Thus far, only two studies of genome-scale transcript levels in <italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic> have been published. Work on strain DMKU 3&#x02013;1042 suggested that the yeast up-regulated &#x003b2;-oxidation in the absence of glucose repression in a complex xylose medium due to the use of lipids as additional carbon source in the absence of glucose, implying possible utilization of the small amounts of lipids present in the rich medium [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A question that may also arise here is that in case lipids were indeed present in the rich medium, whether the response in the &#x003b2;-oxidation was due to glucose de-repression or due to stimulation by lipids. Another study focussed on the response of strain Y179 to anaerobic versus micro-aerobic conditions, as well as to the concentration of inulin in the medium. This study focussed on highlighting differential expression in various stress-response genes, those involved in autophagy, and a number of individual key enzymes. Both of these recent studies used a complex medium containing peptone and yeast extract [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become a popular method not only for sequencing genomes but also for various other experiments [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. RNA-seq is a method in which RNA transcripts are reverse-transcribed and quantitatively sequenced [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This method can accurately quantify differential expression and the improved sensitivity and dynamic range, as well as the ability to elucidate splice variants, makes it superior to microarray technology. The combination of genome sequencing and RNA-seq of a new species or strain is a powerful approach to rapidly gain both a blueprint (genome) and a response (transcriptome) to some perturbations [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] or when comparing different species [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Innovative methods are now needed to effectively use both the blueprint and the response in a concise manner that is attractive to scientists, since a massive amount of data is generated in a single experiment. It is a major challenge to investigate and represent omics results at the genome scale. Gene set enrichment using Gene Ontology (GO) is an established method for microarrays and is now becoming established for RNA-seq (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]).</p><p>Analysis of metabolic pathways could be a sensible additional approach as it gives a sense of directionality to the response, and the scientist often associates a certain endpoint metabolite with a pathway, providing a means to simplify the understanding of the dataset. Painted renderings could be made of individual pathways, but often the number of pathways excludes a concise representation, and the integrated nature of metabolism is lost. Further, in metabolic pathways the interactions (reactions) consist of hypergraphs containing more than one substrate or product, complicating the rendering. Cellular overviews, as is available with software such as Pathway Tools, summarises metabolism into a single image [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the cellular overview method usually assumes a single master framework and inevitably ignores selected highly connected nodes. Cellular compartmentalisation is also often neglected in omics analysis due to the added complexity.</p><p>An approach that is complementary to the pathway-based understanding of metabolism is that of the study of metabolite levels. Metabolomics, which entails the characterisation and quantification of small compounds in the cell, is still technologically demanding and labour intensive, however (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). A new approach in systems biology is to derive compounds that are likely differentially expressed or extensively homeostatically regulated, from a differential transcriptomics dataset. These are the reporter metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the method could be generalised and applied in many scenarios such as described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Models of biochemical pathways have much potential to reveal new insights that are not obvious from the exploration of datasets. The understanding of complex biochemical datasets using computational models is called systems biology. Some flux modelling approaches such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) simulations could be done even at the genome scale [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], as was recently reported for <italic>K</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A long-standing fundamental question is how the flux through a metabolic pathway is regulated. Is the change in a given flux achieved by changes in the concentrations of metabolites that affect that enzyme (metabolic level), or through changes in gene expression or post-translational modifications (hierarchical level)? By combining flux models with measured metabolite exchange fluxes, or through more complex <sup>13</sup>C-Metabolic Flux Analysis, estimation of fluxes at different physiological states can be very informative. Metabolic Regulation Analysis (MRA) combines differential expression levels with differential flux estimates to reveal for each flux the contribution of the metabolic and hierarchical levels of regulation [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Here we report on a detailed RNA-seq transcriptomics study to explore the response of <italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic> UFS-2791 to glucose and xylose in a chemically defined medium under aerobic conditions, including a number of different systemic analyses. Although a major potential future application of <italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic> may be ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass, which is an anaerobic or oxygen limited process where both glucose and xylose may be present, we chose to perform aerobic cultivations with glucose or xylose separately to remove any confounding effects. The strain also utilizes these sugars sequentially. The high cultivation temperature of 35&#x000b0;C was also chosen as this strain was determined to have a growth optimum close to 35&#x000b0;C. Our samples were also taken during mid-exponential phase to eliminate the effect of any possible ethanol stress that may occur later during the fermentation. To address the need for effective integrative exploration of omics data, including RNA-seq, and to combine these data with modelling and simulation, we developed the Reactomica software. We combined gene set enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO), reporter metabolites, metabolic pathway maps with a strong focus on subcellular compartmentalisation, and two new approaches of representation, namely pathway-to-pathway networks and reporter metabolite-enzyme networks.</p><p>The aims were to first effectively explore the key features of the differential response to xylose in a defined medium under aerobic conditions and determine whether the peroxisomal lipid catabolic response previously observed [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] was limited to a rich medium. Subsequently, the central carbon metabolism was investigated in detail, separating the response into subcellular compartments. It is known that in most yeasts that are able to utilize xylose, the two-step conversion via NADPH dependent xylose reductase and the NAD<sup>+</sup> dependent xylitol dehydrogenase is present and that the co-factor independent isomerase reaction is absent, as in <italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Under aerobic conditions, the additional NADH produced by xylitol dehydrogenase is easily oxidised by the electron transport chain. However, the yeast would require additional NADPH for xylose reductase. We investigated which of the key NADPH producing reactions would be up-regulated to support this proposed additional requirement for NADPH during xylose utilization. The somewhat unexpected results were rationalised by estimating fluxes in central metabolism for both conditions. Finally, MRA was used to answer the fundamental question of how changes in gene expression and in metabolite concentrations, respectively, contributed to the regulation of fluxes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Genome sequencing and annotation</title><p>The genome of <italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic> UFS-Y-2791 was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform to 100-fold coverage at the Onderstepoort Biotechnology Platform, Pretoria, South Africa. Assembly was performed <italic>de novo</italic> using Abyss. Open reading frames were found by Augustus. Putative protein sequences were annotated using one of two methods. For annotation of enzymes (778 genes), creation of a pathway genome database (PGDB) and all subsequent analysis involving metabolic pathways, protein sequences were annotated against the Kegg-Kaas server with default settings on the server, resulting in a list of EC number annotations. Output was subsequently parsed and converted to input for the PathoLogic algorithm of Pathway Tools. For gene set enrichment using Gene Ontology (GO), sequences were additionally annotated against the UniProtKB database on a high-performance computing cluster, using BLASTP. An E-value cut-off of 1E-10 was used for gene set enrichment as was done by others [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. An additional 73 genes with E-values between 1E-5 and 1E-10 were included in the list of annotated genes and flagged for further annotation.

Gene set enrichment scores for GO terms and pathways were calculated similar to that described by Ideker [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] as follows: GO ontologies goslim_yeast.obo and go-basic.obo.txt.m were obtained from the Gene Ontology database [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The ontologies were converted to graphs using the &#x02018;is_a&#x02019; child-parent mappings. For obtaining the gene set, a depth-first scan was performed from each GO term and all additional GO terms found from the node of interest were collected to ensure that highly specialised terms would find utility in GO_slim.

For MRA, gene expression changes were considered significant if at least one gene (among paralogs) was considered significant from q-values. Transcript fold changes were calculated from total transcript abundances for all genes mapping to a reaction, in case of isozymes resulting from paralogs or multi-functional proteins. In this manner, the method is robust to potential errors in annotation of paralogs since central metabolic genes are known to have on average higher transcript abundance in comparison with the vast majority of other genes. The fold changes of individual minor isozymes with very low expression levels also cannot dominate the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec013"><title>Results</title><p>In glucose medium, respiro-fermentative growth was observed, even though fully aerobic conditions were ensured by the small working volume in a large flask, vigorous shaking, and sampling at low OD<sub>600</sub> values, with ethanol, glycerol and acetate as fermentation products.

Secondly, a strong effect was seen on carbohydrate transporters, which was consistent with the experimental setting. Some of these differentially expressed putative sugar transporter genes, such as the various <italic>HGT1</italic> homologs of <italic>K</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>, were up-regulated as high as 1242-fold (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156242.s015">S4 Table</xref>). Some of these may encode for xylose transporters. As sugar transporters are highly similar, additional annotation of this group is required before more conclusions regarding sugar transport may be drawn. Thirdly, the extracellular region was affected. These are proteins that are secreted into the medium, such as lytic enzymes or receptors that sense a new environment, as well as the mating genes. Some of these gene sets are explored in more detail in the supplementary text <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156242.s017">S1 Text</xref>.</p><p>It is interesting to note that although many genes in the mitochondrion were differentially regulated, these genes are not the main enzymes of the TCA cycle, electron transport or oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, there is no response suggesting adaptation to a change in the internal energy charge. As the maximum specific growth rate in xylose medium was less than half of that in glucose medium, whereas the cell sizes were comparable, one might expect differential regulation of cell cycle progression genes, or even biomass formation-specific genes like those encoding for ribosomal proteins. There was a notable absence of such gene sets in the enrichment analysis. This is also reasonable since cell cycle control signalling proteins are mostly kinases, which are controlled by post-translational modifications. Most genetic responses observed in the data thus deal with utilisation of alternative substrates. Further, there was only a weak response in the oxidative stress genes, as was expected from aerobic cultivation. From the genes annotated with &#x02018;response to oxidative stress&#x02019; (PRDX5, CTT1, CCP1, YFH1, DCS1, HMX1, SVF1, YDR222W), only peroxiredoxin-5 (PRDX5, mitochondrion, cytoplasm, peroxisome, 3.9-fold up-regulated) and catalase T (CTT1, cytoplasm, 2.4-fold up-regulated) were moderately differentially regulated, resulting in an enrichment score of 1.19, which was insignificant against the background enrichment.</p><p>The data indicated several interesting aspects regarding sugar utilisation, including up-regulation of pathways for utilisation of galactose, xylose and arabinose (see S5). Several enzymes with &#x003b2;-glucosidase activity were found in the annotation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156242.s017">S1 Text</xref>), whereas only one enzyme was both extracellular and significantly up-regulated (48.8-fold), namely cellobiase (EC 3.2.1.21). Cellobiase is not a typical cellulase that can depolymerise cellulose, as it functions to hydrolyse the disaccharide cellobiose. <italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic> UFS-Y2791 also does not possess typical secreted xylanases, proteases, peptidases or lipases, which would allow a microorganism to thrive on plant matter or even attack a live plant. Instead, the strain possesses the inulinase gene <italic>INU1</italic> which hydrolyses the fructan inulin or the disaccharide sucrose. The <italic>INU1</italic> gene was dramatically up-regulated 91-fold and abundantly expressed in xylose medium.</p><p>The pheromone signalling system involved in sexual reproduction, as well as several other genes involved in the conjugation process as well as in invasive growth, were also up-regulated (see &#x02018;extracellular region&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156242.s013">S2 Table</xref>).

The up-regulation of the 2-methylcitrate pathway is, therefore, more likely for the catabolism of short-chain fatty acids and not threonine.</p><fig id="pone.0156242.g015" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0156242.g015</object-id><label>Fig 15</label><caption><title>2-Methylcitrate pathway.</title><p>The suggested route of three-carbon units is indicated in magenta.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0156242.g015"/></fig><table-wrap id="pone.0156242.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0156242.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Differential expression of the constituent genes mapped to the GO term &#x02018;propionate catabolic process&#x02019; (GO:0019543) on glucose and xylose, respectively.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0156242.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0156242.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Id</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Value (Glc)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Value (Xyl)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">log2(FC)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">qvalue</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">signt</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Entry</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein names</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene names</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GK5S-1542</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1512.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.001</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P43635</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Citrate synthase 3 (EC 2.3.3.16)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CIT3 YPR001W YP9723.01</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GK5S-1543</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">901.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.001</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Q12428</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Probable 2-methylcitrate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.79)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PDH1 YPR002W LPZ2W YP9723.02</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GK5S-2306</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">436.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.001</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Q12031</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mitochondrial 2-methylisocitrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.30)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ICL2 YPR006C LPZ6C YP9723.06C</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>Painted differential expression pathway maps were generated for all of 235 metabolic pathways found in the annotation.

From Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156242.g010">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156242.g011">11</xref> it is evident that in anaplerosis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase had very low transcript levels, while phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase was absent from the annotation. Only the pyruvate carboxylase showed substantial transcript levels and was constitutively expressed. Hence, only pyruvate carboxylase was used in the model for flux estimations. In glucose medium, respiro-fermentative metabolism was observed. The specific uptake rate of glucose (on a dry cell weight basis) was 9.4 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup> with acetate and ethanol produced at 2.0 and 2.7 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively with no glycerol formation. In xylose medium, acetate, ethanol and glycerol were absent and the specific xylose uptake rate was estimated at approximately 5 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup>. The ethanol flux calculated could be considered as a conservative estimate, since some evaporation of ethanol could be expected from the aerobic condition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156242.g016">Fig 16</xref> shows the differential flux outputs, as approximated by combining FBA with the consumption rates of sugars and production rates of ethanol and acetate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156242.s016">S5 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156242.s010">S3 Pathway</xref> for the FBA model, parameters and MRA outputs). The xylose utilisation pathways as well as the transaldolases and transketolase fluxes of the non-oxidative PPP were up-regulated, while the direction of the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase was changed towards the direction of glucose-6-phosphate. Notably, the difference in oxidative pentose phosphate pathway flux was only 5% between glucose and xylose utilisation modes and was thus considered constitutive, as was found in the transcript levels. The rest of central metabolic fluxes were down-regulated. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156242.s010">S3 Pathway</xref> for a more detailed log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) scheme). Although transcript levels do not generally correspond well to protein levels and hence to fluxes according to reports using model organisms [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the overall patterns of expression in central carbon metabolism in our RNA-seq analysis corresponded well with the predicted flux patterns.</p><fig id="pone.0156242.g016" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0156242.g016</object-id><label>Fig 16</label><caption><title>Differential flux analysis of central carbon metabolism.</title><p>Fluxes which differed by less than 10% between conditions were considered constitutive.

It is evident that the genetic level up-regulation of xylose reductase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, xylulose kinase, transaldolase and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase rendered the regulation as purely hierarchical. Of these, sorbitol dehydrogenase acting as a xylitol dehydrogenase would be the most extreme example, as it showed a 208-fold genetic up-regulation. These four reactions interact with neighbouring reactions via the metabolites xylulose-5-phosphate, erythrose-4-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate and ribose-5-phosphate to stimulate fluxes through the transketolases, and to reverse the flux through glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, whereas ribose-5-phsophate isomerase may lower the flux through ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase by lowering the concentration of ribulose-5-phosphate. Notably, regulation of fluxes in lower glycolysis is dominated by the genetic component, whereas upper glycolysis is regulated approximately equally by the metabolic and genetic regulation levels. Downward from pyruvate kinase, regulation is dominated by changes in metabolite levels, while some contribution of the genetic regulation level is evident for the fluxes through the aconitate hydratases in the TCA cycle. Due to the absence of measured ethanol and acetate in the xylose medium, the disappearance of fluxes through pyruvate decarboxylase, alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase rendered classification of regulation in these reactions as purely metabolic.</p><fig id="pone.0156242.g017" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0156242.g017</object-id><label>Fig 17</label><caption><title>Metabolic Regulation Analysis of central carbon metabolism.</title><p>For reaction names, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0156242.s010">S3 Pathway</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0156242.g017"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Discussion</title><p>Modelling of bioprocesses has been attempted for a long time, in many different forms. It was realised in the second half of the twentieth century that several confounding factors had to be eliminated in the study of metabolism and its gene regulation, arguably with the growth rate as the most important confounding factor, since the expression level of many genes are correlated with the growth rate. Chemostat cultivation is a useful tool, since the growth rate can be easily controlled. However, for the vast majority of industrial applications, chemostats are unrealistic as industrial applications typically involve batch cultivation, or fed-batch cultivation to avoid catabolite repression, improve volumetric productivity and allow sufficient aeration by controlling the growth rate. Moreover, systems biology has become increasingly data-driven with the availability of high-throughput methods to measure large numbers of intracellular metabolites (metabolomics), proteins (proteomics) and especially RNAs (RNA-seq and microarray) from a single experiment. It is proposed here that much more could be learned in terms of genetic regulation in microorganisms by testing a variety of different cultivation conditions, especially substrates, in small batch experiments as compared to the same amount of work in a more sophisticated, labour intensive chemostat setup, or at least, complementary information. We showed that in a simple and cost-effective batch setup, a large amount of rich RNA-seq data could be generated and fruitfully explored. This small working volume also makes expensive isotope labelling studies feasible. In batch experiments, however, special care needs to be taken in terms of the timing of sampling, as, for instance, fermentation products would accumulate over time and a transcriptome sample late in the fermentation may be more reflective of chemical stress than of the metabolic mode. This may especially be a confounding factor when comparing the effects of the concentration of substrate. Our experimental design alleviated this effect and allowed us to focus on the effects of alternative substrates only.</p><p>Previously, exploration of omics datasets mostly focused on only the lists of the most significantly up-regulated or down-regulated genes separately, or on one or two more advanced types of analyses such as GO enrichment, and occasionally on the extraction of active networks. Here we presented one of the first examples that explore high-quality RNA-seq data from various perspectives, using different types of enrichments and networks, and rationalisation of the response with FBA and MRA as theoretical frameworks. Furthermore, combining information from databases such as GO and MetaCyc in the same problem and with subcellular compartmentalisation revealed several important features that would have been missed using either on its own.</p><p>The vastness of the xylose response under aerobic conditions indicates a different, opportunistic lifestyle that this yeast apparently adapts to when cultivated on xylose, which may be reminiscent of its natural environment where a variety of plant-derived substrates may be utilised. Down-regulation of many biosynthetic pathways is concordant with a lower growth rate, although there is a notable absence of growth rate specific gene sets in the enrichment statistics. Although many mitochondrial genes were differentially expressed, these are not the major enzymes in energy production in mitochondria. Oxidative stress also seems minimal in the aerobic xylose medium. Instead, a strong response is seen in the up-regulation of alternative sugar utilisation machinery, including inulinase, sugar transporters and catabolic routes for alternative sugars. Inulin is a fructan stored in large amounts in some plants, including <italic>A</italic>. <italic>americana</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our strain was indeed isolated from an <italic>A</italic>. <italic>americana</italic> sample.</p><p><italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic> lacks enzymes such as secreted proteases, lipases and carbohydrate hydrolases. This yeast may thus be dependent on other fungi in the environment for these functions, or its natural habitat may be some commensal niche where these monomers are supplied by the plant. The transcriptional regulatory basis for this response is likely to be glucose repression by transcription factors such as <italic>MIG1</italic> binding to carbon source response elements, as was suggested to be the case for the inulinase gene <italic>KmINU1</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156242.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>It is interesting to find that the majority of genes for a complete organelle like the peroxisome, which is dedicated to lipid oxidation, was dramatically up-regulated in the xylose medium, yet without apparent function in the experimental setting. Thus, glucose de-repression is likely sufficient to activate most of the response to enable lipid catabolism, and stimulation by lipids may play a smaller role. The mitochondrial 2-methylcitrate pathway for the degradation of three-carbon molecules was also strongly up-regulated, suggesting that a variety of odd-chain fatty acids originating from peroxisomes may be oxidised.</p><p>FBA simulations predicted no significant up-regulation of the oxidative PPP flux, but a more intense up-regulation of the non-oxidative PPP flux and a down-regulation of glycolysis, which were consistent with RNA-seq data. Since biomass formation, the major sink for NADPH, is down-regulated in xylose medium, and another NADPH sink, xylose reductase, is up-regulated, it thus makes sense that the major source flux of NADPH (oxidative PPP) may be similar in both conditions (considering absolute fluxes normalised by the biomass concentration). Normalising fluxes to the uptake rate of a carbon source or to the biomass formation rate could thus be misleading when interpreting expression data. FBA simulations here thus shed light on what could be expected in terms of gene regulation.</p><p>MRA was used to separate metabolic regulation into hierarchical and metabolic levels. Reactions in lower glycolysis are known to a have high flux capacity due to high enzyme concentrations, and our transcript data also indicated this feature on glucose. Chemostat studies of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> classified these high-capacity reactions as well as the non-oxidative PPP reactions as pseudo-equilibrium or near-equilibrium reactions, suggesting that they can be sufficiently described by simple equations making use of thermodynamics and empirical studies at various dilution rates [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; hence both detailed enzyme kinetic expressions and genetic regulation could be ignored. Reversible high capacity reactions like these should have low metabolic control coefficients over the flux and are not likely to be regulated at the genetic level&#x02014;at least over small changes in the flux, close to a reference steady state. However, our transcript level data for <italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic> showed that the transcript levels in lower glycolysis were substantially lower on xylose, and MRA showed a dominating hierarchical (genetic) level regulation. Flux through transaldolase was also dominated by hierarchical regulation. The contribution of hierarchical and metabolic level regulation of a reaction would differ between substrates utilised, and may also differ between species.</p><p>Reporter metabolite networking suggested that NAD(H), acetaldehyde, ethanol, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate and hydrogen peroxide formed a strongly interconnected redox active system, with aldehyde dehydrogenases and alcohol dehydrogenases being the main players. This system may work across membranes, since acetaldehyde, ethanol and hydrogen peroxide can cross membranes, shuttles connect NAD(H) across compartments, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate are closely connected to NADH. At this stage it is not possible to resolve the fluxes and MRA through the acetaldehyde-dependent pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass. It was, however, evident that dramatic changes occurred in the transcript levels of the alcohol dehydrogenases and aldehyde dehydrogenases, including compartment-specific isozyme switching. As also suggested by Lertwattanasakul et al. [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], ethanol may be catabolised in the mitochondria as fast as it is produced. However, it has to be emphasised that care needs to be taken in extrapolating gene expression data between studies carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Oxygen limitation results in differential expression of many genes in yeasts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We believe to have captured in a unique manner, and from a number of perspectives, a complex transcriptional pattern telling an interesting story about how the cell &#x02018;explores its options&#x02019; when the nutrient availability changes under aerobic conditions. Strong up-regulation of transporters and pathways for utilisation of alternative carbohydrates was evident. In addition, the more opportunistic lifestyle was supported by invasive growth, and sexual reproduction was activated as a long-term survival strategy. The strong peroxisomal fatty acid catabolic response accompanied by the mitochondrial 2-methylcitrate pathway is likely explained by glucose de-repression, similar to that seen for carbohydrate utilisation. As <italic>K</italic>. <italic>marxianus</italic> seemingly lacks the secreted enzymes required for depolymerisation of biopolymers, the species is probably dependent on other species for supply of monomers such as sugars, amino acids and free fatty acids, whereas inulinase is a specialist feature enabling this species to utilise this plant storage oligosaccharide. It would be interesting to see whether xylose may have a stimulatory role as suggested recently for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0156242.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and through which signaling pathways this may take place.</p><p>MRA was demonstrated here as an informative method to dissect the regulation of fluxes into the metabolic and hierarchical levels. It is evident that the genetic level plays a dominating role in the regulation of fluxes in central carbon metabolism, not only in the early enabling steps of utilisation of xylose as the carbon source, but also in the high capacity reactions of lower glycolysis. In kinetic modelling of metabolism, emphasis should thus be placed on genetic regulation, which is currently very challenging. Multiple omics would need to be combined to predict such regulatory networks and build realistic models. However, in order to resolve fluxes originating from pyruvate, isotopic tracer studies would be required, which currently is under investigation. In addition, the isozyme switching observed with alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and acetate-CoA ligase calls for a detailed investigation into the compartmentalisation and kinetics of these enzymes, and detailed bottom-up kinetic modelling to understand the role of this interesting behaviour.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting
