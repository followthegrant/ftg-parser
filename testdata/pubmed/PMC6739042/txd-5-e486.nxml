With the advent of direct acting antivirals (DAA) for the eradication of Hepatitis C, the heart transplant donor pool has been expanded to include donors with untreated Hepatitis C.

The data from 62 patients were extracted from these publications. Fifty-six (90%) patients had donor-derived hepatitis C and 6 (10%) patients were chronically infected with hepatitis C before transplantation. All living transplanted patients achieved SVR-12, defined as hepatitis C virus RNA below the limit of detection 12 weeks after treatment completion. Treatment duration ranged from 4 to 24 weeks. Clinically relevant modification to the dosing of immunosuppressive mediations during DAA therapy was documented in only 1 patient (1.6%).

It is also an opportunity for marginal recipients to significantly shorten the waiting list times by accepting a heart from a hepatitis C&#x02013;positive donor. In 1 center, the mean waitlist time was 329 days for those receiving an HCV negative graft and 78 days in those accepting a Hepatitis C&#x02013;positive graft.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In another cohort, the waitlist time for Hepatitis C&#x02013;positive grafts was as little as 4 days.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, some questions remain unanswered that need to be addressed before heart transplantation from HCV-positive donors becomes the standard of care.</p><p>The objective of our review was to analyze the currently published literature to address the following questions: what is the efficacy of DAA in the setting of heart transplantation?

In 1 patient, the DAA was ceased secondary to medication-induced hepatitis. This patient was concomitantly on a DAA, a herbal supplement and azole therapy for an opportunistic infection. We cannot exclude the role of the DAA in this scenario; however, both herbal supplements and azole therapy can provoke a clinical picture of hepatitis. The cessation of the DAA resulted in an ongoing DDHC and this patient needed to be treated with 3 different DAA regimes over a prolonged period to be cured of the infection.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>TABLE 6.</label><caption><p>Complications during HCV therapy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="txd-5-e486-g007"/></table-wrap><p>One study reported an interaction between ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and everolimus that required a dose reduction of the everolimus.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Another study reported an interaction between daclatasvir/sofosbuvir(DCV/SOF) and both mycophenolate and tacrolimus resulting in a slightly decreased level of tacrolimus and an increased level of mycophenolate without requiring any dose adjustments.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p>There were no documented cases of an interaction between DAA and the induction regime in our series.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>What Is the Efficacy of DAA in the Setting of Transplantation?</title><p>In the setting of transplantation, DAA therapy appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of HCV. Despite the heterogeneity of the studies, there was no reported HCV relapse following complete DAA therapy. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that continued monitoring of viral loads posttreatment was reported in most series. In the THINKER trial that reported on kidney transplants from HCV-viremic donors to HCV-negative recipients, 1 patient had increased HCV viral loads on follow-up measurements during therapy because of DAA resistance and required a change in his DAA therapy.</p><p>Due to geographic variations in the prevalence of HCV genotypes, differences exist in national guidelines on the use of DAA for HCV. American guidelines recommend the use of a genotype-guided therapy,<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> whereas in Australia a pan-genotypic combination is recommended as first-line treatment.<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Despite the differences in choice of DAA combinations, timing of initiation and duration of DAA therapy between studies, all studies reported 100% cure rate. None of the studies identified in this review reported prophylactic administration of DAA (commencing pretransplant) and only 1 study reported the use of a preemptive protocol in the first week posttransplant. Most studies documented HCV infection of the recipient (by NAT testing) before commencement of DAA therapy. This likely reflects the high cost of DAA therapy and the reimbursement arrangements that exist in countries where there is a requirement to prove HCV infection before commencing DAA therapy.</p><p>In the case of transplantation the use of a pan-genotypic is probably the optimal approach for prophylactic and preemptive treatment because of the expected delay in obtaining the genotype of the donor. It is worth noting that a pan-genotypic treatment is being utilized in 2 ongoing studies of DAA after transplantation as well as the most recent publication on the topic.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>What Interactions Between Immunosuppression, Induction Regime and DAA Have Been Observed?</title><p>The data regarding pharmacokinetic interactions between DAA and immunosuppression are also reassuring. Initiation of the DAA resulted in a significant change to biochemical drug levels in only 2 of 62 patients (3%); however, neither of these patients developed rejection. In an abstract addressing this question, no adjustment of immunosuppression was needed after DAA therapy was started.<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> A recently published review on immunosuppression levels in patients undergoing DAA therapy confirmed this probable lack of interaction. No change in the drug levels were observed retrospectively when DAA were started.<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p><p>Moreover, if DAA therapy is administered early after transplantation, the risk of persistent sub- or supra-therapeutic levels of immunosuppression drugs is greatly reduced as immunosuppressive drug levels are routinely checked and titrated at regular intervals during this time period.</p><p>In this series, most of the patients (16 patients, 47%) received basiliximab as induction and no interaction between induction and DAA were reported, but it is worth mentioning that most of the patients (n = 33, 66%) did not receive DAA during the first week after transplantation. With the half-life of 30 days for Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and 7 days for basiliximab, the absence of interaction between DAA and induction regime must be reviewed with some caution.</p></sec><sec><title>Does DAA Therapy Increase the Risk of Acute Rejection?</title><p>The risk of rejection due to the HCV viral load or treatment with DAA cannot be formally determined from published studies due to the heterogeneity of the data. However, 6 (14%) patients suffered from acute cellular or antibody-mediated rejection over the course of the DAA therapy. The rate of acute rejections in these studies is comparable with the available data on rejection in the absence of HCV or DAA.<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p><p>In a cohort of 25 patients, there was no significant difference in the observed rate of rejection (ISHLT grad &#x0003e;1R) between patients with DDHC and a control group. No correlation between viral load and rejection could be found.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The long-term risk of chronic rejection is for the moment mostly unknown. One group has shown that patients who are viremic before initiation of DAA treatment have more marked intimal thickening shown on intravascular ultrasound of the left anterior descending coronary artery.<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>What Is the Optimal Timing of the Initiation and Duration of DAA Therapy?</title><p>The optimal timing of initiation of DAA and the duration of the therapy in the setting of transplantation of a noninfected patient with a HCV-infected heart is still not established.</p><p>In the patients reported in this review, most commenced treatment at first documentation of viremia. Seven patients (14%) received preemptive therapy (first day after transplantation) and none received prophylactic treatment as has been described in a recently published kidney transplant protocol<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and ongoing heart transplant study.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> As seen in the current review, the success of DAA therapy does not seem to be affected by the timing of initiation. Nevertheless, the long-term consequences of the initial viremic period are unknown, particularly the risk of hepatitis C-induced coronary arteriosclerosis,<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> and the possibility of accidental transmission to medical staff should also be considered. In the context of immunosuppression, initial viremia may be extremely high and this could have negative consequences. Some data suggest a deleterious effect of the viremic load on the incidence of ISHLT-1R mild rejection (but not moderate and severe rejection)<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and there are 2 case reports of possible DDHC-associated pancreatitis in patient with high viral load before commencing DAA therapy.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>As demonstrated with kidney transplantation in the same setting, a prophylactic dose or a preemptive dose (given few h after transplant) could diminish or even completely suppress viral load.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Regarding duration of therapy, international guidelines on DAA for HCV treatment recommend a duration of 8&#x02013;12 weeks depending on the DAA regimen.<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> The most recently published study on heart (and lung) transplantation from HCV-infected donors utilized a 4-week protocol of preemptive therapy with a pan-genotype combination commencing within hours of transplantation.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Interestingly, nearly all recipients had detectable hepatitis C viremia immediately posttransplant but all patients achieved sustained viral clearance with no late relapses. While this study suggests that preemptive initiation of treatment may allow a shorter course of DAA to be administered, only 8 heart transplants were included in the study. A confirmatory study in a larger cohort of patients would be desirable before routinely advocating this regimen.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Given the observational nature of all the studies included in this review, there is a possible publication bias in favor of studies with positive outcomes. Nonetheless, the highly consistent conclusions of all published studies in relation to the efficacy of DAA and favorable clinical outcomes of heart transplant recipients with DDHC provides compelling evidence to support the use of NAT-positive hepatitis C donors for heart transplantation. Our review did not address the safety of heart transplantation from NAT-negative hepatitis C&#x02013;seropositive donors; however, published data show that the risk of transmission of hepatitis C from these donors is very low.<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</title><p>Based on this systematic review, we make the following conclusions and propose the following recommendations regarding protocols for heart transplantation from HCV viremic donors to HCV-negative recipients:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>-</label><p>While all DAA regimens achieve excellent cure rates for HCV infection, in view of the high rate of acute kidney injury in the first weeks after heart transplantation, we recommend the use of a pan-genotypic drug combination that is eliminated by the liver.</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>Despite different timings of initiation of DAA therapy across the included studies, there were no differences in sustained viral clearance.

We recommend that all patients undergo serial NAT testing during the first weeks of treatment until their HCV RNA is below the limit of detection to either confirm viral clearance or detect treatment failure. Twelve weeks after cessation of the treatment, regardless of the duration of therapy, a last NAT should be performed to confirm SVR-12.</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>No preemptive changes in induction and maintenance immunosuppression are needed. Interactions between DAA and immunosuppression do exist but appear rare. Data on the interaction between induction and DAA are scarce, but the literature on the use of Basiliximab with DAA suggests it is safe to use. When DAA is initiated during the early phase after transplantation, immunosuppressive drug levels are routinely measured until a stable dose of immunosuppression is found. In this context, the risk of dangerously low or high levels of immunosuppression is minimal. However, when DAA therapy is completed, immunosuppressive medication levels should be monitored in case of changes related to cessation of the therapy.</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>For recipients of NAT-negative hepatitis C-seropositive (ie, antibody positive) donors, a &#x0201c;watchful waiting&#x0201d; protocol with serial NAT testing up to 3 months posttransplant is recommended.</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>Because the risk of coronary intimal thickening is known for patient with chronic hepatitis C and because some data suggest that patient with DDHC and initial viral load have some intimal thickening on intravascular ultrasound at 1 years, a careful assessment of vasculopathy in this population is suggested.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Published online 23 August, 2019.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>B.S. participated in research design, the performance of the research, and the writing of the article.
