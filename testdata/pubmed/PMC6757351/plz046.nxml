<italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> cultivars include important vegetable and forage crops grown worldwide, whereas the wild counterpart occurs naturally on European sea cliffs. Domestication and selection processes have led to phenotypic and genetic divergence between domesticated plants and their wild ancestors that inhabit coastal areas and are exposed to saline conditions. Salinity is one of the most limiting factors for crop production. However, little is known about how salinity affects plants in relation to domestication of <italic>B. oleracea</italic>. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of domestication status (wild, landrace or cultivar) on the response of different <italic>B. oleracea</italic> crops to salinity, as measured by seed germination, plant growth, water content and mineral concentration parameters at the seedling stage. For this purpose, two independent pot experiments were conducted with six accessions of <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, including cabbage (group <italic>capitata</italic>) and kale (group <italic>acephala</italic>), in a growth chamber under controlled environmental conditions. In both taxonomic groups, differences in domestication status and salt stress significantly affected all major process such as germination, changes in dry matter, water relations and mineral uptake. In the <italic>acephala</italic> experiment, the domestication &#x000d7; salinity interaction significantly affected water content parameters and shoot Na<sup>+</sup> allocation. At early stages of development, wild plants are more succulent than cultivated plants and have a higher capacity to maintain lower Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations in their shoots in response to increasing levels of salinity. Different responses of domesticated and cultivated accessions in relation to these traits indicated a high level of natural variation in wild <italic>B. oleracea</italic>. Exclusion of Na<sup>+</sup> from shoots and increasing succulence may enhance salt tolerance in <italic>B. oleracea</italic> exposed to extreme salinity in the long term. The wild germplasm can potentially be used to improve the salt tolerance of crops by the identification of useful genes and incorporation of these into salinity-sensitive cultivars.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>

Also of concern is the fact that many areas are increasingly affected by salinization, mainly in intensively cropped and densely populated areas of the world. According to the <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">FAO (2017)</xref>, ~800 million hectares of land are currently affected by salinization, and as a result 0.25&#x02013;0.50 million hectares of agricultural land are lost every year. The main constraint to production is that very few crops are salt-tolerant, and cultivars of particular crop species vary greatly in relation to this trait (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Greenway and Munns 1980</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Ashraf and Sarwar 2002</xref>).</p><p>Crop plants are generally glycophytic (i.e. sensitive to high salinity), although cabbage (<italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> var. <italic>capitata</italic>) is considered moderately sensitive to salinity (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein <italic>et al.</italic> 1974</xref>). Kale (<italic>B. oleracea</italic> var. <italic>acephala</italic>) reaches acceptable growth rates and can tolerate saline irrigation during early stages of growth, and is therefore a potential candidate for use in drainage water reuse systems (<xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Shannon <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). Wild <italic>B. oleracea</italic> grows in saline environments, inhabiting sea cliffs, where it cannot evade the effects of salt. The species is therefore expected to have developed at least some degree of salt resistance, using different mechanisms to avoid (salt regulation by exclusion, elimination, dilution and/or compartmentalization) or tolerate the effects produced by the increased concentrations of ions. Significant morphological and physiological differences between domesticated and wild accessions have been found in maize (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Chinchilla-Ramirez <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) and also in <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, among other crop species, under artificially imposed stress (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Matesanz and Milla 2018</xref>).</p><p>Genetic diversity in relation to salt tolerance and other traits originally present in wild <italic>B. oleracea</italic> has been reduced in modern cultivars due to human-mediated selection, which has caused several genetic bottlenecks. However, it can be assumed that some classes of alleles, in many cases with minor effects, may have been missed during domestication and/or crop improvement and remain unexploited in modern cultivars (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Prada 2009</xref>). It is therefore important to explore how salt tolerance has changed between ancestors (wild forms) and current domesticate genotypes (landraces and modern cultivars). The main difference between landraces (local varieties) and cultivars is that landraces are grown in agricultural ecosystems, whereas cultivars arise as the result of formal breeding programmes. Most modern cultivars descend from a relatively small number of founder landraces (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Prada 2009</xref>). Consequently, the genes controlling agronomic characters in current cultivars retain low levels of diversity relative to the entire gene pool (landraces and wild forms) from which they arise. For this reason, domestication status may be a determining factor in salt tolerance.</p><p>Cultivated <italic>B. oleracea</italic> includes important vegetable and forage crops grown throughout the world, representing, together with cereals, the basis of world supplies (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Cartea <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Farmers have selected different forms of domesticated <italic>B. oleracea</italic> to produce crops with distinct uses and characteristics: broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower and kale, among others. The diversification of <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, caused by selection processes, has led to differentiation of several botanical varieties or groups, such as <italic>italica</italic>, <italic>gemmifera</italic>, <italic>capitata</italic>, <italic>botrytis</italic> and <italic>acephala</italic>, corresponding, respectively, to the above-mentioned crops (Branca and <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Cartea 2011</xref>). Different <italic>B. oleracea</italic> crops have been demonstrated to display high phenotypic and genetic diversity (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Cartea <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Padilla <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Branca 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Vilar <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>), probably in relation to regional preferences, resulting in numerous choices of edible forms. Despite the relatively high variability in <italic>B. oleracea</italic> crops, the genetic variation could be further increased to maintain and extend the cultivation of <italic>Brassica</italic> species in suboptimal land affected by salt stress. According to <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Arzani and Ashraf (2016)</xref>, the <italic>in situ</italic> genetic resources that have enabled the plants to adapt to survive and grow in saline habitats are crucial to increase the genetic variability in relation to salinity tolerance in crops. Investigation of whether such variation is found in wild <italic>Brassica</italic> and exploration of the underlying mechanisms of salinity tolerance are decisive for advancement in breeding programmes and increased production in saline environments.</p><p>Domesticated (commercial or elite cultivars, germplasm and landraces) and wild forms could be crossed to broaden the genetic base and improve the salt tolerance of <italic>B. oleracea</italic> crops. Breeders should be aware of the high cost of recovering the genetic background of the receptor elite cultivar when wild species are used to enhance salt tolerance (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Cuartero <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, recovering the background of the elite cultivar from crosses between kale and wild <italic>B. oleracea</italic> may be feasible, taking in account that kale may represent an &#x02018;evolutionary bridge&#x02019; for the other taxonomical groups included in <italic>B. oleracea</italic> (Branca and <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Cartea 2011</xref>).</p><p>For most crop species, several evaluation and selection programmes have led to the establishment of germplasm collections. Conventional breeding programmes and other more innovative approaches, such as the use of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection, interspecific hybridization, marker-assisted selection, transformation, mutation and polyploidy, have been used to enhance salt tolerance in different crops (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Flowers <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Flowers 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Cuartero <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). However, salt-tolerant cultivars remain scarce, probably due to the quantitative nature of this trait, in which numerous genes have small effects. Several authors have demonstrated the existence of variations in salt tolerance among species belonging to the genus <italic>Brassica</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Ashraf <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Ashraf and McNeilly 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>) and also within some <italic>Brassica</italic> species (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Maggio <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Ali <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) and crops (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Sanoubar <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). For crop improvement, evaluation of salt sensitivity in all growing phases has been recommended to identify and prioritize efforts on the most salt-sensitive developmental stage (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Cuartero <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). The early stage of growth has been recognized as the most vulnerable life stage in plants, as weak seedlings do not reach the reproductive stage under stressful conditions (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Chinchilla-Ramirez <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). The initial growth stage will be crucial for stress tolerance, as selective pressures will act on the most relevant seedling traits to overcome the restrictive conditions. Plants that are resistant/tolerant to abiotic stress at initial growth stages will probably show enhanced resistance at later developmental stages.</p><p>Research findings in diverse fields suggest that salt tolerance has changed during domestication and selection processes; however, no studies comparing <italic>Brassica</italic> genotypes with contrasting domestication status have been carried out. We aimed to determine whether traits leading to salt tolerance in wild <italic>B. oleracea</italic> that survives on sea cliffs have been lost during domestication and/or improvement processes. Although the effects of soil salinity on the performance of <italic>Brassica</italic> species is well known and widely documented (see above-mentioned references), studies involving accessions belonging to different botanical varieties or groups are scarce. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of domestication status (wild, landrace or cultivar) on the response of <italic>B. oleracea</italic>, including the taxonomic varieties <italic>acephala</italic> (kale) and <italic>capitata</italic> (cabbage), to increasing levels of salinity, as measured by germination, plant growth and allocation traits, and water content and mineral concentration parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>For this research, two independent experiments were carried out with the <italic>capitata</italic> (cabbage) and <italic>acephala</italic> (kale) groups of <italic>B. oleracea</italic>.

Plants belonging to both groups (<italic>acephala</italic> and <italic>capitata</italic>) were exposed to salt treatments for 3 months. Three times a week, the pots were placed in a tray filled with water with the respective amount of salt, and the soil was allowed to reach 100 % water holding capacity by being soaked for 4 h in the saline solution. The pots were then returned to the culture shelves in the growth chamber.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Germination</title><p>Three replications of 20 seeds per accession were germinated in Petri dishes on filter paper soaked with sodium chloride solution (50, 100 and 150 mM NaCl) or non-saline water (control&#x02014;0 mM NaCl).

The roots were then carefully washed with flowing tap water to remove the soil. The plants were separated into roots and shoots (leaves and stems), and the fresh weight was measured with a digital balance (Mettler Toledo mod. ML203/01, 220 &#x000b1; 0.001 g, Columbus, OH, USA). The plant parts were then oven-dried separately at 40 &#x000b0;C for at least 7 days to constant weight, and the root and shoot dry weights were measured. The values of root mass ratio (RMR = root mass/plant mass), shoot mass ratio (SMR = shoot mass/plant mass) and total water content [TWC = (leaf fresh mass &#x02212; leaf dry mass)/leaf fresh mass] were calculated. Salinity response models were constructed and salt-tolerance index (ST-index) was calculated for each accession, according to <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Steppuhn <italic>et al.</italic> (2005a, b</xref>). For this purpose, relative yield (Y<sub>r</sub>) was calculated by dividing the absolute yield (Y, total plant dry mass) by dry mass under control conditions (0 mM NaCl), when salinity has no influence on mass production (Y<sub>m</sub>).

The ST-index, proposed by <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Steppuhn <italic>et al.</italic> (2005a)</xref> as an indicator of the inherent tolerance of agricultural crops to salt stress, was calculated as ST-index = EC<sub>e50</sub> (1 + b), where EC<sub>e50</sub> is the electrical conductivity of the root zone that reduces the relative yield to 50 % of the absolute yield (EC<sub>e</sub> at Y<sub>r</sub> = 0.5) and &#x02018;b&#x02019; is a regression constant. EC<sub>e</sub> was derived from the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water solutions (EC<sub>i</sub>) by the relationship EC<sub>e</sub> = 0.5 EC<sub>i</sub>.</p><p>Before the plants were harvested, two leaf discs of 1.8 cm diameter were punched from the uppermost fully expanded leaf on each plant and were immediately weighed to determine the fresh mass.

Once the fully turgid leaf discs were weighed, they were oven-dried and again weighed to determine the dry mass.

However, differences in the relative yield between cultivars and landraces within domestication groups were marked, although expected, as accessions from two different taxonomical groups were compared. In addition, the effects of domestication (transition from wild plants to landraces) and modern breeding (transition from landraces to cultivars) were variable and depended on the trait considered. Domestication has evidently mediated the seed germination and leaf succulence and shoot Na<sup>+</sup> of seedlings, while modern breeding, along with domestication, may also have influenced the RWC and SLA.</p><p>Although we could not reveal how domestication has led to the loss of salt tolerance of an elite cultivar because the phylogenetic relationships among the wild types, landraces and elite cultivars used in this study are unknown, we provide strong evidences that wild types have potential as sources of salt tolerance.</p><sec id="s15"><title>Germination</title><p>We found that increasing salinity significantly affected the time to emergence as well as the final germination percentage. However, the extent of the response varied between domesticated and wild accessions in relation to percentage (in both groups) and time to germination (only in the <italic>acephala</italic> group). The slight reduction in germination for landraces and cultivars contrasted with the abrupt decrease in final germination in wild accessions. Seed mortality at salinity below 150 mM NaCl was not confirmed; however, the pronounced decrease and/or suppression of seed germination at higher salinity levels in wild accessions probably corresponds to an adaptive mechanism described in species surviving in littoral habitats and which is decisive in the ability of such species to colonize saline environments (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa and Kachi 2000</xref>). In a comparison of wild species from contrasting coastal habitats, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Mariko <italic>et al.</italic> (1992)</xref> found that even under favourable conditions sea cliff species germinate slowly. This probably guarantees germination at the &#x02018;safe site&#x02019; and the subsequent establishment of seedlings in these environments. Salt-adapted Brassicaceae species also show high sensitivity to NaCl during germination (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Orsini <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). Delayed and decreased germination in wild accessions is not associated with salt tolerance at advanced growing stages, as reported for other crops (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Foolad <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Flowers 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Cuartero <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the salt tolerance during seed germination shown by the domesticated accessions, in terms of higher germination percentage and lower time to germination, may be related to human-mediated selection processes (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Fuller 2007</xref>). While domestication and selection processes lead to high germination percentage and rapid germination in cultivated genotypes, wild genotypes have evolved adaptations to saline environments, such as increased succulence of leaves. During domestication, wild <italic>B. oleracea</italic> plants were removed from hostile saline habitats, where non-saline water supplies were limited and occasional, to benign farming environments with less restrictive conditions regarding the availability of fresh water. Under the latter conditions, plants were artificially selected for early emergence and high rates of germination over several generations, leading to changes in seed characteristics that resulted in seeds showing loss of dormancy (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Fuller and Allaby 2009</xref>) (i.e. with a more permeable and thinner seed coat that enables rapid germination even under saline conditions, at least at concentrations reaching 150 mM NaCl). This trait may be undesirable in hostile conditions (i.e. sea cliffs inhabited by the wild type) because it increases the vulnerability of plants to further adverse conditions, but is intentionally selected in plants growing in agricultural environments (i.e. landraces and cultivars grown as crops) (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Fuller and Allaby 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Plant growth and allocation traits</title><p>The study findings did not indicate any clear relationship between salinity tolerance and domestication status of the accessions. Contrary to our expectations, the value of the ST-index was lower in the wild-<italic>capitata</italic> accession than in the wild-<italic>acephala</italic> and similar to those of the domesticated gene pool. This finding may be explained by hybridization between cultivated and wild accessions, which is possible as there are some domestic gardens close to sea cliffs in this area. Branca and <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Cartea (2011)</xref> reported evidence of crosses between wild populations of several <italic>Brassica</italic> species growing near villages and <italic>B. oleracea</italic> landraces in Sicily. In the present study, the wild and cultivated accessions belong to the same species, and cross-pollination may be frequent. The wild-<italic>capitata</italic> could survive in its saline natural habitat due to remaining pre-domestication traits such as dormancy (i.e. strong inhibition of germination, especially under adverse conditions). In addition, higher levels of salt tolerance are expected to occur in wild accessions at advanced stages of development.</p><p>Salt particularly influences growth processes, so that growth rates and biomass production are reliable criteria for assessing the degree of salt stress in a plant and its salt-tolerance capacity (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Flowers and Flowers 2005</xref>). In addition, changes in biomass allocation may be determinant in salt tolerance (Byrt and <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Munns 2008</xref>), and shoot growth is generally more salt-sensitive than root growth (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Munns 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Benincasa <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). It can be assumed that a reduction in leaf area relative to root growth will decrease water uptake, thus conserving soil moisture and preventing osmotic stress due to the salt concentration (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Tester 2008</xref>). The present findings show that increased salinity led to a decrease in total dry mass, with a large reduction in root mass. Although significant differences were only observed in one group in relation to root dry mass (<italic>acephala</italic>) and mass ratio (<italic>capitata</italic>), the trends were similar in both groups. The decrease in dry mass between non-saline and the maximum concentration of NaCl (150 mM) in the irrigation water was 56 and 47 % in roots compared to 27 and 25 % in shoots in <italic>capitata</italic> and <italic>acephala</italic>, respectively. Thus, irrespective of domestication status, salinity seems to alter the allocation pattern of biomass, reducing root mass and, consequently, affecting SMR and RMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>). By contrast, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Jamil <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> found that salt stress inhibited shoot growth more than root growth in <italic>B. napus</italic> (canola) and <italic>B. oleracea</italic> (cabbage and cauliflower). In field-grown cabbage, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Maggio <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> did not find significant differences in shoot/root ratios under several salinity treatments due to similar inhibition in shoot and root growth. Consequently, these authors stated that the shoot/root ratio did not occur as a morphological adaptation to cope with saline conditions in salt-stressed plants.</p><p>
<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Tester (2008)</xref> indicated that initial inhibition of cell expansion and lateral bud development would be lower in genotypes exhibiting tolerance to osmotic stress. A reduced response to osmotic stress would produce an increase in leaf area relative to that in plants more susceptible to salinity. This may be an advantage in annual plants growing in environments with no water restrictions (i.e. cultivars and landraces growing in agricultural systems, where higher productivity is recurrent and intentionally selected), but undesirable in perennial plants in which survival prevails over growth (i.e. wild types living on sea cliffs). Accordingly, we found that two domesticated accessions (i.e. the <italic>capitata</italic> cultivar and <italic>acephala</italic> landrace) outperformed the wild accessions. This may indicate a reduced response to osmotic stress in domesticated plants (annual or biannual) in contrast to wild (perennial) accessions, in which productivity is not important. In addition, a higher level of salt tolerance is expected in wild accessions at advanced stages of development (after continued exposure to saline conditions) or when NaCl concentrations are more limiting at initial stages of growth. <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Matesanz and Milla (2018)</xref> also found that under favourable conditions, several cultivated crop plants show enhanced growth and biomass production relative to their wild counterparts, but that this domestication advantage disappears under stressful conditions. This may be of interest in crop breeding when broader adaptation (inclusive for stressful and unpredictable environments) is desirable.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Water content parameters</title><p>Saline conditions affect crop growth patterns and productivity and also modify plant&#x02013;water relationships, limiting water availability to plants in a similar way to drought stress conditions (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Tester 2008</xref>). Water content per unit dry mass (SWC) increases under salt stress. In addition, higher SWC values in the <italic>acephala</italic> cultivar may be related to the lower dry mass of less dense cells and tissues, resulting in a thinner-leaved accession with higher SLA, as leaf traits may be subject to directional selection in order to improve sensory attributes of leaves (i.e. firmness, fibrosity, etc.).</p><p>Specific leaf area has been reported to be a good indicator of leaf tissue density and resource use strategies (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Barrera Zambrano <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), with light interception for plants with lower SLA being more expensive (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Poorter <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). In the present study, the gradual reduction in SLA from wild plants to cultivars may be related to domestication and to the selection processes conducted in modern breeding programmes. Such programmes have aimed to improve productivity and quality and have focused on producing larger amounts of less dense leaves (higher SLA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), and the genotypes would therefore be more efficient in resource utilization and/or distribution. Specific leaf area was inversely related to succulence (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.795; <italic>P</italic> = 0.002), and increased salinity thus induced more succulent and thicker leaves (lower SLA). Although increased succulence (lower SLA) may be considered a costly strategy, in terms of energy consumption, it provides an advantage and proves determinant when ion toxicity is critical and survival becomes more important than growth, mainly in perennial species such as wild <italic>B. oleracea</italic>.</p><p>Succulence is related to the capacity of several plant tissues to store water and maintain physiological functions under stressful conditions (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Ogburn and Edwards 2012</xref>).

Succulence may therefore reduce the effect of ionic and osmotic stress produced by elevated salinity, ameliorating the reproductive ability in saline environments (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Agarie <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). <italic>Brassica</italic> crops enhanced salt tolerance via the development of succulent leaves (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Ashraf and McNeilly 1990</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Maggio <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) and pods (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Mogensen <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Shannon and Grieve (1999)</xref> found that under salt stress, cabbage heads are generally more compact and the leaves are fleshier than under non-saline condition.</p><p>In the present study, we found that leaf succulence increased with increasing salinity levels, indicating greater water retention in all <italic>B. oleracea acephala</italic> accessions to minimize the toxic effect of salt. Under more saline conditions, wild <italic>B. oleracea</italic> developed much more succulent leaves than in the control treatment (26 % increase, to &#x0003e;3.58 g dm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and in cultivated accessions (to a maximum SD of 2.90 g dm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> in the <italic>acephala</italic> cultivar and 2.95 g dm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> in the <italic>acephala</italic> landrace). In contrast with domesticated accessions, the wild accession appears to maintain the ability to increase succulence even at the higher salinity level (150 mM NaCl), while the maximum capacity of cultivated plants to retain water is possibly reached at these salt concentrations. This suggests that succulence may indicate lack of domestication as possession of this anatomical trait may have permitted wild <italic>Brassica</italic> to survive in saline habitats, by enhancing their capacity to retain water and dilute the salt content. This anatomical adaptation is also often present in halophytic plants (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Tester 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Mineral concentration</title><p>Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and chloride (Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) are the main ions responsible for both osmotic and ion-specific damage, which significantly reduces crop growth and yield (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Tester 2008</xref>).

Ionic stress appears later and causes premature senescence of older leaves and toxicity symptoms (chlorosis, necrosis) in mature leaves (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Tester and Davenport 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Munns <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), as high Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations disrupt protein synthesis and interfere with enzyme activity (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Blaha <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). Differences in ion partitioning and the maintenance of higher K<sup>+</sup> to Na<sup>+</sup> ratios appear to be important mechanisms contributing to salt tolerance and are important selection criteria for identifying salt-tolerant genotypes (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Wei <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Flowers 2004</xref>). In the present study, we found significant genotypic differences between cultivar and wild type for the K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio in roots, but not in shoots (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), in which the K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> values were much lower (mainly due to the higher Na<sup>+</sup> content, with the shoot K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio being irrelevant) similarly to what has been reported for other crops (<xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p><p>
<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Greenway and Munns (1980)</xref> established that for optimal efficiency, the K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio in glycophytes should be higher than 1.0. We found that this threshold was not reached in shoots of the <italic>acephala</italic> cultivar in any salt treatment or in the <italic>acephala</italic> landrace and wild type from 100 mM NaCl. In roots, the K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> value was lower than 1.0 in the <italic>acephala</italic> cultivar from a concentration of 100 mM NaCl, whereas this limit was not lower in the <italic>acephala</italic> landrace and wild accession at any level of salinity (data not shown), demonstrating higher salt tolerance in the wild accession and <italic>acephala</italic> landrace than in the <italic>acephala</italic> cultivar. This suggests that the ability to tolerate salinity may be lost in successive selection processes accomplished by modern breeding programmes aiming to produce new cultivars.</p><p>Accumulation (&#x02018;tissue tolerance&#x02019;) and exclusion (by reduction of salt uptake) of toxic ions are both mechanisms responsible for salt tolerance in plants (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Munns <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). &#x02018;Tissue tolerance&#x02019; is defined by <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Munns <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)</xref> as the capacity of tissues to function while maintaining high internal Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> concentrations, mainly through compartmentalization of these toxic ions in vacuoles (&#x02018;cellular tolerance&#x02019;) and using organic and inorganic solutes to achieve osmotic regulation. This strategy is generally manifested in halophytic species and in the most salt-tolerant non-halophytes. Nevertheless, ion exclusion is the most common mechanism used by glycophytes to adapt to saline conditions, as in the short term it is less costly, in terms of energy consumption, than compartmentalization with long-term advantages (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Gilliham 2015</xref>). Salt-tolerant genotypes have lower shoot Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations and higher shoot K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, and thus higher shoot K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratios, than the sensitive genotypes in crops such as wheat (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Oyiga <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>) and barley (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Wei <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), demonstrating that the exclusion of Na<sup>+</sup> on leaves is involved in salt tolerance in these crops. This mechanism is also recognized in <italic>Brassica</italic> species (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Ashraf and McNeilly 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). In a comparison of the tolerance of three amphidiploid <italic>Brassica</italic> species (<italic>B. juncea</italic>, <italic>B. napus</italic> and <italic>B. carinata</italic>) and their putative diploid relatives (<italic>B. rapa</italic>, <italic>B. nigra</italic> and <italic>B. oleracea</italic>), <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Ashraf <italic>et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> demonstrated that amphidiploid species discriminate for K<sup>+</sup> and against Na<sup>+</sup> in ion uptake into the roots and the later translocation to shoots. The amphidiploid species were thus considered more salt-tolerant than the diploids. <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Ulfat <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> found that in canola (<italic>B. napus</italic>), the most salt-tolerant genotypes have a higher capacity to exclude Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> in leaves. By contrast, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Ashraf and Ali (2008)</xref> did not find any differences in K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratios in shoots or roots among four canola cultivars with contrasting salt tolerance, and <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Batool <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)</xref> did not find any genotypic differences in mineral concentrations between two cauliflower cultivars under salt stress. In the present study, in all accessions the Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations increased and K<sup>+</sup> concentrations decreased in shoots and roots as salinity increased. However, shoot and root Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations were significantly lower and the root K<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio were higher in the wild accession than in the cultivated plants, despite the high variability in the latter trait among wild plants. Unlike in domesticated plants, in the wild accession the concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> in shoots remained stable independently of variations in salinity, indicating that control of Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion and transport within the plant may represent an important mechanism for managing salt stress in wild <italic>B. oleracea</italic>.</p><p>In cultivated wheat and in wild Triticeae species, salt tolerance is generally correlated with the capacity to maintain low Na<sup>+</sup> and high K<sup>+</sup> concentrations in leaves (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Colmer <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), although <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Munns and Tester (2008)</xref> reported some exceptions in which salt tolerance and Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion are not correlated. We did not find a significant correlation between Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation (in shoot and roots) and salt tolerance (based on dry mass accumulation) in seedlings. Nevertheless, shoot and root mineral concentrations appear to be associated with the ST-index, based on yield reduction under salt stress, which reflects the level of tolerance of the accessions to increasing root-zone salinity. Indeed, strict regulation of Na<sup>+</sup> transport from the external nutrient solution to the shoot is involved in enhanced salt tolerance in non-domesticated species, in terms of lower levels of biomass reduction and survival, under extreme and/or long-term salinity exposure. <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Cuartero <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref> also reported variations in this trait (among others), indicating that breeding programmes should consider incorporation of the trait as a useful way of increasing salt tolerance in tomato plants. The next steps will be to facilitate the use of wild genetic resources in agriculture and to advance the development of tools for the identification and introgression of useful genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Understanding how non-domesticated plants that survive in saline environments manage sodium toxicity will be useful for determining the mechanism of stress tolerance in <italic>B. oleracea</italic> and could help to identify useful traits to improve salt tolerance in <italic>Brassica</italic> crops. At the initial stages of development, cultivated plants outperformed wild accessions in growth parameters, probably due to their reduced response to osmotic stress. However, wild <italic>B. oleracea</italic> has evolved various adaptation mechanisms to cope with high salinity levels in the long term. Under a prolonged period of salt stress, the leaves of this species developed increased succulence and maintained lower shoot Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. Differences in regulation of Na<sup>+</sup> transport from external root nutrient solution to shoots (ion exclusion) and succulence may therefore be important for enhancing salt tolerance under continuous, extreme salinity. Such differences may also be important selection criteria for identifying and developing salt-tolerant genotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s20"><title>Supporting Information</title><p>The data used in this study are available as Supporting Information.</p><p>
