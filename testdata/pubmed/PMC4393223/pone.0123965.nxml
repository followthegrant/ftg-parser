Null mutant mice for the <italic>Dlg1</italic> gene (<italic>Dlg1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice) exhibit respiratory failure and cyanosis, and die soon after birth. However, the cause of this neonatal lethality has not been determined. In the present study, we further examined <italic>Dlg1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and found severe defects in the cardiovascular system, including ventricular septal defect, persistent truncus arteriosus, and double outlet right ventricle, which would cause the neonatal lethality. These cardiovascular phenotypes resemble those of mutant mice lacking planar cell polarity (PCP) genes and support a recent notion that DLG1 is involved in the PCP pathway. We assessed the degree of involvement of DLG1 in the development of other organs, as the cochlea, intestine, and skeleton, in which PCP signaling has been suggested to play a role. In the organ of Corti, tissue elongation was inhibited accompanied by disorganized arrangement of the hair cell rows, while the orientation of the stereocilia bundle was normal. In the sternum, cleft sternum, abnormal calcification pattern of cartilage, and disorganization of chondrocytes were observed. Furthermore, shortening of the intestine, sternum, and long bones of the limbs was observed. These phenotypes of <italic>Dlg1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice involving cellular disorganization and insufficient tissue elongation strongly suggest a defect in the convergent extension movements in these mice. Thus, our present results provide a possibility that DLG1 is particularly required for convergent extension among PCP signaling-dependent processes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (19790158 and 22790193) and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (25460240) to AIK from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jsps.go.jp">www.jsps.go.jp</ext-link>).

This organization of subcellular components and structures is known as cellular polarization [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In epithelial tissues covering the surface of organs, two kinds of polarization are observed, namely apicobasal polarity and planar cell polarity (PCP). Apicobasal polarity is formed between the two distinct plasma membrane compartments of the basal and apical cell membranes. Conversely, the polarity orthogonal to the apicobasal axis is called PCP and determines the orientation of the cells within the horizontal plane. For example, PCP is reflected in the asymmetric positioning and coordinated rotation of motile cilia in the embryonic node [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and the orientation of the V-shaped stereocilia on the apical surface of hair cells in the organ of Corti [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. During PCP formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for example, the PCP signaling pathway including core PCP components, composed of DSH, FZ, VANG, STAN, PK, and DGO, plays a central role [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The PCP signaling pathway is required not only for the above-mentioned planar cell polarization, but also for dynamic tissue movement during organogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This tissue movement is called convergent extension (CE). In CE, cells within a tissue sheet intercalate with each other to form a tissue that is narrow in width and long in longitudinal axis [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mutant mice lacking functional PCP components exhibit characteristic phenotypes, including failure of neural tube closure, open eyelids, misorientation of the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells, and malformation of the outflow tract in the cardiovascular system [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the extents of the dependence of these phenotypes on PCP or CE remain to be elucidated.</p><p>In cardiovascular development, the outflow tract is originally formed as a single tube connecting to the right ventricle and then changes its position leftward. Simultaneously, conotruncal cushions develop within the outflow tract and fuse to form the conotruncal septum separating the aorta and the pulmonary artery. In addition, conotruncal cushions fuse to endocardial cushions to close the ventricular septum and to separate the pulmonary and systemic circulations [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Two progenitor cell lineages are known to be critical for the development of the outflow tract. Specifically, a secondary heart field (SHF), comprising a splanchnic mesoderm caudal to the outflow tract, contributes to cardiomyocytes of the outflow tract [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The other cell lineage is composed of cardiac neural crest cells, which migrate into the outflow tract and form conotruncal cushions [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Abnormal behaviors of these cell types can cause congenital heart defects. For example, neural crest-specific gene targeting of ACVR1/ALK2 impaired migration of these cells, disturbed the separation of the outflow tract, and caused persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As another example, impaired development of the SHF caused malposition of the pulmonary and aortic arteries and resulted in double outlet right ventricle (DORV) [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, PCP signaling is thought to be necessary for development of the outflow tract, because mutant mice for PCP component genes such as <italic>Vangl2</italic>, <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Scrib</italic>, <italic>Fzd</italic>, and <italic>Dvl</italic> exhibit cardiovascular defects including PTA and DORV [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Drosophila</italic> Discs large (DLG) is a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein with three PDZ domains and a guanylate kinase-like domain, and has been identified as a tumor suppressor involved in apicobasal polarization of epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In epithelial cells, DLG coordinates with LGL and SCRIB and localizes PAR3/PAR6/aPKC complexes at the apical membrane to form apicobasal polarity [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. During asymmetric cell division of neural stem cells and sensory organ precursor cells, DLG is involved in the spindle orientation [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. DLG1 is one of the four mammalian homologs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> DLG protein and forms the MAGUK scaffold protein family along with three other DLG homologs, DLG2/CHAPSYN-110, DLG3/SAP102, and DLG4/PSD95. DLG1 is widely expressed in various cell types and accumulates at cell-cell contact sites in polarized epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>To date, several <italic>Dlg1</italic> gene-targeted mice have been generated by us and other researchers, and the developmental roles of DLG1 have been analyzed [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These studies showed that loss of DLG1 function leads to complete neonatal lethality [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, respiratory failure [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], cyanosis [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and defects in craniofacial [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and urogenital [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] organs have been reported. Because DLG is involved in apicobasal polarization in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelium, we had expected that the essential function of DLG1 protein would also be the formation of apicobasal polarity in mice, and that the loss of apicobasal polarity would cause the developmental defects observed in <italic>Dlg1</italic>
<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. In our previous study, however, we found that the apicobasal polarity appeared to be maintained in the absence of DLG1, as the intracellular localizations of CDH1/E-cadherin and TJP1/ZO-1 in ureteric epithelial cells were normal in <italic>Dlg1</italic>
<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Consequently, the cell biological function of DLG1 during mouse development has not been clarified. Therefore, in the present study, we further analyzed <italic>Dlg1</italic>
<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> embryonic mice to identify the developmental problems causing the neonatal lethality and to understand the underlying functional mechanism of DLG1. Here we demonstrate the novel requirement of DLG1 for the development of the cardiovascular system and for tissue elongation during cochlear, enteric, and skeletal development, and propose that DLG1 is likely involved in the CE process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animal experiments and ethics statement</title><p>

<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice (<xref rid="pone.0123965.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). The numbers of inner and outer hair cells in the extra hair cell rows were significantly higher in <italic>Dlg1</italic>

Deiters cells have been reported to be missing in mice with impairment of the cell-fate-switching system [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To examine whether the cell-fate-regulating mechanism was disrupted, the possibility that Deiters cells were missing at the appearance of the extra rows of hair cells was examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy (<xref rid="pone.0123965.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I&#x02013;6K</xref>). In the area of extra hair cell rows where four outer hair cells were placed on a line (<xref rid="pone.0123965.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6J</xref>, yellow asterisks), Deiters cells (<xref rid="pone.0123965.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6J</xref>, white arrowheads) were increased in parallel to the hair cells, suggesting that the hair cells did not increase at the expense of the supporting cells.

<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, a BrdU labeling assay was performed.

The possibility that the hair cell proliferation arrest was released and the excessively generated hair cells caused extra rows was evaluated by detecting BrdU-positive cells in the zone of non-proliferating cells. In the regions of outer hair cells, pillar cells, and Deiters cells, no BrdU-positive cells were found in either control or <italic>Dlg1</italic>

For completion of the functional development of the gut, formation of the enteric nerve plexus is crucial as well as endodermal intestinal tube formation. The enteric nerve plexus covers the surface of the tract and regulates intestinal peristalsis. The enteric nerve plexus is composed of neural crest cells migrating downward along the intestine [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Defective migration of neural crest cells and insufficient coverage of the intestinal surface by the nerve plexus result in Hirschsprung&#x02019;s disease in humans with severe malfunction of digestion. Since several neural crest cell-derived tissues and organs, such as the craniofacial skeleton and septum of the heart outflow tract, exhibited malformations in <italic>Dlg1</italic>

<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice</title><p>Cells in multicellular organisms establish vertical apicobasal polarity and horizontal PCP. During PCP formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for example, the PCP signaling cascade, including the core PCP components of DSH, FZ, VANG, STAN, PK, and DGO, plays a central role. In addition, many other effectors and modifiers of this signaling cascade have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In vertebrates, the PCP signaling pathway is one of the non-canonical WNT pathways and is activated by binding of the WNT ligand to FZD receptors [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. SCRIB, which is important for apicobasal polarization, is also involved in PCP regulation [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PCP signals exert their roles during animal development in two aspects: first, in planar cell polarization in its narrow sense, in which each cell orients itself to the correct direction in a plane; and second, in CE, in which the tissue extends its length by narrowing its width by cell rearrangement through cell intercalation or reconstruction of cell-cell junctions [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

As the phenotypes of <italic>Dlg1</italic>
<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice in the palate and cardiovascular system were very similar to those of PCP-deficient mice, we intended to evaluate the possibility that DLG1 functions in the PCP signaling cascade. In mammals, regulation of the orientation of the stereocilia in hair cells and lengthening of the organ of Corti are known to require PCP signaling [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].

<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice</title><p>CE and planar cell orientation are both affected by deficiency of PCP genes. Although the mechanisms for regulating cell orientation and CE under PCP signaling remain unclear, CTNND1 (p120-catenin), which exerts its role in cell-cell adhesion through recruitment of cadherins to the cell surface, was recently reported to be required for CE, but not for hair cell orientation in cochlear development [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

One possible mechanism is that an increase in hair cells by cell cycle dysregulation caused the appearance of the extra row. Deficiency of the cell cycle-regulating protein CDKN1B/p27kip1 has been reported to be the cause [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Another possible mechanism is impairment of the cell fate determination mechanism regulated by Notch signaling [<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0123965.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].

In the case of <italic>Dlg1</italic>
<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, however, the total number of hair cells was decreased and supporting cells beneath the extra hair cell row were not missing.

[<xref rid="pone.0123965.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] studied two <italic>Dlg1</italic> gene-null mutant mouse strains with a C57BL/6J or FVB/NJ background and expressed the idea that DLG1 is involved in PCP. The present results, which were mostly obtained using a <italic>Dlg1</italic> gene-null mutant mouse strain with its genome derived from the C57BL/6N and CBA/J mouse strains, also indicate a role for DLG1 in PCP phenomena, generally supporting the opinion of Rivera et al. However, the phenotypes described in Rivera et al. and our present report consist of not only universal phenotypes that were observed in all three mouse strains, but also specific phenotypes with varied severity or incidence depending on the different mouse strains. Among the phenotypes reported by Rivera et al., lethality, cleft palate, short snout, and reduced size seemed to be universal phenotypes as they were observed in all three mouse strains, although we did not mention all of these phenotypes in this paper. On the other hand, among the comparable phenotypes, the hair cell misorientation was specific for the C57BL/6J strain in Rivera et al., and the long bone shortening was specific for the FVB/NL strain in Rivera et al. and our strain. Since the universal phenotypes represent phenomena in which DLG1 plays a central role with little interference from other genetic backgrounds, their identification will be important to fully evaluate the role of DLG1.
