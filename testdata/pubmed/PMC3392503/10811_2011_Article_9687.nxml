During winter the productivity is low because of the light and temperature conditions. The productivity and photosynthetic efficiency of <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> were assessed under the worst-case scenario found during winter time in Huelva, south of Spain. The maximum light intensity (800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and temperature (20&#x000b0;C) during winter were simulated in a lab-scale photobioreactor with a short light-path of 14&#x000a0;mm. Chemostat conditions were applied and the results were compared with a temperature-controlled situation at 38&#x000b0;C (optimal growth temperature for <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic>).

The slow metabolism under suboptimal temperature resulted in a decline of the light energy requirements of the cells.

In order to reach high yearly productivities light should be efficiently converted into biomass throughout the entire year. In our previous study we assessed the productivity of <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> under summer conditions (Cuaresma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). In the current paper the performance of <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> under the most extreme winter circumstances is studied.</p><p>To some extent algae can adapt their photosynthetic machinery to changing environmental conditions; this is called (photo)acclimation. It can lead to stable long-term adjustment to the new environmental condition on a phenotypic level (Huner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1998</xref>; MacIntyre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>). But, at high light or low temperature, there is an imbalance between the light absorbed through photochemistry versus the energy utilized through metabolism, which leads to over-excitation of Photosystem II (PSII; Huner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1998</xref>). The excitation pressure of PSII can be decreased by reducing energy transfer to PSII (photoacclimation) or by dissipating the excess energy as heat (called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)). NPQ is a defense mechanism against excessive light and oxidative damage (Muller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2001</xref>). Though the photosynthetic machinery is somehow able to acclimate to excessive light energy, all incoming light &#x0201c;wasted&#x0201d; as heat in NPQ is not used for growth (Huisman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>) which automatically leads to a drop in photosynthetic efficiency.</p><p>In addition to light, temperature also affects the photosynthetic activity and the growth of microalgae (Coles and Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>). The photochemical reactions are highly affected by irradiance and are insensitive to temperature (Raven and Geider <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1988</xref>). In contrast, the biochemical processes are temperature-sensitive, and the absorbed light energy cannot be converted into carbohydrates efficiently at temperatures deviating far from the optimum (Coles and Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>; Dauta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1990</xref>; Huner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1998</xref>). At low temperatures the turnover of enzymes is reduced, and the metabolic activity of the algae becomes lower. This leads to a lower maximum growth rate and a reduced need of substrate. In the case of light-limited algal growth this substrate is light; therefore, moderate irradiance can already be excessive at low temperatures (Coles and Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>; Dauta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1990</xref>). Algae use similar defense mechanism to over-excitation of PSII at low temperatures as at high irradiances (Huner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1998</xref>; Maxwell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1994</xref>).</p><p>In most algae cultivation systems temperature is maintained at its optimum value, although this has an influence on production costs. Avoiding cooling in summer and heating in winter, will result in a reduction in process costs.</p><p>The effect of extreme winter conditions on the productivity and photosynthetic efficiency of <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> under light-limited chemostat conditions was assessed in this work in a short light-path flat panel photobioreactor, one of the most robust designs for microalgae cultivation (Posten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>). Maximum irradiance and temperature during winter in a horizontal surface (800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, 20&#x000b0;C) in Huelva (Spain, 37&#x000ba;15&#x000b4;N 6&#x000ba;57&#x000b4;W, PVGIS) were selected to grow <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic>. The influence of temperature control was also tested by applying the optimal growth temperature of <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>
<italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> CCAP 211/8&#x000a0;K (UTEX Culture Collection) was maintained under sterile conditions in Roux flasks containing modified M-8a medium (Cuaresma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). The maintenance culture was kept inside a growth chamber at 25&#x000b0;C with continuous illumination (150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The pH was adjusted to 6.7, and the cultures were bubbled with 5%<sub>v</sub> CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched air.</p><p>During the photobioreactor experiments, urea (60&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>-3</sup> M) was used as nitrogen source, and the culture medium had a composition three times higher than the medium used for maintenance (Cuaresma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>) in order to avoid nutrient limitation.</p><sec id="d32e434"><title>Experimental conditions</title><p>A flat panel reactor of 1.7&#x000a0;L and a light-path of 14&#x000a0;mm was used in the experiments (Cuaresma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). The culture was homogeneously mixed by air bubbling at a flow of 1.5&#x000a0;L L<sup>-1</sup> culture min<sup>-1</sup>. The pH was maintained at 6.7 by adding CO<sub>2</sub> via a separate mass flow controller. The gas outflow leaves the reactor via a condenser to prevent evaporation of the culture broth. Temperature was kept constant by a water jacket connected to a thermostat. Temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen were measured online inside the reactor.</p><p>The reactor was illuminated by red light emitting diodes distributed homogeneously over the reactor surface. To simulate winter irradiance at midday in Huelva (Spain, 37&#x000ba;15&#x000b4;N 6&#x000ba;57&#x000b4;W), data from PVGIS (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">references</xref>) were used. January was selected as reference month, and the maximum irradiance on a horizontal surface was applied to the photobioreactor (800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). The average PFD inside the culture chamber was calculated by measuring the PFD inside the empty reactor with a Licor SA190 quantum sensor at 45 spots distributed homogeneously over the reactor surface. Another Licor SA190 quantum sensor was placed on a reference position in the reactor outer surface, facing the lamps, to continuously measure the received PFD. A correlation factor between the average PFD inside the reactor and the reference PFD could be calculated. With this correlation factor, the PFD was automatically adapted to the desired intensity inside the photobioreactor.</p><p>After inoculation, batch cultivation was needed to adapt the microalgae to the light conditions. When biomass density was around 2&#x000a0;g Kg<sup>-1</sup> (approx. 2&#x000a0;g L<sup>-1</sup>), chemostat conditions were applied, increasing the dilution rate stepwise. At suboptimal growth temperature, adaptation first to the temperature and then to the dilution rate was needed.</p><p>During the steady-state four samples were taken daily from the outflow when operating at optimal growth temperature. Due to the low dilution rate supported at suboptimal growth temperature and the technical pump limitations to supply the corresponding flow rate, the dilution was applied in 2-hour cycles of 50&#x000a0;minutes dilution. In order to have reproducible data, three samples were taken every day at the same time, corresponding with the end of a dilution cycle.</p></sec><sec id="d32e472"><title>Biomass concentration</title><p>Dry weight was determined by filtration through glass microfiber filters (0.7&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m pore size).

After drying for at least 16&#x000a0;h at 80&#x000b0;C, and cooling to room temperature for at least 2&#x000a0;h in a desiccator, the filters were weighed.

The biomass yield on light energy obviously showed the same trend as productivity, with a maximal value of 1.2&#x000a0;g&#x02009;mol photons<sup>-1</sup> supplied when <italic>D</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.18 h<sup>-1</sup>. At high dilution rates the cells experience more light availability since biomass density is low. It leads to a higher photosynthetic efficiency and therefore, productivity. However, when the dilution rate was 0.24 h<sup>-1</sup>, close to the maximum specific growth rate of <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> (0.27 h<sup>-1</sup>), the low biomass density associated to that dilution rate resulted in a bigger loss of photons through the photobioreactor. This leads to a lower photosynthetic efficiency when it is defined as the amount of biomass produced by amount of photons supplied to the system. These results can be related to our previous findings (Cuaresma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>) where <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> was cultivated under continuous irradiance simulating summer conditions (2100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>).

Nevertheless, the photosynthetic efficiency yielded at maximum winter irradiance was higher when compared with the summer experiments (1.2 versus 1.0&#x000a0;g biomass mol<sup>-1</sup> photons). Exposure to a non-oversaturating irradiance during the winter experiments resulted in a higher photosynthetic efficiency when compared with our previous work.</p><p>At suboptimal growth temperature (<italic>T</italic>

It resulted in a productivity of 0.1&#x000a0;g Kg<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, 60% lower than the highest productivity found at <italic>T</italic>
<sub>opt</sub>. The biomass yield on light energy was also relatively low, with 0.5&#x000a0;g mol<sup>-1</sup> photons supplied. At suboptimal temperatures the irradiance applied might be experienced as oversaturating, resulting in a higher rate of heat dissipation (NPQ) and therefore a lower photosynthetic efficiency.</p><p>The negative effect of suboptimal growth temperature on algal metabolism and efficiency is strengthened when low temperatures are accompanied by high irradiances, as already stated by different authors (Sorokin and Krauss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1962</xref>; Spearing and Karlander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1979</xref>; Vonshak and Torzillo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>; Vonshak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>) also assessed the influence of temperature on productivity. They found a positive effect when controlling the temperature at irradiances relatively high.</p><p>In this case photoinhibition could be prevented. Heating the culture in the morning also diminishes the negative effect of temperature, leading to a 60% higher daily productivity as has been already observed by Vonshak et al.

</p><p>According to Cuaresma et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>) the biomass concentration during winter maximal irradiance was twice lower if compared with summer maximum irradiance at 0.24 h<sup>-1</sup> (2009 Summer versus 2010 Winter). Since light was the only limiting factor at <italic>T</italic>
<sub>opt</sub>, and no significant photodamage was observed at 800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, it can be concluded that the culture was light-limited under winter conditions. On the other hand, under both simulations (winter and summer), the optimum biomass density was low compared with the high biomass densities found at high irradiance for other algal strains (Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1998</xref>; Meiser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>; Qiang and Richmond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1996</xref>; Qiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1998</xref>). In this sense, high temperature strains such as <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> require higher light intensity than other strains with a lower optimum growth temperature (Myers and Graham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1961</xref>; Sorokin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1960</xref>). Kliphuis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010</xref>) also found a low optimum biomass density for <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> at high light intensities. Altogether, this indicates that <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> is not only able to withstand high irradiances but might actually need a high irradiance to achieve high productivities.</p><p>The maximum photosynthetic yield of PSII (<italic>Y</italic>
<sub>op</sub>) at the optimum growth temperature remained above 0.7 for all dilution rates applied (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) indicating efficient functioning of the photosynthetic machinery and absence of photoinhibition. The absence of significant photodamage at the irradiance tested (800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) is in agreement with the results of Cuaresma et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>) where no photoinhibition of <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> was observed even at a much higher irradiance (2,100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>).</p><p>The high biomass concentration found at suboptimal temperature is related to the low specific growth rate, and therefore the low dilution rate applied. As commented before, the slow growth at suboptimal temperatures could be related to the slow algal metabolism, which will result in a decline in substrate requirements, therefore meaningless light in the case of a light-limited chemostat. In this sense, the simulated winter irradiance can support a more dense culture at suboptimal temperature since the individual cells cannot grow fast anyway due to the temperature limitation.</p><p>From a photosynthetic point of view, at suboptimal temperatures, the electron sinks will be continuously over-reduced due to the slow metabolism. The incoming light will be experienced then as oversaturating, and will result in over-excitation of PSII. A lower photosynthetic efficiency will be expected, and photodamage to PSII is more likely to occur. In this sense, at suboptimal temperatures, a moderate irradiance level can already be counteracting as addressed before. Algae are able to acclimate to excessive irradiance by dissipating the extra light energy as heat via NPQ. This is shown by the low maximum quantum yield of PSII (<italic>Y</italic>
<sub>op</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5), which was below the typical value for healthy cells (<italic>Y</italic>
<sub>op</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7). This low <italic>Y</italic>
<sub>op</sub> was also reflected in the low biomass yield, and productivity reached at <italic>T</italic>
<sub>sub</sub>.</p><p>In this study a large deviation from <italic>T</italic>
<sub>opt</sub> was applied (&#x00394;<italic>T</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18&#x000b0;C), which led to a 30% decrease in <italic>Y</italic>
<sub>op</sub> compared with <italic>T</italic>
<sub>opt</sub>. This is in accordance with Grobbelaar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>) who also reported a 30% drop in <italic>Y</italic>
<sub>op</sub> at midday when cultivating <italic>Spirulina platensis</italic> 10&#x000b0;C below the optimum growth temperature. Moreover, Maxwell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1994</xref>) also found that growth of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> had the same photosynthetic response to low temperature as to high irradiances. Thus (over)saturating light conditions at suboptimal temperatures lead to photoinhibition and a decrease in the photosynthetic efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Cell pigmentation</title><p>At optimal temperature (<italic>T</italic>

The total pigment content per unit of biomass decreased with increasing dilution rate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) when the culture experienced a higher average irradiance due to the lower biomass concentration. At higher biomass concentrations, higher pigment content is expected to compensate for the increase in photolimitation, a process called photoacclimation.

</p><p>The pigment content at suboptimal temperature (31.2&#x000a0;mg and 6.8&#x000a0;mg carotenoids g<sup>-1</sup> dw) was lower than expected considering that the biomass concentration was higher than the highest biomass concentration achieved at <italic>T</italic>

<sub>opt</sub>. This resulted in a slightly higher ratio of carotenoids to chlorophyll at <italic>T</italic>
<sub>sub</sub> (16% higher). This is probably related to the higher NPQ since the carotenoids also function as antioxidants and play a role in dissipation of excessive light as heat (Niyogi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1997</xref>). At the optimum growth temperature the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio was similar under all the dilution rates assayed, which seems to indicate that no extra photoprotective activity from the carotenoids was needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The strong influence of temperature on algal productivity during winter cultivation was confirmed by this study. Suboptimal growth temperatures lead to a low specific growth rate. Therefore, a low productivity was found at 20&#x000b0;C, the maximal winter temperature, for <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> (0.12&#x000a0;g Kg<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). Biomass yield on light energy was also low, 0.5&#x000a0;g mol<sup>-1</sup> photons. The slow metabolism and the higher need of NPQ to dissipate the excessive light absorbed resulted in a lower photosynthetic efficiency of <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> at suboptimal temperatures.</p><p>Due to the over-saturating irradiance experienced by the algal cells at suboptimal temperature a higher carotenoid-to-chlorophyll ratio was observed, which was probably related to the higher levels of heat dissipation (NPQ).</p><p>Temperature control during winter time could clearly enhance the productivity and photosynthetic efficiency of <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic>. At optimal growth temperature, the productivity reached at maximal winter irradiance (800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) was high when compared with suboptimal temperature, but about half of the productivity found with the same cultivation system at maximal summer irradiance (Cuaresma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). Nevertheless, the biomass yield on light energy was higher at maximal winter irradiance (<italic>Y</italic>
<sub>x,E</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.2&#x000a0;g dw mol<sup>-1</sup> photons supplied) than at summer irradiance (<italic>Y</italic>
<sub>x,E</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0&#x000a0;g dw mol<sup>-1</sup> photons supplied). The low winter irradiance resulted in a more efficient conversion of the available light biomass (higher <italic>Y</italic>
<sub>x,E</sub>) by <italic>C. sorokiniana</italic> when temperature is controlled. However, the lower photons availability during winter time led to a lower volumetric productivity when compared with summer irradiance, suggesting that the photobioreactor was operated in the photolimited regime.</p><p>During winter, the suboptimal temperature is the main factor reducing metabolic rates and, consequently, photosynthetic efficiency at relatively high irradiance (around noon). Higher temperatures than 20&#x000b0;C would lead to a higher productivity, therefore temperature control will result in higher winter productivities. Reduction of irradiance at the photobioreactor surface, on the other hand, might be an attractive alternative to temperature control in outdoor cultivation during winter time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was financially supported by the University of Huelva and Junta de Andaluc&#x000ed;a (Proyectos de Excelencia, AGR-4337) in Spain, and a SenterNovem
