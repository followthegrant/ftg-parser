The methanol increased bulk rotational and lateral mobilities of SPMVs lipid bilayers.

The methanol decreased the anisotropy of the 16-(9-anthroyloxy)palmitic acid (16-AP), 12-(9-anthroyloxy)stearic acid (12-AS), 9-(9-anthroyloxy)stearic acid (9-AS), and 6-(9-anthroyloxy)stearic acid (6-AS) in the SPMVs outer monolayer but it increased the anisotropy of 2-(9-anthroyloxy)stearic acid (2-AS) in the monolayers. The magnitude of the increased rotational mobility by the methanol was in the order at the position of 16, 12, 9, and 6 of aliphatic chains in phospholipids of the outer monolayers. Furthermore, the methanol increased annular lipid fluidity and also caused membrane proteins to cluster. The important finding is that was far greater increase by methanol in annular lipid fluidity than increase in lateral and rotational mobilities by the methanol. Methanol alters the stereo or dynamics of the proteins in the lipid bilayers by combining with lipids, especially with the annular lipids. In conclusion, the present data suggest that methanol, in additions to its direct interaction with proteins, concurrently interacts with membrane lipids, fluidizing the membrane, and thus inducing conformational changes of proteins known to be intimately associated with membranes lipids.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Annular lipid fluidity</kwd><kwd>Membrane protein clustering</kwd><kwd>Methanol</kwd><kwd>Neuronal membranes</kwd><kwd>Transbilayer lateral and rotational mobility</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A number of theories propose perturbations of bulk physical properties of the lipids of cell membranes as the primary event leading to inebriation or anesthesia. The molecular mechanism of action of ethnaol involved in producing ethanol intoxication, tolerance and general anesthesia are not well understood. An understanding of the behavior of ethanol at the molecular level is complicated by the fact that ethanol has a multi-faceted effect on cells in contrast to a localized site of action on a specific cellular target. The nonspecific effects of ethanol resulted in a large body of work that examined how ethanol affected bulk membrane lipid structure. One hypothesis was that ethanol fluidized the bulk membrane lipid and that the increased in fluidity was involved in general anesthesia and intoxication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Most of the accumulated results for the analysis of ethanol's effect on the cell membrane fluidity used a single molecular probe for estimations of bulk membrane fluidity, and thus obtained information about one region (or average). However the membrane fluidity may vary at different positions. In most studies, effects of ethanol on membrane fluidity have examined the bulk bilayer's rotational mobility, not on the individual monolayer's rotational mobility (asymmetric mobility). Furthermore with few exceptions work has not focused on the bulk lateral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and individual monolayers' mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and annular lipid fluidity and protein distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Opinions have been divided as to whether ethanol interfered with membrane protein function by directly binding to the proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or whether the main modes of action occurred indirectly through a change in the physicochemical properties of the lipid membranes into which the ethanol readily diffused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Because biological membranes are of highly complex composition, it has not been feasible to monitor changes in the local lipid environment and to determine its effect on the membrane protein function at the same time.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the fluorophores of anthroyloxy derivatives locate at a graded series of levels from the surface to the center of the lipid bilayer structure (or a series of anthroyloxy fatty acids indicates that the depth of the group is almost linearly related to the number of carbon atoms between it and carboxyl group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The fluorophores of anthroyloxy derivatives can also be used to differentiate whether the bilayer has a fluidity gradient across it, as the anthroyloxy group can be positioned at different positions of the stearic acid moiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These probes have been suggested to measure primarily the dynamic component of membrane fluidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>We believe that the study of the structure-activity relationship of n-alkanols becomes a very important material for the research of mechanism of pharmacological action of ethanol. Tempting to further understand the molecular mechanism of action of ethanol, we carried out a comprehensive study of membrane actions of methanol. We isolated synaptosomal plasma membrane vesicles (SPMVs) from fresh bovine cerebral cortex and using intramolecular excimerization of 1,3-di(1-pyrenyl)propane (Py-3-Py) and fluorescence polarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), we examined the effect of methanol on the bulk fluidity of SPMVs lipid bilayer. In addition, selective quenching of both Py-3-Py and DPH fluorescence by trinitrophenyl groups was used to examine the effect of methanol on the individual SPMVs monolayers. We also evaluated the effect of methanol on basic structural parameters of the SPMVs lipid bilayer's annular lipid fluidity. This study was done through investigation of the effect of methanol on rotational mobility of the hydrocarbon interior and polar region (membrane interface, surface region) in the native membranes which differ in fluidity. The study was carried out using 16-(9-anthroyloxy)palmitic acid (16-AP), 12-(9-anthroyloxy) stearic acid (12-AS), 9-(9-anthroyloxy)stearic acid (9-AS), 6-(9-anthroyloxy)stearic acid (6-AS) and 2-(9-anthroyloxy) stearic acid (2-AS) those reflecting rotational mobility at the 16, 12, 9, 6 and 2 position of aliphatic chains present in phospholipids of neuronal membrane outer monolayers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The fluorescent probes DPH, Py-3-Py and the fluorescent anthroyloxy palmitate or stearate probes, 16-AP, 12-AS, 9-AS, 6-AS and 2-AS were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Methanol and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Other reagents were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and were analytical grade.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of synaptosomes and TNBS labeling reaction</title><p>Preparation of synaptosomes was performed according to the earlier procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To determine fluorescence parameters of probe molecules in each membrane monolayer, TNBS labeling reactions were performed according to the procedures described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] with a few modifications. Synaptosomal pellet was gently resuspended in 50 ml of 4 mM TNBS in buffer A for 80 min (in the case of asymmetric lateral mobility), or 50 ml of 2 mM TNBS in buffer A for 40 min (in the case of asymmetric rotational mobility) or buffer A alone. Buffer A was composed of 30 mM NaCl, 120 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 mM glucose and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The reagent pH was adjusted to 8.5 with NaOH. To assure complete exposure of all synaptosomal outer monolayers to TNBS, the pellet was passed slowly through an Eberbach tissue grinder (3 up and down strokes). Unless otherwise specified, the treatment was carried out at 4&#x02103;. The TNBS labeling reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 1% BSA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 8 g/l NaCl, 0.2 g/l KCl, 0.2 g/l KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.15 g/l Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>&#x000b7;7H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.48 g/l Hepes, pH 7.4).</p></sec><sec><title>Membrane isolation</title><p>SPMVs were isolated from synaptosomes by the formerly reported method in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

The electron microscopic examination of the SPMVs prepared by us showed very high purity. The vesicles, which were separated according to size, demonstrated homogeneous distribution and no longer showed the presence of intracellular organelles or leakage. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.

After incorporation of the probes, the membrane suspension was placed in cuvettes. Control levels of fluorescence were then determined.

Emission wavelengths were 335 nm for tryptophan, 379 nm for Py-3-Py monomer and 480 nm for Py-3-Py excimer. For Py-3-Py excimer emission, a GG-455 cut-off filter was used. The excimer to monomer fluorescence intensity ratio, <italic>I'/I</italic>, was calculated from the 480 nm to 379 nm signal ratio.

The SPMVs were suspended in PBS to concentration 50 &#x000b5;g of protein/ml. Stock solutions of the 16-AP, 12-AS, 9-AS, 6-AS and 2-AS in methanol (2&#x000d7;10<sup>-5</sup> M) were prepared and kept in a cold and dark place. Aliquots were added to the solutions of the native membranes so that the final concentrations of the 16-AP, 12-AS, 9-AS, 6-AS and 2-AS became 4&#x000d7;10<sup>-8</sup> M incorporated the probes. The mixture was stirred for 20 min at room temperature in order to reduce the concentration of methanol that might alter the rotational mobility of the SPMVs. Also, the mixture was bubbled by dry nitrogen for 1 min with 20 min intervals in order to eliminate oxygen that might act as a quencher. To ensure complete removal of methanol residue in the mixture, the prepared mixtures were subjected to exhausted stirring for more than 2 hr which have shown the same results as the mixtures stirred for 20 min. Concentrated solution of methanol was prepared in PBS and added to the labeled membrane suspension to give the desired concentration of the methanol.

For this purpose, three control procedures are routinely used. First, as an "internal control", mitochondria and microsomes are isolated from the synaptosomes from which the trinitrophenylated plasma membranes are isolated. If any significant degree of penetration of TNBS into the synaptosome occurs, these intracellular organelles also become trinitrophenylated. Only 1.8&#x000b1;0.2% and 2.1&#x000b1;0.4% of microsomal and mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine were trinitrophenylated by our treatment. In contrast, when the TNBS treatment is performed under penetrating conditions (37&#x02103;), 60~80% of the phosphatidylethanolamine in microsomes or mitochondria is trinitrophenylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Second, approximately half of the Py-3-Py fluorescence was quenched in the trinitrophenylated SPMVs. Third, the trinitrophenylation of the synaptosome may alter membrane enzyme activities.

It arose from a combination of spectroscopic studies, the realization that membranes can be regarded as a two dimensional fluids, and the desire to obtain a simple single physical parameter that would describe their properties. The difficulty with the membrane fluidity concept is that any physical parameter chosen will be a function of the spectroscopic method employed, specifically its particular time window, and the properties of the probe (shape, charge, location etc) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The membrane fluidity concept also depends on the assumption that the hydrophobic region of cell membranes is structurally and dynamically homogeneous, an assumption that is now under serious challenge. Thus while it may be true to say that bulk or average spectroscopic properties of cell membranes may not be useful in building a hypothesis for the pharmacological action(s) of drug(s), local properties pertaining to domains or the immediate environment of a membrane protein maybe very relevant.</p><p>As already pointed out, membrane bilayer mobility is one of the important factors controlling membrane microviscosity or fluidity, membrane bilayer mobility includes lateral mobility, rotational mobility and flip-flop and it is well known that the most important of these is lateral mobility.

Plasma membranes consist of two monolayers that are asymmetric in lipid distribution, electrical charge, fluidity, protein distribution and function, and does not appear to be coupled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It had been widely known that different lipids could affect the physical properties of the membrane. Membrane cholesterol is one of the major lipids of plasma membranes and is asymmetrically distributed in the outer and inner monolayers of membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].

In addition, investigations of the effects of higher alkanols and the corresponding alkane on membrane luciferase indicate that the anesthetic targets could be hydrophobic pockets on membrane proteins rather than lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].

Still, a large, diverse collection of physiological agonists produces the alterations in membrane fluidity as well as specific ligand-receptor interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Hence the function of membrane proteins may be modulated secondarily to changes in membrane fluidity. Conversely, ethanol may have a direct effect on certain receptors, receptor-gated ion channels, or membrane-bound enzymes, and, as result, on membrane lipids. As mentioned above, ethanol (at 50 mM) increased both lateral and rotational mobility of SPMVs lipid bilayer, and the increases were mainly due to effects on the outer monolayer of the SPMVs. However, ethanol (at 50 mM) increased annular lipid fluidity in SPMVs by 37.2% and altered the protein distribution by 15.6%. Furthermore, methanol, like ethanol, increased both lateral (at 500 mM) and rotational (at 1,000 mM) mobilities of SPMVs lipid bilayer, and the increases were mainly due to effects on the outer monolayer of the SPMVs. And we confirmed that the increase on annular lipid fluidity and the change on protein distribution induced by methanol were far greater than the increase on lateral and rotational mobilities of the SPMVs lipid bilayer. Direct effects of ethanol on protein appear to have magnified such effects on the lipids. This conclusion can be drawn because Bae et al.
