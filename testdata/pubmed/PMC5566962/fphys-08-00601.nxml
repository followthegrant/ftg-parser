In contrast to the protein- and carbohydrate-rich solid food, high fat milk is characterized primarily by fatty acids of medium chain length particularly important for the suckling pups. Therefore, it seems conceivable that the stomach mucosa may be specialized for detecting these important nutrients during the suckling phase. Here, we analyzed the expression of the G protein coupled receptors GPR84 and GPR120 (FFAR4), which are considered to be receptors for medium and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs), respectively. We found that the mRNA levels for GPR84 and GPR120 were high during the suckling period and progressively decreased in the course of weaning. Visualization of the receptor-expressing cells in 2-week-old mice revealed a high number of labeled cells, which reside in the apical as well as in the basal region of the gastric glands. At the base of the gastric glands, all GPR84-immunoreactive cells and some of the GPR120-positive cells also expressed chromogranin A (CgA), suggesting that they are enteroendocrine cells. We demonstrate that the majority of the CgA/GPR84 cells are X/A-like ghrelin cells. The high degree of overlap between ghrelin and GPR84 decreased post-weaning, whereas the overlap between ghrelin and GPR120 increased. At the apical region of the glands the fatty acid receptors were mainly expressed in unique cell types. These contain lipid-filled vacuole- and vesicle-like structures and may have absorptive functions. We detected decreased immunoreactivity for GPR84 and no lipid droplets in surface cells post-weaning. In conclusion, expression of GPR84 in ghrelin cells as well as in surface cells suggests an important role of medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) in the developing gastric mucosa of suckling mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>milk fat</kwd><kwd>stomach</kwd><kwd>fatty acid receptor</kwd><kwd>lipid sensing cells</kwd><kwd>ghrelin</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">BO 1743/3</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="37"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="6571"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the postnatal development of mice, the structure and function of epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract undergo changes in accordance with the physiological requirements at the different developmental stages (Kataoka et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). For the stomach of newborn mice, it has been shown that the glandular buds are only rudimentarily developed with some enteroendocrine cells at their base and an unique epithelial cell type at the glandular surface (Keeley and Samuelson, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The stomach mucosa remains immature during the entire suckling period and the small glands comprise of immature parietal and chief cells coinciding with low levels of acid and pepsin activity in the stomach (Keeley and Samuelson, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). During the late suckling period, at ~3 weeks of age, the structure of the stomach mucosa changes in preparation for weaning&#x02014;the turning point in diet type&#x02014;, i.e., when milk is successively replaced by solid food of lower digestibility (Chen and Fisher, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>). During weaning, glandular morphogenesis continues to mature and the gastric glands reach a compartmentalized structure with active parietal cells and chief cells as well as an increasing number of enteroendocrine cells with distinct hormone profiles (Norl&#x000e9;n et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Karam et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>Not only the digestibility but also the composition of the diet during the suckling phase (exclusively milk) and the post-weaning phase (solid food) is very different. In fact, during the suckling-weaning transition, the diet changes from high fat milk to protein- and carbohydrate-rich food. The energy contained in mouse milk is mainly due to the high fat content, which is characterized by fatty acids of different carbon chain lengths ranging from 4 to 18 (Hahn and Koldovsk&#x000fd;, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>; G&#x000f6;rs et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), but primarily of medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) with carbon chain lengths from 6 to 12 and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) with a chain length of more than 12. For suckling mice, the MCFAs seem to be particularly important since they are highly hydrolysable and represent a rapidly absorbable source of energy (St-Onge and Jones, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Thus, during the first 3 postnatal weeks, the stomach mucosa has to deal with nutrients within the milk, most notably fatty acids. Since the gastric processing of the ingesta as well as the regulation of food intake is dependent on the nutrient composition of the ingested food, it is a prerequisite that the gastric mucosa is capable to sense nutrients in the luminal content (Psichas et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that nutrient sensing in the stomach during the suckling phase strongly relies on receptors which recognize fatty acids and that fatty acid receptors may be less relevant later on when the mice ingest protein- and carbohydrate-rich food. Candidate receptors for MCFAs and LCFAs are the G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) GPR84 and GPR120 (FFAR4), which respond to fatty acids with a chain length of C9&#x02013;C14 and C14&#x02013;C22, respectively (Hirasawa et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Tanaka et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Hence, in this study we analyzed the expression levels for the receptor types GPR84 and GPR120 in the gastric mucosa during different postnatal stages and characterized the cell types which express fatty acid receptors during the suckling phase and post-weaning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals and nutritional experiments</title><p>Studies were performed with C57/BL6J and GPR120-IRES-Cre/eR26-&#x003c4;GFP (Wen et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Kusumakshi, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) mouse pups.

In brief, quantitative changes in mRNA levels were detected using the Light Cycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The qPCR reaction mixture (10 &#x003bc;l) consisted of 2 &#x000d7; KAPA SYBR Fast qPCR Master Mix (Peqlab Biotechnologie, Erlangen, Germany) and primer sets. Relative amounts of GPR84 and GPR120 transcripts were normalized to the expression of L8 which remained constant in all samples. Each assay included (in triplicate): for GPR84 6&#x02013;7.5 ng of each tested cDNA, for GPR120 and for L8 a 1:10 cDNA dilution and a non-template control reaction. The following qPCR protocol was used: 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s, 60&#x000b0;C (for GPR120), or 65&#x000b0;C (for GPR84) for 15 s, 72&#x000b0;C for 8 s with 45 cycles. Then, a melting curve analysis was included to ensure that only a single, specific amplicon had been produced. Amplification of only one product was additionally confirmed by agarose electrophoresis.

These cells were more elongated and sometimes of triangular shape (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Besides invaginations with an apparent base and top distribution of GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP cells, some gastric glands displayed additional labeled cells which were scattered throughout the entire tissue (data not shown). These invaginations likely represent mucous glands reported to occur in distinct areas of the gastric mucosa (Lee et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). Within the surface epithelium, GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP immunoreactivity was confined to mostly small patches of goblet- and columnar-shaped cells. Single goblet-shaped GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP cells are visible in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;C</xref>. In distinct areas, especially along the lesser and greater curvature, larger groups of surface cells were also labeled (data not shown).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Localization and characterization of GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP-immunoreactive cells in the gastric glands at P14. <bold>(A)</bold> GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP cells are confined to basal and apical regions of glandular invaginations. <bold>(B)</bold> CgA positive cells reside in the lower half of the gastric mucosa. <bold>(C)</bold> Dual immunostaining demonstrates colocalization with CgA in a portion of endocrine cells (yellow arrows).

Double-labeling experiments for GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP and GPR84 revealed that some cells of the surface epithelium indeed expressed both fatty acid receptor types (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;C</xref>). Analyses of the distribution patterns showed that GPR84 cells were mostly arranged in larger groups of surface cells. Some of these cells were also GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP positive indicating that a subpopulation expresses both receptor types (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;C</xref>). While most of the double-labeled cells were columnar and goblet-shaped cells, very few cells were found that were small and pear-shaped instead (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D&#x02013;F</xref>). The notion that these cells may represent brush cells was supported by colabeling with the brush cell marker TRPM5 (data not shown). One striking observation was an unique structural feature of the goblet- and columnar-shaped cells. They comprised small vesicle-like or large vacuole-like structures in their cytoplasm. The latter cell type seems to be only present in the superficial layer of the stomach of breastfed mice and to disappear with weaning and it has been speculated that these cells may be capable to absorb lipid from the luminal content (Helander and Olivecrona, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>; Egelrud et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>; Keeley and Samuelson, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). This view is based on the observation that the apical cytoplasmic content of these cells can be labeled by a lipid-soluble dye (Keeley and Samuelson, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). To analyze whether the vesicular structure in the cytoplasm of GPR84-positive surface cells might in fact be lipid droplets, sections were probed with GPR84 and Nile red. The results depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> show, that a GPR84-immunoreactive cell comprises an oval cavity in its cytoplasm expanding above the nucleus. The content of this vacuole-like structure was stained by Nile red (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B,C</xref>). Among GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP cells only some contained large vacuole-like structures, while most of the cells contained smaller vesicular structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). The content of these vesicles was also stained by Nile red suggesting that they are filled with lipid (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E,F</xref>). These results support the notion that goblet-shaped cells may also absorb dietary fats as previously proposed for surface cells with large vacuoles (Keeley and Samuelson, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Consistent with a possible functional role of lipid-droplet containing surface cells in suckling stages, they disappeared with weaning as reported previously (Helander and Olivecrona, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>; Egelrud et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>; Keeley and Samuelson, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Accordingly, no Nile red staining was visible in weaned mice and immunoreactivity for GPR84 was also decreased in the superficial layer (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G&#x02013;I</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Visualization of distinct surface cell types expressing GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP and GPR84. <bold>(A)</bold> A goblet-shaped cell with a large oval apical vacuole-like structure and an adjacent slender columnar cell display different signal intensities for GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP (arrowheads). <bold>(B)</bold> A patch of GPR84-positive surface cells is marked by asterisks. <bold>(C)</bold> Merged image shows the localization of GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP cells belonging to a patch of GPR84-expressing surface cells. <bold>(D&#x02013;F)</bold> A pear-shaped cell with an apical thickening (arrowhead) typical for brush cells is immunoreactive for GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP (<bold>D</bold>, green) and GPR84 (<bold>E</bold>, red).

Thus, we finally determined whether fatty acid receptor-expressing cells colocalize with these endocrine cell types. In 2-week-old mice, immunostaining for ghrelin, accounting for almost half of the CgA-positive cells, revealed an almost complete overlap with GPR84 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;C</xref>), but less than one-half of the ghrelin cells colocalized with GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G&#x02013;I</xref>). Labeling for somatostatin revealed that some, but not all somatostatin cells showed immunoreactivity for GPR84 and GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D&#x02013;F,J&#x02013;L</xref>). Due to the great overlap of GPR84 with CgA and ghrelin in suckling mice, we assessed the percentage of colocalization in the suckling stage and compared it to that of weaned mice. The analysis revealed robust changes in the frequencies of colabeling between the two developmental periods. Although the number of CgA and ghrelin cells increased during maturation, the percentage of colocalization of GPR84 with CgA and ghrelin declined (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref>). In contrast, for GPR120 a marked increase in the percentage of overlap with CgA and ghrelin was observed during maturation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C,D</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Characterization of GPR84 and GPR120-&#x003c4;GFP endocrine cells in suckling mice.

In contrast to the protein- and carbohydrate-rich solid food after weaning, the suckling mouse pups entirely depend on high fat milk. A high proportion of the triglycerides in murine milk contain MCFAs which seem to be particularly important for the pups since they represent a rapidly absorbable source for energy expenditure (St-Onge and Jones, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The hypothesis that, due to the importance of the fatty acids during the suckling phase, the stomach mucosa of mouse pups may express receptor types for fatty acid sensing is supported by the results of this study. High levels of mRNA for the fatty acid receptors GPR84 and GPR120 were found in the suckling stages, which declined during weaning and reached low levels when weaning was completed. Although the functional role of fatty acid receptors in the stomach of suckling pups is elusive, it is conceivable that they may be involved in regulating fat-associated absorptive and/or secretory processes.</p><p>During the suckling phase staining for GPR84 appeared along the luminal surface of the stomach and was confined to numerous lipid droplet containing columnar- and goblet-shaped cells, GPR120 to some. This type of surface cell is only present during the suckling phase and supposedly directly absorbs the dietary lipids from the luminal content (Helander and Olivecrona, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>; Keeley and Samuelson, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Interestingly, it has been described that in suckling rats, especially the MCFAs are taken up by the stomach mucosa (Egelrud et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>). Thus, the abundant expression of the receptor for MCFAs in surface cells coincides with the presumed absorptive properties of the stomach during the suckling phase. Moreover, surface cells with large lipid droplets also contain high concentrations of the fatty acid binding protein L-FABP during the suckling period and low levels in the weaning phase (Iseki et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). Although, it has to be clarified whether fatty acid receptors and binding proteins are in fact expressed in the same cell, one might speculate that an interplay of binding proteins and receptors might facilitate the uptake capacity for fatty acids by surface cells. The reduced level of fat in the ingesta after weaning implies a diminished absorption of lipid by surface cells in the stomach. This notion is in accordance with the observation that lipid droplets and labeling for the fatty acid receptor GPR84 in surface cells almost disappeared after weaning. These results are in line with the finding that surface cells with large lipid droplets are replaced by Muc5A producing cells during the weaning period (Keeley and Samuelson, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>The results of our study indicate that in the suckling phase the ghrelin X/A-like cells account for nearly half of the enteroendocrine cells in the stomach and almost all of them express the receptor for medium chain fatty acids GPR84. This observation is in line with the notable role of MCFAs for the nutrition of mouse pups in the suckling phase, since they are highly hydrolysable and represent a major source for energy expenditure (St-Onge and Jones, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that the concentration of MCFAs in the gastric lumen may be an important parameter for controlling the secretion of the hormone ghrelin, which is an essential molecular signal for initiating food intake and inducing the release of growth hormone (Kojima et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Nakazato et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; De Vriese and Delporte, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Clearly, for such a scenario it is essential that X/A-like cells are capable to sense the concentration of MCFAs in the luminal content by having the appropriate receptor type. In this context, it is interesting to note that recent studies demonstrated that MCFAs can specifically affect X/A-like cells and lead to increased levels of acylated ghrelin in the stomach (Nishi et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Janssen et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The notion that the effects of MCFAs on ghrelin signaling are particularly important in the suckling phase is supported by the observation that in the post-weaning period the proportion of ghrelin cells, which express the receptor GPR84, is significantly declined, whereas the proportion of ghrelin cells, which express the receptor GPR120 for LCFAs, is increased. The change of overlap of receptor types in X/A-like cells during the weaning phase may foremost be an adaptive consequence of the greatly different composition of the solid food after weaning. In addition, the expression of GPR120 in X/A-like cells may have important functional implications, since LCFAs in the luminal content of the stomach cause a reduced level of ghrelin, an effect depending on the activation of GPR120 (Janssen et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lu et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Gong et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Thus, the effect of fatty acids on gastric ghrelin secretion might be dependent on the length of the hydrocarbon chain (Feltrin et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Medium chain fatty acids enhance the secretion of ghrelin, while LCFAs diminish ghrelin release. The different choice of receptor types in X/A-like cells during the suckling phase (GPR84) and the post-weaning phase (GPR120) not only reflects changes in the composition of ingesta, but also points to some fundamental changes in the functional role of ghrelin signals in the course of the weaning process. In this context, it is worth mentioning that ghrelin has a dual action on both growth hormone secretion and food intake; it can therefore be considered as a bridge connecting somatic growth and body composition with energy metabolism (Cami&#x000f1;a et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), aspects which are particularly relevant during the weaning process.</p><p>In conclusion, the transition from feeding exclusively on high fat milk to protein- and carbohydrate-rich solid food coincides with significant changes in the stomach mucosa including morphological modifications and variations in the repertoire of distinct cell types. At the molecular level&#x02014;focusing in this study on receptors for fatty acids&#x02014;there are distinct changes in the expression level but also in the receptor-expressing cell types; all the alterations seem to precisely match the physiological needs in the respective developmental stage.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors listed have made a substantial, direct, and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our gratitude to T.
