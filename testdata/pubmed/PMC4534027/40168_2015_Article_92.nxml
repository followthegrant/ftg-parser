It is paramount to develop optimal biostabilization of stool samples during collection and assess long-term storage for clinical specimens and epidemiological microbiome studies. We evaluated the effect of collection media and delayed freezing up to 7&#x000a0;days on microbial composition. Ten participants collected triplicate stool samples each into no media as well as RNAlater&#x000ae; with and without kanamycin or ciprofloxacin. For each set of conditions, triplicate samples were frozen on dry ice immediately (time = 0) or frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C after 3-days and 7-days incubation at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Microbiota metrics were estimated from Illumina MiSeq sequences of 16S rRNA gene fragments (V3&#x02013;V4 region). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) across triplicates, collection media, and incubation time were estimated for taxonomy and alpha and beta diversity metrics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RNAlater&#x000ae; alone yielded the highest ICCs for diversity metrics at time = 0 [ICC median 0.935 (range 0.89&#x02013;0.97)], but ICCs varied greatly (range 0.44&#x02013;1.0) for taxa with relative abundances &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;%. The 3- and 7-day freezing delays were generally associated with stable beta diversity for all three media conditions. Freezing delay caused increased variance for Shannon index (median ICC 0.77) and especially for observed species abundance (median ICC 0.47). Variance in observed species abundance and in phylogenetic distance whole tree was similarly increased with a 7-day delay. Antibiotics did not mitigate variance. No media had inferior ICCs at time 0 and differed markedly from any media in microbiome composition (e.g., <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01 for relative abundance of Bacteroidetes).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bacterial community composition was stable for 7&#x000a0;days at room temperature in RNAlater&#x000ae; alone. RNAlater&#x000ae; provides some stability for beta diversity analyses, but analyses of rare taxa will be inaccurate if specimens are not frozen immediately. RNAlater&#x000ae; could be used as collection media with minimal change in the microbiota composition.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Relationships between the gut bacteria and health are not new, but an emerging concept is that altered functions of the bacterial community contribute to disease development collectively, rather than through the action of specific pathogenic members. Next generation sequencing approaches have provided powerful tools to study associations of the human microbiome with disease. Interesting associations of microbiota and disease have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but their etiologic significance has not been assessed in well-powered case&#x02013;control or prospective epidemiological studies. To move the field of human microbiome research forward both for clinical purposes and in epidemiological research, validated methods are needed for collecting specimens that represent, as closely as possible, the true <italic>in vivo</italic> parameters and to understand any technical variation that can be introduced. For large population-based microbiome studies, specimen collection methods must be acceptable to participants and, most importantly, tolerant of suboptimal field conditions. If optimal collection and storage conditions (i.e. immediate freezing and storage at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C) are not possible, systematic bias can be introduced in preprocessing steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, it is imperative to minimize possible artifacts by developing and validating collection methods than can be easily implementable for both clinical uses and for large field-based epidemiologic studies.</p><p>Analysis of microbial diversity in human specimens poses important challenges, especially and particularly for field epidemiological studies where a cold chain cannot always be maintained or assured from sample collection to freezer storage. Specimens collected in the field may often spend various amounts of time at room temperature, followed by shipment on frozen gel packs (4 &#x000b0;C) or dry ice to a central laboratory for processing or storage. Fecal samples may not be representative of the whole gastrointestinal (GI) tract or specific loci within the GI, but a recent study showed that it is the relative abundance of taxa that differs rather than the lack of representation in stool as compared to mucosa-associated microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For screening purposes stool could be used to detect and quantify putative bacterial species as biomarkers of microbiota associated carcinogenesis as in the case of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recent efforts to systematically evaluate and standardize post collection analysis of the microbiota will undoubtedly homogenize protocols and facilitate comparison among studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mbqc.org/">www.mbqc.org</ext-link>). However, few studies have evaluated the pre-analytical steps focusing on stability of the microbiome in stool samples collected under field conditions. Very few reports have focused on the impact of preservation medium, time and temperature on the microbial community structure and other microbiota metrics of alpha and beta diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. RNAlater&#x000ae; has been suggested as the preservative of choice to conserve the stability of nucleic acids, both DNA and RNA, in tissue and other biospecimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the sufficiency of RNAlater&#x000ae; alone to prevent differential growth of bacteria during typical delays in field studies is unknown. Addition of antibiotics that prevents either RNA transcription or protein translation may improve biostabilization. Previous reports have yielded inconsistent results for the effects of room temperature storage on DNA and RNA stability for microbial analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] As the microbiome field is advancing from descriptive to longitudinal or prospective studies, it is important to systematically evaluate the collection methods and the media used to biopreserve the microbiome integrity in stool. In this report, we describe a systematic evaluation of the effects of preservation media and storage conditions on the composition of the fecal microbiota as analyzed by 16S rRNA gene profiling (V3-V4 region) using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The objective of this study was to evaluate RNAlater as a biopreservative for large, population-based studies; a biopreservative for human microbiome analyses of stool samples that remain unfrozen for as long as seven days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reproducibility of microbiota metrics with no collection media and RNAlater-based collection media</title><p>We first compared the microbial composition of stool replicates collected without collection media to those collected with different media at time zero.

However, there is high heterogeneity in specimen collection methods in the literature and no consensus on methods to optimally stabilize specimens for microbial composition analysis. Our study found that human fecal specimens collected in RNAlater&#x000ae; yield highly reproducible microbiome composition (beta diversity) estimates, even if they were held up to 7 days at room temperature (25 &#x000b0;C) prior to freezing. Despite this, detection and relative abundances of rare taxa were altered by delayed freezing, irrespective of media, which highlights the potential for bias if specimens are not handled optimally.</p><p>To enhance stabilization of the microbiota ex vivo, we conducted preliminary experiments (not presented) of RNAlater&#x000ae; without and with individual and combined antibiotics. Of all the conditions tested, two antibiotics, kanamycin (through inhibition of protein synthesis) and ciprofloxacin (through inhibition of DNA replication) showed promising results when used at bactericidal concentration (data not shown). The current study built on these findings by supplementing RNAlater&#x000ae; with a bactericidal dose (300 &#x003bc;g/ml) of more than 10-fold the minimal inhibitory concentration of these two antibiotics, which we compared to RNAlater&#x000ae; alone. We found that adding antibiotics to RNAlater&#x000ae; did not yield more stable microbiota metrics in feces left at room temperature for 3 or 7 days. In fact, RNAlater&#x000ae; alone had the highest ICC values for all major phyla for day 3 and was consistent over time (day 7). Irrespective of delayed freezing, the high reproducibility of independent replicates observed for overall composition of the bacterial communities (PCoA plots) suggests that relatively few replicates are needed with RNAlater&#x000ae; alone as the collection media. This finding has major implications with regard to large epidemiologic studies since the cost of collecting and storing multiple aliquots could be substantially reduced.</p><p>Surprisingly, we observed statistically significant differences in the microbial composition of the same stool sample in aliquots collected in RNAlater&#x000ae;-based collection media compared to no media. All samples underwent the same extraction method, but our results indicate a major reduction in relative abundances of Bacteroides in stool samples collected without collection media. The no media condition also had inferior ICCs, which was severe for reproducibility of relative abundance for Bacteroidetes (ICC 0.71), and also notable for alpha diversity estimates and some beta diversity estimates (PCoA scores). It is possible that the thawing process of stool stored without collection media affect the integrity of members of the phylum Bacteroides. Perhaps such stool samples stored without collection media needs a special digestion step after thawing, or requires the immediate inhibition of potential nucleases that are liberated during thawing.</p><p>Other studies have determined the effect of storage parameters with stool samples used for microbial genomic analysis. However, these studies focused on measuring the quality and quantity of extracted DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the effect of room temperature on stool with no preservation media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the robustness of pyrosequencing using stool samples stored in different conditions and DNA extraction methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], or the effect of temperature incubation (including freezing) on measures of bacterial communities in sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Lauber et al. reported on the stability of stool biospecimens for microbiome analysis using 16SrRNA gene sequencing. In that study, the stool samples were left at room temperature without storage media for up to two weeks and found the condition satisfactory for microbial community analysis even after this prolonged period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, because no storage media were tested in that study, it is not possible to evaluate if the differences we observed were stable over time. In addition, while we did not test the stability over time without storage media, our results also show stability of microbial community composition for up to 7 days in RNAlater&#x000ae;. Different mechanisms may contribute to stability. In Lauber et al., the stool was aliquoted using cotton swabs with no preservation media and only DNA was analyzed. The cotton swab may have acted as a desiccant for the stool, thus preventing further bacterial growth during the incubation period. In our study, the RNAlater&#x000ae; solution, being a liquid media, may diffuse more easily to the core of the specimen given proper mixing, and is believed to act as both DNA and RNA stabilizer and inactivate nucleases when specimens are thawed before extraction. In addition, RNAlater&#x000ae; is design to enable measures of RNA transcripts and thus increase its utility for future epidemiologic studies.</p><p>Of interest, a recent report by Cardona et al. suggests that DNA and RNA from stool samples may degrade at room temperature even if collected in RNAlater&#x000ae; affecting the composition of the microbiota for meta-genomic and -transcriptomic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is unclear, however, if the observed degradation of RNA in samples collected with RNAlater&#x000ae; also corresponds to changes in DNA integrity and microbial classification since stool samples collected with RNAlater&#x000ae; were not used for microbial taxonomic analysis. Our results showed that RNAlater&#x000ae; alone provides sufficient stability for taxonomic analyses of bacterial DNA from stool specimens even if left at room temperature for up to 7 days.</p><p>The major limitations of our study are its small size, with only 10 participants, and exclusive focus on how delayed freezing and selected media affect the fecal microbiome. Nonetheless, these issues are critically important for large epidemiologic field studies. These were rigorously evaluated with state-of-the-art microbiome laboratory and analysis methods. Without question, more research is needed on other factors that can affect statistical power and bias, including handling, storing, and thawing of specimens, microbial cell lysis, nucleic acid extraction, robustness of sequencing platforms, and classification and quantification of microbial taxa. The inclusion of mock communities that are site-specific would be necessary in future studies of the microbiome, especially those using clinical specimens, to validate the methodology in the analysis of microbial communities. As reported in a recent study by Hang and colleagues, such mock communities have been developed and evaluated for thermal stability with the aim to be used as reference for microbiome studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The technological advancements in sequencing over the last 20 years have revolutionized our conceptual framework of microbiota and host interactions. Assessment of bacterial composition and specific bacterial functions can be used as a powerful tool to understand their role in health and disease risk. As a step to help move the microbiome field to epidemiological studies, herein we evaluated parameters of microbiome stability and effects of delayed freezing and collection media on bacterial community structure based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Our data suggest that RNAlater&#x000ae; alone effectively preserves the composition of the fecal microbial community for up to 7 days at room temperature, implying that it could be used for population-based studies in field settings. The high ICC observed suggests that fewer replicates can be collected thus saving costs and storage space. Independent validation is needed, as is expansion to understand extreme environments and possible artifactual effects on microbial gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study participants</title><p>Ten healthy volunteers (8 male and 2 female) were aged between 34&#x02013;61 [mean 44.2].

Shannon index is a conservative alpha diversity estimate that adjusts for the relative abundance (proportion) of each taxon.
