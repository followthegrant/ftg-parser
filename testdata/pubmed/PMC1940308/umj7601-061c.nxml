With a BMI of 21.4 it might be regarded as a lightweight but the Book Mass Index is deceiving; the volume has been handsomely produced and there are rich pickings inside. The subtitle reflects the editors' belief that the most important use of a collection of medical quotations is &#x0201c;seeing, in brief, what views&#x02014;of physicians and patients, of diseases and treatments&#x02014;were held in other times and places.&#x0201d; They justify this new publication by suggesting that previous collections of quotations did not fully cover the growth of concepts of normal bodily functions and diseases over the past two millennia, did not always give a complete reference to the source, and, of course, have not been able to record more recent discoveries and thoughts. The editors compare the present collection to a mosaic with a still recognisable image despite only some chips being in place and the rest missing. They discuss their selection criteria in the Introduction and acknowledge that they may have erred, sometimes in one direction by omitting a quotation which should have been included, and sometimes in the other. There will be no specific criticism in this review on either count except to say that while it was very pleasing to find a mention of Axel Munthe, it was surprising to find that his comment on the rapidity with which the faculty of medicine in Paris invented a new fashionable diagnosis of colitis (to replace the old one of appendicitis, then being cured by appendicectomy) was the only entry on the subject of colitis. The editors confess that because of their own background, quotations relating to internal medicine and neurology may be over-represented, but they invite readers to submit their own favourites for a third edition, taking care to give full bibliographic information. Time perhaps for those who feel their speciality has been neglected to start writing in.</p><p>The 3521 quotations have been grouped in perhaps 1000 topics arranged alphabetically from the &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; of <italic>Abetalipoproteinemia</italic> to the &#x0201c;Z&#x0201d; of <italic>Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome</italic>. Some topics are specific and contain only a single quotation, others such as <italic>Patient-Physician Relations</italic> contain many more. Within each topic the quotations are placed in order of date to allow a chronological overview of the topic's development. Confusingly, however, entries for one organ and its diseases may be distributed between a number of different topics with no direct cross-referencing between them; see, for example, <italic>Hyperthyroidism, Hypothyroidism</italic>, and <italic>Thyroid Gland</italic>. Some eponymous conditions such as <italic>Colles Fracture</italic>, <italic>Kaposi Sarcoma</italic>, and <italic>Sj&#x000f6;gren Syndrome</italic> are listed under their eponym, while Wilson disease appears under <italic>Hepatolenticular Degeneration (Wilson Disease)</italic>. Some quotations (427 and 2190, and 1699 and 2447) are duplicates. The <italic>Student BMJ</italic> is quoted on the dust jacket as saying &#x0201c;One of few reference books that are worth reading from cover to cover&#x0201d; but perhaps this was written with tongue in cheek, and it is likely that readers will mostly browse the collection, either completely at random or concentrating on topics of interest. Those seeking a particular quotation could usefully first search the topic list but there are in addition an author-citation index and a subject index. The author-citation index is an alphabetical list of authors, each author's entry containing a list of citations for their quotations, each citation ending with the title of the topic in which the quotation appears and the quotation number. Curiously, the citations within each entry are listed alphabetically not by topic but by their first words. By and large this index seems to be satisfactory; if an author is known the quotation can be found although a large number of topics might need to be searched for oft quoted authors such as William Osler. The subject index may seem to be comprehensive but there are significant gaps. For example, &#x0201c;Kussmaul's breathing&#x0201d; cannot be found by searching for <bold>Kussmaul, breathing, dyspnoea, diabetes mellitus, acidosis</bold>, or <bold>ketoacidosis</bold>; and the quotation &#x0201c;There is no body cavity that cannot be reached with a #14 needle and a good strong arm&#x0201d; cannot be found by searching for <bold>body, cavity, needle, aspiration</bold>, or <bold>arm</bold>. (Both quotations, 727 and 2226 respectively, are traceable via the topics list under <italic>Diabetes Mellitus</italic> and <italic>Needle Aspiration</italic> or via the author-citation index under Kussmaul and Shem.) A quotation for what would now be called ankylosing spondylitis (2913) is to be found in the topic <italic>Rheumatoid Spondylitis</italic> but neither <bold>ankylosing</bold> nor <bold>spondylitis</bold> appear as headings in the subject index, and the only entry under <bold>rheumatoid</bold> is for the arthritis. The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations (revised fourth edition) has about four index entries to one quotation; the ratio for Medicine in Quotations is about two to one, indicating a lesser degree of cross-referencing. The claim on the back cover that the subject index is &#x0201c;exhaustive&#x0201d; seems optimistic.</p><p>The interest in this book, however, lies in the quotations themselves, and what a feast there is. The editors write &#x0201c;Among the quotations here, you may find your convictions stated with a clarity and strength that reinforce your sense of what is right&#x02014;or perhaps you will come across opposing or differing views that encourage thoughtful reconsideration.&#x0201d; An example of differing views would be those of William Osler who said &#x0201c;ask no leading questions&#x0201d; (1876), and Paul Wood who said &#x0201c;The best history-taker is he who can best interpret the answer to a leading question&#x0201d; (1880). Many quotations deal with facts: the observation of goitre developing in rabbits fed only on cabbage for greens leading to the thiouracil drugs (3295); the discovery of the sino-atrial node (3068); the discovery of a living trypanosoma in the cerebro-spinal fluid in a patient with sleeping sickness (3078); and the description of the stiff-person syndrome (3173). Some are humorous: &#x0201c;Take the case of an aurist. You think he lives by dealing with obscure and difficult middle and internal ear cases. Nothing of the kind. He lives on wax&#x0201d; (3110). Perhaps most interesting are the centuries-old descriptions: of epilepsy (969); of tetanus (3284); and of dissipation in modern life c. 2550 BC (1168). For topics from <italic>Curling Ulcer</italic> to <italic>Native American Medicine</italic>, from <italic>Adrenergic Receptors</italic> to <italic>Physician-Assisted Suicide</italic>, from <italic>Homeopathy</italic> to <italic>Vinblastine</italic>, someone, somewhere, at some time, has recorded a note, an observation, or a bon mot. This book is interesting, useful and entertaining. It is a pity that the subject index is not as comprehensive as it could be.</p></body></article>
