Currently, it has assumed so significant role that it is under discussion its inclusion
as one of post-2015 millennium development goals<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Ensuring universal access is extremely relevant for human life and it
means a great challenge for the countries and professionals of this field<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. </p><p>The meaning of access to the health actions and services that people need involves
values such as justice and equity, which could not be incorporated into the concept of
coverage. The universal coverage concept often refers to the amount of the population
covered by health services, which does not mean that this number of people use the
service or that the health service is able to meet the multiple and complex health
needs<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The work of health professionals lies in the service sector, involves a relationship
between subjects of the same nature (human beings), and the work outcomes depends on
collaboration between those who care and those who are cared. Furthermore, like the work
of other sectors of the economy, it is heavily influenced by specific conditions under
which it is performed; the manner in which it's done and under what work conditions and
labor relations<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The special characteristics of work in health care and the importance of workforce for
its development are recognized by the Global Health Workforce Alliance and World Health
Organization (WHO). In the debate on coverage and universal access, these organizations
prepared a report in which they state "A universal truth: no health without a
workforce"<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. </p><p>Therefore, to achieve the goal of universal access to health it is necessary to focus on
who does the work, how it is performed and under what conditions, in different
historical and social scenarios. In this sense, the analysis of the workloads present in
the way of working is a promising way to guide the provision of care to users/patients,
and thus improve the quality of access to health services.</p><p>Workloads are elements found in the work process that synthesize the mediation between
work and wear of the worker. Workloads interact with each other and with the body of who
does the work. They do not act individually, but in combination with each other and
determine the condition in which the worker faces the global logic of the labor
process<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In Brazil, from the creation of the National Unified Health System (SUS), the principle
of universality has been strengthened by defining, in the Federal Constitution, that
health is a universal right and a duty of the state and one component of the quality of
life. Health has been regarded as a fundamental right of the citizen and a duty of the
three spheres of government. This system has the universality, equity and
comprehensiveness as its doctrinal proposition and, from 1990; aims to promote changes
in the hegemonic care model based on the biomedicine assumptions. The Family Health
Strategy (FHS) has an important role in this scenario. </p><p>The FHS is part of the National Primary Care Policy and adopts principles of the Primary
Health Care (PHC), formulated in the World Health Organization conference, held in Alma
Ata, in 1978. The PHC has been reaffirmed as strategic for universal access to health
services<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. </p><p>The FHS has been growing significantly in Brazil and, in March 2015, 37,944 family
health teams had been deployed in 5,319 municipalities, with a national population
coverage of 60.56%, which represents almost 118 million people<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The FHS has expanded the access to health services and strengthened the principle of
universality. Nonetheless, the country is still facing serious problems to ensure
universal access, equitable and comprehensive to all individuals<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. </p><p>The way of doing the work, as well as the complexity of the work environments and
conditions available for its completion, interferes with the quality and safety of the
health care results at all levels of care<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The nursing team represents the largest category among healthcare
professionals and plays a central role in health services and in the assurance of users'
safety<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. </p><p>In the FHS, nursing professionals are present in all teams and their work has an impact
on the quality of care. Thus, to identify the workloads present in their routine helps
to guide managers in the strengthening of positive factors and in the search for actions
to reduce them, contributing to the viability of universal access. </p><p>Although nursing is essential for access and operation of health services, there are
still major imbalances and gaps in the availability, distribution, composition,
qualification and productivity of nursing professionals, which has implications in terms
of quality and safety of services provided. Excessive workloads in the daily routine of
the services, worsened by poor working conditions negatively affect the results,
satisfaction and health of these professionals<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Literature points out complex internal and external challenges to the
profession as well as challenges at other levels such as historical, cultural, gender
and field knowledge and fighting for appreciation of the important role that nursing
plays in the health system<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study was based on the observation that health workforce is critical to achieving
universal access and that the FHS is the preferred policy to achieve this goal and, in
this context, nursing plays a relevant role in the healthcare sector and in the FHS.
Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify the workloads of nursing
professionals of the Family Health Strategy, analyzing their implications for the
effectiveness of universal access <bold>.</bold>
</p><p>For the analysis of the research results, theoretical approaches of labor
process<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup> and workloads<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<sup>)</sup> were associated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This is a qualitative study, in which it was used methodological triangulation with data

professionals working in the FHS teams that were distinguished by developing a good
quality work, according to the information supplied by the managers; at least one
municipality per region; and only FHS teams that had a core team of professionals
recommended by the Ministry of Health. It was excluded those professionals who worked in
the care units of mixed type. The care units of mixed type include both teams working in
the Family Health Strategy teams and teams working on traditional mode. </p><p>Data were collected from November 2010 to February 2013, in the FHS teams from three

</p><p>This study included 23 nursing professionals, of which nine were nurses, 13 nursing
technicians and a nursing assistant, who worked in ten health teams of five
municipalities in total. The number of participants was considered sufficient according
to the data saturation criterion, i.e, the inclusion of new participants and teams was
suspended when no new explanations, interpretations or descriptions of the phenomenon
studied were found.</p><p>Among the participants, most were women (87%; n=20); aged between 30 and 49 years (61%;
n=14); professional experience of at least 5 years (70%; n=16) and experience in the FHS
from one to five years (61%; n=14). Regarding the employment contract, there was a
strong predominance of permanently assigned employees (70%; n=16) with working hours of
40 hours per week (87%; n=20). </p><p>Semi structured interviews followed a script that has been tested and is composed of
closed and open questions. The questions aimed, primarily, to characterize the profile
of the participants, and to identify the sources and implications of workloads on the
professionals composing the FHS. The observations of the work context and document
analysis also followed a script and the first were described in field diaries. The
scripts included the information gathering on the sources of increases in workloads
observed by researchers, details about the labor process and work tools, way of
assisting the users/patients and documents informing about routines, physical structure
and flow of care in the units.</p><p>For the analysis, it was used resources of the Atlas.ti 7.0 software and principles of
the Thematic Content Analysis. In the pre-analysis stage, a storage file [Hermeneutic
Unit] was created using the Atlas.ti software, in which the survey data obtained from
interviews and observation [Primary Documents] was entered. A specific number was
assigned to each interview [<italic>document</italic>]. Data exploration included the
selection/trimming of the meaning units [<italic>quotations</italic>], creation and
assignment of codes [<italic>codes</italic>], and these codes were grouped into
categories [<italic>families</italic>]. Finally, during the interpretation process, it
has been made associations among<italic>quotations</italic>, <italic>codes</italic>
and<italic>families</italic>, generating display networks
[<italic>networks</italic>], which were extracted from the software and presented in the
results. It is important to emphasize that the analysis process, in all its stages, was
based on a cyclical triad, namely: empirical data, theoretical foundation and perception
of the researchers about the studied phenomenon. </p><p>The ethical precepts internationally recommended for developing research involving human
beings were respected. The project was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human
Research of the Federal University of Santa Catarina, under protocol number 971,
approved on October 25, 2010. </p><p>The research was authorised by the institutions involved and it was asked to all
participants to sign of the Informed Consent (IC). To these, it was guaranteed the right
to information, to withdraw from the study at any stage and anonymity. The speeches were
identified by the first letter of the professional category (N and Nt to nurse and
nursing technician, respectively) followed by the first letter of the data collection
region (S, C and N to designate the South, Central West and North) and by a serial
number. The observation note was identified followed by the first letter of the
region.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The results were sorted into two analytical categories: way of working in the FHS and
increase in the workloads and way of working in the FHS and reduction of the workloads.
</p></sec><sec><title>Way of working in the FHS and increase in the workloads of the nursing
professionals</title><p>With regard to the increase in the workloads, in all three regions of the country, the
major components identified are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>,
created by using the Atlas.ti software.</p><p>
<fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>- Main elements which increase the workloads of the nursing
professionals</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="0104-1169-rlae-0992-2682-gf01"/></fig>
</p><p>Among the main elements that increase the workloads are problems related to working
conditions, which have strong association with management. Among them, it is emphasized:
work overload; excess of demand; deficits in physical infrastructure; failures in the
proper functioning of the care network of National Unified Health Service (SUS);
dissatisfaction with the wages, considered to be insufficient, and working hours
perceived as excessive; lack of qualified human resources and the overload caused by
carrying out administrative tasks. </p><p>In the three regions of the country, the workload associated with excess of demand and
territory overestimated were the most significant elements for the increase in the
workloads of the nursing professionals, as illustrated by the following report. </p><p>
<italic>The workload gets intense; it&#x000b4;s too much service to be carried out at the same
time, we often leave work so tired and still under the impression that we did not
accomplish all that was under our responsibility. We have to do home care, we have to
do screening, we have to carry out technical procedures within the unit, we cannot
leave the doctor alone since he always needs us around and we are only two nursing
technicians. If we go out to do the dressings at home, our colleague stands alone in
the health unit to solve what it was already impossible to be solved by two
professionals. It is inhuman to leave the colleague on his own; we go out with a
guilty conscience</italic> (NtC2).</p><p>
<italic>And we go on with the same team to assist the families of our areas and others
that are discovered</italic> (NN1).</p><p>[...] <italic>my team is incomplete, lacking a nursing technique, I have been working
only with a nurse and a doctor in my team. I am alone, so this complicates matters.
The work intensifies, so we cannot do the work the way we want due to the lack of a
nursing technician</italic> (NtS2).</p><p>Failures in the care network and in the organizational and physical infrastructure have
also been very significant, producing increase in the workloads, as shown in the
following reports.</p><p>
<italic>Sometimes the patient's problem resolution depends on other administrative
levels and then it gets jammed. Such situation frustrates us. We get to know the
patient's problem and try to help, seeking ways to do it, but we know that what we
could do has already been done</italic> [...]. <italic>If references are necessary,
we know that they exist, and we seek them, but no one knows where they are.</italic>
[...] <italic>and, besides that, these sectors are not committed to help</italic>
(NtC5).</p><p>[...] <italic>the lack of a counter-reference</italic> [...] <italic>a follow up of that
user/patient. I refer the patient to a specialist, to some medical specialty, but I
do not get any counter-reference, so I do not know what to do</italic>
(tense)<italic>. I know he has been to the doctor, but I do not know the further
steps that should be taken</italic> [...] <italic>I get no feedback. It makes me very
tired, very angry ... it is like an unfinished bridge</italic>[...]<italic>. That to
me is a very bad signal</italic> [...]. <italic>Our infrastructure is one of the
city's best, still, it is completely inadequate. In the winter, it is extremely cold
and in the summer, it is too warm. This dissatisfaction has led me to use
medications, I am fine now, but I used to seek answers to questions that I could not
understand, I'm in therapy</italic>(NS2).</p><p>
<italic>There is a room, without minimum requirements, where the pathology technician
works. She is responsible for collecting material for the tests ordered by the
medical teams. There is no sink in that room, no descartex for proper disposal of
cutting and perfure materials. It was improvised a "can of milk powder" for the
disposal of needles</italic> (OBSERVATION NOTE, C).</p><p>The nursing professionals mentioned the low salaries and excessive working hours as
cause of the increase in the workloads; however, salary was not mentioned in the Central
West region. </p><p>
<italic>The salary is low. Considering the stress level and the amount of work performed
by the professionals</italic> (NN1).</p><p>
<italic>The salary is not the ideal ... it is still low, but if it is compared with
other colleagues from other institutions, our salary is good</italic> (NS2).</p><p>
<italic>I am dissatisfied with the salary, there is no career path to nursing, we earn a
little more because we work eight hours day, although there is no difference because
it is a FHS. We work during two, four, six or more hours in the week and we get no
extra pay. The working hours, eight per day, do not satisfy, it would be better to
work six hours/day, this also to the user/patients,</italic> [...] <italic>many
families are no longer followed up, which is the intention of the FHS, due to the
operating schedule</italic>(NtS1).</p><p>Problems relating to the work subject were also significant, i.e, related to the
patients/users of the services. It was identified dissatisfaction of the users with the
services and difficulties of access, especially in relation to the most complex
services. Another triggering element of the increases in the workloads was the exposure
of professionals to urban violence. Often, the care units are located in violent
areas.</p><p>Way of working in the FHS and reduction of the workloads</p><p>With regard to the way of working in the FHS, considering the reduction of the
workloads, teamwork has been found as the most significant, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, which was generated by the Atlas.ti software
as shown below. </p><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>- Main elements which reduce the workload of the nursing
professionals</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="0104-1169-rlae-0992-2682-gf02"/></fig>
</p><p>Reports of nursing professionals show that teamwork, bond with the user, presence of the
Community Health Agents (CHA) and affinity for their work, contribute to the reduction
of the workloads. The first three components are part of what is prescribed for the FHS
and are associated with the <italic>code</italic>"affinity for their work", suggesting
that there is identity of health professionals with the care model of the FHS, which
contributes to the reduction of the workloads. It also contributed to the reduction of
the workloads: organization of work; respect for professional autonomy within the
collective work; achieving satisfactory results; recognition of the users, colleagues
and managers for the service provided, and good working relationships.</p><p>Teamwork was the main element to the reduction of the workloads. This protective aspect
of teamwork is shown in the following reports. </p><p>
<italic>Our team has a great affinity among all professionals</italic> [...]<italic>one
supports the other; we have integration, friendship, fellowship. Working partnership.
All defending the same purpose</italic> [...]. <italic>In addition,my coworker, the
other nursing technician is very friendly at work. She does not overburden me and we
do not transfer our responsability to another. We work in harmony</italic>
(NtC3).</p><p>
<italic>Teamwork is unique. Good relationship with the doctor, nursing technician and
with the CHA, the power of communication, dialogue, not only with the team of which
we are part, but also with the other team, so we are able do the work, because we
come together, one helps the other</italic> (NN2).</p><p>
<italic>It is positive, so we can work in partnership, all professionals</italic>[...]
<italic>we have meetings every Friday starting at 3 p.m., we discuss a lot with the
team about what has been done</italic> [...] <italic>from the point of view of the
community, what's good and what's not, what we understand from that, what is feasible
is changed. Therefore, there is an interaction, a very tight integration between the
members of the team</italic> (NS1).</p><p>In addition to teamwork, the relationship with the user and presence of the Community
Health Agents are elements that contributed to the reduction of the workloads, signaling
identity/affinity of the nursing professionals with the model of the FHS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, the results showed a predominance of situations that increase the
workloads of the nursing professionals. Among the elements that contributed to the
increase of the workloads, are several elements related to the working conditions and
management of the health system, of which the FHS is part. </p><p>The problem of working conditions has been repeatedly recognized as a serious problem in
the health field in Brazil and, particularly in nursing, including deficits in the
quantity and quality of the workforce, excessive working hours, deficits in the salary
and problems in the work environment<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Deficits in working conditions negatively influence the health of the
nursing professionals and results of the assistance provided by these
professionals<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With regard to the work overload, even considering the involvement of subjective
aspects, it was identified that there is a discrepancy between demand and team's
ability. Other aspects related to working conditions, identified in this research,
indicate that there are unsatisfactory objective conditions, which interact with each
other resulting in the increase in the workloads.</p><p>Overloaded nursing professionals that, in addition, perform their work in adverse
conditions tend to suffer damage to their health, which increases the work absenteeism,
resulting in greater overload on those who remain. This situation negatively influence
the effectiveness and quality of results in health care. The service might be available
and even represent that formally there is coverage, however, the population that uses
the service faces barriers and limited or inefficient care. </p><p>Another factor that contributed to the increase in the workloads were the problems in
the relationship of nursing professionals with users, in particular due to their unmet
needs and insecurity of these professionals to act in areas of violence.</p><p>Increased workloads cause dissatisfaction, wear and even illness on who does the work,
and difficulty to perform a creative and effective work, which interferes in the
possibilities to ensure access, from the perspective of a comprehensive care. </p><p>Universal access is related to providing assistance to the entire population at all
levels of the system<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, considering the complexity of the needs in health. It includes the
environment where the work is carried out, method of organizing work and how care is
provided, as well as the relationship established between professionals and users. It is
worth mentioning that health work is highly dependent on labor force<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, therefore any initiative in this field requires focusing on who performs
the work. </p><p>The absence of geographic, economic, socio-cultural, organizational or gender barriers
has been recognized as required for universal access<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In this study, it was identified economic, socio-cultural and
organizational barriers in the PHC scenario in the country, which has generated
increased workloads of the nursing professionals and hampered the effectiveness of the
FHS as a potentiating policy of universal access. </p><p>On the other hand, the elements that contribute to the reduction of the workloads, found
in this study, show that there is an affinity of the nursing professionals with this
kind of care model. Among these aspects are the teamwork, establishment of bond between
professionals and users and the presence of the CHA, which are the main elements of the
FHS. </p><p>Factors that contribute to the reduction of the workloads can contribute to the
permanence of professionals in this care model, since they are also positive for a
closer approximation with the way of working required in the FHS. FHS is inspired by the
PHC, internationally recognized as a strategy for achieving the universal access to
health<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. </p><p>The identity with the work and search for recognition and appreciation of the work,
reinforce the capacity to act of the collective, offering prospects of coping of the
adverse side of the work contexts. To believe that work has been carried out in the
"right way" promotes satisfaction and, even in inappropriate situations, helps in the
reduction of the workloads. </p><p>In Brazil, the definition of universal right to health and access to health services has
ocurred in a scenario of valuation of the citizens' rights, which occurred during the
implementation of the Federal Constitution in 1988. The current challenge relates to
dealing with complex problems arising from the demographic and epidemiological
transition and insufficient public investment in health<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Greater public investment in health can contribute to improving working
conditions, the operation of the network and hence universal access. FHS integrates the
SUS as a privileged strategy for its accomplishment; however, the everyday of services
has increased the workloads of the teams, which complicates their work, as well as the
resolution of the problems of the users.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>FHS adopts the principles of the PHC internationally recognized as central in the search
for equity and universal access. In this research, the nursing professionals recognized
these precepts as positive. However, deficits in the working conditions and in the
health system management have adversely affected the workloads, which hinders the
effectiveness of the FHS. Increased workloads, particularly the overload on the nursing
professionals, affect the efficiency and quality of care, the way the user is assisted
and cared in the health services and consequently, the quality of access. </p><p>In the contexts where the research was conducted, aspects that increase the workloads
contribute to hinder the access to the health services from the perspective of
universality, equity and resolution. The role prescribed for the family health teams is
extremely ample, requiring longitudinality in care, polyvalent knowledge and
professional training for an intersectoral intervention. </p><p>The research results show that it is necessary to invest in strategies that strengthen
the teamwork, professional autonomy of nursing professionals and incorporation of
technologies that contribute to the efficacy of care and reduction of the work overload.
These strategies may help to empower these professionals for their daily routine, as
well as to participate politically in the management of the healthcare services and
social control, aiming at the implementation of measures to strengthen the profession
and improve universal access.</p><p>These results also contribute to the development of the nursing as a healthcare
profession and as a discipline of scientific knowledge by providing knowledge about the
work of these professionals within the scope of the most significant public policies
prevailing in Brazil, which corresponds to the priority strategy of the WHO to universal
access.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that this study was carried out with an intentional sample, which
limits its generalization. However, it is important to note that even intentionally
including teams considered as of good quality, deficits in the working conditions and in
aspects related to the system management were significant. These findings suggest that
more studies in this same perspective might be promising for further investments in
health and advancement of knowledge in nursing and health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>For all participating institutions and individuals who have made possible this
