However, accurate estimates of the prevalence of sexual violence among in these populations remain uncertain.
Objective: Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of sexual violence among refugees and displaced persons in complex humanitarian emergencies.
Data Source: We conducted systematic review of relevant literature in multiple databases (EMBASE, CINAHL, and MEDLINE) through February 2013 to identify studies. We also reviewed reference lists of included articles to identify any missing sources.
Study Selection: Inclusion criteria required identification of sexual violence among refugees and internally displaced persons or those displaced by conflict in complex humanitarian settings. Studies were excluded if they did not provide female sexual violence prevalence, or that included only single case reports, anecdotes, and those that focused on displacement associated with natural disasters. After a review of 1175 citations 19 unique studies were selected.
Data Extraction: Two reviewers worked independently to identify final selection and a third reviewer adjudicated any differences. Descriptive and quantitative information was extracted; prevalence estimates were synthesized. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2.
Main Outcomes: The main outcome of interest was sexual violence among female refugees and internally displaced persons in complex humanitarian settings.
Results: The prevalence of sexual violence was estimated at 21.4% (95% CI, 14.9-28.7; I2=98.3%), using a random effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was noted with studies using probability sampling designs reporting lower prevalence of sexual violence (21.0%, 95% CI, 13.2-30.1; I2=98.6%), compared to lower quality studies (21.7%, 95% CI, 11.5-34.2; I2=97.4%). We could not rule out the presence of publication bias.
Conclusions: The findings suggest that approximately one in five refugees or displaced women in complex humanitarian settings experienced sexual violence. However, this is likely an underestimation of the true prevalence given the multiple existing barriers associated with disclosure. The long-term health and social consequences of sexual violence for women and their families necessitate strategies to improve identification of survivors of sexual violence and increase prevention and response interventions in these complex settings.

</p><p>Though there have been systematic reviews of gender-based violence<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and sexual violence,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> to our knowledge, there has been no published meta-analysis of prevalence of sexual violence among displaced populations that has attempted to combine and contrast the estimates from across these different studies. Our objective is to estimate the prevalence of sexual violence among refugees and internally displaced persons in complex humanitarian emergencies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>
<bold>Literature Search</bold>
</p><p>The meta-analysis was conducted according to a pre-specified protocol available from the investigators. We conducted an initial search on MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL in November 2010 using an enhanced filter in consultation with an information specialist. Details of our search strategy and terms are presented in the Online Supplement (<bold>Appendix 1</bold>). The search was optimized for sensitivity and specificity through key articles identified by experts. At the time of manuscript preparation, we updated the search on February 2013 and also evaluated the bibliographies of included studies for relevant publications.</p><p>We restricted our searches to studies published in English and developed a search strategy for MEDLINE based on medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and text words of key articles that we identified a priori. Studies were not included or excluded on the basis of design but were required to report (or have references) on their study design and methodologies utilized. Inclusion criteria required the description of an evaluation of a screening tool, strategy, survey, or program to identify sexual violence among refugees and IDPs or those displaced by conflict in complex humanitarian settings. We excluded studies that did not provide prevalence of sexual violence for females, or that included only single case reports, anecdotes, and those that focused on displacement associated with natural disasters. We excluded studies that focused on female genital mutilation as a form of sexual violence. We excluded studies in which it was unclear as to whether the study population was migrant or refugees or if the results were not stratified on the basis of migrant or refugee/IDP status. Two reviewers worked independently and in duplicate, to review titles, abstracts, and full text versions of identified reports. A third reviewer met to discuss and to adjudicate differences.</p><p>
<bold>Data Abstraction</bold>
</p><p>Following the search, duplicate publications were removed. Preliminary screening included a review of all titles and abstracts of identified studies from our searches, excluding those that failed to meet selection criteria. The remaining articles underwent full-text evaluation for inclusion eligibility. Data were abstracted from identified studies that reported the outcome measures of female-targeted sexual violence, prevalence estimates, and other associations.</p><p>
<bold>Study Characteristic<italic>s</italic></bold>
</p><p>We extracted information related to the study characteristics, including country where the study was conducted, country of origin of study population, participant age range, proportion of female participants within the study sample, and total sample size of female participants. We also extracted information that described the study design, including design sampling method, whether the target sample size was reached according to the study authors, non-response percentage. Characteristics of the instrument used to assess sexual violence were also collected, including if pilot testing of questionnaires was performed prior to data collection, the type of instrument(s) used, and validation measures (i.e. reporting of internal consistency, sensitivity, and specificity).</p><p>
<bold>Risk of bias</bold>
</p><p>In order to determine the risk of bias of studies, we evaluated whether reliability had been assessed and whether authors evaluated construct validity of the screening instruments. We also determined whether sampling was convenience or probability-based. We did not conduct quantitative tests for publication bias but assessed this qualitatively when relevant.</p><p>
<bold>Outcome Measure</bold>
</p><p>Sexual violence outcomes included reported rape, molestation, sexual abuse, genital mutilation, gang rape, marital rape, sexual violence related to exploitation, and sexual harassment, as reported by the authors. Though recognizing the importance of GBV on the health and well-being of displaced persons, we focused the search on sexual violence among female refugees and IDPs, as opposed to GBV, given the broad definition,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> interpretation, and variable measurement of GBV in these settings.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>
<bold>Data Synthesis</bold>
</p><p>Statistical analysis was conducted using StatsDirect (version 2.7.9). Statistical heterogeneity was tested and prevalence proportions were pooled using a fixed-effect model if heterogeneity was limited; a random-effects model was used when there was a significant heterogeneity among the studies.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Since heterogeneity was anticipated in these studies we considered the more conservative random-effects model as a more reliable estimate of the prevalence. To maintain similarity of sampling designs across the studies, we conducted sensitivity analyses to determine the robustness of the effect size when studies that had a defined sampling design were analyzed separately from those studies that reported non-probability based sampling methods. A conventional level of p&#x0003c;0.05 was utilized to assess significance. Our study was reported out according to the MOOSE Reporting instrument.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The protocol is available on request from the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present meta-analysis of 19 studies, we found the prevalence of sexual violence among female refugees and internally displaced persons across 14 countries affected by conflict to be 21.4%. The quantification of sexual violence among female refugees and IDPs in complex humanitarian emergencies is challenging.</p><p>Sexual violence is often under-reported. The social stigma associated with rape, shame and fear of reprisal are significant deterrents for survivors of sexual violence to report their traumatic experiences. Compounding social stigma is an often inadequate justice system response that fails to arrest or prosecute perpetrators, a law enforcement system that often mistreats and further victimizes survivors of sexual violence, and a lack of capacity of service providers across multiple systems to receive and give adequate attention to the various and complex needs of women who have been raped.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The cumulative effect is an inhospitable climate for survivors to come forth to disclose their experience and to seek help.

</p><p>The body of research aimed at understanding the prevalence of sexual violence among refugees and displaced populations in conflicts is exponentially more difficult to elucidate given the context and the sensitive subject matter. Not only is there difficulty in reaching the affected populations, but investigators also employ varying definitions and research methodologies to estimate prevalence of sexual violence. Even when taking into account the methodological issues, our finding provides evidence of the need for concerted action to address sexual violence among refugees and displaced populations in conflict settings. The estimated lifetime prevalence of sexual violence against women in non-conflict settings ranges from 10%-50% depending on the country and who is identified as the perpetrator (e.g. intimate partner vs. stranger).<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> In many countries where these estimates are collected in non-conflict setting, basic justice and law enforcement systems are in place. Situations of conflict and displacement may exacerbate existing gender based violence in families and communities and present new forms of violence (e.g. sexual slavery) against women and girls.<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Hence, the prevalence of sexual violence of 21.4% among refugees and IDPs still likely underestimates the true prevalence as many incidences of sexual violence in the setting of complex humanitarian emergencies, such as conflict, go unreported.</p><p>Similar to the recent systematic review by Stark and Ager,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> which focused on the prevalence of GBV in complex emergencies, the systematic review suggests a need for more uniform methods and common definitions in future research. Greater uniformity would yield deeper understanding of sexual violence among refugee and displaced populations. Adopting more consistent approaches, moreover, could potentially identify greater incidence of survivors of sexual violence.</p><p>In addition to the importance of determining prevalence, there is also a critical need to understand who the range of perpetrators may be, as well as the physical locations and settings in which sexual violence is likely to occur. More vigorous action is needed to prevent and to respond to sexual violence among refugees and displaced populations, identify methods to assist survivors, and hold perpetrators accountable. Potential steps include strengthening procedures for identifying survivors, such as the integration of routine GBV screening inquiry for women and girls in protection and health programs using a validated measure with trained providers; expanding prevention efforts using social norms perspectives, providing response services such as psychosocial services and livelihood programs for survivors;<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> building competency, compassion and collaboration among protection officers, health and other service providers, and police; and providing resources and political will to investigate and prosecute perpetrators.<bold/>
</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our analysis has limitations. Our search focused on peer-reviewed publications and searches of secondary sources. Our search may have exclude non-English articles and non peer-reviewed reports by humanitarian organizations. Although sexual violence is a global phenomenon, the search identified studies of refugees or displaced persons from predominantly African countries and thus limits the generalizability of our findings to other contexts. The results may be influenced by bias inherent in individual studies, particularly including social desirability bias that often accompanies self-reported responses to sensitive questions.<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Some studies evaluated violence and traumatic events that occurred in very distant past or did not report the time of the event, thus it is important to note that we cannot deduce estimates of temporality. Since there are no uniformly accepted measures of risk of bias assessments of cross-sectional studies, we developed our own assessment scale for this context. Additionally, some of the select 19 studies included in the final quantitative synthesis were not dedicated to assessing sexual violence but rather on other related topics in which sexual violence questions were included in the survey. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to compare the studies with the primary objective to measure sexual violence compared to studies with other primary objectives and we found no significant difference. The ideal study focused on assessing prevalence of sexual violence should include survey questions that are based on specific types and acts of sexual violence and delivered by trained interviewers in private confidential settings. As some of the studies were not dedicated studies focused on sexual violence and many of the studies did not detail how the questionnaires were administered, it is unclear how the final prevalence proportions reported were affected.</p><p>While this analysis focused on sexual violence among females, sexual violence among males exists and warrants future attention. Emerging reports have documented sexual and gender-based violence among male refugee and IDP populations <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>

However, this is likely an underestimation of the true prevalence given the multiple existing barriers associated with disclosure. The long-term health and social consequences of sexual violence for women and their families necessitate strategies to improve identification of survivors of sexual violence and increase prevention and response interventions in these complex settings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thanks are due to the Center for Public Health and Human Rights for its ongoing support of this research.
