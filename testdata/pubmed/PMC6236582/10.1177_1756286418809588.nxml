involvement. Interestingly, these three boys with phenotypically different
nmDMD provide useful information regarding future therapeutic
recommendations for the ataluren administration in real clinical

characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy due to the absence of
functioning dystrophin, and premature death due to cardiac or respiratory
failure.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr3-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In approximately
10&#x02013;15% of cases, the condition is caused by a nonsense mutation (nmDMD) in the gene
encoding dystrophin, resulting in a premature stop codon in mRNA which leads to the
decay of the transcript and the production of a truncated peptide which is degraded
and nonfunctional.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Management of DMD has been limited to corticosteroid therapy, which slows the
progression of dystrophinopathy, but can cause significant side effects.
Furthermore, it does not treat the underlying cause of nmDMD.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> For the specific form of the disease caused by a nonsense mutation, an
innovative therapeutic approach is available. Ataluren is a first-in-class drug
which was approved by the European Medicines Agency in July 2014 for the treatment
of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged 5&#x02009;years and older. It targets the underlying
cause of nonsense mutation DMD by promoting readthrough of the premature stop codon
in the mRNA, thereby increasing the production of full-length functional
dystrophin.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="bibr6-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr7-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>While both the efficacy and safety of ataluren in patients with nmDMD have been
previously reported from clinical trials,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> it is also important to describe
the real-life experience of patients with rare diseases such as nmDMD. Clinical
findings with ataluren in patients with nmDMD in everyday clinical practice will
help extend our knowledge regarding its effectiveness and safety/tolerability, as
well as aspects related to functionality, patient/family satisfaction and overall
well-being/quality of life.</p><p>We describe here findings from three Italian children with nmDMD treated with
ataluren 40&#x02009;mg/kg/day for 1&#x02009;year. All evaluations were performed by the same
physician, measurements were made every 3&#x02009;months (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4) and the
following outcomes were evaluated: 6- Minute Walking Distance (6MWD),<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and the timed function tests (TFTs), stand from supine, four-stair ascend,
four-stair descend and 10&#x02009;m run/walk. All patients&#x02019; legally authorized

center of University Federico II of Naples are presented. All three cases were
confirmed in a similar manner. Once DMD was suspected, initial assessment involved
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification genetic testing to search for
deletions/duplications in the dystrophin gene. As no mutations were found, each
patient underwent muscle biopsy, which showed a dystrophic pattern with reduction of
dystrophin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1756286418809588">Figure
1</xref>). Sanger sequencing was subsequently performed, and a nonsense mutation in
the dystrophin gene was identified in each case (<xref rid="table1-1756286418809588" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Following molecular confirmation
of diagnosis in these three children, the genetic investigation was extended to
their mothers and all three were confirmed to be carriers. No other family members
with DMD were identified for any of the three boys. During the course of follow up,
none of the children exhibited cardiac or respiratory involvement. Periodic
echocardiograms, electrocardiograms and spirometry check ups were all normal and
each patient received regular sessions of physical therapy and psychomotor
testing.</p><fig id="fig1-1756286418809588" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Muscle biopsy findings in a normal subject compared with case 1.</p><p>(a), (b) HE of a normal subject (a) and case 1 (b) with dystrophic changes;

Past
medical history was uneventful with normal milestones until the age of 5&#x02009;years.
The patient had his first neurological examination at the age of 5&#x02009;years after
elevated transaminase levels were detected in the absence of any liver function
impairment. Subsequently, markedly raised creatine phosphokinase levels
(&#x0003e;10,000&#x02009;U/I) were recorded and nmDMD was confirmed as described above. The
patient was immediately started on corticosteroids (deflazacort 15&#x02009;mg/day).
However, this treatment had to be stopped when the patient was 7-years old as a
result of poor tolerability (agitation and sleep alterations). When the child
reached the age of 10&#x02009;years, the 6MWD ranged between 300 and 400&#x02009;m, and
treatment with ataluren was started at 40&#x02009;mg/kg/day (<xref rid="table1-1756286418809588" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Surprisingly, considering the
patient&#x02019;s age and absence of steroid treatment, he was still able to walk 360&#x02009;m
at timepoint T0. His good performance on the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) may be
explained by the presence of a faint reaction of dystrophin or revertant fibers
in his muscle biopsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1756286418809588">Figure

stable with no marked worsening of motor performance; 6MWD remained between 300
and 400&#x02009;m, and at the 12-month timepoint it was 370&#x02009;m (<xref rid="table1-1756286418809588" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Other measures of functional
performance such as the TFTs (10&#x02009;m walk/run, timed four-stair ascent and
descent, and the time to stand from the supine position) also confirmed
stabilization of the disease with respect to motor performance during treatment
with ataluren (<xref rid="table1-1756286418809588" ref-type="table">Table

impairment; nmDMD was subsequently phenotypically and genotypically confirmed.
Treatment with deflazacort (20&#x02009;mg/day) was initiated almost immediately
postdiagnosis. Ataluren therapy (40&#x02009;mg/kg/day) was started when the boy was
7-years old and this motor impairment was already very severe (6MWD &#x0003c; 75&#x02009;m).
In fact, he presents a more severe clinical impairment when compared with
natural history studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The premature worsening of his motor performance was due to inadequate

At 4&#x02009;years of age, during the first neurological examination, he showed
attention difficulties and waddling gait (mainly on the tips of the toes) with
hyperlordosis. He also had a positive Gower&#x02019;s sign and pseudohypertrophy of the
quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles with associated moderate proximal weakness.
A few months later, the diagnosis of DMD was confirmed by genetic testing. At
the age of 5&#x02009;years, treatment with ataluren was initiated and mobility measures
(6MWD, TFTs) remained the same or improved during the 12-month treatment period.
The baseline 6MWD in this patient was 320&#x02009;m and increased to 400&#x02009;m after
12&#x02009;months&#x02019; treatment with ataluren. The results for the TFTs are shown in <xref rid="table1-1756286418809588" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>For each of the three cases described above, the respective caregivers reported
less fatigue and a reduction in the number of falls per month. Additionally, all
three children achieved better school performance ratings, were more
participative and spent more time involved in social and entertainment-based
activities. Ataluren was generally well tolerated and no adverse events (AEs)
reported.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section10-1756286418809588"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ataluren is a first-in-class drug indicated for the treatment of nmDMD; therefore, it
is important to collect information on its effectiveness and safety/tolerability in
routine clinical practice. Unlike clinical trials where the population is divided in
homogeneous groups for the correct interpretation of results, in clinical practice,
the patients are heterogeneous and the observed results are different from those
expected. Here, we report the clinical follow up of three Italian boys with nmDMD
who were treated with ataluren for 1&#x02009;year. The findings provide several points to
reflect upon, given the wide phenotypic spectrum of the three cases. In particular,
they started treatment at different ages with different degrees of muscle
involvement, and they achieved individual responses to therapy with some interesting
aspects to analyze.</p><p>The first important point to consider is that, in contrast with guidelines&#x02019;
recommendations and our advice, only one of the patients continued corticosteroid
therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> For cases 1 and 3 the caregivers refused to continue
glucocorticoids, as they had concerns regarding side effects. While this lack of
compliance represents a therapeutic failure, it also demonstrates that there are
still some problems regarding compliance and the urgent requirement to develop
glucocorticoids with a more selective mechanism of action for a better balance of
efficacy <italic>versus</italic> side effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>It must be emphasized that in 1 year&#x02019;s treatment with ataluren, the disease did not
significantly progress in these three patients who achieved an improved (cases 2 and
3) or stable (case 1) response from baseline evaluation at clinic based upon 6MWT
results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1756286418809588">Figure 2</xref>). Natural
history studies have shown that in patients with DMD and a 6MWD of 370&#x02009;m, a moderate
to severe decline of 50&#x02013;117&#x02009;m, respectively, can be expected.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The lack of disease progression in such a devastating, unrelentingly
progressive disease as nmDMD, which was observed in the three cases described
herein, should be considered an important therapeutic outcome. These findings are in
line with the results of a recent study<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> in which the group treated with ataluren, compared with placebo, had less of
a reduction in 6MWT distances</p><fig id="fig2-1756286418809588" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Timed function tests in three patients with nonsense mutation Duchenne

3). The hypothesis that improvement may have been due to the early initiation of
ataluren treatment which helped to prevent muscle degeneration is supported by a
muscle biopsy study in DMD patients which found that fibrotic tissue rapidly peaks
(to about 30%) in children aged 6 to 7&#x02009;years, and then slowly increases until the
age of 10&#x02009;years.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This is a crucial time for patients with DMD, since the muscle tissue loses
its ability to self-regenerate and declines toward fibrotic degeneration. This
suggests that this age period may be critical for making treatment decisions
regarding when to begin therapy for children with DMD. It may also suggest beginning
treatment well before this age period, which may thus explain why we observed a
better result in case 3, who started therapy early, (5&#x02009;years) compared with case 1,
who started therapy late (10&#x02009;years). This is despite the fact that at the T0 visit,
the 6MWD for case 1 was longer than it was for case 3. It is important to underscore
that on the basis of natural history studies, the 5-year-old patient in case 3 could
have a spontaneous improvement of disease at the age of 5&#x02009;years;<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1756286418809588" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> therefore, it is mandatory to continue a strict and longer follow up.</p><p>Case 2 presents some interesting information relating to a patient with severe
mobility loss. At the start of ataluren treatment, the boy&#x02019;s muscle impairment was
already very severe (6MWD &#x0003c; 75&#x02009;m) and we expected him to lose ambulation in a
very short time. It was therefore a surprise that this patient achieved an
approximate 50% improvement in motor performance. This observation highlights the
fact that while the best results may be obtained when ataluren is administered at a
younger age, positive results may still be achieved in patients with more severe
muscle involvement. Our data therefore confirm the importance of an early diagnosis
with gene sequencing, since starting treatment early with ataluren can help prevent
muscle degeneration and thereby obtain a better therapeutic result in children with
nmDMD. Of course, this observation was noted in a single case, and further study is
needed in a larger group of patients with the similar characteristics.</p><p>From our experience in these three cases, we found that ataluren was relatively
straightforward to administer with no compliance issues, and it was generally very
well tolerated, with no AEs reported. Last but not least, all caregivers anecdotally
reported an improvement in endurance and school performance in each of the three
children and they were able to spend more time playing. There was an improvement in
the quality of life of the three children and also their caregivers. Given that
studies on quality of life of caregivers and ataluren-treated children are scarce,
we feel that this is an important area for future research.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first report of ataluren administration in real clinical
practice, and on the basis of our limited experience, the main factor influencing
the effectiveness of treatment seems to be the earlier instigation of therapy. This
aspect has yet to be emphasized in clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr Steve Clissold (Content Ed Net) and Leonardi Efthimia for
