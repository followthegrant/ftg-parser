In most vertebrates large, moving visual scenes induce an optokinetic response (OKR) control of eye movements to stabilize vision. In goldfish, the OKR was found to be predictive after a prolonged exposure to temporally periodic visual motion. A recent study showed the cerebellum necessary to acquire this predictive OKR (pOKR), but it remained unclear as to whether the cerebellum alone was sufficient. Herein we examined different fish species known to share the basic architecture of cerebellar neuronal circuitry for their ability to acquire pOKR. Carps were shown to acquire pOKR like goldfish while zebrafish and medaka did not, demonstrating the cerebellum alone not to be sufficient. Interestingly, those fish that acquired pOKR were found to exhibit long-lasting optokinetic after nystagmus (OKAN) as opposed to those that didn&#x02019;t. To directly manipulate OKAN vestibular-neurectomy was performed in goldfish that severely shortened OKAN, but pOKR was acquired comparable to normal animals. These results suggest that the neuronal circuitry producing OKAN, known as the velocity storage mechanism (VSM), is required to acquire pOKR irrespective of OKAN duration. Taken together, we conclude that pOKR is acquired through recurrent cerebellum-brainstem parallel loops in which the cerebellum adjusts VSM signal flow and, in turn, receives appropriately timed eye velocity information to clock visual world motion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cerebellum</kwd><kwd>Brainstem</kwd><kwd>Cerebellum</kwd><kwd>Reflexes</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Predictive feedforward motor control is essential and ubiquitously employed in animal kingdom because biological sensory feedback delays are often too long to achieve rapid and precise motor behaviors. Visuomotor transformation systems have been studied to understand the underlying neuronal mechanisms achieving predictive motor controls. In many vertebrates, a large moving visual scene induces a reflexive eye movement called the optokinetic response (OKR) to stabilize the visual image on the retina. In natural environments, such large field visual motions are often evoked when animals move their head. During head motion, another reflexive eye movement called the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is primarily induced, and the eyes are counter-rotated in the orbits. However, the VOR is not perfectly compensatory, resulting in residual visual motion in the opposite direction to the head turn, thereby inducing the OKR. It has been shown in goldfish that the OKR system, that normally functions as a feedback control system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, acquires predictive feedforward control when a temporally periodic visual stimulation is presented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Namely, OKR eye velocity induced by a large-field visual stimulation moving periodically to the left and right at a constant speed began to decrease before the visual stimulation switched direction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> Trained, black arrows; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> Trained, Predictive Deceleration). When the visual stimulus was extended after the acquisition of this behavior, eye velocity decrease persisted even though the visual stimulation continued at a constant velocity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> Extended Stimulus Period, Trained). When the visual stimulus was not extended, but turned off, the eye velocity profile continued for several periods in the dark (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> Trained). Periods that goldfish could predict ranged from 2&#x02009;seconds to 128 seconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Predictive Optokinetic Response (OKR) in Goldfish.

Not only were Purkinje cells in the vestibulo-cerebellum found to modulate their firing patterns in a highly correlated manner with predictive components of OKR, but cerebellectomized fish lost both the ability to acquire and maintain the predictive components. Although these results suggested that the cerebellum was necessary for the acquisition of predictive OKR, other neuronal bases were not excluded from involvement in predictive OKR acquisition.</p><p id="Par4">One of the distinctive characteristics of the cerebellum is its neuronal architecture that has been evolutionally well conserved from teleosts to primates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We surmised that if the cerebellum alone is sufficient for the acquisition of predictive OKR, other species of fish than goldfish exhibiting particularly closely related cerebellar neuronal circuitry should be able to acquire the predictive oculomotor behavior. Therefore, we conducted behavioral experiments in four different fish species to test this hypothesis.</p><p id="Par5">Our findings showed that like goldfish, carp acquired predictive oculomotor behavior while medaka and zebrafish did not. We noted that the two species acquiring predictive OKR exhibited robust optokinetic after nystagmus (OKAN), a behavior shown to be a manifestation of the velocity storage mechanism (VSM). By contrast, the OKAN of zebrafish and medaka was extremely short and they did not acquire predictive OKR. Since we observed that goldfish and carp with longer OKAN durations did not necessarily acquire predictive OKR better, we examined vestibular-neurectomized goldfish whose OKAN was severely shortened. Interestingly, predictive OKR was comparable to normal animals. Together these results suggest that the cerebellum alone is not sufficient to acquire predictive OKR. Instead brainstem-cerebellar loops involving a velocity storage mechanism is required, and irrespective of VSM capacity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>General procedures</title><p id="Par6">Animals tested were goldfish (<italic>Carassius auratus</italic>), zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), and Carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>).

In the laboratory, all fish were maintained at 26&#x02009;&#x000b0;C on a 12&#x02009;h light/dark cycle with the water quality monitored. Procedures for animal preparation were adopted from those previously described (Goldfish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, zebrafish and medaka<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>). Briefly, goldfish and carps of both sexes, sized 12&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;15&#x02009;cm in length, were restrained by fitting the mouth onto a tapered tube and holding the body, wrapped in gauze for protection, in a plexiglass rigging lined by moistened sponges. The circular tank, 30&#x02009;cm in diameter, had untextured white walls that acted as a blank background for the visual stimulus. Aerated water, at 26&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, was passed over the gills for ventilation. Adult zebrafish and medaka of both sexes were restrained by wrapping with a sponge and fixated at the center of the 10.5&#x02009;cm circular water tank that had untextured dark gray walls and acted as a blank background for the visual stimulus. Aerated water at 26&#x02009;&#x000b0;C was filled in the water tank and maintained the zebrafish and medaka healthy throughout the experiment.

Under local xylocaine anesthesia a 40-turn, 5-mm diameter insulated coil (IET Inc., Switzerland) was sutured at two points onto the upper scleral margin of both eyes with 8.0 ophthalmic silk. The water tank was placed in the center of a magnetic field (DNI inc., USA) generated by two sets of field coils driven by 2 sinusoids with different frequencies for the measurement of horizontal and vertical eye positions. Each of horizontal and vertical eye position signals from both eyes was digitized in synchrony with visual stimulation motion (see below). Horizontal eye position was calibrated by rotating the eye coil at the known angles in the field coil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Zebrafish and medaka eye movements were measured from video images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> acquired by an IR CMOS camera (DMK21BF04, THE IMAGING SOURCE). The camera with IR filter (IR-86, Fujifilm Corporation) placed atop the water tank acquired an image around the head of a fish illuminated with infrared light (AE-LED56, Akizuki Denshi Tsusho CO., LTD.) at 60 frames/s. The acquired images from the camera were sent to a PC via IEEE 1394 at 60&#x02009;Hz, and monocular eye positions were estimated by custom-made software developed on LabVIEW Vision Toolkit (National Instruments).

The rotational axis of the planetarium was carefully aligned to the center of the animal&#x02019;s head at the level of the horizontal semicircular canals. Horizontal and vertical eye including planetarium positions were measured by a potentiometer (Midori Precisions Co., Ltd., Japan). The signals were continuously digitized at a sampling frequency of 1000&#x02009;Hz in 16-bits with the use of a Power1401 interface (Cambridge Electronic Design, UK) for display and storage using the Spike2 program.

Eye velocity of goldfish and carp was calculated by applying a 3-point low pass differentiation filter to eye position data sampled at 1000&#x02009;Hz. High frequency noise components amplified by the differentiation processing were eliminated by applying twice a 101-point moving average filter with a cut-off frequency of 4.39&#x02009;Hz in offline analysis. The eye positions of zebrafish and medaka were resampled from 60&#x02009;Hz to 100&#x02009;Hz by using MATLAB interp1 function, and eye velocity was calculated by applying once a 3-point low-pass differentiation. High frequency noise components amplified by the differentiation processing were eliminated by applying a 11-point moving average filter twice with a cut-off frequency of 4.04&#x02009;Hz in offline analysis. Different filters were used for data from different measurement systems so that their cutoff frequencies are close each other and enough to eliminate high frequency noise effectively from both data sets. Saccades and post-saccadic drifts, if present, were eliminated by applying a custom made automatic desaccading algorithm using an acceleration threshold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

It is thus likely that the existence of a neuronal mechanism within the VSM circuitry, irrespective of its capacity, is crucial for the acquisition of predictive OKR.</p><p id="Par39">Theoretically, the VSM is a leaky integrator that processes head motion signal from the vestibular semi-circular canals providing acceleration-like head motion information to obtain better estimation of head velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. When velocity step visual stimulation is applied, the eye velocity signal is gradually charged in the VSM, and after the visual stimulation is suddenly turned off, the stored eye velocity signal gradually decreases as OKAN until the VSM is completely discharged.</p><p id="Par40">Neuronal circuitry subserving the VSM has been postulated to lie within the brainstem vestibular nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. A subgroup of neurons in the medial and superior vestibular nuclei in monkeys showed highly correlated firing modulation with OKAN eye velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Electrical stimulation in this area modulate the VSM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> while midline sections of the commissural connection between bilateral vestibular nuclei abolished velocity storage capability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The degenerated neurons following midline sections were found to be GABA<sub>b</sub>-ergic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, suggesting that mutual inhibitory connections between bilateral vestibular nuclei were a key element to form the VSM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par41">Similarly, in goldfish, it was recently reported that vestibular neurons in descending octaval nucleus (DO) show highly correlated firing modulation with OKAN eye velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Neurons exhibiting firing modulation during OKAN have been found in Area II of goldfish as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. These neurons in the DO and Area II have been identified to project to the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> as illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> summarizing the goldfish OKR neuronal circuitry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Thus, the VSM signal is available in the cerebellum. The current results demonstrated that cerebellectomy did not abolish OKAN, but dishabituated the habituated OKAN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). These results suggest that the cerebellum is not prerequisite for the VSM, but its output influences the VSM signal content via the inhibitory projection from the cerebellum to the VN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, cyan arrow forming the loops &#x02461;, &#x02463;, and &#x02464;). Thus, the recursive neuronal loops connecting bi-directionally the VSM and the cerebellum would enable the cerebellum to produce predictive motor command ahead of directional changes in the visual stimulation by utilizing the signal from the VSM that then is subsequently adjusted properly by the cerebellum to count passage of time.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Predictive OKR Neural Circuitry.

Namely, an internal model is formed that predicts future sensory stimulation from the past sequence of sensory input to generate oculomotor commands. Consequently the eye movement profile is continuously updated within the cerebellar neuronal circuitry by neural loops first employing, and then replacing the returning pre-cerebellar VSM signals arising from the brainstem. The computational algorithm and its neural implementation for this functionality are yet to be addressed by mathematical modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and then tested by further behavioral and neurophysiological approaches.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Work supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number 16H0291, 18KK0286) and JSPS Research Fellow (Grant Number 17J10497).</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Shuntaro Miki conducted goldfish and carp experiments, made figures, and wrote the manuscript.
