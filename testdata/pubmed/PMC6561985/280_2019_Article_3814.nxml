Most GISTs are diagnosed in adults with median age in the mid-60&#x000a0;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. GIST arises most often in the stomach (60% of patients) or the jejunum/ileum (30%), and less commonly in the duodenum, colon, rectum, appendix, and esophagus (&#x0003c;&#x02009;1&#x02013;5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. GIST is very rare in pediatric patients, accounting for just 1&#x02013;2% of all GIST cases, and has a different clinical behavior and biology compared with typical adult GIST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Unlike adult sporadic GIST, pediatric GIST often affects females (74%) and has a higher proportion of tumors located in the stomach (85%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Another distinct feature of pediatric GIST is the presence of multifocality, which was reported in 23% of the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Metastases to lymph nodes, peritoneum, and liver are common in pediatric GIST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. GIST in pediatrics is frequently an indolent disease, although 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 63% for a cohort of German/Austrian patients with localized or metastatic GIST has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Pediatric GIST rarely has genetic mutations in <italic>KIT</italic> or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (<italic>PDGFRA</italic>), which are commonly present in adult GIST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. GIST in children and young adults is often characterized with mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Another feature in pediatric wild-type GIST is a higher expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) compared with adult wild-type GIST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Testing for mutations in <italic>KIT</italic> and <italic>PDGFRA</italic> before therapy initiation is strongly recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. If no mutation is identified, immunohistochemistry for SDHB is recommended, particularly for GIST occurring in pediatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Surgery remains the standard treatment for localized GIST and, depending on risk classification and type of mutations, adjuvant treatment with imatinib may be recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Imatinib remains the standard treatment for patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic non-SDH-mutated GIST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">For adult patients with confirmed intolerance to or progression on imatinib, the standard second-line treatment is sunitinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Sunitinib was approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of GIST after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This decision was based on a phase III trial showing a significant improvement in time to tumor progression with sunitinib vs placebo in imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients with advanced GIST (hazard ratio 0.33; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001; median 6.3 vs 1.5 months, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Sunitinib was administered at 50&#x000a0;mg (i.e., equivalent to approximately 30&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) once daily on a 4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off schedule (schedule 4/2) in this study.</p><p id="Par9">There is currently no consensus among pediatric oncologists on which drug to use in metastatic or recurrent wild-type pediatric GIST.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis at this MTD showed lower plasma drug concentrations compared with those observed in adult patients with GIST treated with 50&#x000a0;mg on a schedule 4/2. However, since most of the patients treated on the pediatric phase 1 trial were heavily pre-treated with chemotherapy, it can be anticipated that in chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve pediatric patients (such as patients with GIST), the tolerated dose may be higher.</p><p id="Par11">We report results from a single-arm, multicenter, multinational, phase I/II clinical trial that evaluated the PK, safety, and preliminary antitumor efficacy of sunitinib in pediatric patients diagnosed with advanced, unresectable GIST (Eudra CT 2011-002008-33; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01396148). Since the study permitted an intra-patient dose escalation based on individual patient safety/tolerance and real-time PK (cycle 1 samples), it also investigated whether doses greater than the established MTD were tolerated in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient population</title><p id="Par12">Eligible patients were aged 6 to &#x0003c;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years with advanced, unresectable GIST for which there were no available options for treatment with curative intent.

Secondary objectives were to investigate whether doses greater than the previously established pediatric MTD were tolerated in pediatric patients with GIST, evaluate safety and tolerability, antitumor activity, and explore PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships with respect to safety and efficacy in these pediatric patients.</p><p id="Par15">This study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The final protocol, any amendments, and informed consent were approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each study center or country.

A protocol amendment was implemented to reduce the number of enrolled patients (aged 6 to &#x0003c;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years) from 15 to 6 evaluable patients because of the rarity of the disease and slow enrollment, and the fact that this number of patients allowed the analysis of the primary endpoints, i.e., the characterization of the PK profile in pediatric patients. The starting dose of sunitinib was 15&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day administered orally on a schedule 4/2, and patients could continue for up to 18 cycles over a treatment period of 24&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par17">Patients were monitored for toxicity, with the sunitinib dose adjusted according to individual patient tolerance at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion.

In case of grade 3 toxicities, sunitinib was held until the toxicity decreased to &#x02264;&#x02009;grade 1 or &#x02264;&#x02009;2 grade for hematologic toxicities, at which point sunitinib was resumed at the same dose level or reduced by 1 level (investigator&#x02019;s discretion). In case of grade 4 hematologic toxicities the dose was reduced by 1 level after decrease to &#x02264;&#x02009;2 grade. Re-escalation was permitted with appropriate supportive care and monitoring at the discretion of the investigator. Specific guidelines for hypertension management were provided.

The dose-corrected day 28, cycle 2 steady-state mean <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> in this study was comparable to the previously reported steady-state <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> on day 14, cycle 1 in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors, respectively, for sunitinib (32.5 vs 33.0&#x000a0;ng/mL), SU012662 (15.2 vs 16.0&#x000a0;ng/mL), and total drug (47.7 vs 49.0&#x000a0;ng/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the dose-corrected (i.e., to 15&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> for sunitinib, SU012662, and total drug in pediatric patients with GIST were lower than those in adult patients with GIST (32.5 vs 42.6, 15.2 vs 18.9, and 47.7 vs 62.2&#x000a0;ng/mL, respectively) at the dose of 50&#x000a0;mg once daily on schedule 4/2 (Data on file). Therefore, pediatric doses higher than 15&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> would be required to achieve the plasma drug exposures comparable to those achieved in adults with GIST at the dose of 50&#x000a0;mg once daily on schedule 4/2.</p><p id="Par46">Considering that the majority of pediatric patients had their initial dose escalated to approximately 22.5&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> during cycle 2, the observed <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values during cycle 2 are in fact higher than the dose-corrected <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values actually reflecting the dose escalation to 22.5&#x000a0;ng/m<sup>2</sup> dose. Furthermore, the proportional calculated <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values on day 28, cycle 2&#x000a0;at a dose of 20&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> in pediatric patients with GIST are 43.3, 20.3, and 63.6&#x000a0;ng/mL for sunitinib, SU012662, and total drug, respectively, and comparable to those observed in adult patients with GIST at 50&#x000a0;mg once daily on schedule 4/2. Therefore, considering that steady-state total plasma exposures (i.e., AUC) are highly correlated with steady trough plasma concentrations for sunitinib and SU012662, a starting dose of 20&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> in pediatric patients with GIST would be expected to provide drug exposures comparable to those in adult patients with GIST at the dose of 50&#x000a0;mg on schedule 4/2.</p><p id="Par47">The best overall response in this study was stable disease in 50% of patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) and for three patients with PD there seemed to be a clinical benefit justifying a continuation of study medication for additional cycles. This clinical benefit was based on either moderate metabolic response on FDG-TEP scan or a mixed response observed on CT-scan or MRI. A previous study by Janeway et al. also demonstrated antitumor activity with sunitinib in imatinib-resistant pediatric patients with GIST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Of the seven sunitinib-treated pediatric patients with GIST, one had partial response, five had stable disease, and one had disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The duration of partial response/stable disease was 7 to &#x0003e;&#x02009;21 months, with an average of 15 months. Two patients had sunitinib for more than 18 and 21 months for sustained partial response/stable disease. In five of the six patients with partial response/stable disease, sunitinib resulted in a longer time-to-progression (TTP) than that achieved during imatinib treatment. The difference in TTP on sunitinib vs prior imatinib ranged from 2 to 17 months, with an average of 7.5 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">In the series reported by Rutkowski et al., a best response of stable disease was observed in seven of the nine patients treated with sunitinib, and all but one patient eventually had disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Among the eight patients who progressed, PFS and TTP duration ranged from 1 to 28 months, while one patient remained progression free after 73&#x000a0;months (as per date of data cut-off) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In all previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], stabilization of the disease has been observed in the majority of pediatric patients, with 13/20 patients with stable disease and 2/20 patients with partial response. As for treatment duration, 14/20 patients had&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;months of sunitinib, while 10/20 patients had&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;months of sunitinib treatment, and two patients&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;years. This observation is suggestive of antitumor activity for a substantial proportion of pediatric patients with advanced GIST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">The correlation analysis between PK and efficacy seemed to show a higher rate of stable disease in patients with higher total drug <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> on day 28, cycle 1, although no statistical analysis was performed due to small patient numbers in each subgroup (i.e., <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3). Median PFS was also longer in patients with higher total drug <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub>. The moderate positive correlation between PFS and total drug <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> demonstrates that sunitinib can be more effective at higher drug plasma concentrations in pediatric patients with GIST. These results are consistent with a previous study showing that increased exposure to sunitinib was associated with improved antitumor activity in patients with GIST or metastatic renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">There were no unexpected safety findings with sunitinib in this study population of pediatric patients with GIST. Doses higher than the previously defined maximum tolerated dose (15&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] were generally well tolerated in this limited population (increased to 22.5&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day in five of six patients and further increased to 30&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day in two patients). The safety profile was consistent with previous reports of sunitinib safety in adult patients with solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the well-defined toxicity profile for sunitinib in adult patients with GIST. The AEs were manageable with standard medical intervention and/or dose modification in this population. Moreover, our results are in line with three other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] in pediatric patients with GIST showing that sunitinib treatment is generally well tolerated at dose levels that were higher than the previously reported MTD of 15&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The correlation analysis showed an overall moderate negative correlation between percentage change in absolute neutrophil or platelet count and total drug <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub>. This indicates a higher degree of on-target modulation at higher plasma drug concentrations in pediatric patients with GIST.</p><p id="Par51">In conclusion, this study of six pediatric patients with GIST found that both sunitinib and SU012662 reached steady state by day 15, cycle 1, with no additional accumulation across cycles. Higher total drug plasma concentrations were potentially associated with a higher likelihood of stable disease and on-target AEs (e.g., hematological), although not statistically significant. AEs were in general tolerable and clinically manageable. A starting sunitinib dose of 20&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> in pediatric patients with GIST would be expected to provide drug exposures comparable to those in adult patients with GIST at the dose of 50&#x000a0;mg on schedule 4/2.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="funding-information"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was sponsored by Pfizer Inc.
