Additionally age-related disease is often attributed to inflammatory responses. Consequently a reduction in infections and hence inflammation early in life has been hypothesized to explain the rise in lifespan in industrialized societies. Here we demonstrate experimentally for the first time that eliciting an immune response early in life accelerates ageing. We use the beetle <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic> as an inflammation model. We provide a proof of principle for the effects of early infection on morbidity late in life and demonstrate a long-lasting cost of immunopathology. Along with presenting a proof-of-principle study, we discuss a mechanism for the apparently counter-adaptive persistence of immunopathology in natural populations. If immunopathology from early immune response only becomes costly later in life, natural selection on reducing self-harm would be relaxed, which could explain the presence of immune self-harm in nature.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammation has long-lasting health implications. Tissues express the inflammatory response following trauma or infection, providing the innate immune system's first response to insult. In the short term, inflammation constitutes a vital response to immune injury as it is the key component of tissue repair and reinstates physiological homeostasis <xref rid="pone.0019972-Vasto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However the initial acute inflammatory response can develop into a chronic condition if tissue health is not restored or irritation to the immune system is maintained <xref rid="pone.0019972-Licastro1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Exposure to inflammation has therefore been linked to many diseases (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0019972-Hotamisligil1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>), in which cases the inflammatory process can cause more harm than the initial immune insult <xref rid="pone.0019972-Nathan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In fact, the severity of many of the world's most important infectious diseases can largely be attributed to the immunopathology of inflammation <xref rid="pone.0019972-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In addition, diseases caused by inflammation are often associated with ageing, when disease symptoms are not expressed until many years after the initial inflammatory response <xref rid="pone.0019972-Bengtsson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These include cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0019972-Libby1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, cancer <xref rid="pone.0019972-Balkwill1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and metabolic diseases <xref rid="pone.0019972-Hotamisligil1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Recently Caleb Finch and Eileen Crimmins <xref rid="pone.0019972-Finch1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019972-Finch2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> proposed that a reduction in lifetime exposure to infectious disease and subsequent reduced inflammation causes a decline in age-related adult disease, i.e. a direct link between immunopathology encountered in early life and a decrease in adulthood morbidity and mortality. Most studies supporting this hypothesis have been of epidemiological, correlational nature, and lack hypothesis-driven experimental evidence. Experimental animal studies provide very powerful means by which to investigate the mechanisms controlling how environments in early life impact on phenotype expression in human adulthood <xref rid="pone.0019972-Bateson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019972-Waterland1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. As insect immunity also causes inflammation and immunopathology <xref rid="pone.0019972-Brandt1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019972-Libert1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, we have conducted a proof-of-principle study using the mealworm beetle <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic>. The similarities between the underlying mechanisms of the insect and human innate immune systems <xref rid="pone.0019972-Hoffman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> have encouraged and confirmed the importance of, the use of insect model systems in immunology. In <italic>T. molitor</italic> it has been shown that an immune response leads to the damage of vital organs, Malpighian tubules, which function equivalent to the kidneys of vertebrates <xref rid="pone.0019972-Sadd1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Moreover, during the pupal phase of development in <italic>T. molitor</italic> a substantial proportion of the body is reconstructed: almost all larval tissues get completely dissolved and remodelled. Most of the gut is reconstructed during metamorphosis and shows different larval versus adult morphologies, but the Malpighian tubules are an exception and remain as intact structures <xref rid="pone.0019972-Ryerse1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019972-Wigglesworth1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019972-Truman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019972-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This allows us to exclude damage to other tissues as an underlying cause of ageing phenotypes if the timing of the treatment shortly before or after pupation does not affect aging rate. Taken together, we have a model system where inflammatory damage to an organ system has been demonstrated <xref rid="pone.0019972-Sadd1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and because the study was designed to specifically test the impact of inflammation experienced either before or after complete metamorphosis, we can investigate damage to Malpighian tubules as a candidate mechanism.</p><p>Here, we investigate whether experimental activation of immune response early in life affects ageing measured as maximum lifespan. To measure the costs of immune activation and inflammation without any concurrent cost of infection, we activated the immune system at an early life stage with two non-infectious antigens: heat-killed bacteria (<italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>) and nylon filament, both of which elicit an immune response <xref rid="pone.0019972-Armitage1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019972-Adamo1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Animals were challenged either at the larval stage, 70 days post-hatching, or the adult stage, 8 days post-adult-eclosion. The procedural controls received an injection with sterile insect ringer, and full controls were not subjected to any immune injury. We analysed maximum lifespan to specifically measure aging <xref rid="pone.0019972-Swindell1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019972-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and also medium lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Maximum lifespan</title><p>Early-life immune response accelerated ageing, as shown by a reduction in maximum lifespan.

An Exact Unconditional z-pooled test, which is argued to be more powerful for comparing two populations than the standard unconditional tests (Berger, 1996), was used to compare percentages.

Briefly, this is an enzyme involved in two major processes; i) the catalisation of the oxidation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylananine; and ii) melanisation <xref rid="pone.0019972-Cerenius1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. It also has been demonstrated to be condition dependent (<xref rid="pone.0019972-SivaJothy1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>). Our results indicate that immune challenges did not cause phenoloxidase to be upregulated in the long term. This is in concordance with previous experimentation showing that <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic> immune response ceases 28 days following infection <xref rid="pone.0019972-Haine1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>The phenoloxidase response is associated with tissue damage in <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0019972-Sadd1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Since phenoloxidase levels in our study did not appear to be upregulated in the long-term, we can confidently hypothesise that the observed lifespan reduction was not caused by repeated tissue damage from persistent phenoloxidase. Instead, we suggest that immunopathological damage suffered at the time of inflammation and expressed later in life is the parsimonious explanation for our findings. In support of this the experimental procedure elicited an immune response without a living pathogen. Moreover, the effects of immune response were delayed, with the first mortality detected 64 days following infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019972.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>Further evidence to support our hypothesis that immunopathology is an important mechanism behind the long-term cost of early-life inflammation comes from our investigation into the timing of infection. Eliciting immune response before or after complete metamorphosis did not affect the results. This may suggest that inflammation-associated tissue damage contributing to lifespan reduction is carried through complete metamorphosis. In support of this, Malpighian tubules have been shown to be particularly sensitive to immunopathology in <italic>T. molitor</italic>, suffering reduction in functioning <xref rid="pone.0019972-Sadd1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Malpighian tubules function as insect &#x02018;kidneys&#x02019;, and are among the organs of the insect body that are not completely reconstructed during metamorphosis from larva to adult <xref rid="pone.0019972-Truman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019972-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>We propose that an initial immune response and upregulation of phenoloxidase could have inflicted harm on Malpighian tubules that persisted into adult life and caused reduced lifespan. If this were to indicate a general evolutionary mechanism, it is possible that the link between childhood inflammation and reduced lifespan observed by Finch and Crimmins <xref rid="pone.0019972-Finch1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> could be driven by immunopathological damage incurred during inflammation, the long-lasting effects of which are carried through to adulthood.</p><p>Whilst our data are consistent with the notion that early inflammation leads to increased aging mediated by innate responses, the question remains if this observation relates also to vertebrates. Vertebrates have a more complex immune system, the acquired immune system, yet inflammation and immunopathology in vertebrates has also been shown to be partly mediated by NF-kB mediated innate responses. The latter are highly conserved and form an important part of insect immunity (<xref rid="pone.0019972-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019972-Broderick1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0019972-Medzhitov1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>In an evolutionary context, we would like to argue that immunopathology could play a role in organisms in the wild. Costs of immune responses become exacerbated under environmental stress <xref rid="pone.0019972-Moret1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and hence any effect on the aging phenotype will be shifted forward in an individual's lifespan and become subject to natural selection. Moreover a recent study demonstrated for the first time that insect populations in the wild senesce, exhibiting age-dependent survivorship <xref rid="pone.0019972-Sherratt1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Alternatively, immunopathology could provide an explanation for the &#x02018;paradox of aging science&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0019972-Kirkwood1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>: aging (i.e. reduction in maximum lifespan) is present in most species yet it directly opposes natural selection for maintenance systems. An immune response constitutes a trade-off between the damage caused by a pathogen and self-harm. If the costs of self-harm only present at a later stage in life, and cause acceleration in aging but not a reduction in median lifespan, then natural selection on reducing self-harm will be weak.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal rearing</title><p>Pupae were collected from stock cultures maintained at 25&#x000b1;2&#x000b0;C with <italic>ad libitum</italic> supply of food and water.

The rate at which phenoloxidase in each well converted to dopachrome was measured, and this enzyme activity was given in the form of Vmax, which directly correlated with the amount of phenoloxidase in the original haemolymph sample (<xref rid="pone.0019972-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>). For each sample, the reduced data was viewed in plot form on the spectophotometer, and the Vmax over the period of time where the reaction proceeded in a straight line was taken. This was done to remove distortion of the results caused by periods of lag or levelling-off.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Statistical analyses of maximum and median lifespan</title><p>The statistical package R was used for analysis. We examined the difference between each treatment group and control in terms of median and maximum lifespan. To examine median lifespan, we ran accelerated failure time models, with each model representing a treatment group compared to full control. This analysis was based on a paper by William Swindell <xref rid="pone.0019972-Swindell1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The distribution to use in the AFT models was decided by producing parametric survival models for each comparison, with the following distributions: Weibull, Exponential, Lognormal and Gaussian. We then used analysis of variance to test which distribution minimised Akaike's Information Criterion, and was therefore the appropriate distribution to use <xref rid="pone.0019972-Akaike1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. For each comparison of experimental and control group, the Weibull distribution was appropriate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019972.s003">table S2</xref>; plots available on request). Quantile-quantile plots of the data from each AFT model indicated that the effects treatment were not always consistent over time, because the data did not form straight lines. Therefore, we can say that the c-values generated by the AFT model represent effects of treatment on survival, averaged over survival time. Each model produced a c-parameter, which represented the difference in median lifespan between the two groups, and 95&#x00025; confidence intervals for this value. A treatment effect was then calculated. A value of 1 represents a c-parameter when the full control group is compared against itself. Data from accelerated failure time models are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0019972-t003">table 3</xref>. To examine maximum lifespan, we calculated the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile survival time when all treatment groups were combined. We then worked out the percentage of individuals in each treatment group surviving to this time. Exact unconditional tests, using a contingency table approach with the online calculator at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/exact">www.stat.ncsu.edu/exact</ext-link>, were used to compare percentage survival for control group with each treatment group in turn. This produced a score-test z-pooled p-value for each of the seven comparisons. To obtain the treatment effect, the percentage survival of the full control group was divided by that of the treatment group in each comparison. This maximum lifespan method was based on that used by references 23 and 24 and the data are displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0019972.s004">table S3</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0019972.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
