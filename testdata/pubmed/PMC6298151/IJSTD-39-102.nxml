Genital lesions are mainly transmitted sexually. Till date, several forms of medical and surgical therapies have been used with variable success. In the present study, an attempt was made to review all the female patients of genital MC attending the sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic of the Department of Dermatology, Venereology, and Leprosy of Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, Amritsar.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims and Objectives:</title><p>In the present study, therapeutic efficacy and comparative evaluation of topical 10% and 20% of potassium hydroxide (KOH) were undertaken.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A total of 30 female patients of age group 18&#x02013;50 years with clinically diagnosed MC and more than ten lesions were enrolled in this study. The lesions in each patient were divided into two equal Groups A and B. Topical 10% KOH was applied over lesions of Group A and 20% over lesions of Group B with the help of 26G needle. First, two applications were done by the doctor, and subsequent applications were done twice a week at bedtime at home by the patient herself until crusting. These cases were followed up at 4<sup>th</sup> day, 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, and 12<sup>th</sup> week.

In children, the most common sites involved are the chest, arms, and face while in adults, the most common sites involved are genitalia. When genitalia are predominantly involved, the most common route of infection is sexual transmission.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The average incubation period is 2&#x02013;7 weeks. Clinically, it produces discrete pearly-white umbilicated papules.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It is a self-limiting infection but to decrease the risk of autoinoculation and transmission, several topical and systemic treatment modalities are being used but with variable results. These include potassium hydroxide (KOH), podophyllin, trichloroacetic acid, cantharidin, cryotherapy, silver nitrate, and imiquimod.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This study was undertaken not only to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of topical KOH but also to comparatively evaluate two varying concentrations of KOH, i.e.,10% and 20% on genital MC in females.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives of the study</title><p>

</p><p>The patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria were randomly included into the study and others were excluded from the study. All the routine tests were done. After taking informed written consent, the lesions in each patient were divided into two equal groups as follows: Group A and Group B. The lesions were cleaned with distilled water. Topical 10% KOH was applied with a 26G needle over lesions of Group A, and topical 20% KOH was applied over lesions of Group B. First, two applications were done by the doctor, and subsequent applications were done by the patient herself at home twice a week at bedtime until crusting after being properly explained about the procedure.

Majority of the patients belonged to the age group &#x0003c;25 years, but the mean age of patients was 29.83 &#x000b1; 9.307 years [<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>]. Ninety percent of patients showed total duration of the disease &#x0003c;6 months, with a mean duration of 3.43 &#x000b1; 2.932 months. Fifty percent of the patients were housewives, 20% were laborers, 13.3% were students, 6.7% were teachers and salon workers, while 3.3% were tailors [<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>]. We divided these into high-risk and low-risk occupations. High-risk occupations were laborers, students, salon workers, and tailors. According to this, 43.3% of patients had a high risk of contracting the disease according to their occupation while 56.7% of patients had low risk of the same. Of all patients, 93.3% were married and 6.7% were unmarried. Of married patients, a history of extramarital sexual contact was present in 21.43% of the female patients and in 53.57% of their male partners, suggesting that polygamy is more prevalent in men as compared to women [<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>]. Both the unmarried female patients had a history of premarital sexual contact. Of all, only 20% of patients were illiterate while rest 80% of patients were literate, suggesting that educational level of the patients does not affect the transmission of the STIs. About 56.7% of patients lived in rural areas, while 43.3% of patients lived in urban areas, suggesting that MC was more common in patients living in rural areas which can be attributed to lack of sexual awareness and safe sexual practices in the rural areas.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Age group-wise distribution and mean age of the patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJSTD-39-102-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Occupation of the patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJSTD-39-102-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>History of extramarital sexual contact in patients and their partners</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJSTD-39-102-g003"/></table-wrap><p>About 20% of patients were HIV positive, 16.6% of patients had associated systemic diseases and non-STIs such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hepatitis B, and intertrigo, and 26.7% of patients were pregnant [<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>]. These all are states of immunodeficiency, suggesting increased prevalence of MC in the immunocompromised. Associated STIs such as vulvovaginitis, vaginocervical discharge, warts, and herpes simplex were present in 39.9% of patients, suggesting an association of other STIs predisposed the patients to contract MC or vice versa.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Number of patients with associated other conditions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJSTD-39-102-g004"/></table-wrap><p>About 86.7% of patients had lesions over the vulva and thighs while 6.7% of each had lesions over the vulva only and over extragenital sites in addition to the vulva and thighs.</p><p>Since patients who had more than ten lesions overall and at least five lesions in each Group A and Group B were included, it was found that majority of the patients in each group had &#x0003c;10 lesions on the day 0 with a mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) of 10.10 &#x000b1; 4.759 lesions in Group A and 10.17 &#x000b1; 4.786 lesions in Group B [<xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>]. Group B showed Grade 4, i.e., the complete response at as early as week 2, but Group A showed Grade 4 response at week 3. Majority of the patients in Group A, i.e., 93.3% showed complete response within 3&#x02013;10 weeks [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] but in Group B, i.e., 93.3% showed complete response within 2&#x02013;8 weeks [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>], suggesting that Group B showed better response as compared to Group A, but this was not significant statistically. All the patients in Group B showed Grade 4 response by week 10, but in Group A, Grade 4 response was seen in all the patients by week 12. Mean total duration of treatment in Group A was found to be 6.83 &#x000b1; 2.692 weeks and in Group B was found to be 5.20 &#x000b1; 2.156 weeks [<xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>]. This difference in the mean total duration of treatment in both the groups was found to be statistically significant with <italic>P</italic> = 0.012, suggesting that topical 20% KOH is better in terms of total duration of treatment as compared to topical 10% KOH. Similarly, mean total number of applications required was 13.67 &#x000b1; 5.384 applications in Group A and 10.40 &#x000b1; 4.312 applications in Group B with a statistically significant <italic>P</italic> = 0.012, suggesting that topical 20% KOH is better than topical 10% KOH in terms of number of applications required [<xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>]. This is consistent with a study conducted by Vijay <italic>et al</italic>. where topical 20% KOH was found to be better than 10% KOH.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Efficacy was found to be good in 9 (30%) patients, moderate in 14 (46.7%) patients, and poor in 7 (23.3%) patients of Group A while it was found to be good in 16 (53.3%) patients, moderate in 12 (40%) patients, and poor in 2 (6.7%) patients of Group B [<xref rid="T7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>]. Even though Group B fared better than Group A in terms of efficacy, this difference was statistically not significant, suggesting that efficacy of both topical 10% and 20% KOH is comparable. Adverse effects were seen in 7 (23.3%) of patients in Group B and only 2 (6.7%) of patients in Group A. Stinging was found to be the most common side effect and seen in 2 (6.7%) patients in Group A and 5 (16.7%) patients in Group B, followed by secondary infection and ulceration each which were seen only in Group B in 1 (3.3%) patient [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. However, in the study conducted by Sequeira <italic>et al</italic>., pigmentary anomalies were found to be the most common adverse effect which was attributed to the application with a cotton bud along with daily application in their study.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Mean number of lesions in both groups on day 0</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJSTD-39-102-g005"/></table-wrap><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Clinical response in group A and B in case 1 at each follow-up</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJSTD-39-102-g006"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Clinical response in group A and B in case 2 at each follow-up</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJSTD-39-102-g007"/></fig><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Mean duration of treatment and mean number of applications required in both groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJSTD-39-102-g008"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T7" position="float"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Efficacy of both groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJSTD-39-102-g009"/></table-wrap><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Adverse effects seen in Group B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJSTD-39-102-g010"/></fig><p>Mean duration of treatment in HIV-positive patients, patients with associated STIs, patients with associated non-STIs, and pregnant patients in Group A was found to be 9.33 &#x000b1; 1.633, 6.83 &#x000b1; 2.887, 8.20 &#x000b1; 3.347, and 8.75 &#x000b1; 2.121 weeks, respectively, and in Group B was found to be 7.33 &#x000b1; 1.633, 5.25 &#x000b1; 2.050, 6.20 &#x000b1; 2.864, and 6.50 &#x000b1; 1.414 weeks, respectively.

However, a significant difference was found between Group A and Group B in case of pregnant patients only (<italic>P</italic> = 0.026), suggesting that 20% KOH is better than 10% KOH in terms of mean total number of applications required in pregnant patients.</p><p>Efficacy of 10% and 20% KOH was found to be low in HIV-positive patients, patients with associated STIs, patients with associated non-STIs, and pregnant patients as compared to patients who did not have any of these conditions. However, this difference was only significant in pregnant patients (<italic>P</italic> = 0.036 for Group A and 0.006 for Group B). This can be attributed to the fact that these conditions induce an immunocompromised state due to which the patient is unable to mount sufficient immune response to clear the MC infection leading to increase in the mean duration of treatment with increased number of applications required which in turn leads to low efficacy.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis used</title><p>1.
