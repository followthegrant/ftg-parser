From 2009 to 2011, 101 Norwegian patients were recruited. Stool swabs and questionnaires were collected every three months for one year and at the end of the study in 2012. Information on antibiotic prescriptions was collected from the Norwegian Prescription Database. Stool samples were cultured directly on ChromID ESBL agar as well as in an enrichment broth, and culture positive isolates were examined by <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> multiplex PCR. Isolates without <italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M</sub> were investigated for alternative ESBL-determinants with a commercial microarray system. Time to fecal clearance of ESBL producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> was also analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression was used to compare groups according to previously described risk factors. The ESBL point prevalence of fecal carriage were 61% at 4 months, 56% at 7 months, 48% at 10 months, 39% at 13 months, 19% after two years, and 15% after three years or more. We found no correlation between duration of carriage, comorbidity, antibiotic use or travel to ESBL high-prevalence countries. Prolonged carriage was associated with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> isolates of phylogroup B2 or D. Importantly, comparative MLST and MLVA analyses of individual paired urine and fecal <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> isolates revealed that ESBL production commonly occurred in diverse strains within the same host. When investigating cross-transmission of ESBL producing bacteria in health care institutions, this notion should be taken into account.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006095</institution-id><institution>Helse S&#x000f8;r-&#x000d8;st RHF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013060</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Silje Bakken J&#x000f8;rgensen</principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by a research grant awarded to PAJ from Helse S&#x000f8;r-&#x000d8;st RHF, grant number 2013060, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.helsesorost.no">www.helsesorost.no</ext-link>.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Prescription data are available from the National Prescription Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fhi.no/helseregistre/reseptregisteret/datautlevering">http://www.fhi.no/helseregistre/reseptregisteret/datautlevering</ext-link>) for researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data.

The spread of ESBL-E is facilitated by their reservoir in the gut of healthy humans and animals, and in water [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Certain clones, such as the epidemic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain CTX-M 15 ST131, have successfully disseminated internationally [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The increasing threat of antibiotic resistance has prompted surveillance of drug-resistant bacteria from stool samples as a tool to track their migration and to implement infection control measures [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Several risk factors for the acquisition of intestinal ESBL-E have been described, and they seem to vary between low- and high-prevalence countries [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, there are few studies regarding the time course of carriage of ESBL-E in the intestine and the factors that may influence duration of carriage [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Knowledge about carriage duration is important for implementation of adequate infection control measures, and essential in the construction of mathematical models in our understanding of the epidemiology of ESBL-E dissemination.</p><p>Previous studies on clinical patients conclude that fecal carriage seems to be common several months after an infection with ESBL-E, and that ESBL-E negative stool samples occur intermittently during colonisation. However, they identify different risk factors for prolonged carriage, such as urinary catheter use [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], immobility [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], infection with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains belonging to phylogroup B2 (which includes ST131) [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and CTX-M group 1 enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that travel to high-prevalence countries, antibiotic use, diabetes and fresh-water swimming are independent risk factors for UTI caused by ESBL-E [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Briefly, PCR-products were subjected to capillary electrophoresis, and each peak was identified according to colour and size by GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Allele numbers were assigned according to fragment sizes as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Character values were entered into BioNumerics (Applied Maths, Saint-Martens-Letem, Belgium), and dendrograms were constructed using categorical coefficients and the Ward algorithm.

Point prevalence rates were calculated for each three-month period. Carriage survival was estimated in a Kaplan-Meier curve. As many patients with negative samples later became positive in new samples, we found it appropriate to define ESBL-E clearance as two consecutive negative samples, and to present an estimate where the event end-point is set to occur at the first negative sample if the following sample also is negative. For further risk factor analysis, we used carriage at 13 months after inclusion as the dependent variable in uni- and multivariable analyses. Univariate analyses were performed using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test or Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square test when appropriate. Multivariate analyses were preceded by estimation of correlation between risk factors in a multiple logistic regression model. To reveal significant risk factors for persisting ESBL-E carriage at 13 months, we conducted backwards elimination of variables, starting by including previously described risk factors related to microbe- and patient characteristics. There was only one variable significantly associated with prolonged carriage. Thus, an exploratory model of hypothetical risk factors is presented [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The association between potential risk factors and carriage duration was quantified by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). A P-value &#x0003c; = 0.05 was considered significant. The continuous variables have been dichotomized, but the main results were robust to alternative operationalizations.

Two patients died during the study, and six others were lost to follow-up. All samples from these patients were excluded in the statistical analyses. Within the first 13 months of inclusion, eleven patients report to have received antibiotic treatment in hospital. In all cases, this treatment took place within the first three months after inclusion. We asked for 595 fecal samples in total, and received 519 (87%). Of these, 247 samples (48%) contained one or more morphologically distinct colonies of ESBL-E.

Ninety-three patients were followed for one year, 44 patients for two years, and 13 patients for three years or more. We recorded known risk factors for ESBL-carriage and characterized the ESBL-producing <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> isolates by MLVA.</p><p>Patient compliance in follow-up was successful, as 87% of requested fecal samples were delivered. We found that 44% were still ESBL-E carriers after one year by using survival analysis defining clearance as two consecutive negative samples. This may be an overestimation of ESBL-E clearance time, as the actual elimination of the ESBL-E carriage is unlikely to fall upon the exact date of the first negative sample. One could argue that the end-point should be set between the last positive sample and the first negative sample. On the other hand, one could also argue that the end-point should be set at the second negative sample, because a second sample is needed to confirm negativity in a clinical setting. The ESBL-E elimination rate estimate curve flattens in the two last years of the study, because we have set the end-point to occur at the first of two consecutive negative samples. Consequently, the latest possible event occurs at 13 months. When interpreting the curve, it is also important to remember that the interval between the 13-months sample and the last sample varies considerably between the participants. Simple point prevalence analysis with clearance defined as only one negative sample, reveals slightly lower positivity rates, as some patients delivered transient negative samples. Consequently, we recommend that at least two negative samples are obtained to verify ESBL-E clearance. To investigate the ideal time interval between these samples was beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Our clearance rates are in accordance with previous studies from Sweden, Slovenia and France [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Lack of detection of ESBL-E does not confirm absence of ESBL-E, but the risk of further spread can probably be regarded as low. Self-sampling may influence the sensitivity of microbiological tests, but in this study bacterial growth was obtained from all but one sample, in which case a repeated sample was obtained. Contrary to other studies [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], culture in selective enrichment broth did not give a significantly higher yield of ESBL-E. This could be due to differences in media composition, lack of vancomycin to inhibit growth of <italic>Enterococci</italic>, and the higher concentration of cefotaxime in our broth.</p><p>Apart from the long duration of ESBL-E carriage, our most important finding is the high genetic diversity among ESBL-producing <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains within the same individual. Changes in MLVA-type occurred during long term fecal carriage in 89% of the patients. A patient&#x02019;s fecal MLVA-type differed from the urinary type in 54% of the samples. There is less concordance between urine strains and fecal strains than shown in previous studies of patients with non-ESBL <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> UTI [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but the differences may be due to different typing methods. The seven loci MLVA protocol which we have used, gives a differentiation similar to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the MLVA minimum spanning tree, we observe a nice clustering of the dominating STs (ST131 and ST38), as previously shown by others [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The ESBL encoding elements are most often situated on plasmids that are horizontally transmitted between bacteria. Thus, it is likely that spread to new strains and species within the same patient increases during prolonged carriage. Comparative studies of ESBL-E within households and in long term care institutions also show genetic diversity in carriage strains [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For the majority of our patients, the CTX-M group is the same even if the MLVA-type changes. This observation supports the notion of horizontal gene transfer rather than the acquisition of a new ESBL-producing strain. We performed MLVA-analysis of morphologically distinct colonies from each positive fecal sample, but only on one isolate of each morphotype. This approach does not allow detection of different ESBL-producing strains with the same morphotype at individual time points. The observed change in MLVA-types over time may be caused by an alteration in the relative dominance between the strains. Furthermore, the initial strain may have evolved sufficiently to be perceived as a new genotype over time.</p><p>The observed genetic diversity in the fecal isolates has potential implications in an outbreak setting, where attempts to track the spread of individual clones have been customary [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is relevant to question if such tracking is a reasonable approach, based on the observed diversity among ESBL producing fecal <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains in individual samples. This diversity has been demonstrated by different methods [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A recent study from a high-endemic setting, using whole genome sequencing on 16 <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> colonies from each of seven ESBL-positive fecal samples, disclosed a substantial genetic diversity [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Similar genetic variations in fecal <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> isolates have been observed from patients with UTI in an ESBL-E low-prevalence setting [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. During an outbreak investigation, the index patient may thus carry a diversity of ESBL producing <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strains. Consequently, cross-transfer should not be ruled out, even if the microbe fingerprints from randomly selected fecal <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> colonies differ between patients.</p><p>We found a significant association between phylogroups B2/D and prolonged carriage as previously shown (15). Neither MLVA-types, nor single STs, nor any particular CTX-M groups were correlated to prolonged carriage. Our major contributors to phylogroups B2/D are ST131 (n = 33) and ST38 (n = 13). In a previous study, ST131 has been associated with prolonged carriage in a cohort of long term health care facility residents [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], while other studies, like the present, do not find this correlation [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our observation support the notion that also other strains than ST131 have potential to colonise the human intestine for a long time. The studies that do not find significant correlation between ST131 and prolonged carriage include samples containing other B2/D strains that could be equally persistent.</p><p>The observed differences in risk factors for prolonged carriage in previous studies may be related to several factors. The patient populations are somewhat different, as the other studies mainly included hospitalized patients, there were more men, and the average age was slightly higher. The patients suffered from different conditions; we only included patients with community acquired UTI, while the others also included patients with ESBL-producing bacteria in other clinical specimens. There are also variations in sample size.</p><p>In accordance with previous carriage studies [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we did not find any correlation between antibiotic use and prolonged ESBL colonisation within the study cohort, neither regarding the antibiotic type or amount, nor the timing between antibiotic treatment and fecal samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0173510.s004">S3 Data</xref>). However, there are several studies observing association between previous antibiotic use and <italic>infection</italic> with ESBL-E. The average antibiotic consumption among the study participants was twice as high as in an age- and sex matched cohort from the same region in 2011, i.e. 52.1 DDDs/1,000 patient days in the study group versus 25.5 DDDs/1,000 inhabitants/day in the population group [<xref rid="pone.0173510.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As the study cohort is selected among patients with UTI, and 12% of participants suffer from recurrent UTI, this is not surprising. Antibiotics create a selective pressure that favours resistant microbes. The ESBL-carrying plasmids also often contain other resistance genes. Thus, antibiotics which do not directly select for ESBL may provide a selective advantage for genetically linked resistance determinants on the same plasmid. Lack of significant correlation between prolonged carriage and the use of antibiotics may well be a type II error due to our limited sample size. Other presumed, but rarely occurring risk factors included in the model, such as more than three household members, male sex and high co-morbidity score, may also be a subject to type II errors.</p><p>Surprisingly, there was no association between prolonged carriage and travel to high-endemic countries. Our hypothesis was that travel to high-endemic areas would be a risk factor for acquiring new ESBL-E strains, thereby decreasing the odds of being ESBL-E negative in subsequent samples. We expected that the variety of strains would be greater in the travellers than in others. However, as we have discussed above, the variation in fecal genotypes is large regardless of travel. A different study design would be necessary to clarify whether the observed diversity is caused by plasmid transfer between strains, genomic evolution of strains over time or parallel infection with different strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We observed an overall ESBL-E fecal clearance rate of 56% one year after a UTI caused by an ESBL-producing <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> or <italic>K</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>.
