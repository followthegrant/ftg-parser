</p><p>Missing data can seriously compromise inferences from clinical research studies. While great
effort should be undertaken to limit the likelihood of missing data through careful study
design and conduct, it is inevitable that some values for various reasons will be missing.
Missing data are problematic for the data analyst because most statistical procedures require
a value for each variable. Therefore, when a dataset is not complete, the analyst needs to
decide on how to best deal with the data.</p><p>The most common method used for handling missing data is complete case analysis. In complete
case analysis, one analyzes only the cases with complete data. Individuals with missing data
on any of the included variables are dropped from the analysis. The advantages of this method
are its simplicity, its ease of use, and that it is the default for most statistical programs.
However, it has its disadvantages, which include lower sample size leading to reduced study
power, and potentially biased results, depending on the reason for the missing data. One
alternative method for handling missing data is to substitute each missing value with a
reasonable guess, and then carry out the analysis as if there were no missing values. This
method is termed imputation and is the subject of this article.</p><sec id="section1-2192568218811922"><title>Single and Multiple Imputation</title><sec id="section2-2192568218811922"><title>Single Imputation</title><p>In single imputation, a replacement value is determined by a certain rule. There are many
forms of single imputation. Some common examples include the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Last observation carried forward. In this form of simple imputation, a
participant&#x02019;s missing values are replaced by the study participant&#x02019;s last observed
value.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Worst observation carried forward. This form of simple imputation provides a
conservative estimate by replacing the participant&#x02019;s missing values with the worst
observed value.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Simple mean imputation. Missing values are replaced with the mean of the nonmissing
values for that variable.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In general, single imputation methods are not recommended as they depend on assumptions

missing values by calculating several different options or imputations. It is
characterized by 3 steps.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Step 1</italic>. Create multiple copies of the dataset where the missing

in part because it is readily available in standard statistical software. A search on the
term in PubMed from 2008 through 2017 reveals a steady increase in the number of citations
from 76 in 2008 to 310 in 2017 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2192568218811922">Figure
1</xref>). But is multiple imputation the solution for missing data? The short answer
is, &#x0201c;it depends on the reason why the data are missing.&#x0201d;</p><fig id="fig1-2192568218811922" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Annual number of citations in PubMed with &#x0201c;multiple imputation&#x0201d; in the title or

missing data, which is called the missing data mechanism. These categories are important to
understand because the problems caused by missing data and the solutions to these problems
are different for the 3 categories. Comprehending the differences among the categories is
complicated by the fact that 2 of these mechanisms have confusing names: <italic>missing
completely at random</italic> (MCAR) and <italic>missing at random</italic> (MAR).</p><sec id="section5-2192568218811922"><title>Missing Completely at Random</title><p>Data is said to be MCAR if the missing data value is unrelated to any observed or missing
data. In this case, the tendency for the data point to be missing is completely random. In
other words, there is no systematic reason that makes some data more likely to be missing
than others. For example, missing data as a result of a laboratory technician dropping a
blood sample, or data missing from surveys lost in the mail likely occur randomly. This
assumption can be tested by separating the missing and the complete cases and examine the
group characteristics. If characteristics are not similar for both groups, the MCAR
assumption does not hold. Unfortunately, most missing data are not MCAR.</p></sec><sec id="section6-2192568218811922"><title>Missing at Random</title><p>Data is considered MAR if the reason for the missing data is unrelated to the missing
values but are related to some of the observed data. The tendency for the data point to be
missing under this assumption is systematically associated with the observed data, but not
the missing data. For example, if men are more likely to correctly report weight than
women, the weight variable is considered MAR.</p></sec><sec id="section7-2192568218811922"><title>Missing Not at Random</title><p>In data missing not at random (MNAR), missing values <italic>do</italic> depend on
unobserved values. Examples include people who are overweight and, as a result, less
likely to report their weight, or patients with more comorbidities who tend to drop out of
a study more readily than those with less comorbidities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section8-2192568218811922"><title>When Is It Appropriate to Perform Multiple Impution?<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2192568218811922" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-2192568218811922" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr3-2192568218811922" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
