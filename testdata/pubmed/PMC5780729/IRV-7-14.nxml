An important proportion of children who visit emergency departments (EDs) are consulting for infectious diseases, especially during winter and early spring, when influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) circulate in the community. For influenza alone, the rate of visits to United States EDs during the influenza season was estimated at 6&#x02013;27 per 1000 children &#x0003c;5&#x02003;years.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="ref">

</xref> The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate nosocomial transmission of respiratory viral infections associated with a visit in the ED of a large pediatric hospital during winter.</p></sec><sec id="ss2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was conducted at &#x02018;Aghia Sophia&#x02019; Children Hospital, a 750&#x02010;bed tertiary care, university pediatric hospital in Athens, Greece. The ED provides emergency medical and surgical services every other day to children, irrespective of insurance status or other socioeconomic parameters. Approximately, 80&#x02003;000 children 0&#x02013;15&#x02003;years old visit the ED each year, with a peak of approximately 10&#x02003;000 children per month during winter. Well&#x02010;child visits are scheduled in separate areas.</p><p>The ED waiting room occupies 50&#x02003;m<sup>2</sup> at the basement of the main building of the hospital. Triage is implemented at the entrance of the ED by a nurse to identify children requiring consultation by a surgeon. All other children are seen by a pediatrician. Syndromic&#x02010;based cohorting [e.g., influenza&#x02010;like illness (ILI), gastroenteritis] is not implemented. There are five examination rooms for pediatric consultation. Alcohol&#x02010;based solutions and surgical masks are available for visitors, and posters about respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene are posted. Routine cleansing is performed twice per day.</p><p>The study was conducted from November 4, 2010 to March 31, 2011 (influenza and RSV season in Greece). All visits to the ED in one predefined day per week were identified through a computerized system, and the names and telephone numbers of parents of children with no respiratory symptoms and/or a discharge diagnosis other than a respiratory infection were recorded. The parents were called 6&#x02013;7&#x02003;days after their child&#x02019;s ED visit. Patients&#x02019; demographic data, data about their ED visit, and data about new onset of symptoms compatible with an ILI were collected by three trained pediatric residents through phone interviews using a standardized questionnaire (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). Children who visited another health&#x02010;care facility because of their illness were excluded. Laboratory testing was offered at hospital to all children who developed ILI within 1&#x02013;7&#x02003;days after discharge from the ED. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza infections were diagnosed with an immunochromatographic assay (CORIS, Belgium and DIAQUICK A/B/H1N1, Austria, respectively) using nasal aspirates. Influenza&#x02010;like illness was defined as acute onset of fever (&#x0003e;38&#x000b7;0&#x000b0;C) and cough or another respiratory symptom. Close contact was defined as a distance of &#x02264;1&#x02003;m. Oral consent was requested from the parents. The study was approved by the hospital Ethics Committee.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>&#x02002;Number of enrolled children by month.</p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-1" xlink:href="IRV-7-14-g001"/></fig><p>Multiple logistic regression (stepwise forward selection) was applied to investigate risk factors associated with the onset of symptoms after discharge from the ED. <italic>P</italic>&#x02010;values of 0&#x000b7;05 or less were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="ss3"><title>Results</title><p>During the study period, 11&#x02003;066 children visited the ED for pediatric consultation (median: 527 children, range: 368&#x02013;687 children per enrollment day).

</xref> Visitors may wait in close proximity with symptomatic persons especially during winter, when the two most important pediatric viral infections peak, namely influenza and RSV. Our data indicate that visiting the ED of a large pediatric hospital during the winter is associated with an extremely low risk for acquisition of a respiratory viral infection, despite the high burden of influenza and RSV cases admitted through the ED. The study was conducted in the largest pediatric ED in Greece, and our results may be generalized to other EDs with similar crowded conditions and waiting hours. Quach <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>

</xref> also found that a visit to a Canadian pediatric ED did not seem to result to a detectable risk of respiratory infection among children &#x02264;5&#x02003;years. Alcohol&#x02010;based solutions and surgical masks were available for ED visitors in both studies; however, adherence of children to infection control measures is questionable. In another study conducted during 1983&#x02013;1984, it was shown that exposure of young children to an ambulatory pediatric office was not an important cause of respiratory or gastrointestinal infections with an incubation period of &#x02264;1&#x02003;week.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="ref">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> A likely explanation for these findings is the high baseline risk of respiratory infection in children. In a study using a Monte Carlo stochastic model to analyze the transmission of airborne infections in a hospital waiting area under various occupancy levels, waiting times, and ventilation rates, it was found that the mean probability for acquiring influenza, although relatively small, increased with increasing waiting times and decreasing distance among visitors.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="ref">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref> Emergency departments in Greek hospitals are typically overcrowded during winter and many parents in our study reported that they moved away from symptomatic patients, a fact that may had an impact on the extremely low rate of transmission of infection. Another explanation is the fact that ill children stayed at their home after their visit to the ED, which most probably protected them from acquisition of an infection. However, in the study conducted in Canada,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="ref">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> the risk for onset of a respiratory illness was 17%, similar to others.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="ref">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> Climatic differences that may influence the frequency of congregation in closed settings, as well as viral transmission per se, may also play a role.</p><p>In conclusion, a visit to a pediatric ED during winter appears to be associated with an extremely low risk for acquisition of a respiratory viral infection. No control group was used in our study, which represents a potential limitation. In addition, the risk of transmission of a respiratory viral infection to adult visitors during a visit at a pediatric ED was not assessed. In a prospective study conducted in a hospital during the 1986&#x02013;1987 season, up to one&#x02010;third of a total of 43 influenza cases diagnosed in the hospital could be associated with a visit to the ED.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="ref">
