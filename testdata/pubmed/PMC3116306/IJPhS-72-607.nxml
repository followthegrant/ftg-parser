It was also observed that antibacterial activity was increased with introducing chloro group at para-position in phenylimino moiety but decreased with nitro group at same position. Antibacterial activity was also increased when number of carbon atoms increased in alkoxyphthalimide moiety. Compounds 3IV, 3Va, 3Vc, 3VIIIa, 3VIIIh, 3IXa, 3IXb and 3IXc showed significant antibacterial activity while compound 3Xa was found to show more significant antibacterial activity than standard drug. It was also observed that when alkoxyphthalimide group was introduced in thiazolidinone unit as well as number of carbon atoms was increased in alkoxyphthalimide group, the antibacterial activity was also increased. Introduction of arylidene unit at position-5 in thiazolidinone moiety also increases the activity but hydroxyl group at p-position in arylidene unit the decreases activity. Thiazolidinopyrimidines were found to show higher activity than 5-arylidene-4-thiazolidinones. Compounds 4IXa and 4Xa were exhibited moderate to significant activity against all of the organisms.
