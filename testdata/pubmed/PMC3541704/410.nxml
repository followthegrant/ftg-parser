response resulting in the formation of membrane embedded ceramide-enriched lipid
rafts and the reorganization of receptor complexes. Consistently,
decompartmentalization of ceramide formation from inert sphingomyelin has been
associated with signaling events and regulation of the cellular phenotype.
Herein, we addressed the question of whether the secretion of acid
sphingomyelinase is involved in host response during sepsis. We found an
exaggerated clinical course in mice genetically deficient in acid
sphingomyelinase characterized by an increased bacterial burden, an increased
phagocytotic activity, and a more pronounced cytokine storm. Moreover, on a
functional level, leukocyte-endothelial interaction was found diminished in
sphingomyelinase-deficient animals corresponding to a distinct leukocytes&#x02019;
phenotype with respect to rolling and sticking as well as expression of cellular
surface proteins. We conclude that hydrolysis of membrane-embedded
sphingomyelin, triggered by circulating sphingomyelinase, plays a pivotal role
in the first line of defense against invading microorganisms. This function
might be essential during the early phase of infection leading to an adaptive
response of remote cells and tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>survival</kwd><kwd>leukocyte-endothelial interaction</kwd><kwd>trans-migration</kwd><kwd>organ failure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Sepsis is defined as a syndrome with a complex continuum of host responses to invading
microorganisms. These pathophysiological changes affect more than 1.5 million patients
in Europe alone. Similarly, 20% of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in
the United States suffer from severe sepsis, which is the leading cause of mortality in
noncardiac ICUs. Despite the development of early intervention and intensive care,
mortality resulting from sepsis is unacceptably high, reaching 30 to 50% in hospitals
worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). The host response to infection is mediated by pathogen
components (e.g., lipopolysaccharides or zymosan) and by host-activated enzymes,
mediators (such as proinflammatory cytokines), and cells changing their phenotype. The
resulting remote organ failure is associated with a poor outcome.</p><p>Generation of the lipid mediator ceramide has been suggested as one major route of
cellular response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Activation of
ceramide-generating enzymes that hydrolyze cell membrane embedded sphingomyelin is
implicated in mediating and regulating diverse cellular processes, such as
proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Moreover, ceramide
formation is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, such as cancer,
atherosclerosis, pulmonary edema, and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Five
isoforms of specific, sphingomyelin hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases or sphingomyelinases
have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>The secreted acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) is the only isoform associated with
extracellular hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and has been found to be secreted by
macrophages, human skin fibroblasts, and human vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).
Apical secretion by endothelial cells was stimulated by a variety of proinflammatory
mediators and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, interleukin
(IL)-6, IFN-&#x003b2;, or IL-1&#x003b2;, but also by membrane constituents of gram-negative
bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). It was previously shown that
patients with chronic or acute systemic inflammation or infection such as sepsis
exhibited an enhanced sphingolytic activity in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).
During progression of the disease, a further increase in the activity of secreted aSMase
parallel to severity of illness predicts a fatal outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Furthermore, in mononuclear cells of septic patients, the
concentration of ceramide was increased and correlated positively with plasma
TNF-&#x003b1; levels and was higher among patients who developed dysfunction of remote
organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). A 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma sphingolytic activity was also observed
in animal models after application of endotoxin or proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).
As the inert membrane constituent, sphingomyelin is preferentially distributed in the
outer leaflet of cellular membranes. After inflammation-triggered secretion, aSMase
gains unlimited access to its substrate and produces huge amounts of ceramide, affecting
membrane organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In an instantaneous manner, ceramide induced
the release of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells, decreasing
endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). These observations support the concept that
secreted aSMase is a key player in cytokine secretion during host response. This
sequence of cellular response to inflammatory stress also put forward the hypothesis
that an unfavorable outcome of sepsis-associated remote organ failure might be linked to
regulating the secretion and activation of aSMase.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Transgenic mice with a deficiency in aSMase function (knockout [KO]) (aged
8&#x02013;10 weeks) and their wild-type (WT) littermates (aged 8&#x02013;12 weeks)
were used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Animals
were randomly selected for each experiment, were maintained under artificial
day-night conditions at room temperature, and received a standard diet and water
ad libitum. All experiments were performed in accordance with the German
legislation on protection of animals and with permission of the regional animal
welfare committee. Mice were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine and
xylazin injected intraperitoneally before any surgical procedure. During the
surgical procedures, body temperature was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Sepsis model</title><p>Sepsis was induced using the peritoneal contamination and infection (PCI) model
as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). In the
present study, peritonitis was induced by the injection of a 1:4 diluted stool
suspension (5 &#x000b5;l/g body weight [BW]) intraperitoneally. Two postinsult
time points were selected to represent early sepsis (6 h) and late sepsis
(18&#x02013;24 h).</p></sec><sec><title>Survival analysis</title><p>For survival analysis, aSMase WT and KO animals (n = &#x02265;15 per genotype)
were monitored every 3 h after peritonitis induction over 72 h. During this
experiment, animals received volume resuscitation (balanced saline solution) of
25 &#x000b5;l/g BW twice per day subcutaneously over the period of the survival
study. Log-rank statistics were used for data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial burden in blood and organs</title><p>Blood and organs were collected from deeply anesthetized WT and KO mice (n
= &#x02265;4 per genotype per time point) 6 h after PCI. Sodium citrate was
used as an anticoagulant. After blood was harvested, whole liver and lungs were
collected in a sterile manner. To avoid bacterial contamination, collected
organs were briefly washed in 70% ethanol. The organs were later homogenized in
sterile 0.9% saline solution. Enriched brain-heart infusion (2 ml) was added to
each sample, and dilutions up to five orders of magnitude were prepared. These
dilutions were plated on Sch&#x000e4;dler's and blood agars and incubated
under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 48 h. The number of bacterial
colonies was counted. Data were evaluated with consideration of blood volume or
normalized to wet weight of organs.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood analysis</title><p>Whole blood was collected by heart puncture from sham-treated and septic animals
(n = &#x02265;15 per genotype per time point) 6 h after peritonitis induction.
Leukocyte and platelet counts were determined for aSMase WT and KO animals using
the automated veterinary hematology analyzer Poch-100iv-Diff (Sysmex, Leipzig,
Germany).</p><p>Leukocyte subpopulations were also analyzed in whole blood collected from both
genotypes. Blood smears were prepared and stained using Giemsa. The slides were
then processed for analysis using the automated analyzer Cellavision DM 96
(Sysmex, Leipzig, Germany).</p><p>Serum was collected from aSMase WT and KO animals at three time points (n
= &#x02265;8 per genotype per time point) for analysis of laboratory markers
of organ dysfunction using the clinical chemistry analyzer Fuji Dri-Chem 3500i
(Sysmex, Leipzig, Germany) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of phagocytotic activity</title><p>Phagocytotic activity of granulocytes and monocytes was determined by flow
cytometry after incubating whole blood samples with FITC-labeled and opsonized
<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Phagotest; Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ). Briefly, 6 h after PCI, blood was collected from sham and septic WT
and KO animals (n = &#x02265;4 per genotype per time point) using Li-heparin
as an anticoagulant. Diluted blood was incubated with labeled <italic>E.
coli</italic> (1.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/ml) for 20 min at 37&#x000b0;C
followed by washing, lysis, and staining. The samples were measured by flow
cytometry according to the manufacturer's instructions (software: CellQuest
Pro, version 5.1.1). After &#x0201c;gating&#x0201d; FITC-positive monocytes and
granulocytes, groups were compared with each other.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of cytokines in plasma</title><p>Cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemotactic protein [MCP]-1, and TNF-&#x003b1;)
were quantified in EDTA plasma samples collected from sham and septic WT and KO
animals at three time points (n = &#x02265;6 per genotype per time point)
using cytometric bead assay (Becton Dickinson) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Granulocyte-migration studies</title><p>Livers were collected from WT and KO animals (n = &#x02265;4 per genotype per
time point) at three time points. Transmigration of leukocytes into liver tissue
was evaluated by specific staining of granulocytes in liver sections. These
sections (3 &#x000b5;m) were deparaffinized with decreasing ethanol series. The
LEUCOGNOST<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> NASDCL kit (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany)
was used for staining transmigrated granulocytes following the user's
manual. At 400&#x000d7; magnification, stained cells were counted in at least 20
visual fields by two independent and experienced scientists blinded to treatment
or genotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Intravital microscopy</title><p>In vivo imaging of the liver was performed with an epifluorescence microscope as
described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) to
evaluate leukocyte endothelium interactions 6 h after insult in sham-treated and
in septic aSMase WT and KO animals (n = 5 per genotype per time point).
Leukocytes were labeled in vivo with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl
ester (1 mg/kg BW) administered via a central line 10 min before surgical
instrumentation. At least five regions of interest per mouse of either
postsinusoidal venules (40&#x000d7; objective lens) or sinusoids (10&#x000d7;
objective lens) were recorded over 30 s and 5 s, respectively (GFP filterset,
470&#x02013;495 nm excitation and 525&#x02013;550 nm emission band pass filters).
Leukocytes were considered as &#x0201c;rollers&#x0201d; when they rolled across the
endothelium or stuck to the endothelium for a few seconds and then detached.
Leukocytes were considered as &#x0201c;stickers&#x0201d; when they remained stuck to
the endothelium throughout the observation period. The total number of
leukocytes in the postsinusoidal venules was calculated per mm<sup>2</sup>
endothelial surface (length of observed vessel segment &#x000d7; diameter &#x000d7;
&#x003c0;). Rollers and stickers in postsinusoidal venules were calculated per 100
counted leukocytes. Stickers in sinusoids as well as transmigrated leukocytes
were calculated per mm<sup>2</sup> liver surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Protein expression on leukocytes</title><p>Expression of surface proteins CD49d, CD62L, and CD11b was analyzed using flow
cytometry according to the manufacturer's instructions (software: CellQuest
Pro, version 5.1.1). Briefly, whole blood was collected from aSMase WT and KO
animals (n = 9 per genotype per time point). Samples of whole blood were
separately incubated with FITC-labeled CD49d, CD62L, and CD11b antibodies. The
geo-mean of fluorescence intensity (MFI) of all gated leukocytes was
documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of ceramide content in circulating leukocytes</title><p>Whole blood was collected from aSMase WT and KO animals at baseline and 6 h after
sepsis induction (n = &#x02265;12 per genotype per time point). The ceramide
pattern was fixed by the addition of an unspecific, broad-spectrum inhibitor of
hydrolases (diisopropylfluorophosphate) during the lysis of red blood cells.
Washed and pelleted leukocytes were pooled (to obtain 1&#x02013;2 million cells
per sample; six samples per group) and resuspended in methanol. After addition
of 20 pmol C17-ceramide, chloroform, methanol. and distilled water to the cells
followed by intense vortexing and centrifugation, the lower organic phase was
obtained for further analysis. Lipids were then resolved in methanol after
evaporation of the organic phase via the SpeedVac SC201 ARC vacuum system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH, Dreieich, Germany).</p><p>Analysis was performed using a quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) connected to a rapid-resolution liquid
chromatograph. High-purity nitrogen for the mass spectrometer was produced by a
nitrogen generator (Parker Balston, Maidstone, UK).</p><p>Chromatographic separations were obtained using a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 as
described previously (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). The injection volume per sample was
10 &#x000b5;l. Best results were obtained with an isocratic elution
(acetonitrile/2-propanol 3:2 with 1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min for
15 min. For mass spectrometric measurements, we used the following ion source
conditions and gas settings for positive LC-MS/MS: sheath gas temperature:
400&#x000b0;C, sheath gas flow: 9 l/min, nebulizer pressure = 30 psig, drying
gas temperature = 350&#x000b0;C, drying gas flow = 8 l/min, capillary
voltage = 2,000 V, fragmentor voltage = 355 V, nozzle voltage
= 2,000 V. All ceramides gave the same fragment ion of
<italic>m/z</italic> 264.27 at different retention times depending on their
chain length. Quantification was performed using Mass Hunter software (Agilent).
Calibration curves of reference ceramide values were performed from 1 to 100
pmol and were constructed by linear fitting using the least squares linear
regression calculation. The resulting slope of the calibration curve was used
for calculating the concentration of the respective analyte in the unknowns.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of aSmase activity in plasma</title><p>Citrated plasma was collected from aSMase WT and KO animals (n = &#x02265;6 per
genotype per time point) 6 h after the insult. aSMase activity was determined by
the hydrolysis of fluorescently labeled sphingomyelin (NBD-SM; Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR) as a substrate, chromatographic product separation, and image
analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Plasma samples were diluted
1:10 with the incubation buffer (sodium acetate, pH 5.0) before analysis. The
final composition of the reaction mixture was 12 &#x003bc;l plasma, and the
extraction was carried out using the SpeedVac concentrator Plus (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of reactive oxygen species formation in circulating
granulocytes</title><p>Whole blood was collected from aSMase WT and KO animals at baseline and 6 h after
sepsis induction (n = 6 per genotype per time point). Granulocytes were
labeled with a PE-labeled Ly-6G antibody (eBioscience Inc., San Diego, CA). For
the detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we used the FagoFlowEx kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions (EXBIO, Vestec, Czech
Republic). Briefly, blood samples were incubated with <italic>E. coli</italic>
and dihydrorhodamine-123. After red blood cell lysis, the resuspended leukocytes
were analyzed for detection of ROS formation using flow cytometry according to
the manufacturer's instructions (software: CellQuest Pro, version 5.1.1).
The fluorescence signal was expressed as MFI. We measured MFI for sham samples
and those incubated with <italic>E. coli.</italic> Results are represented as a

mice and their WT littermates 6 and 24 h after sepsis (n = 2 per genotype
per time point). Organs were shock frozen for later isolation of total RNA.
Samples were analyzed by a pangenomic microarray mouseWG-6 v1.1 expression bead
chips using an iScan platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) measuring the variation
of expression rate of &#x0003e;42.000 transcripts. Subsequent to biostatistical
analysis, validation of expression data of representative genes was performed by
quantitative real-time PCR. Data were normalized to unchanged reference
transcripts (<italic>Actb</italic>,<italic> Gapdh</italic>,<italic>
Hprt</italic>), and relative changes were plotted against sham-treated WT
littermates.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were obtained from randomly selected animals for each time point. Analyses
were generally performed in an independent setting with respect to the measure.
Thus, each animal reflects a discrete set of data. For ethical reasons, when
possible and appropriate different tissues, organs, and whole blood samples from
one animal were used for several measurements (i.e., samples for determination
of leukocyte counts, leukocyte subpopulations, and platelet counts in whole
blood were obtained from the same animals). The same applied for the analyses of
bacterial burden from blood and organs and granulocyte migration studies. All
data were examined for normal distribution, and appropriate tests were applied.
Statistical differences between groups were analyzed using ANOVA followed by
Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test or ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis test) followed by
pairwise multiple comparison procedures (Dunn's method) or Mann-Whitney
rank-sum test. Data are given as boxplots, which show the median and the first
and third quartiles and whiskers (10th and 90th percentiles). <italic>P</italic>

life-threatening infection. For this purpose, we used the model of PCI to obtain a
severe polymicrobial sepsis that closely reflects the clinical situation as observed
in around 50% of patients admitted to the ICU due to sepsis, severe sepsis, and
septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). This method involves the
collection of stools from nonvegetarian donors followed by extensive microbiological
characterization, preparation, and storage. This model reflects a reproducible and
standardized, nontrauma method that results in a diffuse peritonitis similar to the
clinical situation in cases such as perforated viscus due to diverticulitis. An
acute onset of the disease is followed by systemic inflammation highlighted by an
elevated bacterial burden as well as a cytokine storm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). In the present study, the high bacterial
burden in liver and blood and the rise in the levels of cytokines as well as
parameters of organ dysfunction 6 h after the septic insult confirm an infectious
focus and the development of severe sepsis.</p><p>With the development of sepsis, secreted aSMase activity is increased and breaks down
inert cell membrane-embedded sphingomyelin into highly active ceramide, which
accumulates, forming lipid rafts. It has been recently speculated that in lipid
storage diseases such as aSMase deficiency, immune cells may not obviate an
appropriate inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>).</p><p>To clarify a potential beneficial or maladaptive role of aSMase in the host response
to sepsis, we compared data obtained from animals with a complete loss of function
model to their WT littermates. The difference between the genotypes was elucidated
in the measurement of ceramide content in circulating leukocytes. Due to variation
in the number of white blood cells analyzed, we normalized the ceramide values to
protein content. In KO animals, levels of ceramide were significantly higher
compared with WT littermates but did not increase after sepsis induction. These
ceramide levels at baseline (as well as after sepsis induction), resulting from
unknown compensatory mechanisms, are enough to maintain a normal function at a
healthy state but not under septic conditions. The missing increase of ceramide in
the KO animals after sepsis outlines the pivotal role of this enzyme in the rapid
and transient formation of ceramide. Here we describe that the increase in the
activity of aSMase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) is reflected by a
biological correlate. This increase might safeguard an appropriate cellular stress
response but might also be, in an overwhelming fashion, a trigger of tissue damage
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Without overinterpretation of our
present data with the WT model, we could speculate that the increase in activity
could be the course or the consequence with respect to tissue damage and the
development of organ failure. Although the increase in sphingomyelinase activity
might originate from (active) release by stimulated (endothelial) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>) or passively from the lysosomes of
damaged tissues, the biological activity in circulation per se might be interpreted
as a hallmark of systemic stress response. There are several reports addressing the
abundance of lysosomal proteins, such as chitinase or granulocytic elastase, during
sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). We also determined that the enzyme might be relevant for
triggering cellular stress response in remote cells and tissues. During sepsis, the
lack of lysosomal activity in transgenic mice might hinder an essential signaling
pathway of cellular stress response, leading to macrophage activation and
inflammation due to sphingomyelin accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). To perform best practice procedures and to avoid a potential bias
caused by substrate accumulation, we enrolled in our experimental setting animals
aged 8&#x02013;10 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) where this
phenotype is not yet developed. On the other hand, aSMase-deficient animals with
cystic fibrosis appear to be more resistant to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>
infections with a decreased pulmonary inflammation. However, the absence of
lysosomal aSMase could play a role, together with the more prominent course of
infection, in the development of a more pronounced organ dysfunction observed in the
present study (panel 8) as compared with WT littermates. Thus, the absence of
lysosomal activity could possibly obviate benefits obtained through the decreased
levels of secreted aSMase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>We expected a better outcome with the KO model when compared with WT littermates. The
results instead highlighted a crucial role of aSMase in the early phase of host
response to sepsis. The complete loss of function model resulted in a
hyperresponsive state due to significantly higher bacterial burden mirrored by a
more potent inflammatory response, thereby resulting in a similar outcome as
compared with WT littermates through different trajectories.</p><p>The importance of aSMase during the early phase of sepsis was highlighted by the
analysis of bacterial burden, which suggested a pivotal role of the enzyme in
eliminating invading bacteria. Six hours after sepsis induction, bacterial burden of
aerobes and anaerobes in the liver was significantly higher in KO animals compared
with WT littermates. KO animals also registered a significantly higher CFU of
aerobes in blood compared with WT animals. This suggests an inability of aSMase KO
animals to efficiently eliminate microorganisms. Ceramide produced by activated
aSMase plays a crucial role in innate immune response with respect to the
elimination of microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Ching
et al. (40) suggested that the absence of the enzyme left murine animals more
susceptible to Sindbis virus-induced fatal encephalomyelitis. Unlike WT animals,
aSMase KO mice were unable to eliminate <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> from the lung
upon acute pulmonary infection and died from sepsis a few days later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Without reaching significance, we
registered a lower CFU in lungs of KO animals compared with WT littermates. This
might be explained by the altered lung pathology in aSMase KO animals characterized
by a significant increase in cell counts in the pulmonary spaces consisting mainly
of enlarged and multinucleated macrophages, which also registered an increased
production of chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).</p><p>As key humoral mediators, we investigated the cytokine pattern in plasma. We noticed
an earlier anti-inflammatory response in KO animals. Therefore, impairment of aSMase
activation exhibited distinct effects on cytokine release. Moreover, kinetic and
peak concentrations were in part different from the WT at the two observation time
points in our study. This is an interesting observation because the pharmacological
inhibition of aSMase has been characterized with a decreased transcription and
secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; directly acting on relevant peripheral cell types in a
polymicrobial sepsis model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Also, in an in vitro model of cellular
stress response triggered by prototypic electrophiles as triggers of cellular
damage, aSMase activation resulted in an increase in the expression of TNF-&#x003b1;,
amplifying generation of IL-6. Both knock-down and pharmacological inhibition
abrogated cytokine response under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), whereas the overexpression of aSMase, resulting in
ceramide generation, induced TNF-&#x003b1; sensitivity measured by IL-6 secretion
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>).</p><p>In circulating leukocytes, expression of transcripts encoding for cyto- and
chemokines as well as their receptors was found up-regulated in both genotypes
during the course of sepsis, corresponding to the results of cytokine measurements
in the blood.</p><p>We compared the <italic>Tnfa</italic> transcript expression in an ex vivo
LPS-triggered stimulation of expression and release of the cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>) with systemic TNF levels and
organ-specific expression in our model of polymicrobial infection. We found an
unaffected expression in the lung homogenates 6 h after peritonitis, similar to
unchanged expression of <italic>Tnfa</italic> in peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). On the other hand, in the present study,
we registered an up-regulated expression of <italic>Tnfa</italic> in whole tissue
homogenates of the liver 6 h after sepsis induction, accompanied by higher systemic
TNF-&#x003b1; levels. The hyper-responsive state in the KO animals revealed an overall
higher bacterial burden in the liver compared with the lung. This more pronounced
inflammatory response of the liver along with its pivotal role in host response in
combination with higher organ mass, the exorbitant bacterial burden, and the
cytokines levels in blood as well as the distinct role and response pattern of each
organ during host response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>) enlighten
the trajectory of the expression patterns in the different organs.</p><p>A panel of the relevant transcripts for immune regulation and bacterial elimination
were differentially expressed in the lungs of aSMase-deficient animals compared with
the WT littermates. Lysozyme and the astrocyte-elevated gene 1 (Aeg1, syn. Mtdh)
were only found up-regulated in the lung tissue of aSMase-deficient animals (cluster
3). Aeg1 is known as a TLR-4 specific regulator of NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated cytokine
synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). On the other hand, lysozyme
(EC 3.2.1.17) is one of the most important secreted proteins hydrolyzing certain
mucopolysaccharides of bacterial cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Also functioning as primary regulators of ROS generation and
essential components of the microbicidal oxidase system of phagocytes, both &#x003b1;
and &#x003b2; subunits of the membrane-bound cytochrome b oxidase were found
down-regulated in KO animals. These observations support the hypothesis that, beyond
the altered lung physiology in KO animals, a genotype-specific regulation of
transcripts involved in recognition and elimination of bacteria might have
contributed to a better clearance of bacteria in the lungs.</p><p>Sepsis induced up-regulation of cathepsin G (<italic>Ctsg</italic>) was found
diminished in aSMase-deficient mice. Ctsg is a serine protease participating in the
killing and digestion of engulfed bacteria and regulates phagocytosis,
degranulation, and ROS release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). The down-regulation of
<italic>Ctsg</italic> in septic aSMase KO animals could therefore explain the
inability of leukocytes to effectively eliminate phagocytised bacteria, which
resulted in an overwhelming infection.</p><p>The dynamic, insult-specific variations of platelet and leukocyte counts were
acknowledged as critical hints with respect to disease progression. Similar to the
course in patients with sepsis, a significant drop in leukocyte and platelet counts
was observed in both genotypes 6 h after sepsis induction. With the progression of
systemic inflammation and infection, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which may
function as indicators of disseminated intravascular coagulation, occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Further studies are needed to elucidate the proposed mechanism and
to understand the role of aSMase in platelet activation and thrombocytopenia during
sepsis.</p><p>The observation of leukopenia in WT and KO animals 6 h after sepsis induction raised
the question of the fate of leukocytes during sepsis. This drop in cell count was
confirmed with intravital microscopy of the liver where both genotypes exhibited a
decrease in leukocytes in circulation after sepsis, which suggested the
transmigration of the cells into the remote tissues. Indeed, 6 h after the septic
insult, extravasation of leukocytes was reflected by a significant increase in
transmigrated granulocytes into liver tissue in WT and KO animals. In patients with
sepsis, the liver plays a principle role as a source of inflammatory mediators and
acts as a remote organ for the effects of circulating inflammatory mediators
released from other tissues. Transmigration of neutrophilic granulocytes can result
from microcirculatory changes and leukocyte-endothelium interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). The number and the activation status of
transmigrated granulocytes are held responsible for the induction and retention of
hepato-cellular dysfunction. Further analysis of the phenotype of transmigrated
granulocytes could provide insight into the expression profile and the activation
status of these leukocytes.</p><p>Speculating a distinct phenotype triggered by the enhanced cytokine storm and
bacterial burden, we were able to detect this phenotype with a more elevated
phagocytotic activity, a different leukocyte subpopulation profile, and a
differentiated leukocyte expression pattern in KO animals compared with WT
littermates. Phagocytotic activity increased significantly in both genotypes 6 h
after the septic insult. However, this activity was more significantly increased in
KO animals, reflected by a more elevated bacterial burden and higher levels of MCP
in the blood. Although a more significant increase in phagocytotic activity was
registered in KO mice, these animals still registered higher CFU values in blood and
organs. This might suggest the inability of granulocytes to control intracellular
microorganisms due to impairment in effector mechanisms. The lack of aSMase is not
essential for the uptake of bacteria by the phagocytes but could play a crucial role
in their intracellular elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>).
These results support our concept of the crucial role of aSMase in the early
response to infection.</p><p>Although both genotypes registered a drop in total leukocyte counts 6 h after sepsis,
we observed a different subpopulation profile in KO animals compared with WT
animals. At baseline, both genotypes had similar subpopulation profiles. However, KO
animals revealed a drop in lymphocytes and monocytes, mirrored by an increase in
neutrophils 6 h after sepsis induction. With the development of sepsis, bacteria
migrate into the tissue, inducing an inflammatory response. This includes the
recruitment of neutrophilic granulocytes, as first line of defense, to the focus of
infection and inflammation to combat invading microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). In the
present study, KO animals have an overwhelming infection due to their inability to
efficiently eliminate the microorganisms. This situation could explain the increased
production of neutrophils in KO animals after sepsis as a combat strategy to
overcome the overwhelming infection.</p><p>Another interesting finding was the differentiated leukocyte expression in KO animals
compared with their WT littermates. Indeed, 6 h after sepsis induction, the
expression of CD49d was significantly down-regulated in KO animals, whereas CD11b
was significantly up-regulated only in WT animals. The missing increase in CD11b
expression in KO animals might be due to their inability to produce ceramide and a
subsequent lack of lipid raft formation necessary for CD11b recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>).</p><p>This described phenotype might be one cause of a different course of the disease in
the KO animals. The different leukocyte expression profile of CD49d and CD11b
resulted in a different leukocyte-endothelium interaction between the two genotypes.
CD49d, CD62L, and CD11b expression are essential for the rolling and sticking
phenomenon leading to leukocyte-endothelium interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). In the
present study, WT animals exhibited a significant increase in leukocyte rolling and
sticking in the liver sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules 6 h after sepsis
induction attributed to the up-regulation of expression markers on leukocytes. The
down-regulation or missing increase in expression of these markers in the KO animals
consequently resulted in an unchanged leukocyte-endothelium interaction between
sham-treated and septic animals. Sepsis causes important changes in the liver, with
alterations in hepatic macro- and microcirculation as well as leukocytes-endothelium
interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). The latter leads to
neutrophil sequestration with subsequent local release of proinflammatory mediators
and therefore plays a role in the development of liver dysfunction, which is a
crucial event in the development of sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). It is unknown whether the phenotype of sequestered aSMase-deficient
leukocytes have a rather beneficial or detrimental role with respect to development
of organ dysfunction.</p><p>The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-&#x003b1; was found to be crucially involved in the
generation of ROS (specifically H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in a ceramide-dependent
manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>). The impotence in rapid
ceramide generation in leukocytes of aSMase KO animals might be adjusted by the
2-fold increase in circulating TNF levels to yield a similar ROS release in the two
genotypes as observed here during sepsis. Thereby, with respect to the cytokine
pattern, the earlier and more pronounced response might reflect a hyper-responsive
status to overcome the inadequacy in ceramide-dependent pathways of host
response.</p><p>The development of multiple organ injury is a major complication of sepsis and septic
shock, increasing the lethality of sepsis to 70&#x02013;80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>). To
investigate the course of sepsis in remote organs, which were primarily affected
during the continuum of the disease, different laboratory markers of organ
dysfunction were measured. Dysfunction of the liver is considered a crucial
complication in the course of human sepsis, is often limiting for prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>), and was reflected here by a pronounced
increase in markers of hepatocellular injury (AST and ALT) in KO animals in the
early phase and in the marker of cholestasis (T-Bil) in the late phase of sepsis.
Markers of hepatocellular injury dropped in the later phase of sepsis in KO animals,
with an increase in the marker of cholestasis. In WT animals, markers of cholestasis
and hepatocellular injury continued to rise in the later phase. A paradoxical
up-regulation of a key determinant of transactivation of hepatic stellate cells was
associated with the genetic ablation of aSMase, which was not restricted to the
liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, acute renal failure is a common complication of critical illness. Levels
of creatinine drastically increased (more so in KO animals) in the later phase of
the disease. However, at baseline creatinine levels in KO animals were significantly
higher compared with their WT littermates. This suggests that our aSMase KO animals
are prone to kidney preinjury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>).</p><p>The role of aSMase in diseases such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and chronic heart
failure has been highly characterized in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>). In the present study, we elucidated a
crucial role of aSMase secretion through measurement of the stress-induced enzyme
activity matched to accumulation of its product in circulating leukocytes in the
early phase of sepsis. In a complete loss-of-function model, the pronounced
amplitude of principle inflammation mediators such as cytokines and bacterial burden
supported the concept that this enzyme is crucial in the first line defense against
invading microorganisms. Loss of function resulted in a hyperresponsive state due to
an overwhelming spread of microorganisms and the inability to effectively eliminate
invading bacteria, leading to the generalization of host response.</p><p>The end result is highlighted in the survival analysis. Opposite to expectation, the
complete loss-of-function model did not lead to a better survival. Instead, the
overwhelming infection and inflammatory response led to a high mortality in KO
similar to WT animals, which overall highlights the pivotal role of aSMase in
sepsis.</p><p>In patients with sepsis, the increase of aSMase might function as an adaptive
response mechanism. In our translational model we provided further insight into this
process. It is evident that the conservation of this enzyme is crucial during the
early phase through elimination of invading microorganisms but could have
detrimental effect during the late phase of sepsis. In line with this conclusion,
stratification of patients pretreated with pharmacological inhibitors for other
underlying conditions (i.e., major depression) might be of great value. In fact, a
chronological inhibition of aSMase has been presenting a more favorable outcome in
chronic infectious diseases such as cystic fibrosis with striking differences to the
KO model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>). These results and the data
from the present study encourage further research using a pharmacological-inhibition
model as well as clinical studies with inhibitors of aSMase in patients with
well-defined sepsis.</p></sec>
