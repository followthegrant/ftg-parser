The GRIPHON trial (Prostacyclin [PGI<sub>2</sub>] Receptor Agonist In Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension) provides an opportunity to assess the prognostic value of NT-proBNP thresholds in a controlled clinical trial and to evaluate the response to selexipag according to these thresholds.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The event-driven GRIPHON trial randomly assigned patients to selexipag or placebo.

Hazard ratios (selexipag versus placebo) with 95% CIs were calculated for the primary end point (composite morbidity/mortality events) by NT-proBNP category at baseline using Cox proportional-hazards models, and at any time during the exposure period using a time-dependent Cox model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>With both thresholds, baseline and follow-up NT-proBNP categories were highly prognostic for future morbidity/mortality events during the study (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). In the time-dependent analysis, the risk of experiencing a morbidity/mortality event was 92% and 83% lower in selexipag-treated patients with a low and medium NT-proBNP level, and 90% and 56% lower in placebo-treated patients with a low and medium NT-proBNP level, in comparison with patients with a high NT-proBNP level. Selexipag reduced the risk of morbidity/mortality events across all 3 NT-proBNP categories in both the baseline and time-dependent analyses, with a more pronounced treatment benefit of selexipag seen in the medium and low NT-proBNP subgroups (interaction <italic>P</italic> values 0.20 and 0.007 in the baseline and time-dependent analyses).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These analyses further establish the prognostic relevance of NT-proBNP levels in PAH and provide first evidence for the association of NT-proBNP level and treatment response.

The diagnosis of PAH had to be confirmed by right heart catheterization at any time before screening with a pulmonary vascular resistance &#x02265;400 dyn&#x000b7;sec&#x000b7;cm<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>, and patients were required to have a 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) of 50 to 450 m at screening. Eligible patients were permitted to take stable PAH background therapy including an endothelin receptor antagonist, a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, or both.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design and Outcomes</title><p>The GRIPHON trial was conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was reviewed by local institutional review boards with written informed consent obtained from all patients. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive selexipag or placebo twice daily, and study drug was titrated to the highest tolerated dose or the maximum dose of 1600 &#x000b5;g twice daily. Double-blind treatment continued until a patient experienced a primary end point event, or until premature discontinuation of double-blind treatment (eg, because of an adverse event [AE]) or until the end of the study. End of treatment was defined as 7 days after the last intake of selexipag or placebo. GRIPHON used a composite primary end point of time from randomization to first morbidity/mortality event up to end of treatment. Morbidity events were defined as disease progression, or worsening of PAH that resulted in hospitalization, initiation of parenteral prostanoid therapy or long-term oxygen therapy, or need for lung transplantation or balloon atrial septostomy. Disease progression was defined as a decrease from baseline of at least 15% in 6MWD, and worsening in WHO FC (for patients in WHO FC II or III at baseline) or the need for additional PAH therapy (for patients in WHO FC III or IV at baseline). All primary end point events were adjudicated by a blinded independent critical event committee.</p></sec><sec><title>NT-proBNP Measurement</title><p>Plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP were determined at a central laboratory using a validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Elecsys proBNP II) at baseline, weeks 4, 8, 16, and 26, and at 6-month intervals thereafter.</p></sec><sec><title>NT-proBNP Subgroups</title><p>For each NT-proBNP assessment time point, patients were categorized into low, medium, and high NT-proBNP subgroups according to 2 sets of thresholds: (1) thresholds defined as the tertiles of the baseline distribution of NT-proBNP values in GRIPHON (low: &#x0003c;271 ng/L, medium: 271&#x02212;1165 ng/L, high: &#x0003e;1165 ng/L) and (2) the thresholds outlined in the ESC/ERS guidelines<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> (low: &#x0003c;300ng/L, medium: 300&#x02212;1400 ng/L, high: &#x0003e;1400 ng/L). The main analyses were based on baseline tertile thresholds, and results from the guidelines thresholds are included in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.039360">online-only Data Supplement</ext-link>. Patients were also categorized by change in NT-proBNP category over time as follows: stable low (low NT-proBNP at baseline and at week 26), stable medium (medium NT-proBNP at baseline and at week 26), stable high (high NT-proBNP at baseline and at week 26), improved (high at baseline and medium or low at week 26, or medium at baseline and low at week 26), and deteriorated (low at baseline and medium or high at week 26, or medium at baseline and high at week 26).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Post hoc analyses on the primary end point (composite morbidity/mortality events) were performed in patient subgroups determined by NT-proBNP category and by the change in NT-proBNP category from baseline to week 26. The analysis by NT-proBNP category at baseline included all randomly assigned patients with an NT-proBNP level measured at baseline. For the analysis by change in NT-proBNP category that follows patients for the occurrence of a primary end point from the week 26 time point, the landmark methodology<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> was used. This analysis included data from patients who were still receiving double-blind treatment at week 26 (ie, excluding patients who had a primary end point or had prematurely discontinued treatment before the week 26 time point) and for whom NT-proBNP levels were available at baseline and week 26. The association between NT-proBNP category at baseline, or change in NT-proBNP category, and the risk of a primary end point was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates by treatment arm and subgroup, and using Cox proportional-hazards models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs. A time-dependent Cox proportional model was used to evaluate the association of the NT-proBNP category at any time during the study and the primary end point. This model evaluates the risk of an event for the low, medium, and high NT-proBNP categories at any time during the study.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses were performed that adjusted for the following prognostic baseline covariates: treatment, background PAH therapy, WHO FC, sex, race, age group (&#x0003c;65 years versus &#x02265;65 years), PAH classification, geographical region, creatinine, and 6MWD. Consistency of treatment effects across subgroups were assessed using interaction tests.</p><p>A subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot analysis<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> was performed to descriptively explore whether the hazard ratio (ie, treatment effect) of selexipag versus placebo on the primary end point changed as a function of NT-proBNP level at baseline. Patients were ranked according to their NT-proBNP level at baseline (from lowest to highest) and divided into multiple overlapping subpopulations. A Cox model was fitted separately to each subpopulation to obtain a hazard ratio for selexipag versus placebo. The hazard ratios were plotted against the median values for NT-proBNP level at baseline for each of the subpopulations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient Characteristics</title><p>In the 1142 GRIPHON patients with an NT-proBNP value at baseline, median NT-proBNP levels at baseline were 546.5 ng/L in the selexipag group and 562.5 ng/L in the placebo group.

This provided an opportunity to assess the prognostic and predictive value of NT-proBNP thresholds in a large population using both the ESC/ERS guidelines thresholds and newly derived baseline tertiles thresholds. In this GRIPHON post hoc analysis, NT-proBNP category was highly prognostic for long-term outcomes using both NT-proBNP baseline tertiles and the ESC/ERS guidelines thresholds. These analyses also suggest that NT-proBNP category during follow-up can be used to predict long-term treatment response.</p><p>The ESC/ERS guidelines recommend the use of NT-proBNP as part of a multiparametric assessment for prognosis and as treatment goals for patients with PAH, and provide thresholds to define low (&#x0003c;300 ng/L), intermediate (300&#x02013;1400 ng/L), and high risk (&#x0003e;1400 ng/L) levels of NT-proBNP.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although recent registry analyses have demonstrated that these thresholds have strong prognostic relevance in patients with incident PAH,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> data supporting the specific thresholds currently recommended and data in prevalent patients are more limited.

Although generally in the range of the high-risk cutoff used in the current guidelines (&#x0003e;1400 ng/L),<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> considerable variability was seen. In addition, the lowest-risk tier in the current guidelines, an NT-proBNP level &#x0003c;300 ng/L,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> was not initially identified in PAH receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (although it is used in excluding acute heart failure in other settings<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>). Limitations of the current thresholds therefore include the small samples sizes, the lack of separate validation cohorts, the inclusion of only treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients, the variability in the thresholds identified in receiver operating characteristic analyses<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and the lack of studies specifically designed to identify cutoffs for 3 tiers of risk.</p><p>Given these limitations, both baseline tertile values, and the NT-proBNP threshold values from the 2015 ESC/ERS guidelines were analyzed in the current study. Our results support the relevance of using low, medium, and high NT-proBNP categories in PAH risk assessment. The differences in cutoff values used in the ESC/ERS guidelines and the baseline NT-proBNP tertiles (300 ng/L versus 271 ng/L for the low/medium threshold, and 1165 ng/L versus 1400 ng/L for the medium/high threshold) also suggest that these thresholds should be considered as guidance to clinicians and not as absolute boundaries between risk categories.</p><p>Our analyses by change in NT-proBNP category provide evidence that highlights the importance of maintaining patients in the low NT-proBNP category or improving their NT-proBNP category as potential treatment goals.</p><p>This study also presents the first data showing an association between NT-proBNP category and response to long-term treatment in PAH. Selexipag reduced the risk of morbidity/mortality across all baseline NT-proBNP categories. The treatment effect appeared numerically higher in the low and medium subgroups, but the interaction <italic>P</italic> value was not statistically significant. In the time-dependent analysis, a benefit was also observed in all subgroups regardless of when the NT-proBNP categorization was performed. However, more pronounced treatment effects were seen in the low and medium NT-proBNP subgroups, and the interaction <italic>P</italic> value in this case was statistically significant. These results combined with the poor long-term outcomes and higher discontinuation rates for patients with NT-proBNP in the persistently high range suggest that treatment escalation should be considered for individual patients who remain in or experience deterioration to the high NT-proBNP subgroup while receiving selexipag. These findings also support close monitoring of patients at any time during follow-up to ensure that changes in treatment are made at the appropriate time.</p><p>The results presented here provide an in-depth analysis of NT-proBNP threshold values in the context of a randomized, controlled trial and further support the use of the NT-proBNP categories outlined in the ESC/ERS guidelines in the assessment and follow-up of patients with PAH. It is not surprising that patients with high NT-proBNP at baseline also tended to be in a higher WHO FC and have low 6MWD values. However, it is interesting to note that 32.8% of patients in the high NT-proBNP subgroup were also in WHO FC II, demonstrating that a single parameter cannot provide sufficient information to fully assess risk in patients with PAH, and multiple parameters should be considered when determining prognosis and making treatment decisions. Using such a multiparametric approach to risk assessment is recommended in the ESC/ERS guidelines<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and supported by several analyses of PAH registry data, which have highlighted the strong prognostic relevance of WHO FC, 6MWD, and NT-proBNP levels at baseline and follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>Selexipag was generally well-tolerated, irrespective of NT-proBNP category at baseline. The rates of discontinuations and number of serious AEs related to PAH were higher in patients in the medium and high NT-proBNP subgroups than in those in the low NT-proBNP subgroup. These results are not unexpected given that NT-proBNP is a marker for ventricular dysfunction and patients with high NT-proBNP are likely to have more advanced disease.</p><p>These analyses are subject to a number of limitations. Although GRIPHON provided a large data set appropriate for the analysis of NT-proBNP levels, analyses presented here are post hoc and exploratory in nature. The landmark analysis used to assess the effect of change in NT-proBNP category uses a single time point at week 26 and therefore excludes patients who are no longer receiving double-blind treatment at week 26. Because these analyses do not provide an overall effect of change in NT-proBNP category throughout the study, analyses using a time-dependent covariate model were performed to address these limitations. Finally, the NT-proBNP baseline tertile thresholds used in this study were derived from and applied to the same patient population.</p><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The GRIPHON trial provided an opportunity to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of NT-proBNP in patients with PAH in detail in the context of an randomized, controlled trial. In our analyses, NT-proBNP category at baseline and at any time during follow-up, irrespective of whether the categories were based on the ESC/ERS guidelines thresholds or baseline tertiles, was shown to be highly prognostic for long-term outcomes and can be used to predict response to selexipag treatment. In addition, we show that change in NT-proBNP category has some prognostic value. The data presented in this study therefore support the inclusion of NT-proBNP categories as part of the multiparametric risk assessment of patients with PAH at baseline and follow-up, as outlined in the ESC/ERS guidelines.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Medical writing assistance was provided by S.
