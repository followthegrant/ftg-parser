Advances in procedures used during vitreous surgery, for example, internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, have improved idiopathic MH closure rates.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Recently, Michalewska et al<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> have reported the efficacy of the inverted ILM flap technique for large MHs. Several groups, including ours,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> reported that this procedure is useful for the treatment of intractable MH such as large MH and MH in high myopia, and MH-associated retinal detachment. However, its effectiveness and indications have not yet been clarified in common idiopathic MHs. The inverted ILM flap technique is more technically intricate than ILM peeling. Some reports indicated that the inserted ILM flap might prevent reconstruction of foveal architecture postoperatively in MH-associated retinal detachment cases.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Ishida et al<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> have recently reported greater postoperative displacement of the temporal compared with the nasal retinal vessels toward the optic disc in patients with idiopathic MH who had undergone vitrectomy with ILM peeling. Yoshizawa et al<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> also found that eyes in which the ILM was peeled had a shorter papillofoveal distance than those in which the ILM was not peeled for the treatment of diabetic macular edema. These data suggest that the area of the ILM-peeled retina moves toward the optic disc. If so, less displacement of the nasal retina is assumed to lead to better MH closure. We therefore hypothesized that ILM peeling only on the temporal side would be more advantageous for MH closure than conventional total peeling around the MH. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of hemi-temporal ILM peeling and contribution of temporal retina movement toward the optic disc to hole closure in patients with idiopathic MH.</p><sec sec-type="patients|methods" id="s1"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This retrospective study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of St. Marianna University Hospital and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. We reviewed the medical records of consecutive idiopathic MH patients who were treated with pars plana vitrectomy and air tamponade with 360&#x000b0; ILM peeling (360&#x000b0; group) between January 2015 and March 2016 or treated with hemi-temporal ILM peeling (hemi group) between April 2016 and March 2017 at St. Marianna University School of Medicine Hospital. Best-corrected visual acuity was measured using the Landolt C acuity test and converted to a logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution for statistical analysis. The follow-up period was at least 1 month after the final surgery. Exclusion criteria were MH in high myopia (axial length &#x0003e;28 mm), large MH (basal hole diameter &#x0003e;1,000 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m), history of trauma, choroidal neovascularization, presence of a peripheral retinal break or proliferative vitreoretinopathy before the initial surgery, and cases in whom expansive gas, either perfluoropropane (C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>) or sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), replaced air tamponade during primary surgery.</p><p>Standard 25-gauge or 27-gauge pars plana vitrectomy and phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation were performed in eyes that had cataracts, and vitrectomy alone was performed in pseudophakic eyes and eyes without cataracts. Triamcinolone acetonide was used intraoperatively to facilitate visualization of the vitreous and posterior hyaloids in all eyes. For better visibility, we stained the ILM with a solution of brilliant blue G, as described by Enaida et al.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The areas of ILM peeling were approximately a 2- to 3-disc radius in both groups.

After fluid&#x02013;air exchange, nonexpansive gas was not used for tamponade in primary surgery.

In the current study, we demonstrated that hemi-temporal ILM peeling resulted in nearly the same MH closure rate as 360&#x000b0; ILM peeling, with less movement of the nasal retina than that of the temporal retina. This might suggest the substantial role of temporal retina movement in MH closure after vitrectomy with ILM peeling. In addition, hemi-temporal ILM peeling is preferable for safety because it does not involve the central papillomacular bundle during surgery, and it has been shown that central papillomacular bundle damage may affect central visual function and sensitivity.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>In this study, the primary MH closure rate was 92.9% (39 of 42 eyes), and the mean minimum MH diameter was 241.7 &#x000b1; 118.1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m in the 2 groups. Tadayoni et al<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> reported that ILM peeling might not be necessary for MH &#x0003c;400 mm in diameter. However, they used a long-acting expansive gas (17% C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>) and instructed patients to maintain a facedown position for 10 days postoperatively, which was longer than the 3 days in our study. Using a long-acting expansive gas and longer maintenance of the facedown position might alter the contribution of ILM peeling. Our study focused on the effect of ILM peeling, and thus, we excluded eyes in patients for whom expansive gas, either C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub> or SF<sub>6</sub>, was replaced during primary surgery. Expansive gas is usually used to facilitate MH closure because the interfacial tension of the gas across the hole is thought to prevent trans-hole fluid flow from the vitreous cavity and to reduce transretinal uveal&#x02013;scleral outflow with reduced macular edema. Another suggested mechanism is that the gas interface acts as a surface to allow glial cell migration to bridge the gap between the retinal edges.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In the 1990s, some surgeons used long-acting C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub> gas and instructed patients to maintain a prolonged facedown position for more than 1 week to 2 weeks.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> However, that long duration of the facedown position posed a problem in patient discomfort. Which tamponade gas is better for MH closure remains under debate. Comparative studies have shown similar anatomical success rates with either SF<sub>6</sub> versus C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub> and room air tamponade versus SF<sub>6</sub>.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>Displacement of the retina was previously reported in eyes with an MH,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> an epiretinal membrane,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and after rhegmatogenous retinal detachment surgery.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In this study, we also demonstrated displacement of the macular area around the hole toward the optic disc and found that the migration length to the optic disc was greater in the temporal than in the nasal retina in the 360&#x000b0; group, as previously reported by Ishida et al.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The migration lengths to the optic disc on the nasal side at 1 week and 1 month after surgery were 90.1 &#x000b1; 77.3 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m and 87.3 &#x000b1; 83.24 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m, respectively, in the 360&#x000b0; group, which is comparable with the data found in the study by Ishida et al (91.1 &#x000b1; 89.7 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m at 2 weeks after surgery). In contrast, the migration lengths to the optic disc on the temporal side at 1 week and 1 month after surgery were 136.1 &#x000b1; 106.1 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m and 134.0 &#x000b1; 99.2 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>m, respectively, in the 360&#x000b0; group, which are shorter than the lengths reported by Ishida et al (260.8 &#x000b1; 145.8 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m at 2 weeks after surgery). In addition, the mean basal diameter of the MHs in the report by Ishida et al was 662.1 &#x000b1; 238.1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m, which was greater than the diameter of 578.1 &#x000b1; 250.1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m in our study. They found that the ratio of the displacement of the temporal retina was significantly correlated with basal hole diameter, which may be why the migration lengths in our study were shorter than those in the report by Ishida et al.</p><p>In nasal retina displacement, we showed that the migration length of the nasal retina at 1 week after surgery in the hemi group (42.4 &#x000b1; 42.9 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m) was significantly shorter than that in the 360&#x000b0; group (90.1 &#x000b1; 77.3 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m). These results suggest that removal of the nasal side of the ILM around the MH may accelerate retinal displacement toward the optic disc. Because it is considered that removal of the ILM releases the tangential traction on the fovea from the temporal side, we suggest that ILM peeling increases the elasticity of the retina, leading to macular displacement. Although the ILM is composed of very thin tissue, its mechanical strength is about 1,000-fold greater than that of other cell layers, and the ILM comprises 50% of retinal rigidity.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Moreover, the ILM has 5-fold greater rigidity on the retinal compared with the vitreous side.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The peeled ILM thus reduces retinal compliance with anchoring at the optic disk. The unpeeled nasal ILM of an MH is therefore more likely to restrict the displacement of the retina toward the optic disc, which may contribute to hole closure. Ohta et al<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> noted thinning of the parafoveal temporal retina and thickening of the nasal retina after vitrectomy with ILM peeling in eyes with a closed MH. Based on the cumulative results, we speculate that the retinal nerve fiber layer may shrink after removal of the overlying ILM because the ILM serves as the basement membrane of the M&#x000fc;ller cells.</p><p>However, the reason why the parafoveal temporal retina becomes more displaced toward the optic disc than the nasal retina is unknown. Considering that the nerve fibers in the parafoveal temporal retina are longer than those in the nasal retina under natural conditions, and if removal of the ILM caused nerve fibers to shrink in length in the same proportions, the displacement of the temporal retina would be greater than that of the nasal retina. However, this speculation cannot explain the displacement of the nasal retina in the hemi group. The optic nerve fibers are bundled and tethered to the lamina cribrosa.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Therefore, when the parafoveal temporal nerve fibers are shrunk with ILM peeling, nasal nerve fibers might be drawn together in the optic disc.</p><p>In MH surgery, peeling of the ILM has a success rate ranging from 92% to 97%, whereas pars plana vitrectomy without peeling has success rates of 78% to 89%.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Over the past 15 years, ILM removal during MH surgery has been widely accepted as a technique to improve the MH closure rate.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, hemi-temporal ILM peeling alone may be sufficient for hole closure and, because it creates less displacement of the nasal retina, may have a potential advantage for hole closure without the potential for central papillomacular bundle damage. Hemi-temporal ILM peeling therefore appears to be a useful, safe procedure for idiopathic MH treatment.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>Limitations of this study included the short period of observation, relatively small number of eyes, and the performance of the surgeries by three surgeons, which may have affected the statistical analyses of the results. In addition, the study design was retrospective. Cases of intractable MH such as large MH, MH in high myopia, and MH-associated retinal detachment were excluded because most cases of intractable MH were treated with vitrectomy using the inverted ILM flap technique between January 2015 and March 2017 in our hospital.</p><p>It is also difficult to determine whether expansive gas, either SF<sub>6</sub> or C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, affected the retinal migration in this study. However, we believe that the choice of gas has little effect on the migration when the MH is successfully closed because the main role of tamponade is to stiffen the hole by keeping its edges dry using the surface tension of the gas bubble.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Our preliminary data comparing the migration length of eyes with 360&#x000b0; ILM peeling using either room air or SF<sub>6</sub> showed no differences between them (data not shown). We did not quantify metamorphopsia in this cohort and therefore cannot discuss the effect of less retinal displacement on the relief of distortion. Previously, however, it was reported that postoperative retinal displacement is related to postoperative metamorphopsia.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Thus, hemi-temporal ILM peeling may result in less postoperative metamorphopsia and improved visual acuity. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of hemi-temporal ILM peeling for MH. For this purpose, a randomized prospective study comparing hemi-temporal with 360&#x000b0; ILM peeling in eyes with MH, including large MH, is ongoing in our hospital (UMIN clinical trial registry: 000027810).</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that hemi-temporal ILM peeling did not result in a lower closure rate than 360&#x000b0; peeling. Moreover, the migration length of the nasal retina in the hemi group was significantly shorter than that in the 360&#x000b0; group after MH surgery, suggesting a substantial role of the movement of the temporal retina in MH closure.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>None of the authors have any financial/conflicting interests to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>NE</given-names></name><name><surname>Wendel</surname><given-names>RT</given-names></name></person-group>
