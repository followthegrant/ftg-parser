It leads to decrease in vision post-operatively to an extent that it diminishes more than pre-operative state.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Although, overall incidence of PCO is now rapidly decreasing - from 50% in the 1980s and early 1990s to less than 10% currently.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] A noninvasive method of dealing with PCO is Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy. But Nd-YAG laser has its own problems like corneal haze, uveitis, hyphema, lens pits, and retinal detachment but the most consistent complication is the post-capsulotomy rise in intraocular pressure (IOP).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Rise in IOP is probably caused by clogging of the trabeculum with debris.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] This is maximum after 2&#x02013;4 hours of procedure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Drug brimonidine is usually used in the treatment of glaucoma as it lowers the IOP and reduces risk of progression and loss of vision.

It kills bacteria by interfering with the enzymes that cause DNA to rewind after being copied, thereby stopping DNA and protein synthesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Ciprofloxacin does not have any documented effect on IOP. The present study documents the effect of brimonidine on the prevention of this post-procedural spike of IOP in the Indian subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>Ethical clearance was obtained to carry out this open-label, nonrandomized trial. Study subjects who consented to be a part of the study were selected and matched in terms of age and sex. The inclusion criteria in the study was non-glaucomatous subjects who presented with dimness of vision following PCO after ECCE, advised for Nd-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy at Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER). Exclusion criteria included subjects who were glaucomatous, high myopic, having corneal opacities and uveitis. Those subjects who had not consented were also excluded from the present study.</p><p>A purposive sample of 60 subjects (60 eyes), as per the inclusion criteria, participated in the study. Purpose and procedures were explained and after obtaining written informed consent, they were allocated in two groups:</p><p>Group A: Subjects who were instilled with 0.2% brimonidine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Group B: Treated with 0.3% ciprofloxacin</p><p>The pre-procedural assessment, sociodemographic profile, clinical history, and clinical ophthalmic examination of the subjects were recorded in a pretested and semi-open-ended performa.

Before an hour of the capsulotomy, subjects from Group A were instilled with one drop of brimonidine 0.2% [pharmacological name: 5-bromo-6(2-imidazolidinylideneamino) quinoxaline-l-tartarate and trade name: Alphagan]. However in the subjects belonging to Group B, one drop of ciprofloxacin 0.3% was instilled. IOP was again recorded after 1 hour of instillation of drug (pre-laser post-drop IOP). YAG laser for PCO was done in both the groups under topical anesthesia. The power setting of the YAG machine for both the groups was between 2 to 3 mJ per pulse and the number of shots ranged from 2 to 4 per patient depending upon the thickness of PCO.</p><p>Immediately post-capsulotomy, 0.2% of brimonidine and 0.3% of ciprofloxacin were again instilled in subjects of Group A and Group B, respectively. IOP was recorded after 1 and 4 hours to document the effect of brimonidine in terms of change in IOP.

However in the present study, when one drop of 0.2% brimonidine was instilled 1 hour pre-capsulotomy and immediately after Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy, IOP elevations were prevented. Yeom <italic>et al</italic>. had also documented similar observations where IOP decreased from the baseline in the group who were instilled with brimonidine. But in his study, decrease in IOP was significant after third postoperative hour (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), while the control group exhibited an increase in IOP. Present study also documents a decrease in IOP after 1 and 4 hour in Group A who were instilled with brimonidine. Thus present study provide substantial evidence in favor of brimonidine for prevention of acute rise in IOP after Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy among Indian patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>Global Facts according to WHO estimates</article-title><comment>Available from:
