Taking advantage of emerging insight into structure/function relationships in homologous facilitative hexose transporters and our novel high throughput screening platform, we investigated the ability of compounds satisfying Lipinksi rules for drug likeness to directly interact and inhibit PfHT. The Maybridge HitFinder chemical library was interrogated by searching for compounds that reduce intracellular glucose by &#x0003e;40% at 10 &#x003bc;M. Testing of initial hits via measurement of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in PfHT over-expressing cell lines identified 6 structurally unique glucose transport inhibitors. WU-1 (3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-N-[2-(4-methylbenzenesulfonyl)ethyl]-1,2-oxazole-4-carboxamide) blocked 2-DG uptake (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5.8 &#x000b1; 0.6 &#x003bc;M) with minimal effect on the human orthologue class I (GLUTs 1&#x02013;4), class II (GLUT8) and class III (GLUT5) facilitative glucose transporters. WU-1 showed comparable potency in blocking 2-DG uptake in freed parasites and inhibiting parasite growth, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 6.1 &#x000b1; 0.8 &#x003bc;M and EC<sub>50</sub> of 5.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 &#x003bc;M, respectively. WU-1 also directly competed for N-[2-[2-[2-[(N-biotinylcaproylamino)ethoxy)ethoxyl]-4-[2-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]benzoyl]-1,3-bis(mannopyranosyl-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine (ATB-BMPA) binding and inhibited the transport of D-glucose with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5.9 &#x000b1; 0.8 &#x003bc;M in liposomes containing purified PfHT. Kinetic analysis revealed that WU-1 acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of zero-trans D-fructose uptake. Decreased potency for WU-1 and the known endofacial ligand cytochalasin B was observed when PfHT was engineered to contain an N-terminal FLAG tag. This modification resulted in a concomitant increase in affinity for 4,6-O-ethylidene-&#x003b1;-D-glucose, an exofacially directed transport antagonist, but did not alter the K<sub>m</sub> for 2-DG. Taken together, these data are consistent with a model in which WU-1 binds preferentially to the transporter in an inward open conformation and support the feasibility of developing potent and selective PfHT antagonists as a novel class of anti-malarial drugs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI130584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1478-3355</contrib-id><name><surname>Hruz</surname><given-names>Paul W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI103280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8395-8537</contrib-id><name><surname>Odom John</surname><given-names>Audrey R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI123808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8395-8537</contrib-id><name><surname>Odom John</surname><given-names>Audrey R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1015493</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8395-8537</contrib-id><name><surname>Odom John</surname><given-names>Audrey R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (AI130584, AI103280, AI123808) and the Burrows Welcome Fund (1015493).

While substantial investment of monetary and intellectual resources to combat malaria has resulted in a 93% decline in mortality over the past 5 years, over 435,000 deaths still occur annually, mostly in children [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The emergence of parasite resistance to all available therapeutics including delayed clearance to artemisinin- based compounds has hindered efforts to eradicate this devastating disease [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, there is an ongoing need to develop novel anti-malarial agents with high potency, low production cost, sustained efficacy within disease endemic areas, and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles that allow single dose treatment regimens [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for parasite replication, new avenues have emerged for the design and implementation of effective mitigation strategies [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216457.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>One highly promising approach is to directly interfere with parasite hexose transport. Glucose is the primary source of energy needed by blood-stage parasites for biomass production and ATP synthesis. The malarial glucose transporter, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> hexose transporter (PfHT), first identified by Woodrow <italic>et al</italic>. in 1999 [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] is essential for parasite survival [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Chemical validation of PfHT as an antimalarial target was accomplished with the discovery of compound 3361, a glucose analog, as an antagonist of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> hexose transporter [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216457.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Compound 3361 is highly selective for PfHT over the human orthologue GLUT1 and also inhibits asexual intra-erythrocytic growth in culture [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Compound 3361 is also active against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> liver and transmission stage parasites, suggesting that PfHT may have highly desirable full life cycle activity [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216457.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, while 3361 validates efforts to target PfHT, this compound is not itself considered drug-like and is therefore not a viable candidate for lead development [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>GLUT1 activity is also important for glucose uptake into red blood cells and hepatocytes and GLUT1-mediated uptake has been shown to be enhanced in <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>-infected cells [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Inhibition of GLUT1 under these circumstances may be beneficial for inhibiting <italic>P</italic>.<italic>berghei</italic> infection. However, due to the ubiquitous expression of this transporter and its critical role in maintaining basal glucose delivery to tissues, inhibition of GLUT1 would be expected to result in significant host toxicity.</p><p>Initial efforts to screen for additional small molecule PfHT antagonists was performed in hexose transport null mutants of <italic>Leishmania mexacana</italic> parasites engineered to heterologously express the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> transporter [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This approach yielded several bioactive compounds with varying potency and selectivity for PfHT over the mammalian transporter GLUT1. The physical and pharmacokinetic profile of these pre-lead hits are not sufficient for use as an orally bioavailable drug and will require extensive structure-activity analysis for optimization [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Our identification of the clinically marketed drug lopinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, as a direct antagonist of PfHT further advanced this pharmacological approach to block parasite replication. However, lopinavir has a relatively poor potency (16 &#x003bc;M IC<sub>50</sub>) against blood stage parasites and shows higher selectivity for the human insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 over PfHT [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Drugs that block GLUT4 activity induce insulin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutics targeting PfHT requires identification of compounds with substantially improved potency and selectivity over the human GLUT orthologues.</p><p>To facilitate the identification of novel chemical scaffolds with potent inhibitory activity toward PfHT, we developed a robust high-throughput screening assay that allows real-time detection of intracellular glucose levels in cell lines engineered to selectively over-express a single facilitative glucose transporter. This assay has been validated by screening of the MMV Malaria Box of 400 compounds with known anti-malarial activity [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similar to compound 3361, the novel hits from this screen do not possess sufficient drug-like structure for pharmaceutical development. We therefore sought to begin with a chemical library specifically designed to follow Lipinski&#x02019;s rules for potential as an orally deliverable drug. The Maybridge HitFinder collection, consisting of 14,399 small molecules with drug-like diversity and chemical stability, provided a suitable screening platform. We report here the identification of several novel chemical scaffolds for hit-to-lead optimization and characterization of both potency and selectivity for PfHT over human glucose transporters.</p><p>With the further goal of developing drugs that will maintain efficacy during widespread clinical use, we have characterized the physical interaction of inhibitory compounds with the transporter. Given that hexose transport is essential for parasite survival, we hypothesized that compounds that bind to PfHT within the glucose permeation pathway will be less susceptible to resistance, since mutations that reduce drug affinity would be more likely to also impair transporter function. We here provide evidence for structural interactions between WU-1 and PfHT protein in light of the current rocker-switch model for transporter conformational dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As discussed in detail in this report, these data can facilitate the development of novel antimalarial drugs that are less susceptible to parasite resistance through mutational change. This information also provides novel insight on the conformational dynamics of the family of structurally related facilitative hexose transporters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Materials</title><p>WU-1 (3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-N-[2-(4-methylbenzenesulfonyl)ethyl]-1,2-oxazole-4-carboxamide, cat# 002-890-346), WU-2 (3-(3-bromo-2,6-dimethoxy-5-nitrobenzoyl)-1-(2-chloro-6-methylphenyl)urea, cat# 002-892-269), WU-3 (2-amino-5-phenyl-N'-[(E)-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methylidene]thiophene-3-carbohydrazide, cat# 002-903-252 and WU-5 ((3E,5E)-3,5-bis[(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methylidene]oxan-4-one, cat# 001-840-877) were purchased from MolPort, Riga, Latvia.

For this reason, as well as a diminished GLUT selectivity vs. WU-1, we focused on compound WU-1 for further characterization. The IC<sub>50</sub> for 2-DG uptake by isolated freed parasites for WU-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216457.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) was similar to the EC<sub>50</sub> growth inhibition curve for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> (6.1 &#x000b1; 0.8 &#x003bc;M and 5.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 &#x003bc;M, respectively). These data demonstrate inhibition of PfHT in a cellular context and support an antiparasitic mechanism-of-action of WU-1 through inhibition of glucose uptake by PfHT. In addition to the class I GLUTs, we were also interested in determining whether WU-1 was selective for PfHT over the human class II and class III GLUTs. Using HEK293 cells overexpressing GLUT5 or GLUT8 as representatives of class II and class III GLUTs, respectively, we determined the WU-1 IC<sub>50</sub> for hexose uptake by these transporters. PfHT and GLUT8 transport both glucose and fructose while GLUT5 transports only fructose. The IC<sub>50</sub> for PfHT was similar for 2-DG and D-fructose uptake (5.8 &#x000b1; 0.6 &#x003bc;M vs 5.0 &#x000b1; 0.7 &#x003bc;M, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216457.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0216457.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

After improving the throughput of our previously reported 96-well cell-based assay for the screening of small molecules that inhibit glucose uptake by PfHT [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to run in a 384-well format, we screened of the Maybridge HitFinder library of 14,399 drug-like compounds. WU-1 exhibited potency for PfHT inhibition in the low micromolar range, efficacy in inhibiting parasite growth and excellent selectivity against the human GLUT isoforms vs. the other confirmed hits identified in the screen. The strong correlation between the IC<sub>50</sub> of WU-1 for PfHT-overexpressing HEK293 cells, EC<sub>50</sub> for parasite growth inhibition and inhibition of glucose uptake in freed parasites suggests that PfHT inhibition is the mechanism of parasite death. That WU-1 is selective for PfHT over the human orthologues is important when considering potential safety issues in non-selectively inhibiting human GLUT transporters. GLUT1 is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues and is the key GLUT for glucose transport in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. GLUT4 is the key glucose transporter in muscle and fat for the transport of glucose in response to insulin, the inhibition of which leads to insulin resistance [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, maintaining selectivity for PfHT over the class I GLUTs including GLUTs 1 and 4 is essential for development of an effective and safe therapeutic. Importantly, WU-1 had excellent selectivity for PfHT over insulin-dependent GLUT4 (GLUT4 IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0003e; 100 &#x003bc;M). Although the functional significance of the class II and III GLUTs has been only partially elucidated, there is high potential that disruption of the functional activity of these transporters in humans would have significant metabolic effects [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, it is advantageous that WU-1 exhibits selectivity for PfHT over the class III transporter GLUT8, and has no effect on GLUT5, a class II transporter.</p><p>An important aspect of drug development is determining how the identified hit(s) are inhibiting the target of interest. For PfHT, if the drug binding site overlaps with the substrate binding site this should aid in preventing drug resistance. Specifically, mutations that prevent drug binding would be more likely to also disrupt transporter function. In PfHT overexpressing HEK293 cells, we determined that WU-1 is a noncompetitive inhibitor of PfHT-mediated zero-trans hexose influx. As for other facilitative transport proteins that mediate bi-directional flux across cell membranes, this is the expected pattern of inhibition for compounds that act at the endofacial side of the glucose permeation pathway. Inhibitor binding to the contralateral membrane surface from the measured transport rate would not be expected to be displaced by substrate. This phenomenon is well established for CB and other known endofacial GLUT ligands [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216457.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Further support for WU-1 endofacial binding is that the IC<sub>50</sub>s for WU-1 and CB were both right-shifted in FLAG-tagged PfHT compared to PfHT over-expressing cells whereas the exofacial ligand ethylideneglucose was left-shifted. Crystallization of the protein with the drug bound would definitively identify the drug binding site similar to what was achieved for GLUT1, CB, and two Phe amide-derived inhibitors [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216457.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Using a cell line that overexpresses FLAG-tagged PfHT, we purified PfHT to over 95% and determined it was functional and able to transport D-glucose. Expression and purification of functional PfHT is a vital step in crystalizing the protein. Using our novel ATB-BMPA assay, WU-1 inhibited ATB-BMPA binding to PfHT liposomes indicating that WU-1 interacts directly with the transporter. This was further supported by data demonstrating that WU-1 inhibits glucose uptake in liposomes containing purified PfHT with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5.9 &#x000b1; 0.8 &#x003bc;M, consistent with the IC<sub>50</sub>s determined in PfHT cells and freed parasites, and the EC<sub>50</sub> for growth inhibition.</p><p>All glucose transporters are thought to transport glucose by an alternating access mechanism in which a centrally located glucose binding site is alternatingly accessed from either side of the membrane through a series of conformational changes in the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216457.g010">Fig 10</xref>). The GLUTs as well as PfHT are members of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters which all possess a characteristic fold consisting of two symmetrical six transmembrane bundles. Recently published crystal structures of GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT5, and XylE [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] indicate that the alternation between outward- and inward-facing conformations is achieved via a rocker-switch motion and by a gated-pore mechanism involving transmembrane helices 7 and 10. Transition from the inward-facing to the outward-facing conformation is catalyzed by the transient formation of salt bridges at the endofacial side of the transporter. These salt bridges are formed either between the cytoplasmic ends of several transmembrane helices or between intracellular and transmembrane helices. Interestingly, the FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) which contains seven charged amino acids may also be capable of forming transient salt bridges with residues within PfHT. Our zero-trans influx data indicates that adding a FLAG tag to the N-terminus of PfHT decreases the potency of an endofacial ligand, CB, increases the potency of the exofacial ligand, ethylideneglucose, but has no effect on the K<sub>m</sub>. According to the recently published crystal structure of GLUT5, the cytoplasmic N-terminus is both facing and in close proximity to several regions involved in transient salt bridge formations in the outward-facing but not in the inward-facing conformation (Extended data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216457.g007">Fig 7</xref> of Reference [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). Based on our experimental data and the published crystallographic data, we propose a model in which the FLAG tag, when attached to the N-terminus of PfHT, provides additional stabilization of the outward-facing conformation in the absence of substrate via transient salt bridges with residues found in PfHT. The actual tethering of the FLAG tag to the N-terminus of PfHT appears to be important to our experimental observations since the addition of excess FLAG peptide to PfHT liposomes had no effect on glucose uptake. In addition to the FLAG motif (DYKDDDDK), our engineered FLAG tag contains a TEV protease site (ENLYFQS) flanked on both sides by triple glycine linkers which may add crucial flexibility in salt bridge formations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and methods</xref>). Assuming a simple carrier model for PfHT, stabilization of the outward-facing conformation in a ligand empty transporter would occur by increasing the rate of step &#x0201c;g&#x0201d; relative to the rate of step &#x0201c;h&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216457.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Our hypothesis is also consistent with data reported for GLUT1 that was locked in the outward-facing conformation by an Y293I substitution [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This mutation decreased the K<sub>i</sub> for ethylideneglucose &#x0003e; 2-fold, increased the K<sub>i</sub> for CB &#x0003e;100-fold, and had little effect on the K<sub>m</sub>. In contrast to our results, 2-DG uptake was greatly impaired presumably since GLUT1 was actually locked in one conformation, while FTPfHT is still active.</p><fig id="pone.0216457.g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0216457.g010</object-id><label>Fig 10</label><caption><title>Simple carrier model illustrating the transport of glucose by an alternating access mechanism.</title><p>Glucose can access the glucose binding site of PfHT from either the exofacial side or the endofacial side of the membrane but not simultaneously. N and C represent the N-terminal and C-terminal &#x003b1;-helical bundles of PfHT. Upon binding glucose, PfHT undergoes a series of conformational changes that allows the translocation of glucose through the central pore and its release from PfHT at the other side of the membrane. Transport is bidirectional and down the concentration gradient.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0216457.g010"/></fig><p>Our identification and initial characterization of a protein modification that appears to alter the conformational dynamics of PfHT has potential clinical relevance. Specifically, stabilization of the outward-facing conformation should increase the overall rate of the glucose transport cycle since there would be more ligand empty transporters primed to bind and transport extracellular glucose molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216457.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Although this would not be a desirable effect in efforts to treat malaria, our FLAG tag salt bridge hypothesis could apply to other mammalian GLUTs where increased activity would be of benefit. For example, augmentation of GLUT1 or GLUT4 intrinsic activity would be advantageous in patients with diabetes mellitus.</p><p>As with previously identified small molecule PfHT inhibitors, significant probing of identified chemical scaffolds via medicinal chemistry will be required to develop these newly identified hit compounds to the stage of lead optimization. The emergence of an expanding list of candidates greatly improves the likelihood of success in this endeavor. An advantage of the Maybridge HitFinder collection is the availability of a large set of &#x0201c;building block&#x0201d; analogs to facilitate this process.</p><p>In addition to significantly expanding the list of chemical scaffolds that can be used in the development of new anti-malarial drugs possessing optimal characteristics of efficacy, safety and durability against the development of resistance, the paradigm of targeting microbial hexose transport has significant potential for broader application. This includes other parasites such as <italic>Leishmania</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and other pathogenic microbes that possess structurally similar and functionally essential hexose transporters [<xref rid="pone.0216457.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. While homologous to mammalian transporters, our current study demonstrates that selective targeting of parasite transporters over human orthologues can be achieved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0216457.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Transcriptional characterization of GLUT family members in hGLUT5- and hGLUT8-overexpressing HEK293-FLIP cells.</title><p>Copies of transcript per nanogram of cDNA for each glucose transporter SLC2A family member in: A) overexpression of hGLUT5 in HEK293-flip cells, B) overexpression of hGLUT8 in HEK293-FLIP cells in which native hGLUT1 expression was knocked down by siRNA as described in Materials and Methods.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0216457.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0216457.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Functional activity of HEK293 cell lines.</title><p>Uptake of (A) radiolabeled 2-DG and (B) radiolabeled fructose in cell lines over-expressing the indicated hexose transporter.
