Assessment of the taxonomic diversity and composition of metagenome samples using amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA marker gene is inexpensive and has been applied to map a wide variety of microbial communities, but it is also subject to bias and lacks sensitivity below the species level. It is known that individual bacterial isolates with identical 16S genes may differ by as much as 15&#x02013;30% in their genomes [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which may include genes with toxin production, antimicrobial, or metabolic functions. Alternatively, metagenomics shotgun sequencing (MGS) of all DNA present in a biological sample can be used for computational prediction of gene functions of sequenced DNA fragments to infer differences in the biological function of microbial communities [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Existing bioinformatics tools to characterize MGS data face bottlenecks owing to the large computational task of comparing millions of short DNA sequences (50&#x02013;200 nucleotides in length) to various databases of known proteins, conserved protein motifs, or annotated genomes. The BLAST [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] method is used to compare DNA sequences (i.e., reads) to a database, requiring hundreds of CPU hours to analyze a typical MGS sample containing hundreds of millions of reads.</p><p>Approaches to overcome this computational bottleneck include the reduction of read data file complexity, e.g., through deduplication or by <italic>de novo</italic> assembly. However, these data reduction methods themselves require substantial computational effort and can introduce significant bias. Furthermore, misassemblies can introduce significant biases because the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) reads correspond to hundreds of bacterial genomes and chimeric contigs can be created [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This is especially true for gut microbiomes, where closely related species with similar genomes are present, and this could be exacerbated in the case where significant gene transfer occurs across species (transposase, phage, and lateral gene transfer). The result of a misassembly is to distort abundance information because genomic sequences could be assembled together, resulting in losing the signal for species present in the sample. In addition, one of the advantages of the mapping approach is that it is possible to recover the presence of a gene even when the coverage for that gene is not sufficient for assembling it. Therefore, gene presence in the sample can be better identified using the raw reads and comparing them with annotation databases, rather than assemblies that make it difficult to ensure that species are not artificially masked during the assembly process.</p><p>Other methods involve the use of faster but less sensitive sequence-matching algorithms such as BLAT [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or RAPSearch (MG-RAST webserver [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), or reduced databases for functional protein identification, thus providing a less precise assay for microbial protein function. However, with the MG-RAST webserver, the wait queue for data processing can be up to several weeks. Carr and Borenstein [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] compared MGS annotation using BLAST with using BWA (a DNA sequence similarity tool very similar to Bowtie), and they conclude that at short evolutionary distances, BWA has a higher precision and recall than BLAST for identifying Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologs, but recall and precision for BWA drops dramatically at greater evolutionary distances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>MGS-Fast algorithm and software implementation</title><p>We created a computationally efficient pipeline for MGS data analysis called MGS-Fast, which combines several data preprocessing steps (read data trimming and filtering of low-quality sequences, removal of human host contaminant sequences) with taxonomic and functional profiling of metagenomic WGS data. The pipeline leverages software broadly used in the bioinformatics community for quality control, taxonomy, DNA sequence alignment, and taxonomic profiling (details in Methods section). The novelty of MGS-Fast lies in the use of stringent DNA-DNA matching to annotated and high-quality bacterial DNA sequences from the integrated reference catalog of the human gut microbiome (IGC) [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The IGC database contains 9&#x02009;,879&#x02009;,896 gut microbe genes with annotations based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). The bioinformatics workflow of MGS-Fast utilizes Bowtie 2 to rapidly map a MGS data set and assign known functions to reads originating from microbial genes, producing counts of KEGG gene orthologs as output. The KEGG counts are then applied to identify differentially abundant microbial gene functions in metagenomics data sets, and separate samples from different patient groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>). The IGC database is precompiled as a Bowtie 2 index that is deployed automatically during installation of MGS-Fast and is also available as a separate download (Availability section). Furthermore, the MGS-Fast pipeline is packaged as preconfigured, ready-to-execute software within a Docker container, which is easy to deploy without bioinformatics expertise through a single command (Supplementary Information: Software Manual). Researchers working with nonhuman MGS gut data can create their own custom database of microbial genes (Methods section) for functional profiling. Once a custumized database is prepared, MGS-Fast allows for parallel processing of multiple WGS metagenomic samples with increased accuracy and reduced computational time for the functional assignment of reads.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1:</label><caption><p>Multidimensional scaling (MDS) abundance plot generated using the R package <italic>edgeR</italic> and a mixture model with a negative binomial distribution, for the KEGG annotations generated by MGS-Fast using as input data from gut microbiomes of healthy patients (HV) and patients with liver cirrhosis (LD).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="giz020fig1"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Data analysis of liver cirrhosis metagenomic samples</title><p>In our study, the MGS-Fast pipeline was used for the analysis of gut microbiome samples from 10 patients with liver cirrhosis and 10 control samples from an earlier study by Qin et al. [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], obtained from the European Nucleotide Archive, accession ERP005860. Upon completion, the pipeline generated gene function abundance counts, with a total of 3,785 KEGG IDs, which was similar to the number (4,801) in the original study by Qin et al. Next, following the recommendations of McMurdie and Holmes [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we analyzed 502 of 3,785 KEGG IDs that had significantly different abundance scores (false discovery rate&#x02013;corrected <italic>P</italic>-value threshold 0.05; Suppl. KEGG-FDR.CSV) as a mixture model with a negative binomial distribution, using the R package <italic>edgeR</italic>, version 3.7 [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To visualize the differences between groups of KEGG ID abundances, we also used <italic>edgeR</italic> to create a multidimensional scaling plot (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>), in which clear separation was observed between the healthy and cirrhosis samples.</p><p>Next, we mapped 502 false discovery rate&#x02013;corrected (0.05) KEGG IDs returned by MGS-Fast to pathways using the KEGG website tools [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We were able to identify functional groups and pathways modules that corresponded closely to the ones found in the original study by Qin et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Specifically, the majority of the pathway modules detected were for membrane transport, including oligopeptide transport systems, in addition to zinc, glutamine, and energy coupling factor transport (complete list in Suppl. file KEGG modules&#x02013;502 KEGG IDs.doc). Furthermore, and as reported in the original study, we found prevalent pathway modules for carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism, including the citrate, Krebs, and Calvin cycles, gluconeogenesis, and glyoxylate and glycolysis cycles. We also observed a set of liver cirrhosis&#x02013;associated markers similarly to Qin et&#x000a0;al., including assimilatory nitrate reduction, denitrification, &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) biosynthesis, and GABA shunt, in addition to heme biosynthesis. The GABA neurotransmitter system is correlated with brain disease [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as a result of liver dysfunction, because of increased GABA levels in the blood have the potential to penetrate the blood&#x02013;brain barrier and cause hepatic encephalopathy. Finally, we also detected a set of pathway modules for ammonia production, which could lead to increases ammonia levels in the blood as described by the original study (Qin et&#x000a0;al. 2014 [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). In this respect, we also found the assimilatory nitrate reduction pathway module to be present, in addition to dissimilatory nitrate reduction and the complete nitrification pathway (Suppl. file KEGG modules&#x02013;502 KEGG IDs.doc).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Comparative pipeline performance and processing times</title><p>The MGS-Fast Docker container was deployed on an 8-CPU Intel Xeon Server supporting hyper-threading for a total of 8 parallel processes ("threads"), in addition to 128&#x000a0;GB RAM memory. This is a high-performance computing server, commonly found in laboratories performing genome sequencing bioinformatics. To compare the computational performance of MGS-Fast with that of other published pipelines for metagenomic annotation, we measured the processing time for each tool in the different pipelines using the patient data sets from our study. To ensure the compatibility of the results, we applied the option "&#x02013;threads 8" or similar for all pipelines (Kraken, GOTTCHA [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and HumanAn2 [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) included in our comparison.

For HumanAn2, we observed that the software generates a bowtie index for the reads in the sample provided as input under a temporary files output directory ($OUTPUT_DIR/$SAMPLENAME_humann2_temp/, also described in its documentation), which might explain the additional time required in comparison to MGS-Fast. The significantly increased time required by Kraken to process the data set is not surprising because in the corresponding publication [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] it was reported that Kraken can process 150,000 reads per minute. With 30 million reads in the ERR526291 data set, it would require &#x02265;200 minutes for the alignment, with additional time for the annotation, writing the output ,and other tasks. Furthermore, the computer server used for running all the software comparisons had ample RAM memory (128 GB), and examination of the Kraken output file revealed that no page faults were reported (this is a built-in feature of the software, where number memory faults minus disk swaps are reported), which, if present, would explain the increased time taken by Kraken. The database constructed by Kraken, using the "kraken-build" command that downloads reference data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, was &#x0223c;164 GB in size. This is more than twice the 70 GB reported in the original 2015 publication,[<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and also reflects the fact that Kraken is a k-mer&#x02013;based aligner and read sizes have increased (in our data set it was 100 base pairs&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 2 paired end), resulting in more k-mers to be compared per read, necessitating increased time to process the sample.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>WGS metagenomic data sets used as controls for MGS-Fast</title><p>We further evaluated the performance of the MGS-Fast pipeline by using a range of metagenomic samples from mouse and human collected across different body sites (e.g., gut, mouth, skin), in addition to environmental samples (e.g., copper mine waste), and negative controls of simulated read data from real or synthetic genomes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

Next, Trimmomatic (Trimmomatic, RRID: SCR_011848; [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], blue rectangle, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>) is used to remove sequencing adapters, primers, and low-quality sequence data. Human host DNA is removed by alignment of reads to the human reference genome using Bowtie 2 (Bowtie, RRID: SCR_005476; [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], left green rectangle, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>), using the human GRCh38 reference genome [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This filtering step retains only the "unmatched" reads corresponding to the metagenome as specified by the "&#x02013;un" (unaligned) option from Bowtie 2. The retained reads are then aligned to the IGC microbiome gene catalog database with Bowtie 2 (right green rectangle, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>), using the "&#x02013;end-to-end &#x02013;sensitive" option, in order to assign KEGG protein function IDs to each read. The IGC database [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] contains &#x0223c;10 million KEGG-annotated microbial genes, collected from 1,267 public human gut microbiome samples plus an additional 922 complete annotated prokaryotic genomes. The software versions included in this workflow are the following: FASTQC 0.11.6, Trimmomatic 0.32.1, Bowtie 2.2.6, and MetaPhlAn 2.5.0 (MetaPhlAn, RRID: SCR_004915) [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], with a default preset of parameters (details in <bold>Supplementary Manual</bold>) that can be easily adjusted and changed by the users through the Galaxy interface.</p><fig id="fig4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4:</label><caption><p>

The script counts the number of reads aligned to each gene ID in the BAM file generated by Bowtie 2 and stores the counts in a 2-column "gene ID&#x02014;abundances" file. The annotations were also parsed from the original IGC/HOMD FASTA files to produce a second file of "gene ID&#x02014;KEGG ID" that was saved as a Python "dictionary" data structure. The gene ID&#x02014;abundances are then read line by line using the Python script, which also loads the dictionary data structure and matches the gene ID&#x02014;abundance list entries with these of the gene ID&#x02014;KEGG ID based on the gene ID. The KEGG IDs of the matching lines from the 2 lists are then used by the script as a key for a new dictionary containing key-value pairs. The value corresponding to the KEGG ID keys of the dictionary is set to the corresponding abundance count; in addition, the count is incremented when the KEGG ID is already present in the dictionary as the lists are parsed. Following all data-processing steps, MGS-Fast prints the KEGG IDs and read counts for each gene in a text file, which is used as input file for the <italic>EdgeR</italic> script that creates abundance plots (&#x0201c;abundance-plot.R,&#x0201d; available at [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). The R script filters out genes with low counts, keeping those rows where the count per million is &#x02265;1 in &#x02265;6 samples. The count per million for mapped reads is essentially counts scaled by the number of fragments sequenced in 1 million. Furthermore, we used the calcNormFactors function from <italic>EdgeR</italic> in our script, which normalizes for RNA composition by finding a set of scaling factors for the library sizes across samples. This essentially rescales the library size, resulting in an "effective" library size, which is then used for abundance calculations. This step helps to remove any further artifacts of read distributions per gene that might be introduced, e.g., at the initial stage of read trimming.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>MGS-Fast pipeline software distribution and data options</title><p>The MGS-Fast pipeline was developed using the workflow canvas of the Galaxy bioinformatics web server (Galaxy, RRID: SCR_006281; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>, [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]), which was first pre-installed and configured to run within a Docker virtual machine container [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The Galaxy web server was chosen because it provides an intuitive web browser interface for nontechnical users. Users can easily access and run the MGS-Fast pipeline via the Galaxy interface, and developers can use the Galaxy workflow canvas to build and modify the pipeline.</p><p>Our goal was to develop a complete software bundle within a Docker container, which includes the MGS-Fast workflow and all required bioinformatics software, in addition to all other software dependencies. The entire pipeline is implemented in a series of steps (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>), which are automated via Galaxy. The users only need to select the input data sets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>), and the Galaxy workflow engine will automatically execute all remaining analysis steps of the pipeline. Furthermore, the input data directory is attached and automatically available through the Galaxy interface when users set up MGS-Fast and specify the data directories (Suppl. Software Manual). Upon completion of an MGS-Fast pipeline run, the users can download all result files or simply view the output within the Galaxy interface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>). Furthermore, users can run MGS-Fast by reconfiguring the analysis steps or rerunning a single tool instead of the whole pipeline.</p><p>MGS-Fast also provides 2 options for users to create custom Bowtie 2 indexes both for filtering host genome reads and for annotating the metagenomic reads. Through the first option users can specify the location of a file containing the sequence of a host genome or metagenome, through a text-based menu during the initial run of the MGS-Fast container (Suppl. Manual). The scripts inside the container will automatically build an index for the provided genome and make it available for use on the Galaxy interface without any futher effort by the user. As a second option, we made an additional pipeline (Suppl. Material) available, which is called "Galaxy-Workflow-Custom_MGS-Fast.ga" and can be imported to an already installed and running MGS-Fast workflow. The custom workflow is identical to the regular workflow used by MGS-Fast but provides users the option to use a FASTA file containing the sequence(s) of the custom genome as input. The Bowtie 2 index for the provided genome is automatically built during the first run of the workflow and is then made available for all subsequent runs. Similarly, users can at any point add additional custom genome indexes, both for filtering host DNA reads and for classifying metagenomes. Users can download host genomes (e.g., mouse reference [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) and also a range of WGS metagenomes from the Joint Genome Institute [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>MGS-Fast can confidently transfer functional annotations from annotated gene databases to sequence reads in metagenomic data sets. For microbial read annotation and assignment of KEGG IDs by alignment to the International Genome Consortium, MGS-Fast uses the Bowtie 2 algorithm requiring by default 90% DNA sequence identity in finding matches. While the DNA to DNA alignment performed by Bowtie 2 is less sensitive than translated BLAST utilizing information from conservative amino acid substitutions, at the 90% level of identity, we only have exact matches from DNA fragments of the same species, or orthologs between closely related species [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We have also considered increasing the sensitivity of our method by changing the Bowtie 2 parameters and including the "&#x02013;very-sensitive-local" parameter or increasing the number of allowed mismatches but decided against it because it would allow less stringent DNA-DNA alignments and more false-positive results. Nonetheless, this option is still available for users because the Bowtie 2 parameters can be easily adjusted through the Galaxy interface when a MGS-Fast pipeline run is initiated. However, caution is required in interpreting the results with increased sensitivity parameters because a high percentage of false-positive alignments will make assignment of metabolic function to metagenomic reads less reliable. In addition to Bowtie 2 our pipeline also provides annotations through MetaPhlAn2, using a database of &#x0223c;1 million unique clade-specific marker genes from 17,000 reference genomes. This enables MGS-Fast to identify taxa within narrow clades, even in the absence of reference genomes for species in the gut community. MetaPhlAn2 enabled us to identify a microbial organism at higher taxonomic levels of genera or family, and we observed identification of 8,931 organisms, of which 6,681 have been annotated by MetaPhlAn at the order taxonomic level.</p><p>Using Docker container technology, we bundled all required software components and the MGS-Fast pipeline as a preconfigured, ready-to use bioinformatics package for performing standardized, automated metagenomics analysis on any desktop or laptop computer running Windows, MacOS, or the Linux operating system. Both the container and source code are publicly available for download (Availability section) and can be easily installed by users without bioinformatics expertise with a single command (<bold>Suppl</bold>. Software Manual). Users can then simply access the MGS-Fast pipeline via the Galaxy interface by entering the network address of the container (made available to the user when the installation is complete) on their web browser. Furthermore, the Docker container can be deployed on the cloud or institutional clusters, where users can run multiple instances of MGS-Fast in parallel in order to process multiple NGS samples, or within a single instance of MGS-Fast using Galaxy's Data Collections input data options.</p><p>Regarding computational performance for large-scale studies, we tested MGS-Fast with a set of Illumina HiSeq 2000 oral microbiome data sets ranging from 1.5 to 11 GB (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) in file size [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Using a computer server with average computational capacity (128 GB, 8-CPU core) the processing time for MGS-Fast ranged from 20 minutes for smaller read sets to 2.5 hours for the larger ones. The cumulative processing time to complete running MGS-Fast for all data sets included in this study was &#x0223c;15 hours (900 min). For large WGS metagenomic studies (100 samples), the complete study can be processed in the course of a few days. While running a single data set at a time on our computer server, we noticed that the hardware capacity was underutilized and decided to implement MGS-Fast analysis in parallel, reducing the total time required to process the data sets included here. In a production setting, where more computational capacity might also be available, researchers could use tens of instances at the same time and efficiently process large-scale data sets.</p><p>We then compared the performance of the compressed BWT&#x02013;Bowtie 2 aligner used for MGS-Fast (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) with Kraken [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and DIAMOND [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which use, respectively, a large in-memory k-mer database and protein-based alignment. The Kraken approach is based on a database of preclassified k-mers, and although it can classify millions of reads in just a few minutes, their memory requirements are usually high, requiring a high-performance, expensive computer server to which some laboratories do not have access in order to complete the analysis. In contrast, MGS-Fast is similar to multiple other published tools in the literature using the more efficient Bowtie 2 index structure, which allows for memory efficiency in storage and increased speed when querying the database [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], as also evidenced by our results in the present study.</p><p>Furthermore, our results are substantiated by the subsequent release by the authors of Kraken of a newer tool called Centrifuge [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which, unlike Kraken and similar to other nucleotide-based classification tools in the literature, also uses the BWT for the genome database. This strategy uses one-tenth the space of a Kraken index for the same database, providing faster classification speed and lower memory requirements, making it possible to perform large-scale metagenomics annotation on a desktop computer. As reported in this study [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], Centrifuge took only 47 minutes on a standard desktop computer to analyze a total of 26 GB of input sequence data, and where Kraken and MegaBLAST required 100 and 25 GB of memory, respectively, for their indexes, Centrifuge requires only 4.2 GB. Similar results have been reported for multifold increased speed in comparison to Kraken with BWT use in PALADIN and Kaiju [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and as reported in these studies an important constraint for Kraken is its memory usage, where the database grows in linear proportion to the number of distinct k-mers in the genomic library (at 12 bytes per k-mer).</p><p>Regarding using nucleotide read alignment versus protein translated search for metagenomic classification, the fact is that amino acid sequences are conserved better at evolutionary distances, leading to more sensitive read classification in the case of distant species or taxa. Both DIAMOND and Kaiju [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] align 6-frame translations of reads against a protein database. Similarly to what was mentioned above, Kaiju indexes the reference protein database using BWT as does our MGS-Fast tool, allowing metagenomic sequences to be searched quickly and with low memory footprint against a large protein database. Given a metagenomic sample and the prebuilt index, Kaiju first translates every read in all 6 reading frames, splitting the read at stop codons. As reported in this study, by using the BWT as an index for the reference protein database, Kaiju classifies up to millions of reads per minute and is typically faster than k-mer&#x02013;based methods such Kraken and Clark [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="sec6"><title>Availability of supporting data and materials</title><p>
