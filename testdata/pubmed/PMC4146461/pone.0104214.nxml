Animals may exhibit short-term physiological tradeoffs between social and individual immunity because the latter is often energetically costly. Genetic tradeoffs between these two traits can also occur if mutations that enhance social immunity diminish individual immunity, or vice versa. Physiological tradeoffs between individual and social immunity have been previously documented in insects, but there has been no study of genetic tradeoffs involving these traits. There is strong evidence that some genes influence both innate immunity and behaviour in social insects &#x02013; a prerequisite for genetic tradeoffs. Quantifying genetic tradeoffs is critical for understanding the evolution of immunity in social insects and for devising effective strategies for breeding disease-resistant pollinator populations. We conducted two experiments to test the hypothesis of a genetic tradeoff between social and individual immunity in the honey bee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>. First, we estimated the relative contribution of genetics to individual variation in innate immunity of honey bee workers, as only heritable traits can experience genetic tradeoffs. Second, we examined if worker bees with hygienic sisters have reduced individual innate immune response. We genotyped several hundred workers from two colonies and found that patriline genotype does not significantly influence the antimicrobial activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph. Further, we did not find a negative correlation between hygienic behaviour and the average antimicrobial activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph across 30 honey bee colonies. Taken together, our work indicates no genetic tradeoffs between hygienic behaviour and innate immunity in honey bees. Our work suggests that using artificial selection to increase hygienic behaviour of honey bee colonies is not expected to concurrently compromise individual innate immunity of worker bees.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>BAH was supported by an Elia Scholarship from York University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yorku.ca">www.yorku.ca</ext-link>).

Moreover, organisms that regularly interact with conspecifics can engage in social behaviors that reduce the loads and transmission rates of pathogens (i.e. social immunity) <xref rid="pone.0104214-Cremer1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. For example, the social ants, bees and wasps, have an impressive array of social immune behaviours, which include grooming, social fever, exclusion of infected individuals, and hygienic behaviour <xref rid="pone.0104214-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-WilsonRich1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Mounting an individual innate immune response is energetically costly, and this cost is hypothesized to result in tradeoffs between innate immunity and other traits important to survival and reproduction over short (i.e. physiological) and long (i.e. evolutionary) timescales <xref rid="pone.0104214-Sheldon1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Physiological tradeoffs between innate and social immunity have been discovered in the sub-social burying beetle <italic>Nicrophorus vespilloides</italic>, who rear their brood on carrion. In this species, adults synthesize antimicrobial enzymes that can be used for personal immunity or for &#x02018;sanitizing&#x02019; the carcass used for brood rearing (i.e. social immunity). The physiological cost of synthesizing antimicrobials in this species leads to a tradeoff between investment in personal immunity or social immunity over short-timescales <xref rid="pone.0104214-Cotter1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Several researchers have also documented physiological tradeoffs between innate immunity and cognitive functions that may be important for social immunity in insects. For example, Mallon et al. <xref rid="pone.0104214-Mallon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> challenged the immune system of honey bees with a non-pathogenic elicitor and found that the resulting innate immune response reduced the bees&#x02019; ability for associative learning. In other words, bees mounting an immune response learn poorly. Similar findings were reported for social bumble bees <xref rid="pone.0104214-Riddell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Alghamdi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This short-term tradeoff between innate immunity and learning may impede social immunity if bees have to learn odor cues of sick sisters for example.</p><p>Tradeoffs between two traits can also occur for genetic reasons. A genetic tradeoff occurs when mutations influence two traits in an antagonistic manner (i.e. antagonistic pleiotropy) <xref rid="pone.0104214-Otto1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, by enhancing one trait and diminishing another. Genetic tradeoffs are uncovered by demonstrating negative associations between two traits among groups of related individuals <xref rid="pone.0104214-Alghamdi2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. For example, Alghamdi et al. <xref rid="pone.0104214-Alghamdi2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> studied the potential for a genetic tradeoff between innate immunity and learning by examining if bumblebees with fast-learning sisters have reduced innate immunity; the authors did not observe this pattern. In other words, healthy bees with fast-learning genotypes do not have reduced innate immunity.</p><p>Although there is some evidence for a physiological tradeoff between social and innate immunity, we know little about the existence of genetic tradeoffs between these two components of the immune system of social insects. Several molecular studies of the honey bee <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> have proven the existence of genes with pleiotropic effects on worker behaviour and innate immunity. For example, Chandrasekaran et al. <xref rid="pone.0104214-Chandrasekaran1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> discovered that the honey bee ortholog of <italic>NF-kB</italic>, is a major transcription factor that globally regulates several thousand genes associated with behaviour of honey bee workers. <italic>NF-kB</italic> is also a key regulator of innate immunity in honey bees and solitary insects <xref rid="pone.0104214-DiPrisco1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Evans2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Further, several genes that are differentially regulated in the brains of worker bees during behavioural maturation also play a molecular role in innate immunity <xref rid="pone.0104214-Zayed1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The presence of pleiotropic genes that influence innate immunity and worker behaviour in honey bees suggests the potential for genetic tradeoffs between these traits in social insects.</p><p>Understanding the genetic relationship between social and innate immunity is critical for understanding the evolution of immunity in social insects. This knowledge is needed to better understand why some social insects, like the honey bee, have a reduced complement of innate immune genes <xref rid="pone.0104214-Evans2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Cotter2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Understanding the genetic relationship between innate and social immunity is also critical for developing effective strategies for managing the health of natural and managed pollinators <xref rid="pone.0104214-vanEngelsdorp1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Furst1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. For example, artificial selection for social immunity is commonly used in the management of honey bee colonies in Europe and North America <xref rid="pone.0104214-Rinderer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Buchler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, but this strategy may actually decrease innate immunity if there is a genetic tradeoff between these two traits in honey bees.</p><p>We conducted two experiments to study genetic tradeoffs between innate immunity and hygienic behaviour &#x02013; an important component of social immunity in honey bees <xref rid="pone.0104214-WilsonRich1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Negative genetic correlations (i.e. tradeoffs) between hygienic behaviour and innate immunity can only occur if both traits are heritable <xref rid="pone.0104214-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. There is overwhelming evidence that hygienic behaviour has high heritability in honey bees <xref rid="pone.0104214-Lapidge1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Oxley1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. There is also evidence of a genetic contribution to variation in disease resistance in honey bee colonies <xref rid="pone.0104214-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104214-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and one study found the expression of an antimicrobial peptide, abaecin, to be heritable in honey bees <xref rid="pone.0104214-Decanini1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, we lack information on the heritability of innate immune function on a broader scale in honey bees. For the first experiment, we genotyped 309 workers from two colonies to determine the broad-sense heritability of the antimicrobial activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph, using a zone of inhibition assay following an immune challenge <xref rid="pone.0104214-Korner1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104214-Laughton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>; this assay was used to demonstrate heritability of innate immune response, and map quantitative trait loci affecting this response in a bumble bee <xref rid="pone.0104214-Wilfert1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Second, we sought to determine if honey bees from hygienic colonies have low individual immunity, and vice versa. To do so, we quantified individual innate immunity and hygienic behaviour across 30 typical managed honey bee colonies. Our study sheds light on the relationship between innate and social immunity in a model eusocial insect, and has important ramifications for using artificial selection to improve the health of managed pollinators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Quantifying innate immune response</title><p>To measure the antimicrobial activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph, we utilized the zone of inhibition assay (ZOI) following injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is a non-pathogenic elicitor of the innate immune system; injecting workers with LPS elicits an immune response leading to the release of anti-pathogenic effector proteins into the hemolymph <xref rid="pone.0104214-Moret1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Laughton2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

We performed the assay by first chilling and lightly restraining worker bees (1-day olds for experiment 1, hive bees for experiment 2; see justification below) and sterilizing their abdomen with a Kimwipe saturated in 70% ethanol. Bees were then injected between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> tergite with 1.5 &#x000b5;l of 0.5 mg/ml LPS dissolved in sterile insect saline solution (128 mM NaCl, 18 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 mM KCl, 2.3 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.2) <xref rid="pone.0104214-Laughton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

Twenty-four hours after LPS injection, bees were again chilled and restrained, and at least 4 ul of hemolymph was collected per bee onto dry-ice <xref rid="pone.0104214-Laughton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. To measure the antibacterial activity of the hemolymph 24 hours after LPS injection, we pipetted 1 ul of hemolymph onto a bacterial plate containing a lawn of <italic>Arthrobacter globiformis</italic>. We grew a liquid bacterial stock using 5 &#x000b5;l of concentrated frozen stock (1.6&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> cells per ml) mixed in 50 ml of sterilized broth solution, and incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 48 hrs <xref rid="pone.0104214-Laughton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. From this stock, 1 ml was used to inoculate 5 ml agar plates. The agar on each plate was also punctured with 10 evenly spaced 2 mm holes to which hemolymph was added before being incubated again at 30&#x000b0;C for 48 hrs.</p><p>To control for plate-to-plate variation in bacteria density, we also added 1 &#x000b5;l of 1&#x02236;200 (high dose) and 1&#x02236;300 (low dose) dilutions of dihydrostreptomycin antibiotic (0.1 g/ml) in 80% glycerol on each plate. The ZOI produced by the two antibiotic controls were highly correlated (p &#x0003c; 5.3&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;&#x02212;13</sup>, r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.75). The plate was incubated at 28&#x000b0;C for 24 hrs, after which the diameter of each zone of inhibition of each sample was measured in triplicate. We standardized the area of the zone of inhibition for each experimental sample by dividing it by the area of the zone of inhibition generated by the high dose of the antibiotic control on each plate. As such, all ZOI measurements are presented as percentage of the antibiotic control.</p><p>We performed a series of experiments to validate that LPS injection is eliciting an immune response in worker bees.

Brood frames were incubated at 33&#x000b0;C, and checked daily for emerging bees. Over a period of several weeks, we quantified the antimicrobial activity of hemolymph extracted from these 1-day-old workers using the ZOI assay described above. 1-day-old workers treated with LPS exhibit a strong inducible immune response relative to non-injected, and sham-injected controls <xref rid="pone.0104214-Laughton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We studied 1-day-old workers for experiment 1 to eliminate the confounding influence of age and behavioural state on worker physiology and gene expression <xref rid="pone.0104214-Zayed2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. To eliminate potential confounds from infection status, only workers that appeared healthy were used in this study; workers with deformed wings or phoretic <italic>Varroa</italic> mites were excluded.

DNA was extracted from one hind leg per bee using Chelex following established protocols <xref rid="pone.0104214-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. We amplified the following hyper-variable microsatellite loci, shown previously to be useful in patriline studies of honey bees <xref rid="pone.0104214-Shaibi1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>: HB-SEX-02, HB-THE-03, AC006, HB-C16-05, HB-SEX-03, HB-C16-01, A024, A107, and A007. We amplified these 9 loci in two multiplex reactions following a published protocol <xref rid="pone.0104214-Shaibi1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The reactions were sent to Genome Qu&#x000e9;bec Innovation Centre at McGill University for automated fragment analysis. We used Genemapper (version 4.0) to designate alleles and call genotypes, which were checked manually for errors and miscalls. We were able to genotype 8 loci (all except A107) in colony c10, and 7 loci (all except A107 and A007) in colony c2. To distinguish patrilines, we first deduced the genotype of the mother queen using the genotypes of her daughters; a heterozygous mother will pass on two alleles at equal frequency to her daughters, while a homozygous mother will pass on a single allele to all of her daughters. After deducing the maternal allele, we estimated the paternal allele at a locus in a worker by subtraction. We assumed that two or more workers with the same paternal haplotype were sired by the same father. We excluded rare patrilines (i.e. with 3 or fewer daughters) because these could arise from genotyping error (16 and 22 workers were excluded from c10 and c2 respectively using this criteria). We used general linear models to determine if colony and patriline have a significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph using the GLM procedure in SAS Ver. 4. We also conducted nested analysis of variance to estimate the variance component associated with patriline and colony, using the NESTED procedure in SAS.

We took before and after pictures, and quantified hygienic behaviour as the percentage of frozen brood removed by workers within 24 hours <xref rid="pone.0104214-Spivak1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>We also quantified the relative amount of mites (<italic>Varroa destructor</italic>) in each colony using the &#x0201c;sugar shake&#x0201d; method <xref rid="pone.0104214-Macedo1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. We placed 250 mL of hive bees (i.e. bees on frames containing brood) into glass jars with 125 mL of fine icing sugar <xref rid="pone.0104214-Macedo1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The jars were shaken until all the bees were coated in sugar; this dislodges phoretic mites into the powdered sugar remaining in the jar <xref rid="pone.0104214-Macedo1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The sugar was collected from the jars, dissolved in hot water, and poured through a fine mesh to trap mites. The number of mites per ml of bees was used for analysis.</p><p>From each colony, we also collected 10 hive bees and assessed the antimicrobial activity of their hemolymph using the ZOI assay; as with experiment 1, only workers that appeared healthy were used in this study; workers with deformed wings or phoretic <italic>Varroa</italic> mites were excluded. The average of the antimicrobial activity from each colony was used to represent the innate immune capacity of the colony. We then conducted linear correlations between colony innate immunity and colony hygienic behaviour using R version 3.0.1 <xref rid="pone.0104214-Team1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We studied hive bees for Experiment 2 because hive bees (i.e. bees performing in-hive activities and not foraging) encompass a subset of workers that perform hygienic behaviour (i.e. hive bees which range in age from 8 to 22 days perform hygienic behaviour <xref rid="pone.0104214-Spivak3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Arathi1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>). Hive bees are also more susceptible to infection, and mount a stronger innate immune response relative to foraging bees <xref rid="pone.0104214-Amdam1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Bull1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.

Although it would have been ideal to collect bees of known age for experiment 2, it was not practical given that the ZOI assay requires live bees and is difficult to perform on hundreds of workers of the same age at the same time. We collected hive bees of unknown age from all colonies in a consistent manner, and the average age of hive bees in hygienic colonies is not expected to differ across our study colonies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Experiment 1: Broad-sense heritability of innate immune response</title><p>We quantified the strength of innate immune response and patriline identity for a total of 309 workers belonging to two colonies (c2 and c10).

First, genetic tradeoffs between two traits can only occur if both are heritable, and if genetic variants that influence one trait have antagonistic effects on the other <xref rid="pone.0104214-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The results of experiment 1 preclude the possibility of a genetic tradeoff between the antimicrobial activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph and the hygienic behaviour of a colony because the antimicrobial activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph had very low and statistically insignificant broad-sense heritability (<italic>H<sup>2</sup>&#x0223c;0</italic>) in our study. It is important to note that this low heritability is unlikely to be caused by low statistical power, for even if we ignore that patriline identity was not a significant factor in the study, or if we restricted our analyses to large patrilines, the variance component associated with this factor was still minuscule. Second, we found no negative phenotypic correlation between the average antimicrobial activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph and hygienic behaviour across 30 typical honey bee colonies. In fact, among older colonies, we observed a significant positive phenotypic correlation between innate immunity and hygienic behaviour; the opposite of what would be predicted from a tradeoff. It is difficult to speculate why older colonies would show a positive relationship between hygienic behaviour and innate immunity, while younger colonies do not. Younger colonies are smaller than older colonies, and small colonies tend to have lower hygienic behaviour relative to large colonies <xref rid="pone.0104214-Spivak4" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>A recent study by Wilson-Rich et al. <xref rid="pone.0104214-WilsonRich2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> found that patriline genetics does not influence two aspects of innate immunity in honey bees: encapsulation response and the phenoloxidase activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph. Our study extends Wilson-Rich et al.&#x02019;s findings by showing that patriline does not substantially influence the antimicrobial activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph. Previous work by Decanini et al. <xref rid="pone.0104214-Decanini1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> found the expression level of the antimicrobial peptide abaecin to be heritable in honey bees. Our finding of low and insignificant broad sense heritability for the antimicrobial activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph is not entirely at odds with Decanini et al.&#x02019;s study because the ZOI assay quantifies the strength of innate immunity at a very broad scale. Many proteins contribute to the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph <xref rid="pone.0104214-MorenoGarcia1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and heritability of expression of a single gene is unlikely to drive heritability of the antimicrobial activity of a worker&#x02019;s hemolymph. We believe that the ZOI assay provides an appropriate high-level measure of innate immune response, and previous authors have demonstrated its utility in quantitative genetic studies of innate immunity in social insects <xref rid="pone.0104214-Wilfert1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Can an evolutionary tradeoff exist without a genetic tradeoff?</title><p>We found no genetic tradeoffs between hygienic behaviour and individual immunity in honey bees, which &#x02013; at first glance &#x02013; appears at odds with several hypothesis invoking an evolutionary tradeoff between individual and social immunity in this species <xref rid="pone.0104214-Evans2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Cotter2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Viljakainen1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Before addressing this important question, we would first like to clarify some definitions because genetic and evolutionary tradeoffs are often used as synonyms <xref rid="pone.0104214-Alghamdi2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Cotter2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Here we define an evolutionary tradeoff as a gain or elaboration of a trait that is correlated with the loss or reduction of another trait over evolutionary timescales (e.g. elaboration of social immunity and reduction in innate immune genes in honey bees). We use the standard quantitative genetic definition of a genetic tradeoff as a negative genetic covariance between two traits due to pleiotropy <xref rid="pone.0104214-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Given these definitions, a genetic tradeoff can lead to an evolutionary tradeoff between two traits assuming that one trait is under directional selection. However, an evolutionary tradeoff may occur without a genetic tradeoff, so long as selection pressures favor evolution of one trait relative to another.</p><p>If social immunity is physiologically less costly than innate immunity <xref rid="pone.0104214-Cotter1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Evans2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Cotter2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and if this physiological cost is not transient (i.e. lasts during the lifetime of an individual), then we would predict stronger positive selection on genes associated with social immunity and a concurrent relaxation of purifying selection on genes associated with innate immunity. Over evolutionary timescales, these different selection regimes should result in higher rates of adaptive phenotypic evolution of social immunity, and an evolutionary decay of superfluous innate immune genes. The honey bee has elaborate social immune defenses, and we&#x02019;ve previously documented high rates of adaptive evolution of genes associated with worker behaviour <xref rid="pone.0104214-Harpur3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Kent1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. We have also shown that many innate immune genes in the honey bee have signatures of relaxed purifying selection <xref rid="pone.0104214-Harpur4" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Our independent population genetic evidence therefore supports the hypothesis of relaxed purifying selection on innate immune genes combined with concurrent positive selection on genes associated with worker behaviour. Given the importance of worker behaviour to colony fitness in honey bees <xref rid="pone.0104214-Harpur3" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, we speculate that physiological tradeoffs <xref rid="pone.0104214-Mallon1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104214-Alghamdi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but not genetic tradeoffs, between innate immunity and cognitive function, result in the elaboration of social immunity and the decay of innate immunity in honey bees over evolutionary timescales.</p><p>In addition to shedding light on the evolution of individual and group immunity in social insects, our findings are relevant for breeding disease-resistant honey bee colonies. Currently, artificial selection of colonies with hygienic behaviour is an effective tool for increasing the health of managed honey bee colonies <xref rid="pone.0104214-Spivak2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Spivak3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104214-Ibrahim1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104214-Spivak6" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. If genetic tradeoffs existed between social and innate immunity, then selection for hygienic behaviour will ultimately compromise the individual innate immunity of worker bees, and may not improve the health of bee colonies on the whole. However, our findings reject the hypothesis of a genetic tradeoff between innate immunity and hygienic behaviour in honey bees. As such, selection for hygienic behaviour is not expected to influence individual innate immunity in managed colonies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0104214.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Summary of different statistical analyses examining the influence of patriline identity on worker ZOI scores using patrilines with different size cutoffs.
