Little is known about cancer stem cells, but there is great interest in understanding their pathogenesis and overall place in tumor progression. In this exciting work, Fujikuni and colleagues performed studies on human gastric cancer cell lines in culture to evaluate the role of CD24, a surface protein known to be overexpressed in various malignancies. The authors suggest that CD24 may be a marker of cancer stem cells mainly in the point of the heterogeneity and that silencing its function decreases aggressive behavior <italic>in vitro</italic>. They also show that hypoxia-induced CD24 upregulation increases cancer cell motility and invasiveness. This work convincingly demonstrates the importance of CD24 in tumor aggressiveness, which may be related to cancer stem cell populations.</p><p>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1111/cas.12522">10.1111/cas.12522</ext-link></p><fig id="d35e67" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="cas0105-0iii-f1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Prognostic value of stromal cell-derived factor 1 expression in patients with gastric cancer after surgical resection</title><p><bold>Page 1447&#x02013;56</bold></p><p>In this decisive study, the researchers attempted to improve risk stratification and survival prediction of gastric cancer patients using a retrospective analysis of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in peritumoral and intratumoral tissue samples. Peritumoral SDF-1 expression correlated positively with tumor invasion depth and lymph node metastasis, whereas intratumoral SDF-1 expression was associated negatively with tumor size, tumor differentiation, tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasisand clinical TNM stage. Excitingly, these levels (high SDF-1 in the peritumoral and low SDF-1 in the tumor) together operated as an independent predictor of survival at both 3 and 5 years. This model has the potential to guide treatment and counseling of gastric cancer patients, a much-needed tool in clinical practice.</p><p>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1111/cas.12531">10.1111/cas.12531</ext-link></p><fig id="d35e81" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="cas0105-0iii-f2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Tumor budding in colorectal carcinoma assessed by cytokeratin immunostaining and budding areas: Possible involvement of c-Met</title><p><bold>Page 1487&#x02013;95</bold></p><p>Colorectal carcinoma is a major cause of death worldwide and represents one of the most common cancers in both men and women. Current staging systems provide valuable prognostic stratification for patients, but advances in cellular and molecular techniques may allow for more accurate risk assessment for individual patients. To this end, Satoh and coworkers analyzed budding/sprouting of invasive cancer cells at the borders of tumors to develop a standardized method of characterizing the phenomenon and to better understand its molecular underpinnings. Retrospectively analyzing surgical samples from 139 patients, the authors report that their scoring system might be used as a predictor for disease free survival. Furthermore, the authors&#x02019; work reveals a role of c-MET expression as a component of the budding process. This study demonstrates a way that a widely used staging system may be improved upon and points to a molecular mechanism for a poorly understood carcinogenic process.</p><p>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1111/cas.12530">10.1111/cas.12530</ext-link></p><fig id="d35e95" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="cas0105-0iii-f3"/></fig></sec></body></article>
