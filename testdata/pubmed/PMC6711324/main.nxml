These mediators also provide novel therapeutic opportunities for treating inflammatory disease. However, the regulation of these molecules following acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this prospective observational study we aimed to profile plasma levels of SPMs in ST-elevation MI (STEMI) patients during the first week following MI. Plasma LM concentrations were measured in patients with STEMI (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;15) at three time points and compared with stable coronary artery disease (CAD; <italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;10) and healthy controls (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;10).</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Our main findings were: (i) Immediately after onset of MI and before peak troponin T levels, STEMI patients had markedly increased levels of SPMs as compared with healthy controls and stable CAD patients, with levels of these mediators declining during follow-up. (ii) The increase in SPMs primarily reflected an increase in docosapentaenoic acid- and docosahexaenoic acid-derived protectins. (iii) Several individual protectins were correlated with the rapid increase in neutrophil counts, but not with CRP. (iv) A shift in 5-LOX activity from the leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> pathway to the pro-resolving RvTs was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>The temporal regulation of SPMs indicates that resolution mechanisms are activated early during STEMI as part of an endogenous mechanism to initiate repair. Thus strategies to boost the activity and/or efficacy of these endogenous mechanisms may represent novel therapeutic opportunities for treatment of patients with MI.</p></sec><sec><title>Fund</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the South-Eastern Norwegian regional health authority, the European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society, and the Barts Charity.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>Resolution</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Specialized pro-resolving mediators</kwd><kwd>Polyunsaturated fatty acids</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0005"><boxed-text id="b0005"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><sec id="s0005"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p id="p0010">MI leads to a sterile inflammatory reaction, a response vital for tissue repair. However, if the inflammation is prolonged and not resolved, it could aggravate tissue damage with unfavorable effects on the myocardium. Indeed, resolution of inflammation is a prerequisite for restoration of tissue integrity and function following MI. Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) are key effectors of resolution of inflammation and are endogenously formed from n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the balance of pro-inflammatory mediators and SPMs regulates the duration and strength of the inflammatory response. To this end, however, the role of SPMs and resolution in acute MI is unexplored in humans. We hypothesized that timely induction and resolution of inflammation is required for optimal MI healing and aimed to profile plasma levels of SPMs in STEMI patients during the first week following MI. The sources searched were all PubMed publications available and the search terms were myocardial infarction and resolution, with emphasis on ST-elevation myocardial infarctions.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0015">This is the first report on the regulation of SPMs during acute MI in humans. Our findings show that pro-resolving mechanisms are increased early during STEMI, indicating that the &#x0201c;inflammation breaks&#x0201d; are activated immediately after MI onset. Our novel findings, along with the existing evidence on resolution mechanisms in inflammatory disease, could represent the start of a new era in relation to targeting inflammation during MI, focusing not only of anti-inflammatory intervention, but also on enhancing the pro-resolving capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="p0020">Our data may lead to new targets for therapy in STEMI, not only focusing on how to down-regulate harmful inflammation, but also on how to enhance resolving and repair mechanisms. Future research should try to identify the most important pathways in these processes and their cellular targets, and if successful, these studies could lead to a new paradigm in the management of these patients.</p></sec><notes notes-type="alt-text" specific-use="for-accessibility" id="al0045"><p>Alt-text: Unlabelled Box</p></notes></boxed-text></p><sec id="s0020"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0025">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide of which atherosclerotic disorders are the most important [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Atherosclerosis is now considered a chronic inflammatory disease, with an interaction between lipids and inflammation as the major characteristic. In clinical studies, increased levels of inflammatory markers are associated with accelerated disease and worsened prognosis following atherosclerotic complications like myocardial infarction (MI) [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. MI leads to a sterile inflammatory reaction involving recruitment of inflammatory cells and activation of inflammatory pathways within the myocardium, responses that are vital for tissue repair [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, if sterile inflammation is prolonged and not resolved, such inflammatory responses could aggravate tissue damage with unfavorable effects on the myocardium. Indeed, resolution of inflammation is a prerequisite for restoration of tissue integrity and function following MI [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM) are key effectors of resolution of inflammation and are endogenously formed from n-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. SPMs are classified according to their n-3 PUFA precursor and further divided into subsets of functional families, such as resolvins (Rv), maresins, and protectins. The balance of pro-inflammatory mediators and SPMs during acute inflammation, like in MI, regulates the duration and strength of the inflammatory response [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Commonly used medications in CVD may influence the levels of these lipid mediators (LM). Thus, while aspirin irreversibly inhibits the ability of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 to form pro-inflammatory LM such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandins" id="ir0005">prostaglandins</ext-link> (PG), aspirin also switches the activity of COX-2 leading to a shift in the LM profile from the inflammation-initiating PG to epimeric forms of the protectins, resolvins, and lipoxins primarily mediating anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">An exaggerated and prolonged inflammatory response after MI has been proposed to be detrimental for cardiac function, both in the short and longer term [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>].

Coronary angiography and PCI were performed in all patients and pharmacological treatment (prehospital, procedural, and secondary preventive treatment) was provided in adherence to prevailing guidelines. The STEMI patients were compared with patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;10) defined as episodes of reversible ischemic chest pain with atherosclerotic plaques demonstrated by coronary angiography. To keep confounding factors at a minimum, patients with developing signs of heart failure within the observation period, other known inflammatory comorbidities (e.g. autoimmune disease, infections, and malignancies), and patients using immune modulating drugs (e.g. steroids) and COX-inhibitors were excluded. Blood samples were also obtained from ten age- and sex-matched apparently healthy controls.

Of note, levels of these fatty acids returned to those measured in healthy volunteers after 1&#x0202f;day.

However, <xref rid="f0045" ref-type="graphic">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref> on circulating free fatty acid levels between the different patient groups show that the levels of all four fatty acids are elevated at baseline in STEMI patient, levels that rapidly return to concentration levels measured in both healthy volunteers and CAD patients. These data suggest that the increases in SPM concentrations are via an upregulation of SPM biosynthetic pathways and not merely reflecting difference in FA availability. Finally, the fact that only the CAD group included diabetic patients (20%) and only the STEMI group included smokers (53%) is clearly a limitation of study, but importantly, patients in these subgroups (diabetic and smokers) did not differ from the other individuals in their respective groups in relation to the individual significantly regulated SPMs (Supplementary table S2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0105"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0150">While data on the regulation of inflammatory pathways during MI is abundant, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report on the regulation of SPMs during acute MI. We show that circulating SPMs are markedly modulated at the onset of STEMI, indicating an early activation of resolution processes during MI. We found that circulating SPM levels peak within hours after onset of MI symptoms, even before the observed maximum release of hsTnT, corresponding with the early neutrophil response in circulation. Moreover, in contrast to this rise in pro-resolving mediators, there was a marked decline in pro-inflammatory PG and TxB<sub>2</sub> throughout the observation period, reflecting the use of aspirin as previously shown by others [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Finally, in contrast to the rapid increase in overall SPM biosynthesis, there seemed to be a delayed shift from pro-inflammatory to pro-resolving LM in the LOX-dependent pathway during STEMI. Our findings show that pro-resolving mechanisms are activated early during STEMI, underscoring that resolution of inflammation is an active and regulated process.</p><p id="p0155">Our observations suggest that post-MI inflammation and wound healing programs are activated in parallel and indicate that the &#x0201c;inflammation breaks&#x0201d; are activated immediately after MI onset. Whereas this is the first report on resolution mediators during the acute phase of STEMI in humans, SPMs have been shown to modulate post-MI wound healing in experimental animal models [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>]. Diminished resolution of inflammation worsened prognosis after experimental MI, as well as promoted plaque instability [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We have reported data in patients with stable CAD showing diminished levels of several SPMs [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and demonstrated the diurnal regulation and lower levels of RvD<sub>n-3 DPA</sub> in CAD patients admitted for PCI [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Herein we extend these findings by showing a much more marked regulation of SPMs in STEMI patients. Also, and most importantly, in contrast to the previously reported decreased RvD1 concentrations in stable atherosclerotic disorders, we found marked up-regulation of several SPMs immediately after onset of symptoms in STEMI patients, with a gradual decline during the first week. In contrast, however, the potential vasculo-protective RvD5<sub>n-3 DPA</sub> was reduced during MI, and therapy that counteract this decrease could be of potential interest in STEMI patients.</p><p id="p0160">The early SPM response in STEMI was mainly driven by the DHA- and n-3 DPA-derived protectin families, and especially PD1, 10<italic>S</italic>,17<italic>S</italic>-diHDA (PDX), PD2<sub>n-3 DPA</sub>, and 10<italic>S</italic>,17<italic>S</italic>-diHDPA were higher in STEMI patients shortly after MI onset. DHA derived protectins are formed via the stereoselective conversion of DHA by 15-LOX, with both PD1 and 10S,17S-diHDA (PDX) carrying anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, 10<italic>S</italic>,17<italic>S</italic>-diHDA (PDX) have been shown to inhibit TxA<sub>2</sub>-induced platelet aggregation [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and during mouse ischemia-reperfusion injury, PD1 administration before ischemia resulted in a reduction in functional and morphological kidney injury [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The n-3 DPA-derived protectins have been found to enhance the resolving capacity of macrophages, partly through induction of efferocytosis and a reprogramming of the macrophage phenotype [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Of note, PD2<sub>n-3 DPA</sub> reduces neutrophil recruitment during sterile inflammation [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and interestingly, in contrast to maresins that are mostly produced by pro-resolving (M2) macrophages, protectins may also be produced by neutrophils [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indeed, herein PD2<sub>n-3 DPA</sub>, as well as PD1, were positively correlated with neutrophil counts shortly after MI onset, and it is tempting to hypothesize that the increase in the protectin levels may represent a counteracting mechanism to dampen the harmful effect of the initial rise in neutrophils following STEMI.</p><p id="p0165">Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 with a subsequent reduced biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory LM. All our patients (STEMI and CAD) received aspirin prior to baseline sampling, and as expected we observed suppressed biosynthesis of COX-1 dependent pro-inflammatory LM in these patients (PGs and TxB<sub>2</sub>). Furthermore, aspirin modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2, where it promotes a shift in COX-2 activity to 15-LOX-like activity, with the consequential biosynthesis of AT-SPMs contributing to additional anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Hence, the effects of low-dose aspirin beyond inhibition of PGs and thromboxane are becoming increasingly apparent. AT-PD1 exhibits significant higher metabolic stability than PD1 [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and in our study AT-PD1 was clearly elevated throughout the observation period. Chiang et al. [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] showed that aspirin administered in doses ranging from 80 to 650&#x0202f;mg for 8&#x0202f;weeks to healthy volunteers both inhibited PG biosynthesis and increased AT-LXA<sub>4</sub> in circulation, the latter a pattern that was also observed when assessing plasma concentrations of STEMI patients when compared to healthy volunteers (Supplementary Table S1). Of note we also found that 1&#x0202f;day after aspirin administration the concentrations of this mediator were markedly reduced. Given that STEMI patients received a single dose of aspirin, these observations are in line with the transient effects that aspirin exerts on changing the activity of leukocyte COX-2. Indeed, at variance to the biological actions of aspirin on platelet COX-1 which last up to 2&#x0202f;weeks since platelet COX-1 is not turned over in these cells, leukocyte COX-2, like many other leukocyte proteins, is turned over and therefore the acetylated protein is readily degraded.</p><p id="p0170">In contrast to the early increase in 15-LOX products, we found a delayed increase in the biosynthesis of the 5-LOX SPMs. While 5-LOX activity may also be increased during the initial stages, this activity produces LTs. Later in the timeline, possibly regulated by protectins, 5-LOX remains in the cytosol where it produces RvTs. Moreover, Fredman et al. [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] also showed decreased levels of 5-LOX SPMs in unstable atherosclerotic lesion in both human samples and murine models of atherosclerosis and one might speculate if the late (1&#x0202f;week after MI) rise in 5-LOX SPMs could inhibit further plaque destabilization. Earlier reports have shown that 5-LOX deletion impairs wound healing and promotes cardiac rupture after MI, indicating a crucial role in post-MI inflammation [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. If peak level was reached within the study observation period, or if the 5-LOX SPMs will continue to rise even further, is at present not clear and the importance of this &#x0201c;second hit&#x0201d; of SPMs needs to be further clarified. Of note, this increase in plasma SPM concentrations in the early phases post MI was linked with an increase in circulating free fatty acid concentrations, however the levels of these fatty acids returned to levels found in both healthy volunteers and CAD patients at a later stage (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="graphic">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Thus, suggesting that underscoring a role selective regulation of these pathways in the latter stages post STEMI. Moreover, whereas the early changes in some of the SPM could be related to a marked increase in neutrophils, the cellular or tissue origin of the late increase in 5-LOX is at present not clear and should be explored in forthcoming studies.</p><sec id="s0110"><label>4.1</label><title>Study limitations</title><p id="p0180">This study has some important limitations. First of all there is a low number of individuals included that limit the impact of our findings. Moreover, the use of aspirin in all patients but not in any controls may clearly have influenced comparative analyses between patients and controls. Furthermore, diet may influence levels of various SPM, and the lack of detailed dietary information of the study population limit the interpretation of the data.
