Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR&#x003b1;) is the high affinity receptor for ATRA that mediates these pro-Th2 effects. We have previously characterized two major human Th2 subpopulations: IL-5- Th2 (IL-5-, IL-4+, IL-13+) and IL-5+ Th2 cells (IL-5+, IL-4+, IL-13+), which represent less and more highly differentiated Th2 cells, respectively. We hypothesized that the pro-Th2 effects of ATRA may differentially affect these Th2 subpopulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Specific cytokine producing Th2 subpopulations were identified using intracellular cytokine staining. Proliferation was measured using the Cell Trace Violet proliferation tracking dye. Apoptotic cells were identified using either annexin-V or active caspase 3 staining. Th2 gene expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>ATRA increased the output of Th2 cells from house dust mite allergen (HDM) specific short-term cell lines, and this enhancement was limited to the IL-5+ Th2 subpopulation. Conversely, the RAR&#x003b1; antagonist Ro415253 decreased Th2 cell output from these cultures, and this effect was again limited to the IL-5+ Th2 subpopulation. ATRA and Ro415253 respectively augmented and inhibited Th2 cell proliferation, and this affect was more pronounced for the IL-5+ vs. IL-5- Th2 subpopulation. ATRA and Ro415253 respectively augmented and inhibited the expression of IL5 in a significant manner, which was not found for IL4 or IL13.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report that the reciprocal regulation of Th2 cytokine expression and proliferation by RAR&#x003b1; modulators are largely limited to modulation of IL-5 gene expression and to proliferation of the highly differentiated IL-5+ Th2 subpopulation. These results suggest that RAR&#x003b1; antagonism is a potential means to therapeutically target allergic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01212016">NCT01212016</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Interleukin 5</kwd><kwd>All-trans retinoic acid</kwd><kwd>T helper 2</kwd><kwd>Retinoic acid receptor alpha</kwd><kwd>House dust mite antigen</kwd><kwd>Retinoic acid response element</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The association between vitamin A and effective immune responses dates back to the early 20th century when vitamin A was described as an &#x0201c;anti-infective agent&#x0201d;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Large placebo controlled studies in vitamin deficient populations in developing countries show that vitamin A supplementation is associated with decreased childhood mortality from diarrheal disease and measles, underscoring the critical role for vitamin A in immunity. Studies on vitamin A deficiency have consistently demonstrated an indispensable role for vitamin A in maintaining host immunity to a variety of pathogens
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Retinoic acid (RA) is the bioactive form of vitamin A; all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is the most abundant form of RA found in the circulation. RA influences immunity via multiple mechanisms. CD4 T cells are the immune component most prominently affected by RA. RA augments the differentiation of inducible T regulatory cells, which is abrogated both in vitro and in vivo in either vitamin A deficiency states or using retinoic acid receptor (RAR) deficient mice
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In vitamin A deficient mice, RA restores CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity, homeostasis, and activation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Previous investigations suggest that retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR&#x003b1;) mediates these RA-induced effects on T cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. ATRA exerts its bioactivity via binding to retinoic acid receptor ligand-activated transcription factors, and ATRA is a high-affinity ligand for retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR&#x003b1;). ATRA binding to RAR monomers then induces hetero-dimerization with retinoid X receptors (RXRs). The RAR-RXR complex in turn binds to retinoic acid response elements (RARE) which are present in the promoters of RA responsive genes and result in gene activation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Th2 cells were initially characterized as expressing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. IL-4 is the major factor driving Th2 differentiation, IgE class switching, and alternative macrophage activation, whereas IL-13 functions as an effector molecule that mediates eosinophilic inflammation, airway hyper-responsiveness, and mucus secretion. IL-5 is the major eosinophil-active cytokine and induces eosinophilopoiesis and eosinophil release from the bone marrow, enhances eosinophil survival, and acts as a costimulator for eosinophil activation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In vivo, vitamin A is associated with eosinophilic tissue inflammation, which is both a protective component of anti-helminth immunity and a major contributor to asthma pathogenesis. Vitamin A deficiency inhibits parasite expulsion due to reduced eosinophilia and IL-5 secretion by antigen-specific lymphocytes in vivo, and vitamin A supplementation restores parasite immunity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Vitamin A deficiency diminishes and high-level vitamin A supplementation restores Th2 cytokines and eosinophilia induced by experimental asthma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>RAR&#x003b1; agonists and RAR&#x003b1; antagonists exert opposite effects on the production of Th2 cytokines by in vitro stimulated T cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We have recently characterized two major subpopulations within the Th2 lineage: IL-5+ Th2, which express IL-5, IL-4, and IL-13, and IL-5- Th2 cells, which only express the latter two cytokines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. IL-5+ Th2 cells are more highly differentiated and have greater pro-inflammatory activity than IL-5- Th2 cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. IL-5+ Th2 cells are tightly linked to blood eosinophilia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Given the known pro-Th2 activity of RA, we sought to determine if RA drives the differentiation of IL-5- Th2 to IL-5+ Th2 cells or otherwise enhances the generation of IL-5+ Th2 cells. Using a variety of human in vitro Th2 model systems, in this work we demonstrate the reciprocal regulation of cytokine production and proliferation by RAR&#x003b1; modulators are specific for the IL-5 gene and these effects are limited to the highly differentiated IL-5+ Th2 cell subpopulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects underwent lymphapheresis (National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Department of Transfusion Medicine), and PBMC were isolated as described

Allergic asthmatic subjects had a minimum one-year history of episodic bronchospasm relieved by &#x003b2;-agonist medications and three or more positive skin test responses (&#x02265;3&#x000a0;mm) out of a panel of 10 aeroallergens.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Th2 polarization cycles were repeated at weekly intervals, where 1&#x000d7;Th2, 2&#x000d7;Th2, and 3&#x000d7;Th2 represent 1, 2, and 3 serial 7d cycles of differentiation. For each 7 d round of stimulation, ATRA/vehicle was added on day 1 and, as replenishment, on day 4 of culture. After differentiation, Th2-polarized cells were cryopreserved in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, and subsequently thawed and recovered in complete media containing IL-2 (50&#x02013;100 U/ml) for at least 24&#x000a0;h prior to RA experiments.</p><p>For proliferation assays, PBMC and Th2-polarized cells were labeled with 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M of Cell Trace Violet proliferation tracking dye (CTV; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to instructions.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To examine the relevance of these findings to allergic disease, we analyzed the effects of ATRA and the inhibitor Ro415253 (Ro41) on house dust-mite antigen (HDM) stimulated PBMC from allergic asthmatic subjects. Cell Trace Violet (CTV) was used to track CD4+ HDM-specific memory Th2 cells, which were identified by gating on CTV<sup>low</sup> cells that had proliferated in response to HDM antigen (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Neither RAR&#x003b1; agonist (ATRA), nor RAR&#x003b1; antagonist (Ro41) significantly affected the total number of CD4 T cells proliferating in response to HDM (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). However, the output of HDM-specific proliferated IL-5+ Th2 cells was dose-dependently enhanced by ATRA, and reciprocally suppressed by Ro41 (Figure&#x000a0;

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We next analyzed HDM-expanded T cells to determine how ATRA and Ro41 affect these Th2 cell subpopulations (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E). RAR&#x003b1; modulators reciprocally regulated Th2 cell output in the IL-5+ Th2 but not IL-5- Th2 subpopulation (Figure&#x000a0;

Additionally, these data demonstrate that RAR&#x003b1; regulates the proliferation of IL-5+ but not IL-5- Th2 cells. These results imply that the highly differentiated IL-5+ effector Th2 cell subpopulation is the primary Th2 cell population affected by RAR&#x003b1; modulators; in contrast, the less differentiated IL-5- Th2 cells were significantly less affected. Both the proliferation of IL-5+ Th2 cells as well as IL5 gene expression was suppressed by the RAR&#x003b1; antagonist Ro41, which suggests that RAR&#x003b1; antagonism might provide a therapeutic approach to inhibit the function of pathogenic pro-inflammatory IL-5+ Th2 cells.</p><p>The ATRA/RAR&#x003b1; pathway is a well-known inducer of Th2 cytokine responses both in vitro and in vivo, working through both T cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our results provide evidence, that among the three major Th2 cytokines, RAR&#x003b1; modulators predominantly regulate IL-5 expression. We and other groups have recently characterized IL-5+ Th2 cells as a more highly-differentiated Th2 subpopulation with greater pro-inflammatory function
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This current work demonstrates that some of the pro-Th2 activity of ATRA is due to increases in Th2 proliferation, particularly that of the IL-5+ Th2 subpopulation. Notably, despite this overall pro-IL-5 activity, ATRA did not enhance Th2 differentiation (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Notably, whereas ATRA promoted IL-5+ Th2 responses, the RAR&#x003b1; antagonist Ro41 actually inhibited IL-5+ Th2 responses. Such inhibition may be due to Ro41 acting as a neutral antagonist blocking RAR&#x003b1; activation by endogenous ATRA in the cell culture media or by Ro41 acting as an inverse agonist
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Notably, the latter activity has not been previously reported for Ro41.</p><p>Previous human studies showing ATRA-induced Th2 cytokine production have utilized PBMC or CD4 T cells activated with polyclonal stimuli
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This study is notable for using allergen specific Th2 cells from allergic asthmatic subjects as well as highly differentiated Th2 cell lines. The use of such pathogenically relevant Th2 cells lines confirm and extend previous observations using mitogen activated PBMC from healthy donors.</p><p>This current work showing ATRA augmentation of pathogenic allergen specific Th2 responses underscores the potential clinical relevance of these findings. RA agonists are available both as prescription and over the counter formulations; these data suggest that RA supplementation may potentially augment Th2 responses and thus promote allergic disease, as observed in the mouse model of asthma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Alternatively, other pathways may augment local ATRA levels by the upregulation of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2, which is required for the biosynthesis of retinoic acid. To that end, Shreffler and colleagues have characterized a previously undescribed peanut protein that upregulates retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 in myeloid dendritic cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>We studied the intrinsic regulation of Th2 cell function (proliferation and cytokine production) by reactivating highly differentiated Th2 cells. Since this culture system utilizes APC-free in vitro differentiated Th2 cells, the ATRA/Ro41-mediated effects are, by definition, mediated by Th2 cell intrinsic mechanisms. Using this APC-free system, ATRA did not augment Th2 differentiation, suggesting that the pro-Th2 effects of RAR&#x003b1; modulation are not through enhanced T cell-intrinsic effects on Th2 differentiation.</p><p>Using either Annexin V or activated caspase 3 to identify apoptotic cells, RAR&#x003b1; modulators did not affect the frequency of apoptosis (Figures&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that ATRA augments Th2 responses by promoting Th2 cell proliferation and gene expression and not through differential modulation of cell death or apoptosis.</p><p>An inherent limitation of studies using pharmacological inhibitors is the potential for off-target effects. Indeed, Ro41 has been shown to activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR-&#x003b3;) at concentrations of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], which is 10-fold greater than the concentrations used in this study. To further address whether off-target effects of Ro41 on PPAR-&#x003b3; could have been responsible for its inhibition of IL-5+ Th2 proliferation, we examined the effect of the PPAR-&#x003b3; agonist GW7845 on Th2 cultures. GW7845 did not have any effect on IL-4, IL-5 or IL-13 expression in these cultures (data not shown). The relatively low concentration of Ro41 used in this study as well as the lack of effect of PPAR-&#x003b3; activators, make it unlikely that Ro41 was acting through off-target effects.</p><p>This apparent direct regulation of Th2 cytokine gene expression by RAR&#x003b1; prompted us to examine if a putative retinoic acid response element (RARE) exists in the promoter regions of Th2 cytokine genes (<italic>IL5p</italic>, <italic>IL4p</italic>, <italic>IL13p</italic>). We thus analyzed the 10&#x000a0;kb genomic DNA sequence of the human IL5, IL4, and IL13 promoters using the University of California Santa Cruz genome browser. We identified a single putative RARE (5&#x02032;-TGGTCACAGTTCA-3&#x02032;) in the human <italic>IL5p</italic> (-825 to -813) but not in the human <italic>IL4p</italic> and <italic>IL13p</italic>, suggesting that IL5 could be a RARE-responsive gene. The genomic location of the <italic>IL5p</italic> putative RARE is comparable between human and rhesus, and similarly, between mouse and rat (Figure&#x000a0;

In all experiments, the magnitude of the effect was most apparent for IL-5 responses. The potent induction by ATRA and reciprocal inhibition of IL-5 by Ro41 supports that these effects are mediated through the RAR&#x003b1; receptor. These data demonstrate that RAR&#x003b1; modulation has a major impact on human Th2 responses and suggests that RAR&#x003b1; may be a potential therapeutic target for anti-Th2 therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>RA: Retinoic acid; ATRA: All-trans retinoic acid; RAR&#x003b1;: Retinoic acid receptor alpha; RXR: Retinoid X receptor; PBMC: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells; HDM: House dust mite; Ag: Antigen; APC: Antigen presenting cells; TCR: T cell receptor; CTV: Cell trace violet; Th2: T helper 2; Ro41: Ro41-5253; RARE: Retinoic acid response element; IL5p: Interleukin 5 gene promoter; IL13p: Interleukin 13 gene promoter; IL4p: Interleukin 4 gene promoter; mRNA: Messenger ribonucleic acid; ICCS: Intracellular cytokine staining; qRT-PCR: Quantitative real time PCR; DMSO: Dimethyl sulfoxide; DMEM: Dulbecco modified eagles medium; FBS: Fetal bovine serum; ANOVA: Analysis of variation; MFI: Mean fluorescence intensity; SEM: Standard error of mean</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CP conceived of the study.
