YY1 is highly expressed in various types of cancers, including prostate cancer. Currently, the mechanism underlying the functional role of YY1 in prostate tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this report, we investigated the functional interplay between YY1 and androgen receptor (AR), and the effect of YY1 on AR-mediated transcription. We found that YY1 physically interacts with AR both in a cell-free system and in cultured cells. YY1 is required for the optimal transcriptional activity of AR in promoting the transcription of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) promoter. However, ectopic YY1 expression in LNCaP cells did not further enhance the reporter driven by the PSA promoter, suggesting an optimal level of YY1 is already established in prostate tumor cells. Consistently, YY1 depletion in LNCaP cells reduced endogenous PSA levels, but overexpressed YY1 did not significantly increase PSA expression. We also observed that YY1-AR interaction is essential to YY1-mediated transcription activity of AR and YY1 is a necessary component in the complex binding to the androgen response element (ARE). Thus, our study demonstrates that YY1 interacts with AR and regulates its transcriptional activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>androgen receptor</kwd><kwd>Yin Yang 1</kwd><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>PSA promoter</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">As a transcription factor, YY1 (Yin Yang 1) either represses or activates gene expression, depending on the recruited cofactors.

Recent studies suggest that YY1 plays a role in PCa development and progression. YY1 is increased in the prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia stage (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Seligson <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Importantly, YY1 is essential to histone methylation mediated by Ezh2 (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Caretti <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) that is an oncogene in prostate tumorigenesis (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bracken <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Moreover, p53 mutations are frequently observed in the late stage of PCa, but not the primary tumors.

As a ligand-regulated transcription factor, AR shares common features with other members of the nuclear receptors. AR protein contains two activation domains (AF-1 and AF-2), a DNA binding domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Dehm and Tindall, 2005</xref>). The binding of androgens changes the conformation of AR and composition of the AR-containing complex, which leads to its translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus. Nuclear AR associates with androgen response elements (AREs) in the promoters and enhancer regions of its target genes, and stimulates their expression (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Dehm and Tindall, 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Due to the crucial role of AR in PCa progression, androgen deprivation is used as a therapeutic approach for patients with advanced PCa (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Sharifi and Farrar, 2006</xref>).

When the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an AR antibody (N-20) and analyzed by Western blot using an HA antibody (F-7), we detected HA-YY1 brought down by the AR antibody in the sample with both plasmids transfected (lane 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). HA-YY1 was not detected if Flag-AR was absent in transfection or a control rabbit IgG replaced the AR antibody (lanes 3 and 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment, when HA antibody (F-7) was used to bring down HA-YY1, Flag-AR could be pulled down when both HA-YY1 and Flag-AR were transfected (lane 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, no such significant amount of Flag-AR could be brought down when the control antibody was used or when Flag-AR was replaced by an empty vector (lanes 2 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We further examined whether endogenous YY1 and AR interact in prostate cells. We immunoprecipitated AR from LNCaP cell lysates using AR antibody N-20 and C-19, recognizing the N- and C-terminal of AR, respectively. YY1 could be coimmunoprecipitated by both AR antibodies, but not the control IgG (lanes 3, 4 vs. 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). AR N-20 antibody could pull down more YY1 than AR C-19, proportional to the AR amounts brought down by them (lower panel).

Again, the amounts of AR brought down by these antibodies were proportional to the levels of immunoprecipitated YY1 (lower panel).</p><p id="P17">We then asked whether the YY1-AR association occurred through direct protein-protein interaction. Since the full length AR was poorly expressed in bacteria, we produced and purified recombinant AR N-terminal (1&#x02013;555, containing AF-1 domain), AR C-terminal (556&#x02013;919, containing DBD, LBD and AF-2 domains), and full length YY1, fused with either 6-histidine tag (His&#x000d7;6) or GST, from <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta cells. First, we incubated His&#x000d7;6-YY1 with GST-AR-N-terminal(1&#x02013;555), GST-AR-C-terminal(556&#x02013;919) and GST alone, followed by the addition and incubation of glutathione-conjugated agarose (Sigma). GST-AR(556&#x02013;919), but not GST or GST-AR(1&#x02013;555), brought down His&#x000d7;6-YY1 (lanes 4 vs. 2 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), which showed a similar intensity to that brought down by GST-p53 (lane 5), as we previously demonstrated (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Sui <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). We also performed a reciprocal binding assay by incubating His&#x000d7;6-AR(556&#x02013;919) with GST-YY1 and GST. We observed that GST-YY1, but not GST alone, could bring down His&#x000d7;6-AR(556&#x02013;919) (lanes 3 vs. 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We mapped the interacting domain of AR on YY1 protein using three GST-YY1 mutants, and observed that YY1(198&#x02013;414) and YY1(331&#x02013;414), but not YY1(1&#x02013;224), interacted with His&#x000d7;6-AR(556&#x02013;919) (lanes 5, 6 vs. 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that AR binding site is located at the C-terminal of YY1. In this experiment, GST-p53 (lane 7) served as a positive control, since p53 directly interacts with AR (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Shenk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>YY1 enhances the transcriptional activity of AR</title><p id="P18">After observing direct YY1-AR interaction, we asked whether YY1 has any regulatory effect on AR-regulated gene expression. We determined the response of the PSA promoter to different YY1 concentrations with or without AR. We transfected 293T cells with PSA-Fluc (300 ng), pcDNA3/Flag-AR (300 ng) and increasing amounts (75, 150 and 300 ng) of pcDNA3/HA-YY1, and cultured the cells with or without the synthetic androgen R1881. While the activation of AR to the PSA promoter was greatly stimulated by R1881 (#8 vs. #2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), HA-YY1 alone also slightly enhanced the PSA promoter regardless of the R1881 presence (#3 vs. #1, and #9 vs. #7). When Flag-AR was cotransfected, an initial amount (75 ng) of HA-YY1 displayed increased transcription in the absence of R1881 compared to HA-YY1 or Flag-AR alone (#4 vs. #3 and #4 vs. #2), but this increase was markedly enhanced by R1881 (#10 vs. #9 and #10 vs. #8), exhibiting a synergistic effect of HA-YY1 and Flag-AR. Strikingly, further YY1 increases (150 and 300 ng) inversely affected this synergistic activation (#5, #6 vs. #4, and #11, #12 vs. #10). Western blot analysis indicated that YY1 increases did not apparently alter AR levels (right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

A representative Western blot analysis of endogenous AR and transfected HA-YY1 is on the right. The results suggested that highly expressed endogenous YY1 in LNCaP cells is sufficient for the optimal activity of AR; hence, ectopically introduced YY1 would not further enhance its activity. Instead, when YY1 increased from 100 to 200 ng, we observed a slight decrease in luciferase activity driven by the PSA promoter, which is consistent with the effects of increased amounts of YY1 in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To determine whether YY1 is required for AR-mediated transcription, we cotransfected LNCaP cells with U6/scrambled siRNA or U6/<italic>yy1</italic> siRNA and 80 ng of PSA-Gluc, with or without R1881.

As we mapped the AR binding domain to the C-terminal of YY1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), we tested the interaction of AR with YY1 chimera 17 (Chi17) that has the second zinc finger of YY1 replaced by a zinc finger from growth factor independence-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Galvin and Shi, 1997</xref>).

We asked if the loss of interaction between YY1-Chi17 and AR could result from a destructive distortion of YY1 conformation after the substitution of its second zinc finger. We therefore tested the binding affinity of YY1-Chi17 with Hdm2 and PIASy, which have been identified by us to interact with the spacer region and Zinc finger domain of YY1, respectively (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Deng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Sui <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).

The result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref> also indicated that, although PIASy binds to the zinc finger region of YY1, the zinc finger 2 is not essential to this interaction.</p><p id="P25">To determine whether YY1-AR interaction is necessary to YY1-mediated transcription activity of AR, we individually transfected pcDNA3/HA-YY1 and pcDNA3/HA-YY1(Chi17) with both PSA-Fluc and pcDNA3/Flag-AR in 293T cells and tested Fluc activity in cell lysates. While HA-YY1 could synergistically stimulate PSA promoter transcription (#3 vs. #1 and #2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), HA-YY1(Chi17) completely lost this function (#3 vs. #4). Comparable expression of HA-YY1 and HA-YY1(Chi17) was demonstrated by Western blots with GAPDH as a control (right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Since YY1 is a transcription factor, we asked whether YY1 could potentially bind to the PSA promoter and whether YY1-DNA interaction could affect AR-mediated PSA transcription. Using an algorithm to search for binding elements of transcriptional factors (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Heinemeyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), we identified a potential YY1 binding site (A<sup>&#x02212;2040</sup>AG<underline>ATGG</underline>TC<sup>&#x02212;2032</sup>) in the PSA promoter. The nucleotides are numbered relative to the transcription start site of PSA mRNA and the underlined &#x0201c;ATGG&#x0201d; is reversely complementary to the core sequence (&#x0201c;CCAT&#x0201d;) of YY1 binding element (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Shi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). To study whether this potential YY1 binding site determined YY1-mediated PSA transcription, we disrupted this site by mutating &#x0201c;A<sup>&#x02212;2040</sup>AG<underline>ATGG</underline>TC<sup>&#x02212;2032</sup>&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;A <sup>&#x02212;2040</sup>AA<underline>CTAG</underline>TC<sup>&#x02212;2032</sup>&#x0201d;, which deleted the YY1 binding elements and introduced a SpeI site (ACTAGT) used in DNA subcloning. Hence, we generated a reporter construct with an YY1-binding site mutated PSA promoter driving Gluc cDNA (designated as &#x0201c;m-PSA-Gluc&#x0201d;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p id="P27">To determine whether YY1-DNA interaction is required for PSA promoter expression, we individually transfected PSA-Gluc and m-PSA-Gluc reporter plasmids into LNCaP cells with or without endogenous YY1 knockdown. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>, wt and m-PSA promoters showed no significant differences in driving Gluc expression, either with or without R1881. Similar results were obtained in 293T cells (data not shown). We also tested the effect of YY1 on an artificial promoter, 3&#x000d7;ARE, which contains three concatemeric repeats of the PSA promoter ARE-I and lacks an YY1 binding element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). In this reporter assay using 3&#x000d7;ARE-Fluc, YY1 knockdown decreased the AR-mediated transcription by 35% (p &#x0003c; 0.01) in the presence of R1881 (#4 vs. #3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>), similar to the YY1's effects on AR-mediated transcription of the endogenous PSA promoter (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>YY1 is required for the AR-ARE-complex</title><p id="P28">We used EMSA to determine whether YY1 regulates AR-ARE association. We first analyzed the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled synthetic probe containing ARE-I of the PSA promoter without or with the incubation of LNCaP cell nuclear extract and detected a slowly migrated band when the nuclear proteins was added (lines 1 vs. 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). This band likely corresponds to an AR-ARE-containing complex, since its intensity increased when the cells were cultured in R1881-containing medium (lanes 3 vs. 2), which enhances AR-ARE association and/or promotes AR expression, and decreased when the unlabeled probe was added to compete with the labeled probe (lanes 4 vs. 3). To further validate the identity of this band, we individually incubated the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled the ARE-I-containing probe and a control probe consisting of a scrambled sequence with the LNCaP cell nuclear extracts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref> (lanes 5 vs. 6), the ARE-I probe exhibited a specific band with the same migration as lane 2, but the control showed mostly nonspecific binding. To confirm the presence of AR in this band, we incubated the labeled ARE-I-containing probe with the nuclear protein extracts of LNCaP cells infected by lentiviruses expressing the scrambled siRNA or the AR siRNA that efficiently knocked down endogenous AR (data not shown). The depletion of AR markedly reduced the intensity of the detected band (lanes 7 vs. 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Therefore, these gel-shift experiments unequivocally indicate that the slowly migrate band, as pointed at the left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, is the AR-ARE-I-containing complex.</p><p id="P29">To determine the presence of YY1 in this AR-ARE-I-containing complex, we pretreated the LNCaP nuclear extracts with YY1 antibodies (13G10 generated from rabbit and H-10 from mouse) prior to the analysis of EMSA.

These results indicate that YY1 is an essential component of the AR-ARE-I-complex, since the association of YY1 and YY1 antibody disrupted the complex formation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">YY1 regulates different epigenetic processes by mediating gene expression and protein modifications. The multifunctional properties of YY1 may explain its elevated expression in different cancers, including PCa. Our current study provided unequivocal evidence of the functional YY1-AR interaction and unveiled another regulatory activity of YY1: acting on AR-mediated transcription through direct protein-protein interaction. Our data suggest that YY1 plays an important role in prostate cell differentiation and PCa development.</p><p id="P31">We and others demonstrated that YY1 enhances Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination/degradation, inhibits p300-mediated p53 acetylation and antagonizes p53's transcriptional activity (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Gronroos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Sui <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In the current studies, we revealed that YY1 promotes AR-mediated transcription without significantly altering its expression and stability. Therefore, YY1 exhibits differential regulatory functions to different proteins. Since YY1 interacts with various transcriptional cofactors, it is possible that the binding of YY1 provides an additional interface to AR-mediated gene expression and determines the components in the AR-containing complex.</p><p id="P32">Ample evidence indicates that YY1 regulates gene expression through recruiting various chromatin remodeling proteins to target promoters. Depending on the recruited cofactors, YY1 can either activate or inhibit gene expression. In the present study, we observed that a medium increase of YY1 in 293T cells could markedly enhance AR-mediated transcription of the PSA promoter. However, further increases in transfected YY1 did not add to, and actually slightly decreased, AR-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, in LNCaP cells, although YY1 knockdown significantly reduced PSA promoter transcription in the presence of R1881, ectopically expressed YY1 did not cause any increased transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We believe that the already high levels of YY1 in prostate cancer cells, such as LNCaP, contribute to the elevated activity of AR. Conversely, instead of promoting AR's function, the further increase in YY1 inversely affects the activity of AR due to the &#x0201c;squelching effect&#x0201d; resulted from an excessive titration of a transcription factor, as described previously by Gill et al (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Gill and Ptashne, 1988</xref>). Consequently, this leads to compromised performance of AR, as shown in the cotransfection experiments in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Based on this observation, we proposed that the regulation of AR by YY1 follows a model schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>. In a condition with an optimal increase of YY1, it is recruited by AR and activates gene expression. In PCa cells that exhibit elevated YY1 expression (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Seligson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), we propose that this recruitment leads to stimulated expression of AR-targeted genes and consequently promotes proliferation of PCa cells. When YY1 is either depleted by siRNA or robustly overexpressed, the expression of AR-targeted genes will be significantly reduced by the absence of YY1 or attenuated due to the squelching effect caused by excessive YY1, respectively.</p><p id="P33">The manner of YY1-regulated transcriptional activity of AR is reminiscent to a reported correlation between YY1 expression and outcomes of prostate cancer patients (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Seligson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In that study, YY1 expression was predominantly elevated in the prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia stage and in tumors from intermediate to high morphologic grade. However, increased YY1 expression in prostate cancer tissues was inversely associated with a higher risk to develop recurrent disease. Therefore, although YY1 could be used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker, its functional role may be either proliferative or antiproliferative, depending on the stages of prostate cancer development and progression.</p><p id="P34">Androgen receptors are critical for the proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells. Current therapeutic approaches in PCa to inhibit AR function include preventing ligand synthesis and using androgen antagonists that bind to AR (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Hirawat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Although these treatments are initially effective, they will eventually fail due to restored AR activity despite the presence of therapeutics. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of AR regulation may provide fundamental support to the therapeutic treatment of PCa. In this study, we demonstrated that YY1 physically interacts with the C-terminal of AR and is essential to the AR-mediated transcription of the PSA promoter. These results imply that YY1 may be an alternative therapeutic target to inhibit AR's activity and PCa development. In addition, the regulation of YY1 to AR's transcriptional activity depends on the YY1-AR interaction but not on the YY1-DNA association, suggesting that YY1 may either mediate the posttranslational modification of AR or act as a cofactor, recruiting other proteins to facilitate AR-mediated transcription. Further investigation is required to delineate whether altered YY1 expression will affect the posttranslational modification of AR and/or the association of AR with other critical transcription cofactors.</p><p id="P35">We have demonstrated that the YY1-AR interaction is important to AR-mediated transcription of the PSA promoter. Whether the direct binding of YY1 to the PSA promoter affects PSA expression is still unclear. Our results indicate that the transcription of the PSA promoter and the artificial 3&#x000d7;ARE-I promoter without any YY1 binding site exhibited similar effects to altered YY1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Thus, it is unlikely that YY1-DNA association is critical to PSA promoter transcription. However, since increased YY1 expression inversely affected AR-mediated transcription, it is also possible that excess YY1 in the nucleus may enhance the YY1-DNA association, in turn reducing transcription of the PSA promoter.</p><p id="P36">Both AR and YY1 are proteins with multiple functions and their regulatory roles in prostate cancer have been indicated by many previous reports. Our current study revealed the functional interplay between these two proteins in PCa cells. We demonstrated that, as a novel AR-interacting protein, YY1 is an essential component of the ARE-complex and crucial in maintaining the AR-mediated transcription. Future study is needed to delineate the mechanism underlying YY1-regulated function of AR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS131157-supplement-1.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e832" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr. Purnima Dubey and Ms. Karen Klein for critical reading of the manuscript.
