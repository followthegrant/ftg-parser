However, little information is available on the relationship between MR-1 expression and the progression of atherosclerosis. Here we report atheroprotective effects of silencing MR-1 in a model of Ang II-accelerated atherosclerosis, characterized by suppression focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-&#x003ba;B) signaling pathway, and atherosclerotic lesion macrophage content. In this model, administration of the siRNA-MR-1 substantially attenuated Ang II-accelerated atherosclerosis with stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques and inhibited FAK, Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and NF-kB activation, which was associated with suppression of inflammatory factor and atherogenic gene expression in the artery. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrated similar changes in Ang II-treated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages: siRNA-MR-1 inhibited the expression levels of proinflammatory factor.

Ang II regulates not only proteolytic enzymes secretion within atherosclerotic plaques but also inflammatory factor secretion within the arterial wall. Furthermore, among the different client proteins modified by Ang II, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-&#x003ba;B) signaling pathways play a critical role in mediating proliferation, migration and inflammation of cells [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the same time, previous studies have been demonstrated that modulation of FAK, Akt, mTOR and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway decreases inflammatory processes and stabilize artery atheromatous plaque in the apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) model of atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that underlie atherosclerosis-related inflammation remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p>Myofibrillogenesis regulator-1 (MR-1) was identified from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library, which encodes a protein of 142 amino acids [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our previous researches showed that silencing MR-1 protected the development of cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial inflammatory injury and inhibited mTOR signaling pathway and the expression of matrix metalloprotein (MMP) 2 induced by Ang II [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ren et al. found that MR-1 modulates proliferation and migration of cells through FAK/Akt signaling pathway [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Li found that overexpression of MR-1 activated NF-&#x003ba;B activation and the proinflammatory factor expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; induced by Ang II [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, whether silencing MR-1 would attenuate Ang II-induced vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis in ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>mice has not been explored. Based on important role of MR-1 in cell proliferation, migration, inflammatory reaction, and signal transduction regulation, we surmised that MR-1 plays an important role in atherosclerosis development induced by Ang II.</p><p>The present study shows significant MR-1 upregulation in the atherosclerotic lesions of ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice induced by Ang II. Silencing MR-1 exhibited decreased atheromatous lesion formation secondary to inactivation of FAK, Akt, mTOR, NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway and alleviation of inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>Eight week-old male ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were obtained from Peking University Health Science Center (purchased from Jackson Laboratory) and fed with regular rodent chow. All of the animal experiments followed the instructions of the Laboratory Animal Management Statute of china Physiological Society. After 1 week of accommodation, mice were randomly divided into the following three groups (n=18 in each group): 1) untreated group served as controls; 2) siRNA-MR-1 injected group received Ang II (Sigma, 2.5 &#x000b5;g/kg/min, dissolved in PBS including 0.01 M acetic acid) by implanted subcutaneous minipump (model 2004; Alza Corp., Mountain View, CA) for 4 weeks; 3) siRNA-control injected group received Ang II (Sigma, 2.5 &#x000b5;g/kg/min, dissolved in PBS including 0.01 M acetic acid) infusing by implanted subcutaneous minipump for 4 weeks. All operation was proceeded under anesthesia with 2.5% avertin (14 &#x000b5;l/g body weight, i.p., Aldrich Chemical Co.). The doses of Ang II and siRNA-MR-1, siRNAcontrol were chosen to mimic previous reports [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Jugular vein injecting were performed during avertin anesthesia in the next day of operation as described previously [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Two weeks later, a second injection was administered in a similar fashion. Animals were sacrificed after 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of atherosclerosis and immunohistochemistry</title><p>After 4 weeks, mice were killed and perfused with 7.5% sucrose in paraformaldehyde. Afterwards, a section of the thoracic aorta fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h (n=6). Then embedded in paraffin and cut into 5 &#x000b5;m serial sections which were prepared every 100 &#x000b5;m. Eight sections were prepared from each animal subject for hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining. For the detection of collagen, the sections were stained with picrosirius red. The plaque area and collagen area were observed and calculated using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). Images were captured with a Sony 3-CCD video camera and analyzed by ImagePro image analysis software. Aortic immunocytochemical analyses were performed with antibodies specific for CD68 and for colocalization studies in mice plaques, MR-1 expressing cells (macrophages and VSMC) were identified by immunofluorescence (CD-68 and &#x003b1;-actin Abs, respectively; Dako) in combination with MR-1 immunoperoxidase (MR-1 polyclonal antibody was generated in our laboratory) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements of blood pressure and metabolic parameters</title><p>Systolic blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography (BP-2000 system; Visitech Systems, Apex, NC) as described previously [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Primary murine VSMC cultures were obtained from ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice aortas and identified by examining the SMC-specific marker alphasmooth muscle (alpha-SM) actin by flow cytometry, and then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% FBS. In the experiments on mTOR signaling, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Sigma) was added to the treatment cells for 24 h. Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma), and the final concentration of DMSO in the treatment medium was 0.1% (vol/vol). Rapamycin was used at the concentrations of 100 nM. The cells cultured without inhibitors contained an equivalent amount of DMSO. After 24 h, the cells were treated with Ang II (100 nM) for 8 h, then the protein expression levels of MR-1, TNF-&#x003b1;, MMP-2, MCP-1, p65 and p-p65 were determined by Western blotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting analysis</title><p>After 4 weeks, mice were killed and the aortas were removed for Western blotting analysis.

Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot revealed a strong increase of MR-1 expression in Ang II+siRNA-control treated mice compared with Ang II+siRNA-MR-1 treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1A and B</xref>). In the same time, Western blot showed that the MR-1 expression levels is induced by Ang II in VSMCs and macrophages compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>).

Now, we investigated the effect of siRNA-MR-1 on these signaling proteins in artery induced by Ang II. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, siRNA-MR-1 decreased the levels of p-FAK, p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-p65 in artery wall induced by Ang II compared with the siRNA-control group.</p><p>In order to determine whether mTOR could interfere with NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway in our experimental conditions, we studied the effect of mTOR on the translocation of p65 to the nucleus which is important to NF-&#x003ba;B activation.

FAK is a member of the focal adhesions that mediates integrin-mediated signal transduction associated with a variety of cellular functions including cellular proliferation, migration, and adhesion. The downstream signaling pathways involved in FAK signaling include the Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) survival pathway, and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. PI3K/Akt controls cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. Our previous studies have found that silencing MR1 could inhibit FAK/Akt signal pathway induced by Ang II [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathways are downstream targets of activated PI3K/Akt. Transcription factors NF-&#x003ba;B controls the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory reaction, and the mTOR plays an important role in cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism. Previous studies has also been suggested that inhibition of mTOR alleviated atherosclerosis and results in the selective elimination of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We found that silencing of MR-1 in an atherosclerotic mouse model induced by Ang II resulted in a decrease of macrophages accumulation and the expression of proinflammatory factor MCP-1, TNF-&#x003b1; and matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2, which mediate the adhesion and recruitment of monocytes into the arterial wall, where they differentiate into macrophages [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, we demonstrated that siRNA-MR-1 reduced the severity of atherosclerosis by decreasing inflammation.</p><p>Macrophages are implicated in the lipoprotein uptake, vascular inflammation and the formation of atherosclerosis but also contributed to plaque destabilization [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Hence, our results suggest that targeting MR-1 to inhibit macrophages accumulation is a promising way for the treatment of the formation of atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic plaque stability. In additon, enhanced inflammation activity was also a hallmark of the formation of atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. Studies have suggested that MMP-2 was markedly increased in unstable plaques, demonstating that MMP-2 is an important risk factor for unstable plaques [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. MCP-1 is highly expressed in macrophage-enriched plaques, suggesting pivotal roles in the processes of atherosclerosis formation and plaque instability [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the same time, TNF-&#x003b1; also could contribute to the atherosclerotic lesion and plaques instability [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The present study shows that the knockdown of MR-1 suppressed atherosclerosis and promoted plaque stability induced by Ang II by decreasing the expression levels of MCP-1, TNF-&#x003b1; and MMP-2, atherosclerotic lesion macrophage content, plaque area and increasing the fibrous cap, which was beneficial for plaque stability. Moreover, it has been shown that mTOR signalling regulates lipid homoeostasis by activating sterol regulatory elementbinding proteins [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Accordingly, suppression of mTOR alleviated lipid metabolism and prevented macrophage accumulation. In our experiments, we demonstrated that silencing MR-1 can inhibite the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and blood glucose. These data indicate that siRNA-MR-1 regulation of lipid homoeostasis is regulated at least in part by mTOR.</p><p>The method of RNAi which efficiently and selectively silences target gene expression has been implicated in experimental studies for the treatment of various diseases. In the present study, we successfully inhibited MR-1 expression in vivo in an atherosclerotic mouse model. In addition, MR-1 promoted the formation of atherosclerosis and plaque instability, including MMP-2, MCP-1 and TNF-&#x003b1; upregulated induced by Ang II. These results indicate that MR-1 is a promising target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by grants from Science and technology project of hunan province department of education (13C251) and the first echelon pillar engineering fund of hunan Environment-Biologic Polytechnic.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions:</bold> W.J.D. designed the entire project and write the articles.
