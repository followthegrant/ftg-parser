Here we report the experimental study of the theoretically predicted piezoelectric effect in triangle monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> devices under isotropic mechanical deformation. The experimental observation indicates that the conductivity of MoS<sub>2</sub> devices can be actively modulated by the piezoelectric charge polarization-induced built-in electric field under strain variation. These polarization charges alter the Schottky barrier height on both contacts, resulting in a barrier height increase with increasing compressive strain and decrease with increasing tensile strain. The underlying mechanism of strain-induced in-plane charge polarization is proposed and discussed using energy band diagrams. In addition, a new type of MoS<sub>2</sub> strain/force sensor built using a monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> triangle is also demonstrated. Our results provide evidence for strain-gating monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> piezotronics, a promising avenue for achieving augmented functionalities in next-generation electronic and mechanical&#x02013;electronic nanodevices.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="i1" xlink:href="ncomms8430-i1.jpg"/>Two-dimensional transition-metal-dichalcogenide materials should have strong piezoelectric properties, making them useful for nanosensors and piezotronics.

Bulk TMDC crystals exhibit a honeycomb structure where adjacent sites occupied by two alternating species are centrosymmetric<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Because of this centrosymmetric structure, piezoelectricity is unexpected in bulk TMDC materials. By scaling TMDC thickness down to monolayer, the structure becomes non-centrosymmetric. Owing to the absence of an inversion centre in its crystalline structure, monolayer TMDC is predicted to be strongly piezoelectric<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Recently, the piezoelectricity of a mechanically exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> flake on a flexible substrate designed for piezotronics and energy conservation was reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In their work, polarization charges are induced along one direction at the zigzag edge under uni-axial strain.

Strain-induced polarization charges are theoretically predicted to accumulate only at zigzag edges under isotropic mechanical deformation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and improved strain-induced piezoelectricity in monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> triangles has not been rigorously investigated to date. Therefore, much experimental confirmation about piezoelectricity in CVD-grown monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> triangle under mechanical deformations is needed. In addition, although the field of semiconducting TMDC-based electronic devices has evolved rapidly, studies on sensor development have been relatively limited<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In spite of the straightforward concept in piezoelectricity, its potential in electromechanical devices remains largely under exploited.</p><p>In the following, we report the experimental study of the piezoelectric effect in CVD-grown monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> triangles under isotropic mechanical deformation. The application on a new piezotronic strain/force sensor that is built using a monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> with high sensitivity is also presented. The highest gauge factor of the monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> strain sensor is &#x0223c;1,160, which is much larger than that of conventional metal sensor (1&#x0223c;5). The working principle of this new type of strain sensor is discussed in comparison with a theoretical model, where polarization charges accumulated at three zigzag edges in the monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> triangle enable multi-directional sensor applications. The discovery of this property in 2D materials enables active sensing, actuating and new electronic components for nanoscale devices based on the well-established piezoelectric effect.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characterization of atomic monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub></title><p>High-quality monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> films were synthesized by CVD method (See Methods).

Oxidized (300&#x02009;nm) silicon substrates with millimetre-sized Au contact pads for electrical measurements were prepared by photolithography. In these standard chips, an 80 &#x000d7; 80&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> central region is prepared for electron beam lithography of nanodevice fabrication. Before transferring the as-synthesized MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer films onto the centre region, the sapphire-capped films were spin-coated with PMMA and immersed into 2&#x02009;M NaOH solution to etch away the sapphire layer. The PMMA-capped MoS<sub>2</sub> was first cleaned by deionized water and placed on the centre region. After removing PMMA, the monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> surface was further cleaned by chloroform. Tapping-mode AFM was used to determine the layer thickness and accurately identify the position of the individual MoS<sub>2</sub> sheets for subsequent <italic>e</italic>-beam lithography. The selected MoS<sub>2</sub> sheets were constantly measured by Raman spectroscopy to confirm the layer number, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>. The measured energy difference between two Raman characteristic peaks at 384.3 and 405.2&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was 20.9&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, indicating that the MoS<sub>2</sub> film had a single-layer structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, consistent with the AFM analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>. Nanoscale Au electrodes made by a standard <italic>e</italic>-beam lithographic technique were placed on top of the triangle MoS<sub>2</sub> sheet, connecting it to the Au contact pads. To study the piezoelectric polarization direction, multiple contact electrodes around the triangle shape were intentionally designed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1c</xref> shows a typical device consisting of a triangular MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer device and several sets of source/drain (<italic>S</italic>&#x02013;<italic>D</italic>) electrodes. The measurement setup for these MoS<sub>2</sub> devices is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, in which the contact-mode AFM was used to apply a controlled mechanical load to the MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mechanical&#x02013;electronic coupling properties of the devices</title><p>To identify the maximum deformation, which could be achieved in these MoS<sub>2</sub> devices, the relationship between the applied force and deformation was measured through AFM-based force spectroscopy using the PeakForce Quantitative Nanomechanical Property Mapping mode. Deformation maps over a 2.5 &#x000d7; 2.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> area in the central region of MoS<sub>2</sub> device shown in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> were acquired under variable mechanical loading forces applied by AFM tip, as seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref> provides the load-dependent deformation of the monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> device. Owing to physical constraints imposed by the underlying substrate, mechanical deformation of the MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer saturated when the applied force exceeded an average of 25&#x02009;nN for all of measured devices. The current&#x02013;voltage (<italic>I&#x02013;V</italic><sub>b</sub>) characteristics of these devices were investigated under variable mechanical loads using the circuit defined by a <italic>S</italic> and <italic>D</italic> as seen in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>. By cycling the applied loading force from 0 to 12.5&#x02009;nN and back to 0&#x02009;nN with the AFM tip in contact with the centre of the denoted area, measured <italic>I&#x02013;V</italic><sub>b</sub> curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> reveal a decrease in current with increasing force and this decrease can be reversed when the strain was released. It can also be clearly seen that the measured current through the device at a fixed voltage (0.55&#x02009;V) monotonically decreased as deformation increased, as shown in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>.</p><p>To further investigate the coupling effect of mechanical deformation and electric field, <italic>I&#x02013;V</italic><sub>b</sub> curves similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref> were acquired in the central region of the sample under variable load, using different <italic>S</italic>&#x02013;<italic>D</italic> electrode pairs as marked in the inset, respectively. It is noted that before the application of a mechanical loading force, different <italic>S</italic>&#x02013;<italic>D</italic> combinations demonstrated small variations in their <italic>I&#x02013;V</italic><sub>b</sub> characteristics with device conductance of the same order of magnitude. We attribute this to differing levels of electron scattering as mobile electrons traverse through different distances. Application of a loading force at the centre of the device results in a significant drop in the measured current that scales directly with the magnitude of the applied force. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3c</xref> displays <italic>I&#x02013;V</italic><sub>b</sub> curves in other two measured electrodes when a bipolar sweep voltage was applied to the device from &#x02212;1 to 1&#x02009;V. The same trend of the current change at the positive and negative bias was obtained. The observation of this phenomenon between all S&#x02013;D combinations indicates that the position and directionality of the measured electrodes are not relevant to the deformation-induced modulation of conductance.</p><p>Along the electron transport path from the S to D electrodes, there is a back-to-back metal&#x02013;semiconductor&#x02013;metal contact. For carrier transport through a metal&#x02013;semiconductor barrier, tunnelling effects dominate when the semiconductor is highly doped, whereas the thermionic emission dominates when the semiconductor is slightly or moderately doped. As the MoS<sub>2</sub> employed in this work is intrinsic <italic>n</italic>-type and the measurements were carried out at room temperature, current through the reversely biased Schottky barrier <italic>&#x003c6;</italic><sub>s</sub> can be given by a classic thermionic emission diffusion theory (for <italic>V</italic>&#x0003e;&#x0003e;3<italic>kT/q</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq1"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e568" xlink:href="ncomms8430-m1.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p><disp-formula id="eq2"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e571" xlink:href="ncomms8430-m2.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>S</italic> is the area of the contact junction, <italic>A</italic>&#x0002a;&#x0002a; is the effective Richardson constant, <italic>q</italic> is the electronic charge, <italic>k</italic> is the Boltzmann constant, <italic>T</italic> is the temperature, <italic>N</italic><sub>D</sub> is the donor impurity density, <italic>V</italic><sub>bi</sub> is the build in potential at the barrier and <italic>k</italic><sub>s</sub> is the permittivity of MoS<sub>2</sub>. To evaluate whether this equation can precisely describe the observed phenomenon, ln<italic>I</italic> is plotted as a function of <italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub><sup>1/4</sup> by using the data provided by the <italic>I</italic>&#x02013;<italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub> curve without strain in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>. The curve shows that the experimental data is fitted well with the linear model. This not only indicates that the thermionic emission&#x02013;diffusion model is the dominant working process in the fabricated devices, but also shows that the theory can be applied to extract the Schottky barrier from experimental data. If <italic>S</italic>, <italic>A</italic>&#x0002a;&#x0002a;, <italic>T</italic> and <italic>N</italic><sub>D</sub> are constant, the barrier height could be retrieved from the ln<italic>I</italic>&#x02013;<italic>V</italic> plot<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Subsequently, the deformation-induced change of Schottky barrier height can be determined by</p><p><disp-formula id="eq3"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e656" xlink:href="ncomms8430-m3.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>I</italic><sub>&#x0025b;</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> are the currents measured through the MoS<sub>2</sub> at a fixed bias with and without being deformed, respectively. The results are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref> for two biases of &#x02212;1 and 1&#x02009;V, indicating that the change of barrier height &#x00394;<italic>&#x003c6;</italic> on <italic>S</italic> and <italic>D</italic> contacts has an approximately linear relationship with applied forces and both the barrier heights at the <italic>S</italic> and <italic>D</italic> contacts were increased with increased deformation. Moreover, the &#x00394;<italic>&#x003c6;</italic> has the same trend at the other bias voltages, which is not very sensitive to the choice of bias voltage.</p><p>To better understand the origin of mechanical tuning of electronic properties in these devices, transport behaviours were compared by applying the mechanical force at distinct spatial locations on the MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a,b</xref> provides the corresponding <italic>I&#x02013;V</italic><sub>b</sub> curves measured at two fixed <italic>S</italic>&#x02013;<italic>D</italic> electrodes, but with the AFM tip in contact at the centre and near the edge of the triangular film, respectively. The results reliably revealed a decrease in the measured current with increasing force applied at the centre (upper inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), but an increase in measured current with increasing force applied near the edge (upper inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>) in all MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer devices. It was anticipated that both tensile and compressive strain result from localized deformation of the MoS<sub>2</sub> monoloayer. The relation between spatially defined deformation and tensile/compressive strain was examined by positioning the AFM tip at various positions across the device as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>. The film can be imagined to be concave under compressive strain when a mechanical load is applied to the central region of the device (lower inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), whereas the surface is convex under tensile strain due to deformation near the edges (lower inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). These two different conditions of deformation position result in two bending cases of the film. According to experimental observations and our interpretation, tensile strain was observed by applying a mechanical load outside the dashed-line triangle region at points indicated by yellow circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>. In contrast, compressive strain occurred when the contact region was inside the dashed-line triangle shape as indicated by green crosses. These observations strongly suggest that the film can be reliably switched between states of compressive and tensile strain.</p><p>The local strain <italic>&#x0025b;</italic> of the monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> can be estimated as:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq4"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e750" xlink:href="ncomms8430-m4.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>E</italic> is Young's modulus, <italic>F</italic> is the applied force and <italic>A</italic> is the cross-sectional area of AFM tip. By approximating the nominal radius of the AFM tip (Bruker ScanAsyst-Air) to be 5&#x02009;nm, the contact area <italic>A</italic> (<italic>&#x003c0;r</italic><sup>2</sup>) is found to be roughly 78.5&#x02009;nm<sup>2</sup>. <italic>E</italic> is known to be &#x0223c;270&#x02009;GPa for monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), thus the strain can be derived by the following equation:</p><p><disp-formula id="eq5"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e785" xlink:href="ncomms8430-m5.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>The relationship between the changes of barrier height &#x00394;<italic>&#x003c6;</italic> and the applied strain can therefore be obtained. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4d</xref> shows the barrier height changes at bias voltage of 1&#x02009;V as a function of strain, indicating that the change of barrier height increases with increasing compressive strain and decreases with increasing tensile strain. The asymmetry relation between compressive and tensile strain can be explained by differences in local strain-induced charge polarization. For the case of local tensile strain near the edge, the induced charge effectively accumulates on the zigzag edge. As compared with the local compressive strain at the centre, the induced charge is likely to be scattered by other electrons/charges during its migration to the zigzag edges. This may be caused by the fact that the barrier height change under tensile strain is different with that under compressive strain.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Strain/force sensor</title><p>To investigate the observed device response towards sensor applications, the induced device current was measured as a function of time at a fixed bias voltage of 1&#x02009;V under a periodically switched applied load. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a,b</xref> shows the time-resolved measurement of the device current response under compressive and tensile strain, controlled by the spatial location of the loading force, respectively. While applying a loading force of 10&#x02009;nN, the measured current is immediately decreased under compressive strain and increased under tensile strain. The response was highly repeatable in many on/off cycles, indicating the stability of the device. The accessibility of multiple steady states in the device, characterized by the measured current under different loading forces (0, 5 and 10&#x02009;nN) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, will enable the development of logic circuit applications based on these triangular MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer devices. The response time of the MoS<sub>2</sub> strain sensor was evaluated as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, in which the rise time and decay time were about 1.79 and 1.23&#x02009;s, respectively. The performance of a strain sensor was also characterized using gauge factor, which is defined as [&#x00394;<italic>&#x00399;</italic>(<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>)/<italic>&#x00399;</italic>(0)]/&#x00394;<italic>&#x0025b;</italic>. The highest gauge factor in our CVD monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> strain sensors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) was &#x0223c;1,160, a value much larger than that of the conventional metal sensors (1&#x0223c;5), graphene (&#x0223c;2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> and doped-Si (&#x0223c;200)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, and even greater than that of the highest reported gauge factor for CNTs (&#x0223c;1,000)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. This increase can be attributed to the piezoelectric polarization and the detailed mechanism discussed in the next section. These results clearly demonstrate the utility of triangular MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer devices as force/strain sensors, to monitor the mechanical changes at the nanoscale range or smaller.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been theoretically reported that due to lack of centrosymmetry in crystal structure, MoS<sub>2</sub> with an odd number of layers under strain will give rise to in-plane piezoelectric polarization charges induced at the zigzag edges<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Here, an AFM tip has been used to apply controlled, local isotropic strain rather than uniaxial strain. In-plane charge polarization radiates circularly from the centre towards the zigzag edges in the case tensile strain, or in an opposite way under compressive strain, instead of along one direction as in the case of uniaxial strain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In the case of a triangular monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> under local isotropic strain, the induced polarization charges are in the presence of three discrete zigzag edges. Band diagrams of triangular monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> piezotronic devices are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>, to explain the underlying working mechanism. First, the presence of metal contacts with the semiconducting monolayer of MoS<sub>2</sub> establishes the same Schottky barriers height (SBH) at both sides of contacts, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>. When connected to an external power supply for electrical measurements, the quasi-Fermi level of the MoS<sub>2</sub> device is raised at one of the contacts as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>. However, the barrier heights at the metal sides on both contacts remain the same. Next, placing the AFM tip in contact with the centre of the triangular MoS<sub>2</sub> device produces local isotropic compressive strain in the monolayer and negative polarization charges are induced at three zigzag edges of the triangular MoS<sub>2</sub>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>. Finally, an induced negative piezopotential at the MoS<sub>2</sub> side depletes free electrons near its interface with the metal, thereby increasing SBHs at both contacts and producing a decrease in the measured current under compressive strain. In contrast, positive polarization charges are induced at the three zigzag edges of the MoS<sub>2</sub> triangle under a local isotropic tensile strain as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>. In the tensile condition, positive-induced polarization charges attract free electrons near the interface between the metals and the MoS<sub>2</sub>, resulting in decreased SBHs at both contacts and an increase in the measured current. The conductivity of the MoS<sub>2</sub> device is clearly sensitive to changes in SBH and the measured current can be readily modulated by strain-induced charge polarization. It is noteworthy that the induced polarization charge with the same sign around three zigzag edges of the triangle MoS<sub>2</sub> is expected to observe symmetrical modulation of carrier transport between any two contacts in this experiment. This was evidently verified in the observed <italic>I&#x02013;V</italic><sub>b</sub> curves (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Based on the proposed mechanism, the piezoelectrically induced transport behaviour has been shown to be robust and reproducible. However, the piezoelectricity of nanomaterials may be affected by many factors, including the geometric size, crystal orientation, temperature, surface piezoelectricity and non-local effects. Although new electromechanical theories have been proposed in recent years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, great efforts are still required to understand the new physics of piezoelectricity in nanomaterials.</p><p>In summary, we have performed a thorough experimental study to confirm the piezoelectricity of CVD-grown triangular monolayers of MoS<sub>2</sub> through the application of local isotropic deformation. The proposed working mechanism was confirmed to be the result of strain-induced in-plane charge polarization at the zigzag edges. These piezoelectric polarization charges alter Schottky barrier heights at both contacts and thus produce a change in conductivity of the MoS<sub>2</sub> devices. A novel strain/force sensor using these MoS<sub>2</sub> devices was also demonstrated. The highest gauge factor was found to be more than 1,000, a value much larger than that of the conventional metal sensors and comparable with that of the highest known gauge factor for CNTs (&#x0223c;600&#x02013;1,000). The merit of these triangular MoS<sub>2</sub> devices lies in their suitability for the development of multi-directional nanoforce detectors. Experimental observations of the piezoelectric effect in 2D materials are expected to enable more applications in new electronic components such as touch sensors, energy generators and bio-integrated systems, as well as through their integration with silicon-based CMOS technology for achieving augmented functionalities.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Growth of atomic monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub></title><p>High-quality monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> films were synthesized by CVD under the following conditions.
