Several studies have indicated that an increase in BDNF levels is associated with neuroprotection and amelioration of neurological signs in animal models of HD. In a recent study, an increase in BDNF mRNA and protein levels was recorded in mice administered recombinant BDNF peripherally. Chronic, indwelling osmotic mini-pumps containing either recombinant BDNF or saline were surgically placed in R6/2 or wild-type mice from 4 weeks of age until euthanasia. Neurological evaluation (paw clasping, rotarod performance, locomotor activity in an open field) was performed. After transcardial perfusion, histological and immunohistochemical studies were performed. We found that BDNF- treated R6/2 mice survived longer and displayed less severe signs of neurological dysfunction than the vehicle treated ones. Primary outcome measures such as brain volume, striatal atrophy, size and morphology of striatal neurons, neuronal intranuclear inclusions and microglial reaction confirmed a neuroprotective effect of the compound. BDNF was effective in increasing significantly the levels of activated CREB and of BDNF the striatal spiny neurons. Moreover, systemically administered BDNF increased the synthesis of BDNF as demonstrated by RT-PCR, and this might account for the beneficial effects observed in this model.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work has been supported by grant RC12C of the Italian Department of Health.

HD pathology is characterized by the formation of intranuclear inclusions of mutated huntingtin in the brain <xref rid="pone.0064037-DiFiglia1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Such inclusions have been shown to interact with and impair the function of a number of transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0064037-Sugars1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Striatum is a brain region which is highly susceptible to neurodegenerative processes. Striatal neurons are prone to undergo cell death induced by acute brain insults such as ischemia and hypoglycemia <xref rid="pone.0064037-Auer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064037-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Interestingly, HD is histopathologically characterized by marked loss of the striatal projection neurons in a way that is similar to that of ischemia <xref rid="pone.0064037-FigueredoCardenas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a major role in the survival of mature neurons in the central nervous system, and in the striatum, in particular <xref rid="pone.0064037-Zuccato1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Striatal projection neurons are particularly vulnerable to neurodegeneration induced by HD. One of the mechanisms underlying such vulnerability is explained by the fact that these neurons do not synthetize sufficient amounts of BDNF, and that striatal BDNF depends on the cortical synthesis and release <xref rid="pone.0064037-Altar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064037-Conner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. BDNF is synthesized by cortical neurons and released in the striatum by cortico-striatal anterograde transport <xref rid="pone.0064037-Altar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064037-Conner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, as very low levels of BDNF mRNA have been demonstrated in the adult rat striatum <xref rid="pone.0064037-Salin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. For this reason, cortical pyramidal neurons function is necessary for an appropriate BDNF supply for the striatum <xref rid="pone.0064037-Zuccato1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, huntingtin directly modulates the expression of neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF)-controlled neuronal genes, including BDNF gene <xref rid="pone.0064037-Zuccato2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Thus, wild-type huntingtin stimulates production of BDNF <xref rid="pone.0064037-PerezNavarro1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, whereas mutant huntingtin decreases it <xref rid="pone.0064037-Zuccato3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In fact, BDNF is decreased in brain tissue from human HD patients <xref rid="pone.0064037-Zuccato3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064037-Ferrer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and in some mice transgenic for mutant huntingtin <xref rid="pone.0064037-Zuccato3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064037-Duan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064037-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Overexpression of BDNF proved protective in the R6/1 mouse model of HD <xref rid="pone.0064037-Gharami1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Indeed, a specific involvement of BDNF was demonstrated in the pathophysiology of the disease: a loss of huntingtin- mediated BDNF gene transcription has been observed both in a mouse model of HD and in HD patients <xref rid="pone.0064037-Zuccato3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Moreover, Canals and coworkers <xref rid="pone.0064037-Canals1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> showed that BDNF knockout mice display an earlier age of onset and more severe motor symptoms.

Other authors <xref rid="pone.0064037-Poduslo1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> showed that BDNF does enter the brain.

Thus, even though the question remains open, there are several lines of evidence that peripherally administered BDNF exerts its effects by entering the BBB.</p><p>Indeed, if BDNF does not penetrate the BBB, it is also possible that peripheral BDNF acts indirectly by increasing the expression of cortical and striatal BDNF. Moreover, it could be possible that peripherally administered BDNF increases the expression of other growth factors, which also activate CREB, which in turn would stimulate BDNF in the cortex and in the striatum.</p><p>Moreover, we demonstrate that, following BDNF administration, BDNF mRNA is increased in the brain, as showed by our RT PCR data. This observation is very important as it suggests the existence of a positive feedback triggered by systemic BDNF.

Tissue was mounted on gelatin-coated slides, cover-slipped with GEL-MOUNT&#x02122; and examined under an epi-illumination fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop 2). A CLSM (Zeiss LSM 700) was used to acquire all the images. <italic>Quantification of microglia staining and statistical analysis.</italic> Images were acquired by using a CLSM (Zeiss LSM 700) laser-scanning confocal microscope under nonsaturating exposure conditions and using the same acquisition settings for all samples. The conditions in term of gain and laser power were selected at levels that allowed optimal visualization of the fluorophore used as secondary antibody and standardized using sections from HC mice. Each image was saved at a resolution of 1024&#x000d7;1024 pixels. These settings were then applied as standards for all subsequent images. By a 40X objective Z-stacks images of striatum from coronal sections were collected using computer-controlled microstepper stage of the confocal microscope. Stacks of images were, then, combined into a single two-dimensional (2D) projection image, exported in TIF file format using NIH ImageJ software and used to quantify the area of histochemically positive tissue for CD68.</p><p>The area of immunolabeling was calculated in each of three separate fields (one dorsolateral, one central and one medial, each 1 mm in diameter) on each hemisphere in each of three rostrocaudally spaced sections from 4 mice from each experimental group (wild-type, wild-type treated with BDNF, R6/2 mice and R6/2 mice treated with BDNF). The data obtained by image analysis were compared by means of one- way ANOVA including the group as main factor. Post hoc pair comparisons were carried out where necessary using HSD Tukey tests. P-values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4h3"><title>3.
