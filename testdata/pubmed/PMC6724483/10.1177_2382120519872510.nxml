In clinical education, there is an emphasis on the integration of basic medical science with clinical practice to provide a higher order of comprehension for future physicians. Also of importance in medical education is the promotion and development of professional behaviors (i.e., teamwork and interpersonal professional behavior). We set out to design and implement a weekly, 2&#x02009;hour educational active learning activity for first-year preclinical medical students to foster knowledge integration and to promote professional development. As part of our case-based curriculum, we used a small-group active-learning approach involving 3 stages: concept mapping, student peer-review, and student group evaluation. Specific learning objectives and behavioral outcomes were designed to focus the learning activities. Rubrics were designed to (1) assess learners&#x02019; group generated concept maps, (2) determine effective student peer review, and (3) appropriate evaluation of group dynamics. In addition to assessment data from the rubrics, course evaluations from participating students were collected. Analysis of rubric assessments and student evaluation data confirmed that there was significant statistical achievement in critical thinking and teamwork among students. Furthermore, when analyzing concept mapping scores between the first and last case, the data displayed significant statistical improvement supporting that student groups were further integrating basic science and clinical concepts. Our concept map-based active-learning approach achieved our designated objectives and outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Group-developed concept mapping</kwd><kwd>peer review</kwd><kwd>interprofessional collaboration</kwd><kwd>collaborative learning</kwd><kwd>faculty facilitation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2382120519872510"><title>Introduction/Background</title><p>Active learning emphasizes active participation in learning and self-awareness of the learning process.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> A current trend in medical education is to move away from traditional passive learning environments toward more active and engaging learning exercises.

The first session was an introduction/training for the learners. The training included the learning theory behind concept mapping, its use in medical training, its high value in enhancing critical thinking, peer review feedback, and use of course rubrics. The remaining sessions involved active learning, developing concept maps on topics which aligned with the didactic lecture portion of the curriculum.

As stated above, all student groups used the CMAP tool software to build their maps, allowing simple concept map submission to faculty.

The student groups shared the feedback review with each other to help improve the maps. Next, each member of the group filled out a group evaluation that gave insight into group dynamics and the ability of the group to collaborate and function cohesively. Finally, a wrap-up session that consisted of the faculty facilitators sharing with the students the &#x0201c;expert&#x0201d; map, created by clinical and biomedical faculty, and discussed what terms or connections the learners may have struggled with as well as address any misconceptions.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2382120519872510"><title>Assessment</title><p>The student groups were assessed on a weekly basis by faculty using specific rubrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2382120519872510">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2382120519872510">2</xref>) on all components of the learning activity for which they were trained with during the first session.

Previous assessment tools for concept maps focused on either map structure (concept hierarchy, number of connections and linking words) or the relationship between concepts by focusing on the propositions created by connecting concepts with linking words.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The faculty-developed rubric assesses overall structure (Organization) while looking deeper into the accuracy of the propositions (Connections, Linking words) without the burden of counting and comparing specific number of connections or linking words; outside of the goal of every concept should be connected to at least 2 others. The encouragement of more than 1 connection between concepts, especially between separate concepts on different sides of the map, can promote new learning and is termed integrative reconciliation.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section7-2382120519872510"><title>Peer review rubric</title><fig id="fig2-2382120519872510" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Rubric to assess student peer feedback.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2382120519872510-fig2"/></fig></sec><sec id="section8-2382120519872510"><title>Course evaluation surveys</title><p>Both precourse and postcourse evaluations were administered to each student cohort.

Most students believed the course would have a positive impact on critical thinking skills (Likert-type scale response 2021 cohort, 4.09 [SE&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.082], n&#x02009;=&#x02009;122; 2022 cohort, 4.13 [SE&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.084], n&#x02009;=&#x02009;117).

As most students reported at the beginning of the course that it would improve critical thinking and by the end of the course that it did encourage critical thinking, this suggests that the second learning objective had been met. In support of this, there was no statistical difference between the precourse and postcourse evaluations for questions related to critical thinking. The second learning objective could also have been met if students did not have a positive perception between concept mapping and critical thinking at the beginning of the course and a more positive outlook on critical thinking by the end of the course. However, our course evaluation data suggest that most students had a positive attitude toward concept mapping enhancing critical thinking both before and after the course. In addition, students were asked on the precourse evaluation &#x0201c;Do you believe this exercise will enhance your ability to work in a group?&#x0201d; with the corresponding postcourse question &#x0201c;To what extent has your ability to work in a group improved?&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2382120519872510">Figure 3</xref>: Q2).

However, both cohorts reached comparable average scores on the final concept maps (2021 cohort, 11.625 [SE&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.157]; 2022 cohort, 11.12 [SE&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.218]). Both cohorts displayed significant improvement on concept map scoring between the first concept map produced and the last (2021 cohort, 24 groups, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02013;5.4, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;37.3; 2022 cohort, 25 groups, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, t&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02013;11.06, df&#x02009;=&#x02009;43.1). Improvement in concept map construction could also be observed in representative student group-created maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2382120519872510">Figure 4</xref>). As students progressed in the course, they displayed better knowledge integration by creating more connections between concepts and provided more complex linking word descriptions, which reinforced content comprehension. These data strongly support the objective to identify and integrate basic science and clinical concepts was achieved.</p><fig id="fig4-2382120519872510" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Representative student group concept maps.

The results of the course evaluations showed that the students thought the course aided in the development of critical thinking skills supporting the achievement of 1 of the 4 stated learning objectives. Critical thinking development using concept mapping has been shown in previous studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, concept map improvement was evident by the increase in the map score averages throughout the semester, suggesting learner groups were able to identify and integrate basic scientific knowledge with clinical medicine and with more complexity. The demonstration of concept integration supports the achievement of the first learning objective listed above (ie, identify and integrate basic science and clinical concepts). To accomplish this objective, learners had to work as a team to create a final product as well as peer-review other group&#x02019;s map. This design permitted us to achieve our last 2 objectives which were the development of skills relating to teamwork and professional interactions as well as provide proper feedback. All of the stated learning objectives were measured through the different rubrics used throughout the course.</p><p>The creation of concept maps can range from complete freedom of map construction by providing no terms to more restrictive approaches by providing a skeleton concept map where students fill in terms or links.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Our approach was intermediate to these methodologies. Within each clinical case, terms were provided and separated into 2 domains, medical science (basic science) and clinical medicine. The student groups had complete freedom to construct concept maps with the provided terms and were encouraged to add more terms and links as they desire. The clinical cases and provided terms were aligned with the didactic lecture curriculum. This approach allowed students to explore and visualize content material that was delivered separately and integrate the information prompted by the clinical case and using concept mapping. Although concept mapping has been used in problem-based medical curricula,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> this is the first report of this active learning method to be engaged and aligned with didactic lecture curriculum for first-year medical students.</p><p>A noteworthy difference between the concept map rubric developed and used here with other rubrics was the emphasis on both the development of web-like organizational structure of the map and increased complexity of descriptors that linked the terms. Concept map assessment rubrics have been developed to score maps with an emphasis on hierarchical structure<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> or focusing on the number and accuracy of links.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The rubric used in this study was modified from Jennings (2012) to assess overall map structure, number of connections, and accuracy of links.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> This challenges the learners not only to make as many connections as possible but also to deeply understand the mechanisms of how the concepts are connected with complex links. Concepts for each clinical case were intentionally chosen by faculty to allow for and promote multiple connections for learners to discover the numerous relationships and connections between basic and clinical science needed for medical practice. Through the process of concept map peer review, continual improvement of knowledge integration could be demonstrated along with weekly formative feedback from faculty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2382120519872510">Figure 3C</xref>). Although the cohorts in this study had different average concept map scores for the first case, they both finished the course with essentially the same final average map scores, suggesting growth of knowledge integration occurred in both cohorts. All groups in both cohorts displayed improvements in concept map rubric scores throughout the term. The improvement of concept map construction was observed as the groups continued to work through the case-based concept mapping sessions. The 2021 cohort had 11 case-based concept mapping sessions, whereas the 2022 cohort worked through 8 cases during the term. The combination of continual use of concept mapping aligned to the curriculum along with the regular formative feedback by faculty and peer review feedback contributed greatly to group performance improvement.</p><p>Development of clinical cases and &#x0201c;expert&#x0201d; concept maps for each case were collaborative efforts between basic science and clinical faculty. The process of using the concept map rubric and providing continual feedback had a positive effect on the faculty-developed concept maps. Using a similar process as students, faculty worked in teams and developed &#x0201c;expert&#x0201d; concept maps that progressed in both complexity and interconnection over a period of 3 consecutive years. This indicated that this approach advanced the maps to further integration and complexity that require higher order thinking. The faculty collaborations highlighted a number of positive outcomes for instructors involved in concept mapping such as motivation, cooperative learning, and articulation of information.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2382120519872510" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section12-2382120519872510"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on our metrics, the implementation of this exercise was successful, and measured progress was achieved regarding all 4 learning objectives. This approach further encourages learners&#x02019; independence and ownership as faculty facilitators had minimal involvement in the student groups&#x02019; construction of maps or the peer review process beyond assessment.
