Fruit temperature and its transpiration vary with environmental factors and fruit characteristics. In line with previous studies, measurements of physical and thermal fruit properties were found to significantly vary between fruit tissues and maturity stages. To study the impact of these variations on fruit temperature and transpiration, a modelling approach was used. A physical model was developed to predict the spatial and temporal variations of fruit temperature and transpiration according to the spatial and temporal variations of environmental factors and thermal and physical fruit properties. Model predictions compared well to temperature measurements on mango fruits, making it possible to accurately simulate the daily temperature variations of the sunny and shaded sides of fruits. Model simulations indicated that fruit development induced an increase in both the temperature gradient within the fruit and fruit water losses, mainly due to fruit expansion. However, the evolution of fruit characteristics has only a very slight impact on the average temperature and the transpiration per surface unit. The importance of temperature and transpiration gradients highlighted in this study made it necessary to take spatial and temporal variations of environmental factors and fruit characteristics into account to model fruit physiology.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The CIRAD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cirad.fr/">http://www.cirad.fr/</ext-link>) has supported this work.

The transpiration flux had the lowest impact on the heat budget of elements on the fruit surface and was negligible in comparison to the other heat fluxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092532-g004">Figures 4E to 4L</xref>).</p><p>The influence of the radiation flux on fruit temperature was particularly evident around 3:00 pm when the low increase in radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092532-g004">Figures 4E to 4L</xref>) induced an increase in temperature at the different fruit positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092532-g004">Figures 4A to 4D</xref>).</p><p>Powers simulated were greater for the sunny side of the fruit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092532-g004">Figures 4I to 4L</xref>) than the shaded one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092532-g004">Figures 4E to 4H</xref>), regardless of the maturity stage. For example, radiation and the convective powers were more than three times higher for the sunny side than for the shaded one at midday, regardless of the maturity stage.</p><p>The analysis of the conductive rate in the fruit centre indicated that during the first part of the day, the surface layers heat the underlying ones since the conductive heat is positive, whereas during the second part of the day, the underlying layers heat the surface layers since the conductive heat is negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092532-g004">Figures 4M to 4P</xref>).</p><p>Patterns of the diurnal changes in the average fruit temperature were quite similar, regardless of the maturity stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092532-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

Daily water losses by transpiration increased with fruit maturity stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092532-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

Fruits at the M1 and M3 maturity stages were considered because they had contrasting sizes.

The daily changes in the distributions of temperature and transpiration showed similar patterns for the two maturity stages. Temperature and transpiration were homogenous before the sun rose, and became more and more variable until the middle of the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0092532-g005">Figures 5C to 5F</xref>). Then, as the sun went down, fruit temperature and transpiration tended to return to the homogenous state observed at the beginning of the day.

The greatest effect of the evolution of fruit properties was found for the total water losses by transpiration since these losses were multiplied by more than 2.8 when taking parameter variations into account. Evolutions of fruit properties had minor effects on the minimum and the average of predicted temperatures, whereas the predicted maximum values of temperature and transpiration per surface unit somewhat increased. The impact of the evolution of a fruit's characteristics in terms of transpiration and temperature were mainly due to its increase in size.

The large inner temperature gradient previously observed by Saudreau et al. <xref rid="pone.0092532-Saudreau1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and the large transpiration gradient should be considered for modelling physiological processes. It was recently suggested that differences in light conditions between the two sides of a mango induce the differences in water and osmotic potentials observed between the sunny and shaded sides of the fruit <xref rid="pone.0092532-Lchaudel3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Since temperature is known to affect enzymatic reaction speed, the temperature gradient is expected to induce differences in substrate and product concentrations within the fruit. Consequently, it would be interesting to determine whether or not the temperature gradient highlighted in this study is related to sugar variations within the fruit, in accordance with relationships established between the accumulation of temperature and sugar content for peach <xref rid="pone.0092532-Gnard2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and mango <xref rid="pone.0092532-Lechaudel1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

The absence of strong effects was due to the weak influence of fruit thermal and physical properties on fruit temperature and transpiration per surface unit, as revealed in the local sensitivity analysis, and to the fact that these properties changed very little during fruit development, as shown by their measurements. Although changes in fruit colour were observed during fruit development and according to the fruit side, peel reflectance was found to increase only slightly during the last maturity stage. The increase in peel reflectance during fruit ripening could be related to the degradation of chlorophyll pigments, which induces the appearance of yellow peel colour <xref rid="pone.0092532-Medlicott1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, as observed for the shaded side in the late development stage. Surprisingly, no difference in the peel reflectance values was found between the two fruit sides, although the sunny fruit side had a pink blush. A purple peel colour was effectively presumed to be related to a higher heat absorbing capacity than a green one <xref rid="pone.0092532-Hetherington1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In fact, the accumulation of anthocyanin pigments is reported to be involved in peel blushing <xref rid="pone.0092532-Proctor1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092532-Honda1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> in response to high irradiance <xref rid="pone.0092532-Steyn1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, and is probably responsible for decreasing peel reflectance. As observed by Ribero Da Luz <xref rid="pone.0092532-RibeirodaLuz1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> for leaves, accumulation of wax on exposed tissues affects optical properties. Therefore, differences in wax accumulation between fruit sides due to sun exposure differences, as observed on grape <xref rid="pone.0092532-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092532-Nordby1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, could explain the absence of differences in reflectance values between the two fruit sides, even if their anthocyanin pigment contents were assumed to be different. Low variations in the peel conductance to water were found with the fruit maturity stages as well. The slight tendency of a decrease in the peel permeability to water with fruit development, regardless of the fruit side, could be explained by the assumed increase in the epicuticular wax per unit skin area <xref rid="pone.0092532-Bally1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092532-Vogg1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> and/or in the wound healing activity around cracks <xref rid="pone.0092532-Gibert1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092532-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. The measured lower peel conductance to water of the sunny side compared to the shaded one would result from the presumably higher accumulation of wax on this side <xref rid="pone.0092532-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092532-Nordby1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Finally, the decrease in the water content during fruit growth <xref rid="pone.0092532-Lechaudel2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> induced only a slight variation in thermal parameters, including heat capacity, thermal conductivity and specific gravity. Only the fruit size increase was found to extend the gradient of fruit temperature and transpiration, mainly due to the expansion in volume.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>Significant variations in thermal and physical properties were measured between mango tissues at several mango maturity stages. To study the impact that mango development has on its temperature and transpiration, a physical model was developed. Model predictions have been satisfactorily compared to fruit temperature and have made it possible to accurately simulate the daily variations of temperature between fruit sides. Model outputs indicated that the average fruit temperature at the growing season scale was not affected by the evolution of the fruit's thermal and physical properties during its development. These results suggested that the calculation of an average temperature of a growing fruit, required, for example, for the calculation of the thermal time sum, can be achieved without taking the evolution of fruit properties into account. However, results indicated that changes in a fruit's properties during its development induced changes in the temperature and transpiration distribution within the fruit. Consequently, to represent the spatial and temporal variability of fruit temperature and transpiration of a growing fruit to model physiological processes such as growth, ripening and quality development, the variations in the fruit's properties during its development, and particularly its size, should be taken into account.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0092532.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
