Lactoferrin (Lf) is a glycoprotein present in milk that has already shown neuroprotective effects through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties on impaired developing brains. The aim of this study was to characterize a rat model of IUGR and assess the neuroprotective effect of a nutritional supplementation with bovine Lf during pregnancy and lactation on this model.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A model of 50% gestational caloric restriction (CR) was used. Three groups were designed, and pregnant rats had either <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food (control group, CTL) or 50% of the controls' intake (restricted group, IUGR). The diet was isocaloric and supplemented with bovine Lf for the caloric restricted dams (restricted-Lf, IUGR_Lf). At postnatal day 7 and 21, advanced <italic>ex-vivo</italic> diffusion MRI techniques at 9.4T were used to investigate brain cortical and white matter microstructure. Further, genes and proteins involved in structure (synaptophysin, MBP), microglia (Iba-1), metabolism (MCT2, &#x003b2;CaMKII) and apoptosis (Bcl-2) were analyzed in the cortex and striatum. In the cortex, the number of parvalbumin immunoreactive interneurons and their perineuronal nets were quantified. Behavioral tests were performed at P31.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Effects of the CR were significant in the cortex and striatum with reduction of synaptophysin (marker of synaptogenesis) at P7 and MBP (marker of myelin) at P21 in the cortex. Indeed, MCT2 (energy metabolism), Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) and &#x003b2;CaMKII (synapse activity) expressions were reduced in IUGR groups at P7. In the striatum NG2 (marker of oligodendrocyte precursor cells) and Bcl-2 at P7 as well as &#x003b2;CaMKII at P21 were decreased following IUGR and restored by Lf. Cortical microstructure was impaired following CR with partial effect of Lf. Lf prevented oxidative stress induced parvalbumin interneurons impairments whereas striatum and external capsule showed alterations in microstructure depicted by diffusion MRI, which were also partially reversed by Lf.</p><p><bold>Discussion and Conclusion:</bold> The model of 50% caloric restriction induced mild impairment partially reversed by nutritional intervention using Lf during pregnancy and lactation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>intrauterine growth restriction</kwd><kwd>caloric restriction</kwd><kwd>lactoferrin</kwd><kwd>neuroprotection</kwd><kwd>magnetic resonance imaging</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001711</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">33CM30-124101/140334</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="9465"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Highlights</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>- Moderate undernutrition induced IUGR demonstrated mild cerebral impairment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Cerebral impairment is characterized by white and gray matters damage depicted by MRI.</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Oral Lf supplementation showed partial neuroprotection following caloric restriction during gestation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>- It represents a promising approach to reduce developmental diseases in IUGR and preterm infants.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>The definition of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) given by world health organization in 1995 was &#x0201c;An infant suffering from IUGR is defined as being below the 10% percentile of the recommended gender-specific birthweight for gestational age reference curves.&#x0201d; It is one of the main causes of developmental brain damage with possible long life neurodevelopmental disabilities. If IUGR is an important public health concern worldwide, the rate of IUGR in the developing countries is about six times higher than in developed countries with at least 30 million IUGR infants per year. Poor antenatal and postnatal nutrition further prevents infants from attaining their full developmental potential. IUGR adults show a higher risk of altered cognitive and executive function and emotion control. The often-associated morbidities of IUGR, prematurity and poor postnatal growth represent a major risk for poor development of affective cognition and psychiatric disorders (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Lactoferrin (Lf), an iron-binding glycoprotein is involved in the intestinal iron uptake and regulates immune response with anti-inflammatory as well as antioxidant property (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In humans, higher concentration of Lf is found in the colostrum but Lf level decreases through lactation period (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). After oral administration, Lf is regulated through binding sites on brain endothelial cells allowing the passage from blood to tissues including the brain (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Lf has been shown to down-regulate inflammation in lipopolysaccharides injury models (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Importantly, Lf nutritional supplement in preterm shows significant reduction in late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Our previous studies explored the effect of Lf on various animal models of perinatal brain injuries. Hypoxic-Ischemic post-natal day 3 (P3) pup rats demonstrated recovery with maternal Lf supplementation during lactation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), characterized by a reduced cortical loss and an altered white matter recovery. Furthermore, inflammatory and apoptotic gene expressions were also reduced (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Following lipopolysaccharides injection at P3, Lf administration during lactation reduced ventriculomegaly as well as impaired microstructure and white matter alterations (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Finally, in a model of dexamethasone induced IUGR mimicking maternal stress and fetal growth restriction, the abnormal levels of brain metabolites as well as major neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were restored with Lf (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that Lf, with its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, has great potential to reduce brain injury, improve cerebral development and prevent noxious programming due to adverse pre and postnatal conditions.</p><p>As such, the aim of this study was to evaluate structural and functional cerebral impairments in gestational caloric restriction induced IUGR as well as the potential neuroprotective effect of Lf supplementation. Effects of caloric restriction were assessed with advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging techniques [diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as well as neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI)] in conjunction with protein and gene expressions and behavioral tests.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animal Preparation</title><p>All experimental protocols have been previously approved by the Animal Research Ethics of Geneva, Switzerland (#GE7115). Nulliparous Wistar female (225&#x02013;250 g) and Wistar male (250&#x02013;275 g) rats (Charles River Laboratories, France) were used for breeding. During gestation, they had either <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food: Control group (CTL) or access to 50% of the controls' intake: Restricted group (IUGR). Bovine lactoferrin (Lf) (Taradon laboratory, Tubize, Belgium) at an expected dose of 1g/kg/day according to daily intake of food by gestating and lactating dams, was added to the diet as a supplementation also during gestation and lactation for the Restricted-Lactoferrin group (IUGR_Lf). From the day before the parturition and during the whole lactation, all dams had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food, with either Lf enriched (1 g/kg/day) or isocaloric diet. Standard animal housing conditions according to the animal facility of the CMU, University of Geneva, were applied with free access to water. At birth, rat pups were culled or boarded out to another dam of the same group in order to control litter size to 10 to 12 pups per dam until weaning day. Dam and pup weight gain were measured daily until weaning and once a week until P42. The number of pups per group is mentioned by experiment separately.

Proteins (25 &#x003bc;g) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed by immunoblotting. All antibodies (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were diluted in blocking buffer containing 0.1% casein (Sigma-Aldrich, C8654). Antibodies were diluted in the concentrations suggested on the data sheet by the manufacturer (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After incubation of the primary antibodies, the following secondary antibodies were applied: goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated with Dylight<sup>TM</sup> 680 (#5470, Cell Signaling Technology), goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with IRDye 800 (926-32210, LI-COR) and donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with IRDye 680 (926-68074, LI-COR). The Odyssey Infra-red Imaging system (LI-COR) was used to visualize the protein bands. The densitometry was assessed by normalizing the optical density of each sample with respect to actin expression (mouse monoclonal anti-actin from Millipore, MAB1501), using Image Studio Lite ver.5.2 software. The results are expressed as a percentage of values obtained either for the control or for the restricted rat pups (100%) using actin as a standard.</p><table-wrap id="T1"

Triple immunolabeling for labeling DNA oxidative damage, parvalbumin (PV), and perineuronal nets (PNNs) was performed as followed. An antibody against 8-oxo-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), a product of DNA oxidation, was used as DNA oxidative marker, while the PNNs were labeled with the lectin <italic>Wisteria floribunda Agglutinin</italic> (WFA), which binds the N-acetylgalactosamines in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Brain sections containing the anterior ACC were first incubated with PBS + Triton 0.3% +sodium azide (1 g/L) containing 2&#x02013;3% normal horse serum, then placed for 48 h in a solution with a mouse monoclonal anti-8-oxodG (1:400; AMS Biotechnology, Switzerland) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-parvalbumin (PV) (1:2,500; Swant Inc., Switzerland) primary antibody together with the biotin-conjugated WFA (1:2,000; Sigma, Switzerland). Sections were then washed, incubated with fluorescent secondary antibody conjugates: goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:300; Life Technologies, USA), goat anti-rabbit CY3 (1:300; Chemicon International, USA) and streptavidin 405 conjugate (1:300; Millipore Corporation, USA). Sections were visualized and processed with a Zeiss confocal microscope equipped with &#x000d7;20 and &#x000d7;40 Plan-NEOFLUAR objectives. All peripherals were controlled with LSM 710 Quasar software (Carl Zeiss AG, Switzerland). With the triple immunolabeling of 8-oxodG, PV, and WFA, Z-stacks of 12 images with &#x000d7;20 objective (with a 1.8 &#x003bc;m interval) were scanned (1,024 &#x000d7; 1,024 pixels). Images were filtered with a Gaussian filter to remove background noise and sharpen cell profile contour. Only the inner 9 images of Z-stacks were used for the analyses. The stack images were merged in a tif file with Imaris. Analyses were performed in a delineated region of interest (ROI) comprising the ACC (mainly cg1 and small portion of cg2) by an observer unaware of the experimental groups. To quantify the overall 8-oxo-dG, the staining intensity and number of labeled voxels within the ROI were measured. For PV-IR cell count, PV cell bodies were counted and their mean intensity of labeling (arbitrary unit) also obtained. To analyze the number of PV+ cells surrounded by WFA labeled PNN (WFA+ PV), we used the same &#x0201c;spots module&#x0201d; used to count PV+ cells to assign spot markings on the profile-labeled voxels that fall within a given size. Briefly, the channels for PV and WFA immunolabeling were chosen, and the profile size criterion (&#x0003e;8 and &#x0003e;5 mm, respectively) was defined to quantify stained profiles above these given sizes. The procedure was visually monitored/verified before proceeding. Spots generated for PV that contacted/overlapped with spots generated for WFA (PNN) were considered as those PVI surrounded by PNN (WFA-positive PVI).</p></sec><sec><title>Behavioral Tests</title><p>Behavioral tests were performed from P31 to P41.

As IUGR is thought to induce a delay in neurodevelopment, we addressed special focus on brain microstructural integrity, cell markers as well as metabolic proteins and gene expressions, which are important in cerebral development and injury. Further investigations were pursued for behavioral deficits. Analyses were performed at P7, P21 and from P31 to P41. P7 corresponds to the near term equivalent age for humans. P21 corresponds to the peak of myelination and cortical maturation providing already good information about the consequences of IUGR and potential Lf neuroprotection. Behavioral tests were performed at a time period where myelination is nearly completed (P31 to 41, preadolescent human equivalent) and as such potential mental disabilities can be observed in children at this time point. Indeed, these tests target behavioral aspects that could be impaired in IUGR children, such as motor activity, attention, memory and anxiety.</p><sec><title>IUGR Model</title><p>Despite any effect of Lf supplementation on the weight of the dams, evidences validated our CR-induced IUGR model as it reduced maternal weight gain during gestation and had long-lasting effect during lactation period. While control dams gained 50% of their initial body weight by the end of gestation, restricted animals gained only 17%. This reduced maternal weight gain was also observed in a previous study using a stress induced model (maternal dexamethasone infusion) during the third week of gestation (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and by others (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Low birth weight in IUGR newborns is considered as a major indicator of prenatal insults. Pups were weighted at P1, and as both restricted diets were isocaloric, it was not expected that nutritional supplementation with Lf would improve low body weight in P1 IUGR pups indicating that offspring birthweight is highly dependent on the maternal food caloric intake during gestation. However, while IUGR pups receiving Lf through lactation caught up control body weight at P7, IUGR catch-up was only observed at P21. This gives rise to a potentially improved early metabolism in IUGR pups receiving Lf. In a placental insufficiency model, pups with moderate IUGR had a catch-up growth at P7, whereas catch-up growth in severe IUGR pups was not reported (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cortical Impairment and Effects of Lactoferrin</title><p>We reported a decrease in cortical synaptophysin expression at P7 in whole cortical homogenate tissue, resulting from caloric restriction. As IUGR neurodevelopment is thought to be delayed due to reduced nutrients during a critical phase of cerebral development (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), the present result suggest that IUGR leads to transient delay in synaptogenesis in the cortex in P7 restricted rats. Similarly in sheep (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), impaired fetal environment was induced by an intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide pro-inflammatory environment and cerebral synaptophysin expression was reported to be decreased in motor, somatosensory and entorhinal cortices causing reduction in density of presynaptical boutons.</p><p>A decrease in beta Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (&#x003b2;CaMKII) expression in the cortex further supports this interpretation. &#x003b2;CaMKII is activated by calcium and is an important kinase targeting substrate responsible for long-term potentiation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> overexpression induced an increase in the number of neurite extensions and in formation of new synapses (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Therefore, it is related to morphology and quantity of synapses (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) by modifying the cytoskeletal structure. Along with our previous results on synaptophysin expression, decrease in &#x003b2;CaMKII emphasizes a potentially altered number/size of synapses and supports a transient delay in synaptic formation and possibly function.</p><p>Myelin basic protein (MBP) is one of the main components of myelin sheath structure and primordial for its formation and compaction and for axonal. In the current study, MBP expression was reduced in the cortex in IUGR pups at P21. Uterine artery ligation IUGR induced models have been widely used to approach white matter damage linked to perinatal impairments such as prematurity or fetal growth restriction observing a similar reduction in MBP density in the corpus callosum and the cingulum, sign of myelination defect (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, cortical expression of Iba-1, a microglial protein, was increased at P21. As it is expressed in both quiescent and amoeboid form and even though it is upregulated by activation (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), we quantified CD68 expression in order to identify properly activated microglial. However, CD68 analysis failed to identify microglial activation induced by IUGR. In a placental insufficiency rat model, inflammatory microgliosis was reported to impair white matter development (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Indeed, using another marker (OX42) for immunohistochemistry, a higher density of microglia was observed in IUGR rats. Taken together, myelin integrity alteration concomitant with increased microglia density are in accordance with others work (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Even though, our current results showed comparatively less microstructural alterations, it may further demonstrate the neuroinflammatory basis for cerebral impaired development in IUGR condition.</p><p>Despite an absence of significant differences, a tendency in the up-regulation of &#x003b2;CaMKII, synaptogenesis and MBP levels was observed in the Lf supplemented group providing evidence for a beneficial effect on cortical development. Indeed, DTI and NODDI derived parameters demonstrated a potential conservation of the microstructure in the cortex at P7 in IUGR_Lf rats compared to IUGR even though at P21 remaining impairments detected by diffusion MRI appeared moderates in the IUGR group. Altogether these results suggest that Lactoferrin reduces the delayed and impaired cortical development following caloric restriction.</p><p>We have demonstrated that redox dysregulation and oxidative stress (genetic or environmental origin) during development, in several animals models relevant to schizophrenia and autism, at microcircuit levels, leads to excitatory-inhibitory imbalance through impairment of the PV inhibitory network and their PNN (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Similar redox dysregulation processes during development, at macrocircuit levels, could underlie impaired oligodendrocytes and delayed cortical myelination (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Parvalbumin immunoreactive (PV-IR) cell, oligodendrocyte and myelination impairment have been reported in schizophrenia (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Abnormal control of redox system could therefore affect neuronal synchronization important for cognitive processing, and also disturb myelination leading to subsequent white matter injuries. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant demonstrated to prevent oxidative stress during development and as such, to protect PVI and PNN. Clinically, several positive effects of NAC have been observed including an improvement of negative symptoms, a decrease of antipsychotics side effects, and an improvement of mismatch negativity and local neural synchronization in chronic schizophrenic psychosis. Recently, Conus et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) observed on early psychosis patients that NAC add-on therapy for 6 months led to significant improvements in neuro-cognition and a reduced positive symptoms in patients presenting high oxidative status.</p><p>In the present study, lactoferrin prevents oxidative stress thus restoring PV-IR cell deficits in ACC of hypocaloric induced IUGR rat pups. Lactoferrin could have prevented oxidative stress and restored PV-IR impairment through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in the same way as NAC does, even without improving MBP expression (myelination). Although beyond the scope of the present study, it may prove vital for the future studies to look into additional functional consequences of hypocaloric induced IUGR, such as mismatch negativity (sensory gating), and fast spiking neuronal synchronization (important for cognitive and social processing), and the effect of lactoferrin supplementation. This would certainly shed additional light on the contribution of a developmental undernutrition in psychiatric disease such as schizophrenia and potential prevention.</p></sec><sec><title>Impaired Microstructure in Striatum and Restoration With Lf</title><p>MR Imaging of the striatum of IUGR pups showed promising improvement of the neurodevelopment with Lf. The striatum is a vulnerable gray matter area in developing brain (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), which was proposed to be especially affected in case of periventricular leukomalacia and may be related to mild motor deficits (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) but also potentially to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In the present study, at P7, microstructural organization was altered or delayed, as depicted by reduction of the neurite density (<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>icvf</italic></sub>) and dispersion of the fibers (ODI) were reduced whereas isotropic volume fraction (<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>iso</italic></sub>) was increased. No changes in cell markers used in the current study were identified, suggesting alterations of arborization/maturation rather than in neuronal or glial reduced populations. No difference in MBP expression was observed, however, the low level of MBP immunostaining of brain sections at early time-point did not allow a structural assessment in the axonal fascicles. Nonetheless, these parameters were normalized with Lf, promoting a better integrity of the striatum in the first week after birth. Similar neuroprotective effect of Lf was observed at longer term (P21) in the striatum following lipopolysaccharide injection in the rat pup (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). MCT 2 expression in the striatum was decreased as observed in the cortex. Similar to the cortex, striatal mRNA expression of Bcl-2 was also downregulated and normalized with the Lf supplementation. As Bax expression was not affected by IUGR, reduction in anti-apoptotic protein presumed an increased apoptotic rate in IUGR condition (Bax/Bcl-2) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). However, no increase in fractin expression was visible. Interestingly, &#x003b2;CaMKII protein expression was reduced in IUGR and restored with Lf at P21. Lactoferrin administration also improved striatal expression of &#x003b2;CaMKII. DTI/NODDI and &#x003b2;CaMKII findings suggest reduced arborization as consequence of IUGR reversed by Lf.</p></sec><sec><title>External Capsule, IUGR Impact on White Matter Tracts, and Repair With Lf</title><p>In external capsule, increased water diffusivity was observed perpendicularly to the main diffusion direction at P7. This abnormal RD was associated with increased <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>iso</italic></sub> and reduced neurite density emphasizing clearly for a defective myelin organization. RD in the external capsule and corpus callosum were also increased in P21 moderate&#x02014;but not in mild&#x02014;IUGR pups after placental insufficiency (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). As it was correlated with poor oligodendrocyte density and an abnormal percentage of unmyelinated axons, RD modification was suggested to result readily from this myelin injury. All these studies related impaired neurodevelopment with alteration in the external capsule around 3 weeks of age. By this time, oligodendrocyte and astrocyte proliferations and maturations stage is likely to be finished. However, in our case, the microstructural alterations of external capsule were observed in P7 pups transiently as almost no difference was measured at P21. Positive effect of Lf at 7 days point was obvious. Our model further argues for a potential delay in myelination process rather than a long-lasting injury.</p><p>Neuroprotection with Lf was assessed in the inflammatory (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and hypoxic-ischemic (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) models, as well as in the present CR model. While partial normalization was observed in the case of brain inflammation, diffusivities were fully normalized in the hypoxic-ischemic injured brain, such as the RD in the present study. Supplementation with Lf appeared to improve impaired white matter formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitation of IUGR Impact and Neuroprotection by Lf</title><p>The present study further illustrates the complexity of the IUGR condition, which depends on the timing, the severity, the heterogeneity of risk factors and pathways potentially impaired that are mimicked by various animal models. Maternal stress, placental insufficiency and undernutrition mimicking-models were all reported to interfere with fetal trajectory growth but altered pathways are very likely to differ depending on the risk factor (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Our present model, moderate undernutrition, using a 50% caloric restriction during gestation, is likely to induce a mild and transient impairment to the neurodevelopment despite the IUGR phenotype. We believe that part of the non-significant changes seen in the model and the partial Lf neuroprotection are due to the mild IUGR model used. It is important to notice that mild IUGR has been also reported in humans with moderate but depicted developmental impairments (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). It is important to notice that this model mimics one type of environmental risk which is necessary but not sufficient by itself alone to reproduce fully the clinical phenotypes. One may need the combination with genetic risks as well. As such, the mildness of the model is evident and may be responsible for absence of behavioral impairments. Furthermore, behavior evaluation was made at childhood age before adulthood where psychiatric symptoms generally occur following IUGR including social problems, poor cognitive performances, anxiety, and schizophrenia (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Notice that, due to the variability of the caloric restriction model and according to the high number of different techniques used in this study, number of pups in each group was not large enough to assess possible gender differences but it is point to consider in further experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we show that IUGR induced by moderate undernutrition demonstrated mild cerebral impairments. Cortical synaptogenesis and myelination were potentially delayed. Striatal microstructure showed alterations. The white matter integrity assessed in the external capsule presented abnormal development. Lf supplementation showed beneficial restoration in the cortex, in the striatum microstructure and in the white matter organization of the external capsule. Further Lf showed reduced oxidative stress in ACA interneurons. This model does not fully represent the clinical situation as IUGR newborns often cumulate adverse conditions in addition to IUGR, such as hypoxia-ischemia or infection/inflammation. Nevertheless, oral Lf supplementation showed partial neuroprotection in this CR IUGR model. This is also neuroprotective against hypoxia-ischemia and inflammation in the developing brain, and thus represents a very promising tool to reduce developmental diseases in IUGR and preterm infants.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors participated to the design of the study.
