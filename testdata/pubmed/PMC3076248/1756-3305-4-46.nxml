Seven of them dropped from the study for different reasons. Among those study participants that completed their follow-up, 69 were classified under the category of adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). However, the remaining 11 cases were considered as under treatment failure mainly due to recurrence of parasitemia on day 7 (four patients), day 14 (six patients), and day 21 (one patient). The age of all cases of treatment failures was found to be less than 20 years. The load of parasitemia of patients with treatment failure on day of admission (4709.4/&#x003bc;l) was higher than day of recurrence (372.37/&#x003bc;l).

It is recommended that all concerned bodies should act aggressively before further expansion of the current drug resistant malaria.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The efficacies of anti-malarial drugs have been challenged by the emergence of drug resistant strains of <italic>Plasmodium </italic>parasites. For more than 50 years, chloroquine (CQ) was the drug of choice for effective treatment of uncomplicated malaria of all species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Resistance to <italic>Plasmodium falciparium </italic>was first documented in 1986 from the border areas of Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] several years after the first report from Southeast Asia and South America in the late 1950 s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], followed by gradual spread of the resistant strain throughout the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The high level of CQ resistance of the parasite necessitated change of choice from CQ to sulphadoxine pyramethamine (SP) in 1998. Faster drop in therapeutic efficacy of SP for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria enforced the adoption of Artemether-lumefanthrine (Coartem<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) (AL) in place of SP as a first line treatment in 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Even though, significant numbers of clinical resistance have been reported for a long time in most parts of Asia, mainly from Indonesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], chloroquine resistant strains of <italic>P. vivax </italic>was not known in Ethiopia until recent years. It has been used as the first line drug for many years for treatment of <italic>P. vivax </italic>infection. However, after the first report from Debreziet, Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], gradually a few reports are coming from some malaria endemic areas of Ethiopia including Debrezeit (5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], Serbo, 3.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and Nazreth and Debrezeit (5.76%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The present study was conducted in the southern part of the country, in Halaba district. Unlike other parts of Ethiopia, the proportions of the two principal etiological agents of malaria (<italic>P. falciparium </italic>and <italic>P. vivax</italic>) in the study area are 30 and 70%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, there was a report of antimalarial drug resistant strain of <italic>P. falciparium </italic>from the same district [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The high prevalence of <italic>P. vivax </italic>malaria and the presence of antimalarial drug resistant <italic>P. falciparium </italic>in the study area could be an indicator for the possible emergence of CRPv strains. In agreement with the hypothesis, the outcome of the study showed the highest ever reported decline in the efficacy of chloroquine drug against <italic>P. vivax</italic>. Except for these few reports, however, the nationwide prevalence of chloroquine resistant <italic>P. vivax </italic>remains poorly studied. This necessitates country wide survey for the current status of chloroquine resistant <italic>P. vivax </italic>malaria in other malaria endemic areas of the country.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study Site and Period</title><p>The clinical trial was conducted at Halaba Kulito Health Center, located in Halaba town about 313 km south of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The study site is situated within an altitude of ranging from 1554 to 2149 m above sea level, longitude of 38&#x000b0; 7' 0" E and 7&#x000b0; 18' 0" N latitude. The climatic zone of Halaba district consists of mainly mid-land ('<italic>Weinadega</italic>') and low-land ('<italic>Kola</italic>'), which accounts for 86% and 14%, respectively (as reported by the District Agriculture and Rural Development Office). The annual rainfall is estimated to be 857-1085 mm, while the mean annual temperature varies from 17 to 20&#x000b0;C with a mean value of 18&#x000b0;C. The most common health problem in the district is malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. <italic>Anopheles arabiensis </italic>is a chief vector of the malaria parasite in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

For every follow-up day and on any incident of malaria-like illness, there was an examination of blood film (except on day 1), recording of temperature, and assessment of any health problem and adverse drug reactions. During the follow-up period, any patient who failed to come to the health center on the scheduled date was traced to his/her home assisted by the local guide recruited during the study, and retained in the system unless it was beyond the capacity to trace the lost patient for several reasons (change of address, reluctance to continue as the study subject, etc).

In agreement with earlier reports from Indonesia, Peru, and Ethiopia, most of the treatment failures recorded in this study were children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>As stated by Baird [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], a subject that has an asexual parasitemia of any level persisting to day 7 could be classified as an early treatment failure. According to this definition, four of the treatment failures documented in this study were categorized under early treatment failure and are definitively classified with a demonstration of adequately absorbed, fully compliant therapy. On the other hand, Baird [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] stated that an asexual parasitemia that becomes undetectable but reappears at any time between days 7 and 28 are classified as a recurrence treatment failure. Similarly, seven of the treatment failures recorded in the study on day 14 (six) and 21 (one), should be classified under this category (recurrence treatment failure). Furthermore, Baird [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] revealed that subjects having no recurrent parasitemia up to day 28 should be classified as having an infection that was sensitive to chloroquine. Therefore, 69 of the study participants were possibly infected with chloroquine sensitive strain of <italic>P. vivax</italic></p><p>Treatment failure of <italic>P. vivax </italic>malaria after anti-malarial drug treatment might not necessarily be an indication of the emergence of CRPv strains. There could be other factors contributing to the failure such as malabsorpition of the drug, relapse, poor drug quality, re-infection, low level of drug in blood, and recrudence of parasitemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In this study, however, the possible causes of the treatment failure were either malabsorption of the drug or recrudescence of parasitemia. Because most of the treatment failures detected in this study were at the early stage of the follow-up (Day 7, and 14, except one on day 21), on these days the blood level of CQ and its metabolites do not drop to level below minimum effective concentration. Thus, it can prevent the recurrence of parasitemia of relapse or re-infection up to 35 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Besides, for most of the early treatment failures (four), the original parasite persisted up to day 7 though their numbers were less than the day of admission. Under such a situation, it is impossible to think of the treatment failures to be due to re-infection or relapse as a new parasite needs a longer incubation period (ranges from ten to seventeen days). In addition, Baird and Hoffman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] stated that in tropical areas like Ethiopia, the challenge of a relapse could appear frequently but does not commence before day17. In line with this assumption, relapse could not be the cause for treatment failure documented in this study as 91% of the treatment failures were detected before day 17.</p><p>Treatment failures associated with drug resistance may also be due to poor drug quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, the quality of drug used to treat all the patients was confirmed in the laboratory using international specifications set for each test. The drug used was confirmed to have good quality and the treatment failures could not be due to poor drug quality.</p><p><italic>In-vivo </italic>therapeutic efficacy studies remain the 'gold standard' method for assessing antimalarial drug efficacy. However, due to the difficulty in classifying true treatment failure, as recurrences of parasitemia (biological resistant) or due to malabsorption of drug by patients, supplementing it with other confirmatory tests is important. For instance measurement of CQ and its major metabolite DCQ in blood of patients with treatment failures could clearly reveal the presence of malabsorption or recurrences of resistant parasites.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The treatment failure reported in this study (13%) was relatively the highest as compared to earlier few reports from Ethiopia and Africa. This report is a good indicator of the emergence and spread of chloroquine resistant <italic>P. vivax </italic>strains in malaria endemic area of Ethiopia. Thus, besides taking the right measures by the concerned bodies to control further expansion of resistance against chloquine, more study on the degree of dissemination of the resistance pattern within the <italic>P.vivax </italic>strains in other malaria endemic regions of the country is recommended to have clear picture of the country wide distribution of the problem.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACPR: Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response; CQ: Chloroquine; CRPv: Chloroquine Resistant <italic>Plasmodium vivax; </italic>DACA: Drug Administration and Control Authority of Ethiopia; PRR: Parasite Reduction Ratio; SNNPR: South Nations and Nationalities Peoples Region; WBC: White Blood Cells; WHO: World Health Organization</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TK was fully involved in all phases of the study, including data collection and monitoring both in the field and laboratory, data analysis, interpretation, and write-up of the manuscript; KB was involved in data collection and field monitory, statistical analysis of data and critical revision of the manuscript for publication; KG sketched map of the study site and involved in data collection.
