We have previously shown that dCRY acts through Inactivation No Afterpotential D (INAD) in a light-dependent manner on the Signalplex, a multiprotein complex that includes visual-signaling molecules, suggesting a role for dCRY in fly vision. Here, we predict and demonstrate a novel Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interaction between dCRY and calmodulin (CaM). Through yeast two hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and calorimetric analyses we were able to identify and characterize a CaM binding motif in the dCRY C-terminus. Similarly, we also detailed the CaM binding site of the scaffold protein INAD and demonstrated that CaM bridges dCRY and INAD to form a ternary complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results suggest a process whereby a rapid dCRY light response stimulates an interaction with INAD, which can be further consolidated by a novel mechanism regulated by CaM.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>calmodulin</kwd><kwd>INAD</kwd><kwd>cryptochrome</kwd><kwd>photoreception</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100007479</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">Progetti di Eccellenza 2011&#x02013;2012</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Universit&#x000e0; degli Studi di Padova<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003500</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">CPDA137397/13</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Ministero dell&#x02019;Istruzione, dell&#x02019;Universit&#x000e1; e della Ricerca<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003407</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">EPIGEN Flagship project&#x02014;Subproject 4</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn004">FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100011264</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn004">PITN-GA-2012-316790</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn005">Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100005010</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn005">IG17753</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="67"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="10929"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endogenous timekeeping systems allow living organisms to synchronize their behavior and physiology to daily and seasonal changes of the environment. Despite being self-sustained, the oscillatory mechanism that generates such rhythmicity needs to be entrained by environmental stimuli such as light, temperature, food and social interactions. In the majority of instances, light is the predominant entrainment cue. Most organisms use changes in features and intensity of light around dawn and dusk as their primary Zeitgeber (Roenneberg and Foster, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the blue-light resetting of the circadian clock mainly relies on the action of CRYPTOCHROME (dCRY). Upon light activation, dCRY binds to the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM) and the ubiquitin ligase JETLAG, promoting degradation of both TIM and itself (Busza et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Koh et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Peschel et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ozturk et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Like other members of the conserved blue-light absorbing flavoprotein family, dCRY possesses an N-terminal light-sensing domain and a small C-terminal tail. Following illumination, the C-terminus is released from the surface of the N-terminal domain onto which it is folded, allowing partner proteins to bind dCRY in a light dependent manner (Ozturk et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). We have previously demonstrated an important role for the dCRY C-terminus in mediating molecular interactions. This terminus harbors several protein-protein interaction motifs involved in the function and regulation of this complex protein, including a TRAF2 ligand and two class III PDZ-binding motifs (Hemsley et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Mazzotta et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). PDZ (postsynaptic density protein 95, <italic>Drosophila</italic> disk large tumor suppressor, and zonula occludens-1 protein) domains assemble large protein complexes involved in signaling processes (Ivarsson, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) by binding a number of different short linear motifs frequently localized at the C-termini of proteins (Stein et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>One of the most studied model systems for the role of scaffolds in signal transduction is Inactivation No Afterpotential D (INAD), a five PDZ containing protein in the microvilli of <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptor cells. INAD organizes the core components of the phototransduction pathway into a supramolecular complex (Montell, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Huber, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The assembly of the INAD signaling complex is highly coordinated and spatio-temporally organized. Signaling component binding involves specific INAD regions, usually more than one PDZ domain, and multiple targets binding to the same PDZ domain are not infrequent (Liu et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). INAD is also able to form homodimers, increasing the ability of the complex to simultaneously link multiple targets (Xu et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). This specific interaction involves the dCRY C-terminus and a specific INAD region comprising the PDZ2-PDZ3 tandem (Mazzotta et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The binding of dCRY to INAD has connected this circadian photoreceptor with the visual transduction complex, where it modulates visual responses, measured as both photoreceptor sensitivity and motion vision, in a circadian fashion (Mazzotta et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Several aspects of the visual response in both vertebrates and invertebrates are regulated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (CaM) dependent signaling mechanism. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, for example, light-stimulated rhodopsin initiates a phospholipase C signaling cascade resulting in opening of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) and TRPL (TRP-like) cation channels, leading to Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Montell, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Rhabdomeres in the fly retina, microvillar photoreceptor cell structures, contain high levels of CaM. Several CaM targets have been identified in the signaling cascade, corroborating the critical role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. CaM binds the eye-specific kinase neither inactivation nor afterpotential C (NINAC), an unconventional myosin responsible for rhabdomeric localization (Porter et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Both light-sensitive TRP and TRPL channels possess CaM binding sites (one in TRP and two in TRPL) and bind CaM <italic>in vitro</italic> (Phillips et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Warr and Kelly, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). The rhodopsin phosphatase Retinal degeneration C (RdgC) also binds CaM, and this interaction is important for photoresponse termination (Lee and Montell, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). CaM interaction regulates the activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM dependent kinase II (CaMKII), which is abundant in fly retina and involved in the negative regulation of visual responses (Lu et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). A direct interaction is also reported between CaM and INAD, involving the region upstream of the PDZ2 domain of the latter (Chevesich et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Tsunoda et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Xu et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Given the scaffold nature of INAD, it can be assumed that the interaction with CaM may both promote and regulate INAD binding to different partners, e.g., dCRY. CaM is an ubiquitous sensor protein of 148 amino acids containing two domains connected by a flexible linker (Clapham, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and is extremely conserved from yeast to human. Each domain hosts two &#x0201c;EF-hands,&#x0201d; helix-loop-helix motifs binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> with varying affinity, often modulated by the interaction with target proteins (Clapham, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, each CaM domain undergoes a conformational change. CaM recognizes target proteins through a &#x0201c;CaM-binding-domain&#x0201d; (CaMBD). Generally, the binding region on the target protein is a stretch of about 20 amino acids, with high hydrophobic content and a tendency to form &#x003b1;-helices. CaMBD binding is largely driven by hydrophobic interactions between &#x0201c;anchor&#x0201d; residues on the target and methionine side chains in the CaM pocket, which become exposed upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (Yamniuk et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Marshall et al., <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The binding mechanism can be very diverse, resulting in different tuning of target protein properties. The two CaM domains can interact with the same CaMBD (typical &#x0201c;wrap around&#x0201d; mode) or the N- and C- lobe may bind the different domains independently. In the latter case, CaM acts as an adaptor protein: the binding can promote structural reorganization if the two target domains are on the same protein, or induce dimerization when different proteins are involved (Yamniuk et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Here, we present a novel interaction between dCRY and CaM. Through <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, <italic>in vitro</italic> assays and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, we identified the CaM binding motif in the dCRY N-terminus precisely. We also characterized a CaM binding site in the INAD stretch upstream of PDZ2, and demonstrated that dCRY, INAD and CaM form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data suggest a role for CaM as a novel regulatory module in the formation of the dCRY/INAD complex that strengthens light-induced responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>In silico</italic> Analyses</title><p>UniProt (The UniProt Consortium, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) canonical sequences (UniProt accession numbers in parentheses) for dCRY (O77059) and INAD (Q24008) were retrieved.

The reference cell was filled with deionized water. Protein and peptide solutions were prepared by diluting concentrated stock solutions in the reaction buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, in the absence or in the presence of 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Apo-protein and peptide solutions were devoid of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, as determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy, as previously described (Merloni et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Each experiment started with a small injection of 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;L, which was discarded from the analysis of the integrated data, in order to avoid artifacts due to the diffusion through the injection port occurring during the long equilibration period, locally affecting the protein concentration near the syringe needle tip. Care was taken to start the first addition after baseline stability had been achieved. In each individual titration, small volumes (5&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;L) of a 0.4&#x02013;0.8 mM solution containing dCRY or INAD peptide was injected into a solution of 20&#x02013;40 &#x003bc;M CaM, using a computer-controlled 310-&#x003bc;L microsyringe.

We also established that the dCRY-INAD interaction is mediated by a specific INAD region, comprising the PDZ2-PDZ3 tandem extended upstream of PDZ2, including an amino acid stretch (i.e., <sup>233</sup>TMAKINKR<sup>240</sup>) known to be part of a CaM binding motif (Xu et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Mazzotta et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In the fly retina, CaM is concentrated in rhabdomeres, photoreceptor cell microvillar structures where the phototransduction cascade complex (Signalplex), assembled by the INAD scaffold protein, is localized (Shieh and Niemeyer, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Huber et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Shieh and Zhu, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Chevesich et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Tsunoda et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). dCRY is another member of the Signalplex, in which it interacts with the phototransduction complex through INAD, and contributes to the fly circadian visual response (Mazzotta et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This interaction is mainly driven by light exposure, suggesting that other modulators can mediate the interaction in a light independent fashion. To shed light on a potential, wider role for CaM in clock entrainment, an interaction network centered on dCRY, INAD and CaM was generated with STRING (Szklarczyk et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The resulting network (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>) shows that proteins forming the Signalplex are physically linked to the circadian timekeeping mechanism through dCRY. CaM interacts with multiple components of the Signalplex, i.e., NinaC, TRP, TRPL and INAD, presumably acting as both driver and mediator of different cell signals (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). The connection between INAD and Galphaq (G protein alpha q subunit) is also of interest. This protein is actively expressed in chemosensory cells and central neurons (Talluri et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>) and is known to be required for correct signal phototransduction in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (Lee et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that CaM associates the complex formed by dCRY with INAD, serving as a direct molecular bridge between light sensing and signal propagation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>CaM Interacts With the Circadian Blue-Light Photoreceptor dCRY</title><p>An analysis of dCRY with the CaM binding database (Yap et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) suggested a putative binding site in the dCRY C-terminal tail (residues 490&#x02013;516). This region is predicted to form a short &#x003b1;-helix, a common feature shared among CaM binding regions (Lee and Zheng, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>). Notably, this region is also in the proximity of the linear motifs previously found responsible for interaction with the INAD PDZ domains (Mazzotta et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A multiple sequence alignment of dCRY orthologs shows this region to be conserved among arthropods. The motif is almost identical in all Drosophilidae, with the exception of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>pseudoobscura</italic>, in which different amino acid substitutions are observed. A comparative investigation of secondary structure highlights a short-conserved helix, suggesting an evolutionarily preserved functional role. To verify these predictions, we tested binding of a synthetic peptide mimicking dCRY residues 490&#x02013;516 to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled CaM using <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The position and shape of the peaks in the <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC map used to follow the titrations with the peptide is very sensitive to the chemical environment of the corresponding amino acids and represents a useful tool to study protein interactions with other molecules. Most of the peaks in the HSQC spectrum were perturbed upon addition of the peptide up to a two-molar excess. Most of the perturbed signals moved very little at the beginning of the titration, becoming weaker and broadening beyond detection before reappearing in a different position during the titration (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>), which suggests a slow or slow-to-intermediate exchange regime, typically associated with K<sub>d</sub> in the nM-&#x003bc;M range. As a consequence, it was not possible to follow several peaks during the titration, and to trace the assignment of the bound protein starting from apo-CaM. A number of isolated, representative, peaks on both lobes moved significantly, similar to what observed for other known CaM binding domains. The available data support the binding of the selected peptide to CaM, although they do not allow the definition of the molecular details and interaction stoichiometry. To address these limitations, the thermodynamics of interaction between CaM and the dCRY-derived peptide was studied by means of ITC.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Inactivation No Afterpotential D (INAD) and <italic>drosophila</italic> cryptochrome (dCRY) sequence domain organization and calmodulin (CaM) binding site conservation. <bold>(A)</bold> PDZ domains composing INAD are presented in gray bars named with the corresponding Pfam nomenclature, while the CaM binding site is boxed in red.

Because of the well-known regulation exerted on dCRY by light even in a cell-based system such as yeast (Rosato et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Hemsley et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Mazzotta et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), the interaction was tested both in the light and in the dark. A strong interaction between dCRY and CaM was observed (both full length and fragments). The binding affinity was particularly high when the N-terminal moiety of CaM (aa 1&#x02013;80) was used as prey (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

As dCRY is a well-known light responsive flavoprotein (Masiero et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), we can speculate that specific structural rearrangements may explain this behavior. On the other hand, light is known to activate a yeast stress-response signaling pathway that leads to an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Bodvard et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which might cooperatively enhance CaM binding to dCRY.

The data from INAD also suggest that light-induced conformational changes are not relevant for the interaction with CaM. Analysis with FELLS (Piovesan et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) predicts the <sup>233</sup>TMAKINKR<sup>240</sup> motif to form a short &#x003b1;-helix, a feature common to PDZ accessory tails and CaMBD (Lee and Zheng, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The segment is also predicted to form a hydrophobic cluster, reinforcing its role as a mediator of CaM/INAD protein-protein interactions. Similar to what was observed for dCRY, this region is conserved among Arthropoda, suggesting that the CaM/INAD interaction may be a common mechanism in this phylum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S5</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Evidence for an interaction between CaM and INAD. <bold>(A)</bold> CaM (full-length or fragments) was challenged with INAD (full-length or fragment) in a yeast two-hybrid assay with &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity as a measure of interaction.

This motif does not correspond to any prototypical CaM binding sequence (Rhoads and Friedberg, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Hoeflich and Ikura, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Nevertheless, the two residues Met-235 and Ile-238 could serve as hydrophobic anchors, defining a less characterized 1&#x02013;4 motif already described for the CaM-binding domains of tobacco MAPK phosphatase (NtMPK1; Rainaldi et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and the HIV-1 Matrix Protein (Samal et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). During the titration of <sup>15</sup>N-CaM with INAD<sub>230&#x02013;243</sub>, an incremental change in the position of many <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC cross peaks was observed in response to peptide addition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), indicating a fast exchange regime. In this case, the assignment of the peptide bound state could be obtained by simply tracking the incremental movement of the perturbed peaks. A more detailed analysis shows that during the titration a number of peaks, characterized by a relatively large shift, become broader and then sharpen again, giving the titration curve a sigmoidal appearance (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">S6</xref>). Both features indicate a fast-to-intermediate exchange regime for some of the peaks. In these conditions, fitting the titration curves would be largely inaccurate. Altogether, this behavior is associated with a K<sub>d</sub> in the &#x003bc;M range. Although the spectra show that several residues distributed in the entire protein are perturbed during titration, the largest shifts involve peaks corresponding to residues of the C-terminal CaM lobe. The overall chemical shift change was 2.5 and 4.5 ppm for the N- and C-terminal lobe, respectively, suggesting a preferential interaction of the peptide with this domain. Specifically, the most significant chemical shift changes in <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N resonances (at least one standard deviation above average) were observed for the following residues: Val-55, Lys-77, Asp-78, Glu-83, Asp-93, Val108, Met-109, Thr-110, Asn-111, Gly-113, Lys-115, Ala-128, Gln-143, Met-144, Thr-146 and Lys-148 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Most of these residues cluster on a hydrophobic surface containing four methionines, which becomes exposed only in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded CaM.</p><p>Chemical shifts based 3D structure prediction, although limited in quality by the sole <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N spectra, suggests CaM to assume a compact conformation resembling that of CaM bound to AKAP79 CaM binding domain (Patel et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), with both C-lobe and N-lobe participating in the interaction with INAD<sub>230&#x02013;243</sub> (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S7</xref>). The C-lobe, in particular, is predicted to assume a more open conformation supporting the preferential interaction presumed for this domain. Of note, a similar prediction using the chemical shifts measured in a 1:2 CaM/INAD<sub>230&#x02013;243</sub> solution, suggests that, in these conditions, the N-lobe also goes through a conformational change to a more open conformation, possibly engaging an additional interaction with a second peptide (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S7</xref>). The overall quality of this model, however, is almost modest and does not allow further speculations on binding geometry.</p><p>ITC experiments showed that, in the presence of 5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM interacts with INAD with an exothermic reaction, as indicated by the negative peaks following each injections of the peptide into the protein solution (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8">S8A</xref>). A single binding event is inferred from the integrated heat data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8">S8B</xref>). Due to the weak binding of INAD to CaM, the sigmoidicity of the curve was not optimal to obtain a reliable stoichiometry value, as no inflection point is present in the binding isotherm to provide this information. Therefore, restrictions in the binding parameters had to be made to obtain a reliable data analysis, by fixing the stoichiometry and r<sub>M</sub> to one, implying therefore a single binding site for INAD to CaM (Scheme <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="S3" position="float"><label>Scheme 3</label><caption><p>Model describing the binding of a single INAD molecule to CaM protein, in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnmol-11-00280-g0008"/></fig><p>A fit (GoF = 72.83%) using a single site model indicates that one INAD molecule binds CaM with LA <italic>K<sub>aINAD</sub></italic> = 6.08 &#x000b1; 0.06 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <italic>K</italic><sub>d1INAD</sub> = 164 &#x000b1; 2 &#x003bc;M, with a favorable enthalpic contribution (<italic>&#x00394;H</italic> = &#x02212;8.52 &#x000b1; 0.01 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and a negative entropy change (<italic>&#x00394;S</italic> = &#x02212;11.3 cal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Competition Between INAD and dCRY for CaM</title><p>In order to understand whether the site occupied by INAD corresponds to the HA or LA site observed for dCRY, a competition experiment was carried out by titrating INAD over a CaM solution, preincubated with a 1:1 concentration of dCRY. In these conditions, we expect that only the HA site is occupied by dCRY because of the large difference in affinity between the HA and LA sites. The reaction was monitored using ITC. The absence of significant heat of reaction (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9A</xref>) indicated that dCRY binding to the HA site prevents INAD from binding to the protein, suggesting that dCRY and INAD compete for the same site. The INAD peptide is not able to displace dCRY because the affinity of INAD for CaM is four orders of magnitude lower than that of dCRY (K<sub>d</sub> 164 &#x003bc;M vs. 58 nM). On the other hand, when a dCRY solution is titrated over CaM preincubated with a four times excess of INAD, exothermic peaks are observed following each injection (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9B</xref>). The shape of the integrated curve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9C</xref>), confirms that dCRY is able to outcompete INAD for binding to the protein into the HA site, before occupying the LA site. A fit of the integrated heat data, however, is quite complex, as the binding curve represents the sum of the contributions of the multiple binding isotherms deriving from the different equilibria involved. These include the binding of dCRY to CaM in the HA site and in the LA site, and the concomitant dissociation of INAD from the HA site, as well as the competition between the different species. Therefore, we used a global fit analysis approach, available in the AFFINImeter software, to combine all the information comprised in the three binding isotherms representing the single equilibria and the competition experiment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;C</xref>). Using the model builder tool of AFFINImeter, we first constructed a binding scheme describing the competition of INAD and dCRY for the HA site of CaM, and the subsequent binding of dCRY to the LA site to give the CaM-dCRY<sub>2</sub> complex (Scheme <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p><fig id="S4" position="float"><label>Scheme 4</label><caption><p>Model describing the competition of INAD and dCRY for the HA site of CaM and the subsequent binding of dCRY to the LA site in the CaM-dCRY complex.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnmol-11-00280-g0009"/></fig><p>The fitting of the data using this model (GoF = 33.83% for the competition curve) is clearly not satisfactory (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S9C</xref>).

The results of the global fit analysis, reported in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, suggest that binding of INAD to the HA site of CaM increases the affinity of dCRY for the LA site by two orders of magnitudes. This change in the affinity possibly involves a protein conformational change, reflected in the change of the enthalpy value from negative to positive. This event renders the formation of a CaM-INAD-dCRY ternary complex possible, as derived from the concentration distribution of the different species upon dCRY titration into the CaM-INAD solution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>CaM signaling regulates visual responses in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Previous studies have shown that CaM interacts directly with INAD, the main scaffold of the phototransduction complex (Xu et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). CaM is also known to modulate heterodimerization of several proteins (Kilhoffer et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Hoeflich and Ikura, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), acting as a strong regulator of physiological responses. Our previous work (Mazzotta et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) suggested that the interaction between dCRY and INAD might be modulated by CaM. Experimental validation by yeast two-hybrid and CoIP assays confirms that dCRY binds CaM, forming a ternary protein complex <italic>in vivo</italic>, together with INAD. Using an integrated approach, in the present study we also demonstrate that both single CaM domains bind dCRY. It has been already proposed that CaM may act as an adaptor or recruiter protein, easing the assembly of macromolecular complexes if each of the two CaM lobes is able to independently bind separate targets (Yamniuk et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In the present study, we identified the dCRY portion interacting with CaM and we propose that it is located at the beginning of the flexible C-terminal tail containing the linear motifs which are important for PDZ domain recognition (Hemsley et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). To confirm this hypothesis, we titrated <sup>15</sup>N-labeled CaM with a peptide encompassing dCRY residues 490&#x02013;516 and showed that the addition of this peptide determined a shift and a concomitant broadening of several peaks in the HSQC spectrum of CaM. This behavior indicates that the selected dCRY portion binds CaM with low micromolar affinity. Calorimetric measurements also support this interpretation. Our results have narrowed down the previously identified INAD CaM binding domain to the &#x003b1;-helical motif (MAKI, aa residues 235&#x02013;238) upstream from the PDZ2 domain. This sequence has previously been observed to be necessary for the interaction with dCRY (Mazzotta et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>The typical CaM binding domain consist of a short peptide (15&#x02013;30 residues) rich in bulky hydrophobic residues and positive charges, with a propensity to fold into an &#x003b1;-helix. Initial attempts to classify CaM binding motifs have been carried out based on the spacing between anchor hydrophobic residues (Ishida and Vogel, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). It is now clear that peptide sequences able to bind CaM are difficult to categorize, as numerous unclassified binding sequences have been reported (Yap et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Neither dCRY nor INAD contain a motif corresponding to any of the known classical CaM-binding site patterns. In the present study, we identified INAD residues 233&#x02013;240 as a putative CaM-binding site, in a region of INAD previously shown to be involved in CaM binding (Xu et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). This region has a strong propensity to fold into an &#x003b1;-helix and contains two hydrophobic residues. In the helical conformation, these residues localize on the same side of the structure, in the orientation expected for them to act as anchor points. The presence of positive charges completes the typical CaM binding motif requirements. Interestingly, the relative position of these residues resembles that of the CaMBD region of <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> MAPK phosphatase-1 (NtMKP1; Yamakawa et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The motif responsible for NtMKP1 binding to CaM defines a novel, unconventional, 1&#x02013;4 motif in which two anchor residues are separated by only two amino acids, one of which is basic (Yamakawa et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>In our NMR experiments, the addition of INAD<sub>230&#x02013;243&#x02013;</sub> to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled CaM caused incremental chemical shift changes in the HSQC spectrum, indicating fast-to-intermediate exchange between the free and bound states, consistent with low &#x003bc;M affinity. The largest shifts were observed for residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM, suggesting a preferential interaction with this domain. Calculation of the CaM 3D structure from <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N chemical shifts predicts that the protein binds INAD in a &#x0201c;wrap around&#x0201d; mode with stoichiometry 1:1. In this condition, the C-lobe in particular is predicted to assume an open conformation that presumably triggers the interaction, where the N-lobe maintains a closed-like conformation. Remarkably, a peptide of similar length derived from NtMPK1 was shown to bind to the C-terminus of soybean CaM with HA and subsequently, at higher peptide concentrations, to the N-terminal lobe (Rainaldi et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). A similar behavior was later observed also for a short peptide spanning residues 11&#x02013;28 of HIV-1 matrix protein (MA<sub>11&#x02013;28</sub>), which binds specifically to the C-terminal domain of CaM (Samal et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This peptide also presents a 1&#x02013;4 motif similar to INAD<sub>230&#x02013;243</sub> and to the NtMPK1 peptide. In our study, the yeast two-hybrid assays confirmed that the separate CaM domains effectively bind INAD in an independent manner, with efficiency comparable with full length CaM. The analysis of spectral changes during the NMR titrations clearly shows that both peptides interact with CaM in the affinity range expected for weak transient interactions, as those mediated by linear motifs described here (Perkins et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Collectively, the data presented here support a role for CaM in facilitating the assembly of a macromolecular complex between dCRY and INAD.</p><p>We have also observed that, while occurring both in light and dark, the INAD interaction with CaM is significantly stronger in the presence of light. Even though light was not expected to influence the binding activity, our result could be explained taking into consideration the reported effects of light on a non-photosynthetic organism such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Exposure to continuous blue light activates a yeast stress-response pathway that leads to an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Bodvard et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In turn, this modulates the nuclear localization dynamics of stress-regulated transcription factors, ultimately triggering a light-induced gene expression response (Bodvard et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The observed effect of light on the CaM affinity to dCRY was somehow expected due to light regulation on dCRY (Rosato et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Hemsley et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Mazzotta et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Considering the above mentioned yeast response to blue light (Bodvard et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), it can be hypothesized that the photo-induced dCRY conformational change is modulated by CaM signaling. Although not all the available evidence supports this hypothesis (Ozturk et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Vaidya et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Masiero et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent signaling pathways in fly circadian timekeeping is well established. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering in pacemaker neurons results in a dose-dependent period lengthening of free-running behavioral rhythms, mirrored by a slower accumulation of PAR domain protein 1 (PDP1), a crucial component of the interconnected transcriptional/translational <italic>Drosophila</italic> feedback loops (Harrisingh et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Recently, an endogenous daily rhythm in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been detected in pacemaker neurons, which varies as a function of the time of day (Liang et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A strong correlation was observed in the phase relationship between the peak of Ca<sup>2+</sup> rhythms and the daily peaks of locomotor activity, for both morning (M) and evening (E) oscillators (Grima et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Liang et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments show that CaM is part of the complex formed by dCRY and INAD in fly photoreceptors and this association depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This establishes a connection between CaM signaling and circadian clocks in photoreceptors, with the link being dCRY. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation observed in pacemaker neurons was found to be independent from dCRY (Liang et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, dCRY plays different functions. In circadian clock neurons, dCRY acts as a circadian photopigment contributing to the resetting of the molecular clock by promoting light-dependent TIM degradation (Yoshii et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>); in contrast, in peripheral tissues, including the compound eyes, it has been suggested that it might provide an integral component of the molecular clock (Ivanchenko et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Krishnan et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Collins et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Moreover, in compound eyes it is also associated with the cytoplasmic membrane and contributes to the modulation of visual sensitivity (Mazzotta et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize an involvement of dCRY in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent signaling mechanism, impinging on the circadian fly timekeeping. To put our findings into context, we propose a model in which light and CaM co-modulate the phototransduction cascade (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). A fast light response stimulates dCRY conformational changes, which in turn allow a prompt interaction with INAD when the fly is exposed to blue light. An additional slower mechanism, regulated by CaM, consolidates the initial light-induced response and this synergistic action strengthens the physiological output. Our NMR and calorimetric data supporting low &#x003bc;M affinities for the interactions of CaM with dCRY and INAD perfectly fit this scenario. Within this setting, CaM would act as an adaptor protein, stabilizing the interaction between dCRY and INAD enhancing their functional responses. This is in line with the notions that the ability to readily form and break interactions allows fast responses to cellular perturbations and changes in the environment (Stein et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and that the simultaneous presence of multiple weak interactions enhances the stability of the complex and allows a more deterministic regulation of cell processes.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Functional model of the interaction.
