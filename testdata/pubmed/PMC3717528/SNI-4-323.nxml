Although magnetic resonance images (MRI) has well-established criteria for distinguishing between benign vs. malignant spinal disease, these criteria are fallible. However, when MRI scans are combined with positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) studies, together they better specify the pathology of vertebral lesions, while the latter (PET-CT) screens the body for lesions at other sites. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) of various tissues may further help differentiate benign from malignant disease. Although tissue diagnosis is still considered the gold standard (e.g., utilizing fine needle aspiration cytology [FNAC]), the combined diagnostic accuracy of MRI and PET-CT in differentiating benign from malignant disease requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective study was performed involving 24 patients (18 males and 6 females) who presented with nontraumatic spontaneous vertebral compression fractures. Patients with osteoporosis, degenerative disease, and disc herniations were excluded. All patients underwent MRI (with/without contrast) of the spine involving the affected region, followed by whole-body PET-CT. Additionally, all patients had FNAC of the lesion at the primary spinal site or other sites picked-up by PET-CT (e.g., subjected to FNAC in case where cytology from primary site was inconclusive).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Specifics of diagnostic studies</title><p>MRI studies (1.5 Tesla Siemens Magneton) with/without gadolinium (0.1 mmol/kg) were labeled as benign (preservation of bone marrow/paravertebral abscess/collection) vs. malignant (convex bulge of posterior vertebral cortex, pedicular disease, and paraspinal soft tissue mass).</p><p>PET-CT included acquisition of both the PET and CT images. CT was done at 140 kV + 18 mA. CT was done for anatomical localization and also as an attenuation map. PET was done after injection of 10-20 mci of 18 F fluoro deoxy glucose (FDG) intravenously and images were taken 50-60 minutes after injection on a GE-discovery machine. The results were interpreted both visually and semi-quantitatively. Liver SUV values were taken as baseline. Malignant lesions were those with SUV values &#x0003e;2 SD of liver SUV and were categorized as benign if the values were &#x0003c;2 SD of liver SUV.</p><p>CT-guided FNAC of the lesion was done in all patients, and the results were compared with MRI and PET-CT results. When FNAC was inconclusive, tissue diagnosis from other sites of involvement seen on PET-CT was obtained. In cases where there were no other sites involved, the provisional diagnosis was based upon radiological finding. Empirical therapy was started for suspected benign pathology such as tuberculosis, and in these cases, the final diagnosis was guided by the response to empirical antitubercular treatment (ATT) therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sensitivity and specificity of MR vs. PET-CT in distinguishing benign disease</title><p>Of the 24 patients in this series, 14 had tuberculosis (benign disease). MRI, PET-CT, and FNAC were consistent with benign pathology in 10 of 14 patients [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The sensitivity/specificity of MRI in diagnosing benign lesions was 78.57%/90%, while the sensitivity/specificity of PET-CT for diagnosing benign lesions was 92.8%/90%, respectively. Furthermore, the specificity for diagnosing benign lesions utilizing both studies together was 100%, but the algorithm was not sensitive [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of results of investigative modalities and comparison with final diagnosis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SNI-4-323-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Literature review and comparison with present study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SNI-4-323-g002"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Sensitivity and specificity of MR vs. PET-CT in malignant disease</title><p>For 6 of 10 patients with malignant disease, all 3 studies (MRI, PET-CT, and FNAC) were positive for malignancy. Six of these patients had the following malignant lesions with metastases; thyroid malignancy (follicular carcinoma; two patients), prostate adenocarcinoma (three patients), and adenocarcinoma of the lung (one patient). For the remaining four patients, however, the three investigations did not unanimously suggest malignancy; these included three patients with multiple myeloma, and one patient with lymphoma. Two of these four patients were accurately diagnosed by FNAC [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The remaining two patients have been described in the FNAC section.</p><p>The sensitivity/specificity of MRI in picking up malignant lesions was 90%/78.57% and for PET-CT was 90%/92.8%, respectively. The sensitivity was 100% for diagnosing a malignant lesion with both investigations combined, though it was not specific.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Sensitivity and specificity for FNAC</title><p>There were four patients in whom the FNAC was inconclusive. For the two with suspected malignancy on MRI and PET-CT (e.g., PET-CT showed multiple lytic lesions in one, and iliac bone involvement in the other), FNAC biopsies from the clavicle and iliac bone proved malignant. The remaining two patients were suspected of harboring benign lesions; the PET-CT suggested benign disease and showed mediastinal lymph nodes in one patient, while no other site of uptake was demonstrated in the second patient. Of interest, both with suspected benign disease responded to empirical ATT that was successfully monitored utilizing PET-CT (e.g., response to therapy) over 8 months of treatment (e.g., showed resolution of lesion) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) and (b) pretreatment PET-CT images showing increased uptake in the region of upper cervical vertebrae.

Unfortunately, even multiple radiological studies combined are not 100% sensitive or specific for distinguishing between benign or malignant disease. This, therefore, still requires subjecting patients to FNAC for establishing a diagnosis, target therapy, and assess the prognosis.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Sensitivity and specificity of MRI in distinguishing benign vs. malignant disease</title><p>The sensitivity and specificity of MRI in differentiating benign from malignant lesions have been studied previously. The criteria used by Cho and Chang to diagnose malignant lesions included; the presence of an epidural mass, pedicle enhancement, bulging of the posterior vertebral cortex.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The criteria used by William <italic>et al</italic>. to diagnose benign lesions was preservation of the bone marrow[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. We combined these criteria (vide supra) to differentiate benign from malignant lesion on MRI.</p><p>In our study, MRI alone missed one case of malignancy (out of 10) and misdiagnosed 3 cases of benign disease (out of 14). This was possibly because tuberculosis of the vertebral body may destroy the pedicle and the posterior cortex in absence of a paravertebral collection at times, mimicking malignancy on MRI.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Sensitivity and specificity of fluoro deoxy glucose PET-CT in distinguishing benign vs. malignant disease</title><p>FDG PET-CT can be considered as adjunctive method for diagnosing and differentiating malignant from benign vertebral compression fractures. In comparison with MRI, FDG-PET-CT showed slightly higher sensitivity and lower specificity. [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In our study PET-CT missed one patient in each of the groups. When both the modalities were combined, the specificity for diagnosing a benign lesion was 100%.</p><p>A major problem in selecting mean SUV max as the sole criteria for differentiating benign and malignant lesions is that no single cut off can be suggested. According to Laufer <italic>et al</italic>., the mean SUV values of lesions with active cancer were 7.1 and 2.1 in benign lesions (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.02).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] However, Harkirat <italic>et al</italic>. reported SUV max values of 21 in tuberculosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Despite these limitations, PET-CT has multiple advantages. First, whole body screening picks up sites other than the involved spine thereby giving a broader picture of disease. Second, in cases of indeterminate FNAC results, the site of FNAC can be guided by involvement of other more accessible sites such as subcutaneous lymph nodes, other bones, thyroid gland, etc., Finally, in cases where empirical therapy (ATT) is started, the disease progress and response to therapy can be monitored by repeating PET-CT. This has not been mentioned in the literature previously.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, MRI and PET-CT combined are 100% specific for diagnosing benign lesions. In case either or both of them suggest a malignant tumor, further work up, especially including a tissue diagnosis is warranted for pathological confirmation. PET-CT had the advantage of picking up more accessible lesions for tissue diagnosis vs. lesions found in the spine. Additionally, PET-CT could be utilized to follow response to treatment for benign lesions (e.g., tuberculosis) being empirically treated with ATT. Of note, major limitation of this study was the small sample size.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Available FREE in open access from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com/text.asp?2013/4/6/323/112619">http://www.surgicalneurologyint.com/text.asp?2013/4/6/323/112619</ext-link></p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Disclaimer</bold>: The authors of this article have no conflicts of interest to disclose, and have adhered to <italic>SNI's</italic> policies regarding human/animal rights, and informed consent.
