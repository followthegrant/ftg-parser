This paper explores the epidemiology and potential treatments for chronic pain and opioid misuse and identifies educational and regulation changes that may reduce diversion of opioid analgesics. We cover the epidemiology of chronic pain and aberrant opioid behaviors, psychosocial influences on pain, pharmacological treatments, psychological treatments, and social treatments, as well as educational and regulatory efforts being made to reduce the diversion of prescription opioids. There are a number of ongoing challenges in treating chronic pain and opioid misuse, and more research is needed to provide strong, integrated, and empirically validated treatments to reduce opioid misuse in the context of chronic pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>addiction</kwd><kwd>dependence</kwd><kwd>diversion</kwd><kwd>comorbid</kwd><kwd>narcotic</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Opioid analgesics remain the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for acute and chronic pain. However, the risks for misuse and development of addiction have raised concerns for clinicians, public health specialists, and the community at large. The concern about prescription drug addiction has resulted in new state and federal policies and monitoring systems, and yet there is a need to help the increasing number of Americans suffering from chronic pain. The number of prescriptions for opioid analgesics has risen dramatically over the last decade,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-sar-2-145">1</xref> and at the same time, reports of misused or abused opioids have led to increasing concerns about diversion of these potent drugs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-sar-2-145">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-sar-2-145">3</xref></p><p>Although the administration of opioids in the management of acute pain carries little risk, long-term use of opioid analgesics is associated with clinically relevant rates of abuse or addiction. This review will focus on the relationship between noncancer pain, opioid analgesics, opioid misuse, and the diversion of these narcotics. Pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatment strategies for prescription drug addiction and pain management are reviewed, including broader policy strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Epidemiology of pain and addiction</title><p>It is estimated that up to 50% of Americans experience chronic pain or intermittent repeating pain during their lifetime.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-sar-2-145">4</xref> There is an ongoing, and often heated, discussion about how to best treat pain disorders and the role that opioid analgesics should play in the treatment of nonmalignant pain to balance the need for pain management and the risk of developing an addiction. Despite this ongoing debate, the number of prescriptions for opioid analgesics is on the rise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-sar-2-145">1</xref> According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-sar-2-145">5</xref> pain complaints account for more than 40% of all symptoms related to outpatient visits, or over 100 million ambulatory encounters in the US alone each year. Pain costs the US over $100 billion per year in health care and lost productivity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-sar-2-145">6</xref> Furthermore, pain medications are the second most commonly prescribed class of drugs, accounting for 12% of all medication prescribed during ambulatory office visits in the US.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-sar-2-145">7</xref> This medical use of opioids, that increased during the 1990s in response to an effort to promote better pain control, has also been associated with a dramatic increase in the abuse of opioids that now seems to be stable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-sar-2-145">8</xref> Since 1997, the four primary opioids used in pain treatment have increased markedly, ie, morphine (73%), hydromorphone (96%), fentanyl (226%), and oxycodone (403%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-sar-2-145">9</xref></p><p>Concerns about diversion and addiction are also on the rise, as there are an increasing number of reported cases of misuse or abuse of opioids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-sar-2-145">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-sar-2-145">3</xref> However, there is significant disagreement about the frequency of opioid abuse/dependence that occurs due to prescribing for pain, with estimates ranging from a low of 3% to a high of 30% depending on the study and the methodology used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-sar-2-145">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-sar-2-145">10</xref> A recent large scale meta-analysis by Fishbain et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-sar-2-145">11</xref> studied aberrant drug-related behaviors in the context of chronic opioid analgesic therapy. Aberrant behaviors may include taking medications off schedule, hoarding medications, requesting opioid analgesic refills early, taking too much or too little of the prescribed medication, or supplementing with nonprescribed drugs (legal or illicit). The results suggest that the onset of actual addiction after starting opioids for pain management is relatively low (0.19%&#x02013;3.2%). However, the occurrence of aberrant drug-taking behaviors is much higher (11.5%). When analyzing only those studies that included a urinary toxicology screen, the aberrant drug-related behavior rate went even higher, with 20.4% of patients having no opioids in their urine screen, and 14.5% testing positive for other illicit drugs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-sar-2-145">11</xref></p><p>While the likelihood of patients progressing from taking legitimately prescribed opioids for pain to opioid addiction is low, pain in the context of pre-existing opioid addiction is extremely high. A recent study of pain in the context of opioid addiction found that 80% of patients entering methadone maintenance treatment reported experiencing frequent pain. Approximately 37% of individuals entering for opioid addiction reported chronic pain compared with only 24% in a general substance abuse population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-sar-2-145">12</xref> Among individuals entering methadone maintenance treatment for addiction who experience pain, 65% report moderate to severe pain, and pain that interferes with daily activities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-sar-2-145">12</xref></p><p>Among individuals with comorbid opioid addiction and chronic pain, pain can significantly interfere with relapse after opioid addiction treatment. The odds of opioid relapse after detoxification in those with opioid addiction and moderate pain are 2.6 times higher than those without pain. Individuals with severe pain in the context of opioid addiction have over five times higher relapse rate compared with their nonpain counterparts with opioid addiction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-sar-2-145">13</xref></p><p>Therefore, while conversion rates to addiction appear to be low among individuals starting opioid analgesic therapy for chronic pain, aberrant behaviors are not infrequent. Further, among those individuals with comorbid opioid addiction and pain, untreated pain can significantly hamper recovery from opioid addiction.</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, deaths from unintentional overdoses are now the second leading cause of accidental death in the US. After a steep rise beginning in the early 1990s, over 27,000 such deaths were recorded in 2007. Nearly 11,500 deaths from opioid analgesics in 2007 have contributed to this trend. Admissions to drug treatment programs increased by 400% between 1998 and 2008; opioid analgesics were the second most prevalent abused substance, after marijuana.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-sar-2-145">14</xref> Visits to emergency departments for opioid abuse more than doubled between 2004 and 2008. National prescription tracking data demonstrate that 40% of opioid prescribing is done by family practitioners, osteopaths, or internists, most frequently for musculoskeletal complaints. Approximately 3% of the US adult population receives long-term opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-sar-2-145">14</xref></p><p>These events parallel an increase in the medical use of opioids since 1990. Two events conspired to produce this surge in opioid prescribing. First, aggressive, and ultimately illegal, marketing of OxyContin&#x000ae; began in 1995 following approval of the drug. Second, physicians have been encouraged to identify and ultimately treat acute and chronic pain. Sales of methadone and oxycodone quadrupled between 1997 and 2002.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-sar-2-145">14</xref> Interestingly, the number of opioid prescriptions correlated strongly with mortality, in that, states with the highest opioid prescribing rates had the highest rates for accidental opioid death. In general, per capita sales are most strongly associated with oxycodone-related and methadone-related mortality. In almost every sample, men have higher death rates than women, most commonly those aged 45&#x02013;54 years. Caucasians and Native Americans have higher death rates following overdose than African Americans.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-sar-2-145">14</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Psychosocial influences of pain</title><p>Pain is a multidimensional construct that is influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-sar-2-145">15</xref> Multiple researchers have identified that the perception of pain does not correlate well with physical injury,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-sar-2-145">16</xref> and that nonphysical forms of pain can activate the same areas of the brain as physically induced pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-sar-2-145">17</xref> Further, research has indicated that descending pathways from the brain can be used to modulate (up or down) the messages of the ascending neural pathways.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-sar-2-145">15</xref> This suggests that the patient is an active interpreter of the pain sensation. The patient filters nerve sensations from the body through cultural, emotional, and personal lenses to identify if the pain exceeds the patient&#x02019;s ability to tolerate the pain and the need to access treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-sar-2-145">18</xref></p><p>A number of psychological factors have been shown empirically to alter a patient&#x02019;s pain experience. Emotional status can have a significant impact on a patient&#x02019;s pain experience. Research has identified that depression and chronic pain share many of the same serotonergic pathways and are a frequent comorbidity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-sar-2-145">19</xref> Even brief mood states can have a significant impact on pain tolerance such that a 5-minute induced mood state (positive or negative) can alter pain tolerance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-sar-2-145">20</xref> Emotional catastrophizing is strongly associated with increased reports of pain and decreased pain tolerance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-sar-2-145">21</xref> Feelings of pain-related self-efficacy can improve pain tolerance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-sar-2-145">22</xref> Patients who feel more in control of their pain and have more coping skills with which to tolerate pain decrease their negative affect related to pain. In essence, the messages patients give themselves about their ability to cope with a certain level of pain become a self-fulfilling prophecy. These issues are best addressed with a pain psychologist to help patients develop their psychosocial pain-coping skills. Through psychotherapy, patients can acquire the pain coping skills necessary to increase their ability, and their confidence in that ability, to tolerate pain. In turn, reliance on pharmacotherapy is likely to decrease.</p></sec><sec><title>Diagnostic issue: comorbid addiction and pain</title><p>The prevalence of opioid addiction in chronic nonmalignant pain patients have been reported to vary from none in some studies up to 50%, and in cancer patients up to 7.7% depending on the subpopulation studied and the criteria used. Unfortunately, in the research literature, the concept of &#x0201c;addiction&#x0201d; is often intertwined with what is better referred to as &#x0201c;aberrant drug-related behaviors&#x0201d;. Aberrant drug-related behaviors may be red flags, but do not by themselves indicate the presence of addiction, which is defined as seeking the psychological effects of the drug. Aberrant drug-related behaviors can also be indicative of iatrogenic drug-seeking behaviors or diversion, among other possibilities. The risk of addiction to opioid analgesics needs to be thoroughly evaluated when initiating long-term opioid treatment. Only some screening tools like the Pain Medicine Questionnaire<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-sar-2-145">23</xref> have been thoroughly validated. The risk of developing behavioral problems with chronic opioid analgesic therapy varies. While some researchers estimate that up to 24% of patients with chronic pain develop aberrant drug-related behaviors,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-sar-2-145">24</xref> others estimate that these behaviors are higher (50%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-sar-2-145">25</xref></p><p>The commonly used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition criteria may overestimate the problem by using the criteria of tolerance and withdrawal. Using varying terms for the evaluation of addiction, such as drug-seeking behavior, addictive behavior, and abuse behavior can be misleading. Therapeutic dependence is another concept that may be present in chronic pain patients receiving adequate relief by opioids. These patients tend to hoard opioid analgesics to ensure that they continue to obtain adequate pain control by building up a personal reserve of opioids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-sar-2-145">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-sar-2-145">28</xref></p><p>Prospective studies using appropriate and thoroughly validated criteria are needed in order to make precise conclusions because estimates of addiction problems among chronic nonmalignant pain patients on long-term opioid treatment have been found to vary significantly. Some patients, especially those on short-acting opioids, may suffer from recurrent subtle withdrawal, which can be manifested as increased pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-sar-2-145">29</xref> It may be difficult to differentiate between the primary pain and the pain resulting from opioid withdrawal. Patients who increase opioid doses for pain relief may actually be treating their withdrawal phenomenon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-sar-2-145">30</xref> To assist clinicians in diagnosing addiction in the context of treatment with opioid analgesics, Portenoy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-sar-2-145">31</xref> suggested a set of criteria that may be useful for this purpose. They recommended assessment of: manipulation of the treating physician or medical system for the purpose of obtaining additional medication; acquisition of medication from other medical or nonmedical sources; the tendency to hoard medications or to sell; and unapproved use of other drugs, such as alcohol and other sedatives/hypnotics during opioid therapy. For example, Dunbar and Katz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-sar-2-145">32</xref> assessed the prevalence of six behavioral criteria of 20 opioid-treated patients with chronic pain and addiction problems. They found that unauthorized dose escalation, frequent telephone calls, receiving opioids from other providers, losing the prescription, multiple reported drug allergies, and patient resistance to changing opioid medications were well correlated with a diagnosis of addiction made during the course of therapy by the patient&#x02019;s pain physician.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of pain</title><p>Pain is difficult to assess, particularly in the context of addiction, where other multiple factors may be driving elevated or suppressed reports of pain. Therefore, the commonly used 0&#x02013;10 pain scale is a good start. However, it is not enough to base pain treatment on this single self-reported pain measure, particularly if the prescriber has concerns about potential opioid misuse.</p><p>Instead, a functional assessment of pain and pain management is a more objective and reliable means to help patients address their pain management goals. This type of assessment should be used in the first meeting with a prescriber, and may be useful if assisted by a pain psychologist. In this form of assessment, the patient and provider identify areas in a patient&#x02019;s life that have been negatively impacted by pain management. The provider and patient would then list three goals that the patient would be able to accomplish if they experienced less pain. In this treatment modality, the provider and patient do not wait until the patient is pain-free to begin behavioral activation, but it occurs on the first visit. The patient&#x02019;s ability to accomplish those goals then indicates if the prescribed pharmacological treatment was helpful or if the side effects decreased the patient&#x02019;s ability to accomplish the goals. With each appointment, the patient and provider assess the patient&#x02019;s ability to complete the goals established at the previous appointment. No dosage increase is made without the patient showing progress in meeting their objectives at the previous level. This changes the entire focus of the treatment plan, ie, rather than focusing on the patient being pain-free, the focus is on helping the patient return to his/her daily activities. The return to daily activities will have the secondary impact of counteracting many mental and physical comorbidities of pain, such as depression, social isolation, and weight gain.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacological treatment</title><p>Pharmacological treatment for opiate addiction in the context of treating chronic pain is a challenging endeavor. An initial comprehensive assessment of each individual case may help design a tailored treatment plan that balances effective pharmacological treatment for both addiction and pain (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-sar-2-145">Table 1</xref>). Recent reformulations of some opioid analgesics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ie, OxyContin, can potentially reduce the misuse of oral medications by crushing or creating intravenous preparations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-sar-2-145">33</xref></p><p>Most patients with chronic pain will already be treated with an opioid analgesic, and the current clinical strategies to treat this comorbidity are frequently geared towards conversion to a long-acting &#x003bc; agonist treatment such as methadone, treatment with a partial &#x003bc; agonist such as buprenorphine, discontinuation of opioid agonist treatment when opioid-induced hyperalgesia develops, and to minimize the diversion.</p></sec><sec><title>Opioid analgesics</title><p>Opiates refer to naturally occurring products that come directly from the opium poppy, such as morphine, codeine, and thebaine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-sar-2-145">34</xref> Opioids are agents that bind to central and peripheral opioid receptors or produce clinical effects like those of natural opium (eg, mimicking opiates). In part, these G protein-coupled receptors may regulate analgesia via a neurotransmitter (eg, gamma aminobutyric acid) and substance P inhibition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-sar-2-145">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-sar-2-145">37</xref> The principle opioid receptors include the &#x003bc; opioid receptor, the &#x003ba; opioid receptor, the &#x003b4; opioid receptor, and the opioid receptor-like receptor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-sar-2-145">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-sar-2-145">38</xref> Other poorly characterized opioid receptors include &#x0025b;, &#x003b9;, &#x003bb;, and &#x003b6;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-sar-2-145">36</xref> Anatomic location and receptor specificity determine the type and extent of the manifested clinical effect. For example, &#x003bc; opioid receptors in the brain and gut are responsible for analgesia and gastrointestinal dysmotility, respectively. However, respiratory depression may result from multiple receptors located both centrally and peripherally.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-sar-2-145">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-sar-2-145">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-sar-2-145">41</xref></p><p>Furlan et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-sar-2-145">42</xref> conducted a meta-analysis of opioids for chronic noncancer pain to assess the efficacy of this treatment. The analysis included 41 trials involving 6019 patients, where 80% of the patients had nociceptive pain, 12% had neuropathic pain, 7% had fibromyalgia, and about 1% had mixed origin pain. The medications that had been evaluated in these trials included tramadol, propoxyphene or dextropropoxyphene, codeine, oxycodone, and morphine. Interestingly, the average duration of treatment was 5 weeks, with 33% of participants dropping out in the opioid-treated group compared with 38% of participants in the placebo groups. The magnitude of pain reduction with opioid analgesics compared with placebo was found to be moderate and the improvement in functional outcomes was even smaller. Eight trials that compared opioids with other analgesics showed that opioids did not differ significantly from nonopioid analgesics for pain treatment. Interesting, opioids were significantly worse than nonopioid analgesics on functional improvement measures. Despite the empirical evidence that opioid analgesics are not highly efficacious for the control of chronic pain and for functional recovery, physicians continue to prescribe them. This leads to a number of interesting points of discussion that should certainly be addressed in a different venue.</p></sec><sec><title>Risk and adverse effects of opioids</title><p>The sine qua non of opioid toxicity is respiratory depression, and other effects, such as miosis, decreased bowel motility, and mental status depression, are also problematic side effects. Patients with severe respiratory depression require supportive care, but antidotal treatment for opioid overdose is pharmacologically directed toward antagonizing central nervous system opioid receptors. Naloxone (Narcan&#x000ae;) is the parenterally available opioid receptor antagonist used in clinical practice to reverse the symptoms of opioid-induced respiratory depression rapidly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-sar-2-145">43</xref> Carefully titrated doses of naloxone may reverse opioid toxicity without inducing symptoms of opioid withdrawal, even in the opioid-dependent patient. Assistance in titrating naloxone dosing may be obtained from local toxicology consultation services or by contacting a poison control center.</p><p>Moore and McQuay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-sar-2-145">44</xref> conducted a systematic review of 34 trials involving a total of 4212 patients and provided information on adverse events related to opioid analgesic use in treating noncancer pain. The most frequent side effects related to treatment with opioid analgesics compared with nonopioid analgesics were nausea, constipation, and somnolence. Eisenberg et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-sar-2-145">45</xref> also reported that treatment involving the use of opioid analgesics for neuropathic pain when compared with treatment with placebo showed higher rates of nausea, constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, and vomiting. Endocrine abnormalities, such as hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction, may also be associated with opioid treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-sar-2-145">46</xref> Opioid treatment may be associated with impaired neuropsychological performance, mainly in reaction times, psychomotor speed, and working memory.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-sar-2-145">25</xref> Prolonged treatment with opioid analgesics commonly results in the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia that occurs when the balance between antinociceptive and pronocioceptive systems are upregulated after opioid exposure, with enhanced vulnerability to experience pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-sar-2-145">47</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Opiates</title><p>Morphine is a natural product that produces effective analgesia following multiple routes of administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-sar-2-145">48</xref> Decreased analgesia observed following enteral absorption is due to first-pass metabolism that is absent following parenteral delivery.

Due to cross-tolerance effects, methadone effectively reduces the euphoric and reinforcing effects of further abuse of short-acting opioids. Further, the longer half-life of methadone reduces fluctuations in opiate receptor stimulation, decreases withdrawal symptoms, and decreases the probability of relapse. Dividing the methadone dose prolongs the analgesic effect of methadone while reducing the reinforcing effect of repeated doses, which can translate into an effective treatment for comorbid pain and addiction. Methadone maintenance programs continue to be the most structured and effective treatment for opiate dependence by decreasing intravenous drug use and the risk of transmissible infections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-sar-2-145">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-sar-2-145">65</xref></p><p>Unfortunately, these methadone treatment programs are not authorized in the US to treat chronic pain patients. The major limitation of methadone maintenance programs in this context is that they are only licensed to treat opiate addiction, and dosage adjustment is only possible in order to stabilize opioid craving, withdrawal, or sedation. While in many ways this restriction may be seen as appropriate given the lack of expertise in pain management, this limitation can be resolved by integrating treatment with primary care or by blending pain management training into the curriculum of addiction psychiatry or addiction medicine programs.</p><p>Another limitation in methadone treatment programs is the regulatory delay of take-home methadone doses, based on complete abstinence, but for patients with comorbid chronic pain this delay would not allow for divided doses, at least during the initial phase of treatment. Patients with chronic pain receive a once-daily dose of methadone for their opiate addiction in these programs, although it is likely that they will still need short-acting opioids for breakthrough pain. Ideally, these patients would be better served in a pain clinic that could simply divide the same methadone dose, which would likely control the pain without the need of additional opioid medications.</p><p>Methadone maintenance in physicians&#x02019; offices or &#x0201c;medical maintenance&#x0201d; is an alternative format for take-home methadone doses that has the potential of expanding methadone maintenance services for those individuals who are psychosocially stable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-sar-2-145">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-sar-2-145">68</xref> This could potentially include treatment of those with additional chronic pain and can translate in resolving both major limitations to methadone maintenance treatment of comorbid pain and addiction.

Additionally, treatment providers outside of substance abuse clinics are less likely to understand the motivational impact of frequent urine samples. Additionally, the few nonaddiction treatment providers who do integrate urine samples into their treatment plan, may not be aware of the need to use toxicology results immediately in the therapeutic context to motivate change in behavioral patterns while presenting the results in a nonjudgmental way to help build an enduring therapeutic alliance. Mostly, patients with addictive disorders respond well to these interventions when they are framed in the context of treatment in a nonpunitive manner.

A number of long-term studies have shown effective, long-lasting analgesia in moderate to severe cancer and noncancer pain, including neuropathic pain, with a low incidence of constipation, nausea, dizziness, and tiredness.</p><p>In 2007, a panel of experts specializing in palliative care and pain treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78-sar-2-145">78</xref> reviewed the clinical experience with transdermal buprenorphine and other analgesics, and considered that transdermal buprenorphine was a valuable treatment for cancer pain, including its neuropathic components. Buprenorphine has been described to exert an antihyperalgesic effect. The dose range of 35&#x02013;140 &#x003bc;g per hour was considered adequate to achieve sufficient pain relief in most patients, although higher doses provided improved pain relief when a slow titration was used.

Conversely, because buprenorphine binds strongly to opioid receptors, the use of supplementary opioids for analgesia is difficult. Therefore, for additional analgesia, or breakthrough pain, it may be necessary to force a change of treatment with buprenorphine to methadone for maintenance medication.</p><p>Patients treated with buprenorphine for addiction can usually be stabilized with sublingual doses of 12&#x02013;16 mg per day.

Because tramadol is an unscheduled drug, clinicians may not be aware of its opioid effect and potential for abuse.

As the patient re-engages with his/her daily activities he/she should be encouraged by the clinician and will likely be rewarded for increasing activities via increased social support, positive reinforcement by family members, more positive self-esteem, and a reduction in pain. As the patient&#x02019;s focus shifts to external stimuli rather than maintaining a focus on their pain in the absence of any cognitive distractors, their pain experience will decrease. True behavioral shaping (or operant conditioning) includes material rewards as well (eg, tokens that can be redeemed for goods), and can be integrated into treatment plans for patients who are initially less intrinsically motivated. This technique in essence uses both operant conditioning and cognitive dissonance. Patients are rewarded (with materially or nonmaterial rewards) for &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; behaviors that they then desire to repeat. As patients continue to engage in positive behaviors, they also transfer the desire to engage in the behavior from &#x0201c;earning a reward&#x0201d; to an internally motivated drive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b120-sar-2-145">120</xref> This has been used successfully to reduce pain reports, as well as opioid use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b121-sar-2-145">121</xref> Usually this treatment is best integrated into a multidisciplinary treatment plan and should not be used as a stand-alone treatment device.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b122-sar-2-145">122</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Self-regulation therapy</title><p>Self-regulation therapy is found under many names in the research literature, including autogenic training, relaxation therapy, biofeedback, and imagery. Meta-analyses have shown that these forms of treatment rival pain reduction rates of opioid medication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b123-sar-2-145">123</xref> This form of therapy is frequently integrated with other psychosocial pain management strategies as one step to increasing patient self-efficacy. The health psychologist directing this therapy teaches patients to reduce their physiological reactivity to pain, cravings, and strong emotional states to improve the patient&#x02019;s control over their pain experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Acupuncture</title><p>In 1998, the National Institutes of Health convened a conference to review the evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture. At that time, it was recognized that sufficient evidence existed to endorse the complementary use of acupuncture to treat (among other things) chronic pain and substance abuse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b124-sar-2-145">124</xref> Research has been somewhat limited in treating substance misuse in the context of chronic pain, but a meta-analysis of studies of acupuncture for chronic pain suggests a minimum of six treatments is needed to see a significant change in pain reports.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b125-sar-2-145">125</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Spirituality</title><p>Integrating spiritual resources into treatment has been of increasing interest to researchers in the areas of both addiction and chronic pain. If patients have a faith background that can support them in reducing opioid use and improving pain management, clinicians should consider encouraging patients to use those resources. Many of those undergoing addiction treatment report that spirituality is a positive coping mechanism for them, and welcome integrating spirituality into treatment protocols.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b126-sar-2-145">126</xref> Prayer is one of the top pain-coping strategies in the context of opioid dependence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b127-sar-2-145">127</xref> Additionally, research has shown that spirituality can be a powerful mechanism for chronic pain relief, and empirically validated treatments have been developed to help patients with chronic pain increase their self-efficacy and to improve their coping with pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-sar-2-145">18</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Meditation</title><p>Meditation techniques vary widely, and include mantram, transcendental meditation, loving-kindness, yoga, and tai chi. Meditation is well supported as a treatment of both pain and opioid addiction.

Support groups provide information and strategies to manage chronic pain. In addition to learning new skills and information, individuals can gain a sense of hope that others have been able to manage their chronic pain. They are able to manage the emotional struggles and spiritual suffering that chronic pain can cause better. Support groups can be safe places to share feelings and receive nonjudgmental acceptance and positive regard.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b136-sar-2-145">136</xref></p><p>There are a variety of types of support groups, including in-person, phone, and Internet options. Some meetings focus on general chronic pain and others focus on pain related to specific diseases, eg, arthritis, cancer, and fibromyalgia. Meetings can be led by experts or peers with chronic pain, be structured or unstructured, and focus on providing information or social support, emotional support, or skills such as relaxation strategies. There are support groups that are modeled on the 12-step peer support model similar to Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs. Chronic Pain Anonymous is the prototype of adapting the 12-step model. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-sar-2-145">Table 2</xref> provides a list of support groups and other Internet resources that provide much more information.</p><p>The Internet is a window to many resources, including some that are very reputable and helpful, but not all. The average person now seeks information on the Internet routinely and many have had the experience of joining chat rooms, blogs, list serves, and message boards. However, there continue to be individuals who will need encouragement to consider this source of information and support. Less Internet-savvy individuals will likely need specific recommendations for Internet groups, as well as ongoing encouragement and conversation about their efforts to connect with support groups. Clinicians might consider giving out the information from Martelli et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b137-sar-2-145">137</xref> who provide an introductory guide to chronic pain resources on the Internet.</p><p>Some advantages to online support groups are that there is no cost, they are easy to access, are available 24 hours and 7 days per week, and allow individuals to remain anonymous. There are advantages to in-person meetings for those individuals who prefer in-person conversations, including more indepth conversation, and a quicker sense of connection with others. Patients can benefit from discussing the options with their clinicians.</p><p>The American Chronic Pain Association has helpful information on their website to prepare individuals to participate in support groups. This organization also has a 10-step guide available which is designed to help people deal better with their pain and improve the quality of their lives. The 10-step guide is quite different from the 12-step model of Chronic Pain Anonymous. The 10-steps include accepting the pain, getting involved in one&#x02019;s own health care, learning to set priorities, setting realistic goals, knowing that one has a basic right to be respected, recognizing that emotions affect physical wellbeing, learning to relax, exercising, seeing the total picture, and reaching out to share with others.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b138-sar-2-145">138</xref></p><p>The 12-step approach is based in spiritual healing and the power of the support group (ie, &#x0201c;fellowship&#x0201d;). The 12-step program begins by encouraging individuals to accept that their life has become unmanageable due to chronic pain (acceptance step) and that individuals are powerless to cure the physiology of the pain but do have the ability to control their reaction to the pain. The emphasis on spirituality is the cornerstone to this approach. For many with chronic pain this is very important and often not a part of traditional medical treatment. Some individuals with chronic pain are angry at their God and feel betrayed in that relationship (&#x0201c;Why me? How could God have allowed this to happen to me?&#x0201d;). The 12-step approach can ultimately be very helpful for these individuals.</p><p>In summary, clinicians should be aware of the wide range of support groups and community resources available, provide this information to patients, and include discussions and recommendations for their patients. Continuing to follow up on their interest and ability to engage in support groups is important.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Diversion</title><p>Diversion of opioid analgesics from legitimate to nonmedical use is on the increase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-sar-2-145">14</xref> At present, prescription opioid analgesics are the most commonly abused prescription medications in the US. Drug diversion occurs at every point in the drug supply chain, ie, at the level of distribution because of theft, at the retail level with the sale of controlled substances without prescriptions, the use of stolen or forged prescriptions, theft from pharmacies or health care facilities, at the patient level with inappropriate prescribing, and the seeking of prescription drugs under false pretenses. The improper disposal, sale, or gifting of legitimately prescribed medications also contributes to the pool of diverted drugs.</p><p>People divert opioid analgesics for a variety of reasons. Although some divert drugs for monetary gain, other individuals may use the illegally acquired drugs themselves. Other nonmedical uses of prescription drugs include exploratory behavior, compulsive use, self-medicating for mood, sleep, or pain, and to alleviate abstinence symptoms. The relationship between increased opioid prescribing and the misuse of opioids is unclear. For example, prescription drug users are less likely to obtain prescription opioids for euphoria than for pain, and those who do use opioid analgesics for euphoria usually purchase these drugs from dealers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b139-sar-2-145">139</xref></p><sec><title>State-level interventions to address misuse of prescription drugs</title><p>Due to the high rates of both chronic pain and prescription drug misuse, state-level interventions have developed over the past 50 years, including requiring continuing medical education credits on these topics, providing guidelines and other resources for prescribers, and the development of prescription monitoring programs. These state-level interventions target the wide range of prescribers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-sar-2-145">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Some states have very helpful websites that provide information for prescribers. An example is the Massachusetts Pain Initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.masspaininitiative.org">www.masspaininitiative.org</ext-link>). This website provides information and downloadable PDFs including a pain resource guide, newsletter, screening tools, and pocket pain management tool. Another state providing helpful information is Oregon (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oregon.gov/OHA/OHPR/PMC/index.shtml/">http://www.oregon.gov/OHA/OHPR/PMC/index.shtml/</ext-link>), which supplies policy information and educational materials.</p><p>Washington State has an online resource guideline on the use of opioids for chronic noncancer pain. The guideline was developed by experts in the field on behalf of the state&#x02019;s Agency Medical Directors Group. The guideline includes other resources and tools to educate prescribers. In addition, the site has free continuing medical education credits (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.agencymeddirectors.wa.gov/">www.agencymeddirectors.wa.gov/</ext-link>). California and Oregon are examples of states that have gone beyond providing information, in that they require their prescribers to take a specific number of continuing medical education credits on chronic pain and pain management.</p><p>State prescription monitoring programs have been implemented in about 50% of states, and are being developed or considered in another 25% of states.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b140-sar-2-145">140</xref> These programs include prevention, intervention, investigation, and enforcement. They were developed to reduce the likelihood of drug diversion by prescribers, doctor shopping, and fraud, and to prevent unnecessary deaths and injuries associated with use of prescription medications for pain management. Prescription monitoring programs can track data from pharmacies and provide prescribers with more complete information about patient use of controlled substances (patient activity reports). They can provide statistical reports to follow state trends and create collaborations with other state agencies and programs. In 2003, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Justice initiated a competitive grant program that attempted to encourage more states to create prescription monitoring programs. At that time, there were about 15 states with prescription monitoring programs. The program was very successful in encouraging other states. Of note, in the past, another source of support for prescription monitoring programs at the state level was the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act of 2005. However, this source has not continued.</p><p>Evaluations of the programs suggest that they are effective, particularly in the overall reduction of prescription of pain management medications and also in increasing physician awareness of this issue. More research is needed. Some of the prescription monitoring programs are not proactive and only provide information when asked. There is a range of medications that the different prescription monitoring programs monitor in different states (many focus on Schedule IV and/or Schedule III medications) and most of the misused medications are in Schedule III. The National Alliance For Model State Drug Laws provides updates on these programs. Another source of information on prescription monitoring programs is on the Alliance of State Pain Initiatives website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://trc.wisc.edu/">http://trc.wisc.edu/</ext-link>), which has an informative position paper.</p><p>Another state level intervention is creating policies that define what an addiction is. There is great variability amongst states, and this topic is important to distinguish between physical dependence that can occur even with appropriate prescribing and taking of these medications. Patients with substance use disorders are at high risk of chronic trauma-induced pain and do need acute pain management. These definitions can sometimes lead to reduced quality of care for this population, which is of course weighed against the issue of misuse of prescription pain relief medications.</p></sec><sec><title>US Food and Drug Administration</title><p>In response to the current epidemic of opioid-related deaths, the FDA intends to require opioid manufacturers to provide training for both clinicians and patients on the appropriate prescribing and use of opioid analgesics. However, in July 2010, an advisory panel (comprising the Anesthetic and Life Support Drugs Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee) rejected the FDA risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS). The majority of members noted that the proposed REMS simply did not go far enough. The REMS, which was proposed to apply solely to long-acting opioid analgesics, should be extended to all opioids, irrespective of the setting in which they are prescribed. In addition to making pain management training mandatory for any clinicians seeking a Drug Enforcement Administration number, the advisory panel indicated that patients should bear a greater burden of responsibility for their own treatment. Committee recommendations included registration of patients who receive long-term opioid therapy and signing treatment agreements. While the final FDA decision on its REMS is not available, the response to opioid abuse and unintentional death will likely have an impact on patients and providers alike.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Opioid analgesic abuse in the context of chronic pain treatment can be a complex issue. This issue is gaining an increasing amount of attention on an international scale. While researchers are scrambling to identify empirically validated treatment options across the pharmacological, psychological, and social domains; governmental legislators and state medical boards are attempting to implement programs to increase education for providers and reduce diversion. Despite this recent attention, a number of serious challenges remain in the treatment of chronic pain in the context of opioid misuse. There are many treatments that have not been empirically validated, there are challenges to using methadone and buprenorphine to treat comorbid pain and addiction, and there are limited educational opportunities for physicians and psychologists who wish to treat patients with chronic pain and opioid misuse. As the field continues to develop strong integrated psychological-pharmacological treatment paradigms, it is hoped that we can reduce the instances of misuse and prevent many cases from progressing to the level of comorbid addiction.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this
