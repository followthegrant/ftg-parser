These proliferating vessels, which appear as an early capillary blush or &#x0201c;puff of smoke&#x0201d; on conventional angiogram, lend the moyamoya syndrome its name (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The moyamoya syndrome refers only to these angiographic findings and can be seen as a consequence of systemic illnesses or treatments, such as Down&#x02019;s syndrome, atherosclerosis, or cranial irradiation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Moyamoya disease refers specifically to idiopathic cases and has been histologically characterized by intimal proliferation, irregular lamina, and medial fibrosis in large arteries, with a marked absence of inflammation. The small proliferative vessels are also atypical and markedly variable in diameter (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Patients with moyamoya disease typically present in one of two age groups, either as children or as adults in their 40s, with transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, or less frequently, hemorrhage. TIAs and strokes are generally felt to result from proximal stenosis causing hemodynamic insufficiency (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The possibility of active embolism as a mechanism for cerebral ischemia in moyamoya syndrome has only recently been investigated (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Understanding the exact mechanism of stroke is important in these patients, as treatment options differ. Hypoperfusion is managed with volume expansion, normocapneia, permissive hypertension, and ultimately surgical bypass. Embolization may be managed with antithrombotic and/or antiplatelet agents (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), which may be risky in fragile moyamoya collaterals.</p><p>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is the primary means of detecting cerebral arterial emboli <italic>in vivo</italic>. Both gaseous and particulate emboli can be identified as high-intensity transient signals (HITS). These signals have a high <italic>in vitro</italic> specificity for emboli (as opposed to artifact) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and have been identified in patients with moyamoya disease (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In spite of this, there has never been visual or pathological proof of embolization in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Case Presentation</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Patient A</title><p>A 44-year-old right-handed hypertensive woman presented with left arm weakness. Symptoms had been present intermittently for several months, but had been particularly severe for 3&#x02009;days. On examination, she had left hemiparesis and left-sided hyperreflexia. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed acute right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarcts in addition to multiple bilateral chronic infarcts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Conventional angiogram demonstrated diffusely narrowed bilateral paraclinoid and supraclinoid ICAs, ACAs, and MCAs with numerous collaterals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patient A, a 44-year-old woman with bilateral moyamoya disease, symptomatic on the right side.

No hematologic, vasculitic, autoimmune, connective tissue, or genetic abnormalities were identified. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no central embolic source and no cardiac dysrhythmias were seen on inpatient telemetry monitoring. Given her age, bilateral proximal vasculopathy, and negative secondary workup, she was diagnosed with moyamoya disease. Because of her progressive neurologic symptoms, plans were made to proceed with bilateral direct superficial temporal artery (STA) to MCA bypasses, in stages, beginning with the symptomatic right side.</p><p>The STA parietal and frontal branches were used for anastomoses to two frontal MCA branches. On two occasions, embolic material was observed passing through the recipient artery in a distal-to-proximal direction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; Video <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S1</xref> in Supplementary Material). A portion was removed and sent for histological analysis, where it was interpreted as non-specific proteinaceous material (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref> in Supplementary Material). The surgery was completed without radiographic or clinical evidence of new ischemia. On post-operative day 1, a surveillance TCD showed 8&#x02013;10 HITS in the right MCA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). While the patient was on aspirin, a platelet aggregation assay was suggestive of incomplete efficacy. Aspirin was increased from 81&#x02009;mg daily to 325&#x02009;mg daily, and 4&#x02009;days later a repeat TCD study detected no HITS and the platelet aggregation study demonstrated improved platelet inhibition.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Intra-operative photos taken during right superficial temporal artery&#x02013;middle cerebral artery bypass of patient A, demonstrating intraluminal embolic material traveling in a distal-to-proximal direction, observed on two occasions <bold>(A,B)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fneur-08-00425-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Transcranial Doppler displaying a high-intensity transient signal (HITS) in the right middle cerebral artery territory of patient A.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fneur-08-00425-g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Patient B</title><p>A 37-year-old woman with a history of complex migraines and Graves disease status post thyroidectomy presented with three weeks of progressive speech difficulty during the third trimester of pregnancy. On examination, she had a mild mixed aphasia. Brain MRI demonstrated embolic-appearing infarcts of various ages in her left frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Conventional angiography showed occlusion of the left MCA M1 segment with local proliferation of collaterals and a normal right ICA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Additional imaging was performed to assess the hemodynamic reserve of the left hemisphere and the patency of the left MCA. TCD vasoreactivity study demonstrated a lesser increase in flow velocity in the left compared with the right MCA at higher end-tidal carbon dioxide concentrations. A single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study performed before and after 1,000&#x02009;mg of intravenous acetazolamide showed baseline perfusion deficits in the left MCA territory with some areas of improved perfusion after the acetazolamide, suggestive of some degree of preserved autoregulation. Additional workup for etiology of stroke included a transesophageal echocardiogram, telemetry monitoring, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, all of which were unrevealing. She had no history of radiation, atherosclerosis, or hyperlipidemia, and extensive serologic testing was unrevealing. Given her unilateral vasculopathy, negative secondary workup, and history of hyperthyroidism, she was diagnosed with moyamoya syndrome.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Patient B, a 37-year-old woman with left-sided moyamoya syndrome. <bold>(A)</bold> Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates multiple embolic-appearing ischemic infarcts in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. <bold>(B)</bold> Cerebral angiogram with severe left ICA stenosis with collateralization. <bold>(C)</bold> Transcranial Doppler displaying HITS in the left MCA territory.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fneur-08-00425-g004"/></fig><p>Transcranial Doppler demonstrated 26 HITS in the left MCA during a 30-min period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C).

Studies using xenon inhalation or single-photon positive emission computed tomography (SPECT) have shown impaired vasoreactivity distal to the stenosis, indicating that distal arterioles are maximally vasodilated and are unable to further augment flow (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) Additionally, brain infarcts have a tendency to occur in areas of perfusion deficit seen on SPECT, in anatomically watershed distributions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>There is also clinical evidence to support the phenomenon of hypoperfusion. In children, there is an association between activities which reduce systemic carbon dioxide (such as crying) and subsequent cerebral vasoconstriction with transient ischemic symptoms (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Furthermore, direct and indirect bypass operations which augment distal perfusion improve outcomes. The 5-year stroke rate of 12% (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) to 27% (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) in patients treated with any kind of bypass surgery is markedly improved compared with 40% (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) to 82% (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) in patients who did not have surgery. Although there is no randomized trial data to prove efficacy, surgery is considered the best available treatment for symptomatic moyamoya syndrome (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The possibility of embolism as an additional mechanism has also been recently investigated. In patients with proximal vascular stenoses, the two mechanisms can be difficult to separate and may coexist. One cannot rely solely on a typical watershed pattern of infarcts on imaging, as such infarcts have been associated with small distal vessels filled with cholesterol emboli (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Both mechanisms may ultimately contribute to the infarcts, in that a state of chronic hypoperfusion from a proximal stenosis may prevent the distal washout of emboli. A TCD study may provide actionable information, as HITS have been associated with emboli in patients with proximal MCA stenoses, with number of HITS linearly correlating with number of infarcts on MRI (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>In moyamoya disease, HITS are detected in about 12% (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) to 20% (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) of patients. Their presence was predicted by recent clinical ischemic events and carried a corrected odds ratio of 10.6 for stroke in the next year (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Furthermore, HITS are equally prevalent in all stages of the disease (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), a finding that might not be expected if hemodynamic compromise was the only factor at play.</p><p>The two patients discussed here provide convincing evidence of the presence of emboli in moyamoya patients. The nature and origin of this embolic material are more difficult to determine. While the pathological interpretation was non-specific, the fact that solid material was surgically extracted eliminates the possibility of the TCD and surgical findings being artifactual. It is also very unlikely that the embolus was a result of the procedure itself as it was seen traveling on two occasions in a distal-to-proximal direction, from an untouched arterial territory toward the surgical clamp. Possible sources of emboli include the severely stenosed proximal intracranial vessels, with disturbed hemodynamics explaining the reversal of flow in distal arteries. Alternatively, severe hemodynamic compromise from proximal stenosis could cause stasis in distal vessels with development of embolic material distally. Given that this finding was observed in both moyamoya disease (patient A) and moyamoya syndrome (patient B), we have no evidence to suggest that the risk of emboli formation would differ between these two groups.</p><p>This is the first report documenting direct visualization of brain embolism in moyamoya. In both cases, HITS were abolished with the use of antithrombotic therapy, but our data are insufficient to establish a cause and effect relationship.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hemodynamic compromise may not be the only cause of brain infarction in patients with moyamoya. Brain embolism occurs in this population, as seen here intra-operatively and by TCD, and may cause brain infarction. This provides a rational basis for antithrombotic therapy, which should be studied further.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Please note that written informed consent was obtained from both patients for the publication of this report.
