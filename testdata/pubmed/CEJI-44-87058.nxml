Lymphocytes obtained from lymph nodes of mice were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; a preferential COX-1 inhibitor), ketoprofen (KET; a non-selective COX inhibitor) and robenacoxib (ROB; a selective COX-2 inhibitor) in concentrations reflecting their plasma levels achieved in vivo at therapeutic doses and in ten-fold lower concentrations. The cells were activated with concanavalin A. In contrast to KET and ROB, ASA had no effect on the activation-induced CD25 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, nor did it affect the counts of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> activated effector (aTeff) and resting (Trest) T cells. Both KET and ROB caused a depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> aTeff cells, and additionally KET induced a loss of CD8<sup>+</sup> Trest cells. Moreover, ROB, but not the other drugs, reduced the activation-induced CD25 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This suggests that non-selective COX inhibitors and selective COX-2 inhibitors may weaken the effector T cell response by producing a negative effect on the count of aTeff cells. Furthermore, the results seem to imply that ASA and KET have certain potential to induce Foxp3 expression in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively. However, all the observed changes were very weakly manifested and therefore it is not certain whether they have clinical importance, despite the statistical significance determined.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NSAIDs</kwd><kwd>COX</kwd><kwd>T cell activation</kwd><kwd>CD4</kwd><kwd>CD8</kwd><kwd>CD25</kwd><kwd>Foxp3</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prevention of inflammation as well as minimizing early and late effects of an inflammatory response are an important component in the therapy of many human and animal diseases and disorders. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) play an enormous role in the management of inflammatory diseases and as analgesics and antipyretics. The major mechanism of action of NSAIDs is through the inhibition of the synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandin (PG), specifically PGE<sub>2</sub> via blocking cyclooxygenase (COX) at sites of inflammation [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There are two COX isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. In the traditional view, COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and has important roles in tissue homeostasis, particularly in the stomach and kidneys as well as in blood clotting [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], whereas COX-2 is a predominantly inducible enzyme, expressed at sites of inflammation, infection and cancer that generates prostanoids, which drive disease pathogenesis [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, it has been commonly thought that the antiinflammatory action of NSAIDs mainly arises from the inhibition of COX-2, whereas their unwanted side effects are largely attributed to the inhibition of COX-1. However, COX-2 is also constitutively expressed and plays a physiological role in many tissues and organs [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], while COX-1 is also involved in inflammatory reactions [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. On the basis of their inhibitory activity on COX-1 and COX-2, at least three major classes of NSAIDs can be distinguished: 1) preferential COX-1 inhibitors, 2) non-selective COX inhibitors, and 3) selective COX-2 inhibitors [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>NSAIDs are a principal group of drugs administered to alleviate symptoms of inflammation which occur in the course of various bacterial or viral infections in humans and animals. It is widely held that the administration of these medications does not significantly influence the immune response to infection, and therefore does not compromise the treatment of an infection. Although NSAIDs are popular all across the world, their effect on T cells has not been as thoroughly investigated as it might have been expected. CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are key players in cell-mediated immune protection of the body, providing a highly efficient defence against viral and bacterial infection. IL-2 is a pleiotropic cytokine, which plays pivotal roles in orchestrating immune responses. This cytokine can act both in an autocrine and paracrine fashion by binding to IL-2R [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Three distinct receptor chains have been identified as components of IL-2R: &#x003b1; (IL-2&#x003b1;, CD25), &#x003b2; (IL-2&#x003b2;, CD122) and &#x003b3; (IL-2&#x003b3;, CD132) chains. IL-2R may exist in three functional forms: the monomeric low-affinity receptor (CD25<sup>+</sup>CD122<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD132<sup>&#x02013;</sup>), the dimeric intermediate-affinity receptor (CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup>CD132<sup>+</sup>), and the trimeric high affinity receptor (CD25<sup>+</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup>CD132<sup>+</sup>); however, only the two latter ones are functional receptor forms [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The dimeric intermediate-affinity receptor is expressed by naive and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In turn, the trimeric high affinity receptor is expressed on recently activated T cells [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A critical point in the development of an immune response is the activation of T lymphocytes, which requires IL-2 binding to its high-affinity IL-2R for optimal signalling. Thus, the CD25 molecule is needed for the high affinity binding of IL-2 to effector cells and is potently induced after T cell activation. Perusal of the available literature has shown a shortage of research on the effect of NSAIDs on CD25 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during their activation. In our previous investigations [<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we evaluated the influence of meloxicam (a NSAID) on the expression of CD25 by bovine peripheral blood T cells, but our research only dealt with constitutive, and not with activation-induced, expression. These studies demonstrated that the drug significantly down-regulated CD25 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and WC1<sup>+</sup> T cells, although the effect did not manifest itself very strongly. In turn, other investigators [<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that ibuprofen and naproxen, but not indomethacin, piroxicam and sulindac, interfered with the binding of IL-2 to T cells and significantly inhibited the proliferative response of T cells to this cytokine. In the light of these findings, a hypothesis was put forth, suggesting that NSAIDs can inhibit CD25 expression during T cells activation, thus making these cells less responsive to IL-2. The current study has been dedicated to the verification of this hypothesis under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. There are certain implications found in the literature suggesting that differences between NSAIDs with respect to their affinity to COX may impinge on the effect of these drugs on CD25 expression [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Considering the above as well as the fact that various classes of NSADs distinguished with respect to their affinity to COX-1 and COX-2 are used in medicine, this research focused on the effects of a preferential COX-1 inhibitor (acetylsalicylic acid &#x02013; ASA), non-selective COX inhibitor (ketoprofen &#x02013; KET) and selective COX-2 inhibitor (robenacoxib &#x02013; ROB) on the CD25 expression on mitogen-activated murine CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, CD25 molecule is not exclusively the marker of T cell activation because natural and induced Foxp3 (Forkhead Box P3 protein)-expressing CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are well known in humans and mice [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the case of activated effector T cells, the CD25 expression is inducible, i.e. it occurs transiently during the activation of these cells [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], whereas Treg cells express this molecule constitutively [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similarly to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, natural and induced Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells are also present within the pool of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, in order to investigate the effect of NSAIDs on the CD25 expression on effector CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, it was necessary to distinguish them from CD25-expressing Treg cells. Foxp3 currently represents the most often used marker to distinguish activated effector T (aTeff) cells (Foxp3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and Foxp3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> cells) from Treg cells (Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> cells); the CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> phenotypes represent mostly resting T (Trest) cells [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Animals</title><p>Female 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the Institute of Experimental and Clinical Medicine of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw.

Because the phenotypes CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> are shared by aTeff and Treg cells, it was necessary to label Foxp3-expressing cells. Consequently, the research presented in this paper additionally provides some new data on the impact of short-term action of NSAIDs on the expression of Foxp3 and count of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> Treg cells when lymphocytes are activated with the mitogen.</p><p>The research has not demonstrated any effect of ASA either on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as regards the analyzed parameters, or on the expression of CD25 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. It was found that ASA increased the percentage of Foxp3-expressing cells within CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subset, but this was not accompanied by a decrease in the absolute count of Foxp3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Moreover, the absolute count of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was distinctly higher in ASA-exposed samples than in the control, although the differences did not prove to be statistically significant. Nevertheless, the overall character of these observations implicates that ASA could have induced the expression of Foxp3 in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which in turn might suggest its potential to generate CD8<sup>+</sup> Treg cells. However, the scale of this phenomenon was relatively small. The results suggest that KET might have induced Foxp3 expression as well, but in this case CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were affected. This is pointed out by the fact that the exposure to this drug caused an increase in the percentage of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells among CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells without accompanying changes in the expression of CD25 or the absolute count of CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Similarly to ASA, this effect did not manifest itself as a corresponding change in the absolute count of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and Foxp3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The most probable reason was that the observed changes in percentages of cells were very weakly expressed, whereas the standard deviations of means of absolute counts were very high. However, it needs to be mentioned that the average absolute count of Foxp3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in samples treated with KET 10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup> M was distinctly lower than the control values.</p><p>The research has shown that the exposure to KET resulted in losses among both CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The degree to which cells from these two subsets decreased in count most clearly was proportionally comparable, which is indicated by the absence of a change in the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells within CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subset. The results imply that KET caused a loss of CD8<sup>+</sup> aTeff, but did not affect the count of CD8<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, which is proven by the fact that the absolute count of Foxp3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was significantly lower than the control values, whereas the absolute count of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells did not differ from the control.</p><p>ROB had a significant influence on the assessed parameters but interestingly when it was applied in the lower concentration. The higher concentration of this drug had hardly any effect on the analyzed cells. The current state of knowledge does not provide us with an answer which could clarify this finding. The exposure to ROB 10<sup>&#x02013;7</sup> M led to a decrease in the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which was not accompanied by a change in the absolute count of the total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population (data not shown), or in the CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. This change was correlated with an increase in the percentage of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells and a decrease in the percentage of Foxp3<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells within the CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset. Thus, these data suggest that the drug reduced the mitogen-induced CD25 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> aTeff cells, and therefore decreased the count of CD4<sup>+</sup> aTeff cells. However, this effect of the drug was rather weakly expressed, which is why most probably it was impossible to capture it in absolute counts.</p><p>The exposure to ROB 10<sup>&#x02013;7</sup> M also led to a reduced percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells within the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subset, but in this case the above decrease was accompanied by a decline in the absolute count of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population (<italic>p</italic> = 0.035; data not shown). Our further analysis revealed that the drug induced a reduction in the absolute counts of CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> and Foxp3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>, but not CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> and Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These results show that ROB caused a loss among CD8<sup>+</sup> aTeff cells. However, it is worth noting that the genesis of ROB-induced reduction in the count of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> aTeff cells seems to be different. In the former case, the decrease was caused exclusively by the inhibition of CD25 expression on CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, whereas in the latter instance there was an actual loss of Foxp3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (it cannot be excluded that the drug might have additionally reduced the CD25 expression). In a short-term culture situation, this cell loss can only be explained by the proapoptotic action of the tested substance. The exposure to ROB or KET led to an increase in the percentage of Foxp3-expressing cells within the CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subset. It would be incorrect to claim that these drugs generated the formation of CD8<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, because the increase in the percentage of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells was most evidently an apparent one, i.e. it was due to the decrease in the absolute count of Foxp3<sup>&#x02013;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>The available literature contains scarcely any reports on the effect of NSAIDs on CD25 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during their activation. Our results are in agreement with the data obtained by I&#x000f1;iguez <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], who also demonstrated that a preferential COX-1 inhibitor (indomethacin) had no effect on the activation-induced CD25 expression on CD3<sup>+</sup> cells, whereas a selective COX-2 inhibitor (NS398) down-regulated it. Furthermore, our previous studies showed that meloxicam, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, reduced constitutive CD25 expression on bovine CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and WC1<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Besides, it was demonstrated that non-preferential COX inhibitors (ibuprofen and naproxen) significantly inhibited the proliferative response of T cells to IL-2, while preferential COX-1 inhibitors (indomethacin and piroxicam) did not alter this response. These results are consistent with the ones discussed herein, because a CD25 molecule is needed for the high affinity binding of IL-2 to aTeff cells [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, the current results referred to in the cited literature suggest that the inhibition of COX-2, and not of COX-1, can lead to reduction in the activation-induced CD25 expression on T cells. Considering the mechanism of action of NSAIDs, such results and conclusions may appear paradoxical, because our earlier studies revealed that PGE<sub>2</sub> down-regulated activation-induced CD25 expression on bovine CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and WC1<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, there are reports [<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] indicating that PGE<sub>2</sub> down-regulated the CD25 expression on human T cells. When taking into consideration these results as well as the fact that NSAIDs reduce the synthesis of PGE<sub>2</sub>, it should be expected that these drugs would up-regulate the CD25 expression. Clearly, the effect of NSAIDs on CD25 expression is produced through some other mechanism. The current data implicate that ASA and KET have some potential to induce Foxp3 expression in CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively, which may mean that they are capable of generating Treg cells. This suggestion is supported by results of other studies, where it was proven than KET induced Foxp3 expression in lymph node cells [<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and ASA increased the relative levels of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells among CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in the periphery and thymus of mice [<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, ASA, unlike KET and ROB, did not affect the activation-induced CD25 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, nor did it influence the count of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> aTeff and Trest cells. Both KET and ROB caused some loss among CD8<sup>+</sup> aTeff cells, in addition to which KET induced a loss among CD8<sup>+</sup> Trest cells. Moreover, ROB, but not the other drugs, reduced the activation-induced CD25 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This finding suggests that non-selective COX inhibitors and selective COX-2 inhibitors may weaken the effector T cell response by decreasing the count of aTeff cells. On the other hand, the above effect can be interpreted as an immunosuppressive action, although it can also be perceived as an anti-inflammatory action. Our results suggest that ASA and KET possess certain potential to induce Foxp3 expression in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively. However, it should be underlined that all the changes observed in this experiment were very weakly expressed and therefore it is uncertain whether they have clinical importance, despite being statistically significant.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The study was supported by grant No. 15.610.008-300 from the University of Warmia and Mazury in
