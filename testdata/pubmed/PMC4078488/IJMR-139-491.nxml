This review documents the history of vaccines and vaccination in India with an objective to derive lessons for policy direction to expand the benefits of vaccination in the country. A brief historical perspective on smallpox disease and preventive efforts since antiquity is followed by an overview of 19<sup>th</sup> century efforts to replace variolation by vaccination, setting up of a few vaccine institutes, cholera vaccine trial and the discovery of plague vaccine. The early twentieth century witnessed the challenges in expansion of smallpox vaccination, typhoid vaccine trial in Indian army personnel, and setting up of vaccine institutes in almost each of the then Indian States. In the post-independence period, the BCG vaccine laboratory and other national institutes were established; a number of private vaccine manufacturers came up, besides the continuation of smallpox eradication effort till the country became smallpox free in 1977. The Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) (1978) and then Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) (1985) were launched in India. The intervening events since UIP till India being declared non-endemic for poliomyelitis in 2012 have been described. Though the preventive efforts from diseases were practiced in India, the reluctance, opposition and a slow acceptance of vaccination have been the characteristic of vaccination history in the country. The operational challenges keep the coverage inequitable in the country. The lessons from the past events have been analysed and interpreted to guide immunization efforts.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Eradication</kwd><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>smallpox</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd><kwd>vaccines</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vaccination is a proven and one of the most cost-effective child survival interventions<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. All countries in the world have an immunization programme to deliver selected vaccines to the targeted beneficiaries, specially focusing on pregnant women, infants and children, who are at a high risk of diseases preventable by vaccines. There are at least 27 causative agents against which vaccines are available and many more agents are targeted for development of vaccines<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. The number of antigens in the immunization programmes varies from country to country; however, there are a few selected antigens against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, hepatitis B which are part of immunization programmes in most of the countries in the world. The first vaccine (small pox) was discovered in 1798. The most striking success of these efforts has been the eradication of smallpox disease from the planet<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Though a proven cost-effective preventive intervention, the benefits of immunization is not reaching to many children who are at the maximum risk of the diseases preventable by these vaccines. Majority of the children who do not receive these vaccines live in developing countries. As per the recent nation-wide survey data, of the targeted annual cohort of 26 million infants in India, only 61 per cent had received all due vaccines<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Understandably, the implementation of vaccination programme and ensuring that the benefits of vaccines reach to each and every possible beneficiary is a challenging task. This review documents the history of vaccines and vaccination in India and analyses the events of past to provide policy direction for the vaccination efforts in the country. The focuses is on broader events and it does not address detailed operational aspects of immunization programme in the country; however, the selected global timelines and events have been referred to provide a context and perspective.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Ancient times till first documented smallpox vaccination in India in 1802</title><p>The history of vaccines and vaccination starts with the first effort to prevent disease in the society<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Smallpox (like many other infectious diseases including measles) was well known since ancient times and believed to have originated in India or Egypt, over 3,000 years ago<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. This was subject of observation for many learned minds and physicians such as Thucydides in 430 BC and Rhazes (also known as Abu Bakr) in 910 AD who reported that people affected by smallpox were protected from the future infections<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Abu Bakr also gave the initial (and probably the first) account of distinguishing measles and smallpox in 900 AD. From India, there are a few descriptions of occurrence of disease; however, one of the best recorded smallpox epidemics was reported from Goa in 1545 AD, when an estimated 8,000 children died<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Historians and physicians have sometimes referred smallpox as &#x02018;Indian Plague&#x02019;, which suggests that the disease might be widely prevalent in India in the earlier times.</p><p>The evidence indicates that smallpox inoculation was practiced in China in around 1000 AD and in India, Turkey, and probably Africa as well<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. The inoculation, &#x02018;the process of injecting an infective agent in a healthy person, which leads to often mild disease and preventing that individual from future serious disease&#x02019; was common in India<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Inoculation with smallpox virus material called variolation preceded smallpox vaccination and was one of the accepted approaches to protect from the disease. Inoculation was widely practiced in India (and later on, even a ban by Bengal Presidency in 1804 had limited effect on the practice)<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. A detailed description of the practice of inoculation in India was given by Dr JZ Holwell in 1767 to the President and other members of Royal College of Physicians in London<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. (The inoculation practice has been documented from different parts of India, especially in Bengal and Bombay presidencies<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) however, there is a limited record of how many people were annually inoculated from smallpox matter in India during that period.</p><p>Smallpox affected all races and all regions of the world, with frequent epidemics and inoculation was practiced in a number of countries in East; however, the practice reached Europe especially in the United Kingdom not before early 18<sup>th</sup> century<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Knowing the severity of disease, various approaches were tried to prevent the scourge. Benjamin Jesty, an English farmer and cattle-breeder, in 1774 conducted an experiment with cowpox matter inoculation on his wife and two children and had almost discovered the first smallpox vaccine<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Twenty two years later, Edward Jenner made similar observation in milk-maids and noticed that a person inoculated with cow-pox virus, would develop a mild cowpox disease, with no serious risks and would be protected from future smallpox infections. Jenner's observation was his discovery of smallpox vaccine. Jenner published his observation in his seminal work titled &#x02018;An enquiry into the causes and effects of Variolae Vaccinae&#x02019; in 1798. Soon after Jenner's publication, the smallpox vaccination spread to many parts of the world, especially Europe and America. The smallpox vaccine reached India in 1802 (within 4 years)<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.

Anna Dusthall, a three year old child from Bombay (now Mumbai) became the first person in India to receive smallpox vaccine on June 14, 1802<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. From Bombay, through human chain of vaccinees, the smallpox vaccine as lymph was sent to Madras, Poona (Pune), Hyderabad and Surat<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. The proven benefits of smallpox vaccination had such impact that variolation was outlawed in many European countries and also in some provinces of India as early as 1804. There were special efforts done by officials of Indian Medical Services to popularise smallpox vaccination. The uptake in the general public was low due to several reasons including need to pay a small fee for vaccination, belief in the practice of inoculation and that the disease was a wrath of goddess and many other misconceptions. Another major factor was organized oppositions by erstwhile &#x02018;<italic>Tikadaars</italic>&#x02019; (who were involved in variolation) to smallpox vaccination fearing that they might lose their jobs. In fact, the variolation continued to be practiced in India even after ban and till early and mid-Twentieth century<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. In the initial years, all the lymph required for vaccination was coming from England and then kept alive through chain of volunteers for further vaccination in India. By 1850 AD, as vaccine coverage increased, the challenges such some post-vaccination deaths, post-operative complications and unsuccessful vaccine take raised programmatic difficulties. This was complicated by resistance from some Hindus on pretext of vaccine coming from cow, which is considered a sacred animal<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.</p><p>The vaccination was conducted by identified limited numbers of &#x02018;trained vaccinators&#x02019;, who would travel from one place to another and often termed as &#x02018;travelling vaccinators&#x02019;. These vaccinators were licensed to conduct vaccination (thus also called &#x0201c;Licensed vaccinators&#x02019;) and not paid by government, thus would charge a small fee for vaccination from beneficiaries. This fee became a major reason for low coverage in rural areas and by the poor people. Later on, to address this challenge the concept of &#x02018;Paid vaccinators&#x02019; came, who were hired as salaried employees by provincial governments to administer vaccination in rural areas and were paid by the government. The system of &#x02018;Paid vaccinators&#x02019; was started in the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p><p>The vaccination in the 19<sup>th</sup> century was implemented through &#x02018;vaccination and sanitary departments&#x02019; and the Sanitary Commissioners were in-charge of these efforts. However, the structure and approaches adopted in each province varied slightly. The vaccination would be offered through &#x02018;dispensaries&#x02019; in urban areas, which would also act as a store for vaccine lymph. There were a few variations <italic>i.e</italic>. Bombay system of vaccination, started in 1827, was largely reliant on touring/travelling vaccinators, responsible for vaccination circles or subdivisions. Later on, Bombay system became most widely used approach in other provinces of India. Nearly two third of vaccination used to be done by touring vaccinators and rest at the dispensary system in India<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>.</p><p>The Compulsory Vaccination Act was passed in India in 1892 to ensure higher coverage with smallpox and reduce the epidemic. The &#x02018;Act&#x02019; largely remained on the papers except at the times of epidemics. On records, the law was in force in approximately 80 per cent of the districts of British India in 1938<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Vaccine availability and manufacturing in India (1802-1899)</title><p>Smallpox matter was used for inoculation and the material used for smallpox vaccination was lymph from cowpox matter. The early vaccines (or vaccine matters, as called often) were not made in manufacturing units. It was lymph collected from cows after vaccinating them with cowpox matter. Subsequently, there were a few improvisations in form of vaccine farms and cow farms for production of vaccine lymph in different parts of the world.</p><p>In India, till 1850, the vaccine was imported from Great Britain. However, there were real logistic challenges in transport of vaccine to India. The increased demand in later years led to the shortage of vaccine or lymph in the country and mandated the Government of India to find alternatives for increasing sustained vaccine supply. There are records of a few research efforts in Bombay (Mumbai) as early as 1832 and the animal experiments for lymph started in Madras (now Chennai) in 1879, with initial success in 1880<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. In later part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, with increased vaccine material supply, the research focus shifted to an effective preservation technique to ensure transport of vaccine material to the rural and difficult to access areas. As early as in 1895, glycerine was used in India for efficient transport of vaccine material as glycerinated lymph paste. Lanoline and Vaseline were other preservatives used in India. Vaccine with boric acid, which was also reported to be effective, was developed in 1925<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>Another important event of this period was a cholera epidemic in Bengal and other parts of India. Following a recommendation of British Government, the Government of India accepted a request of Dr Haffkine to come and conduct Cholera vaccine trial in India. In 1893, Dr Haffkine conducted vaccine trials in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, and showed the efficacy of his vaccine in the effective control of the disease. Though Haffkine knew the process for the development of cholera vaccine, he had proven its efficacy here in India<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> (and Personal Communication: Dr Abhay Choudhury, Director, Haffkine Institute, 2012). A plague epidemic started in India in 1896 (which led to the enactment of Epidemic Act of 1896, which is still applicable in the country). The Government of India requested him to work on the development of plague vaccine and provided him a two-room set in Grant Medical College, Mumbai, to set up his Laboratory. Dr Haffkine developed plague vaccine in 1897 and it is arguably, the first vaccine developed in India. This laboratory was called Plague Laboratory since 1899, renamed as Bombay Bacteriological Lab in 1905 and then finally named as Haffkine Institute in 1925, as it is known today<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Vaccination in India (1900-1947)</title><p>The beginning of twentieth century witnessed a few socio-scientific-geopolitical events, which had lasting effect on vaccination efforts in the country. These changes were:</p><p><italic>(i)</italic> Outbreak of cholera and plague in India (1896-1907) and the services of already limited number of vaccinators were diverted to epidemic control efforts,</p><p><italic>(ii)</italic> The First World War (1914-1918) started and with coinciding Influenza Pandemic (which reportedly killed around 17 million Indians) became a priority for the Government,</p><p><italic>(iii)</italic> New scientific understanding that two doses of smallpox vaccine would be needed for long lasting protection. It was a challenge considering that it meant convincing people to get vaccinated twice with perceived inconvenient and painful procedure<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p><italic>(iv)</italic> Most significantly, the Government of India Act of 1919, which devolved a number of administrative powers from Centre to Provinces, by which the local self-governments were assigned the responsibilities of providing health services, including smallpox vaccination. (The health service delivery being a State subject in India has an origin in this Act).</p><p>This period provides an insight as to how socio-political situation can adversely affect health of the people. Specially, &#x02018;The 1919 Act&#x02019; originated with good intentions but the local government had limited financial capacities to fund vaccinators and often led to the variable efforts and progress on smallpox vaccination. The vaccination efforts continued with variable progress till 1939, when World War II was started. Vaccination efforts, though still a focus of local administration, became a casualty of the war. The vaccination coverage went down and in 1944-1945 in India, the highest numbers of smallpox cases in the last two decades were reported. As soon as the World War II ended, the focus was brought back on smallpox vaccination and cases decreased suddenly<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Another important milestone of this period was the typhoid vaccine trials in India between 1904-1908. The Anti-typhoid Committee of British Army Medical Department carried out extensive trial of vaccine in 24 units of British Army, joining their operations in India and Egypt<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. The Committee compared the attack rate of typhoid amongst volunteers for vaccination and amongst non-volunteers in Army (and thus non-vaccinated) individuals and reported six-fold decrease in attack rate amongst vaccinated. Though the methods were not strictly scientific and received adverse criticism, the trial had decisive influence on the decision making on typhoid vaccination<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>.

Additionally, cholera and plague vaccines were being produced in the country. One major event of this time was death of a few people in Punjab province after plague vaccination in 1902. Officials blamed Dr Haffkine for poor quality of vaccine and he was relieved from his position. Later on, the matter was investigated by eminent scientist such as Sir Ronald Ross and it was found that the same batch of plague vaccine was safely administered to many other places and these deaths were due to a contamination of vaccine vial. Dr Haffkine was exonerated and offered to be the Director of Haffkine institute, which he declined<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. The deaths following vaccination were also reported after smallpox vaccination in all these years of vaccination; however, this event of death after plague vaccine in Punjab can arguably be called the first systematically documented Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) investigation in India. The plague vaccination suffered major setback after this event. This event highlights the risk as to how AEFI can adversely affect the vaccination programme. It also highlights the need for a more robust and detailed procedure for investigation of deaths following vaccination which has become crucial platform for a functioning immunization programme in the recent times.</p><p>In early twentieth century, at least four vaccines (smallpox, cholera, plague, and typhoid) were available in the country. However, the major challenge was the shift of smallpox vaccination to two dose schedule. This had an important implication in the form of additional vaccine requirement. Considering this, the Government of India decided to set up new vaccine institutes. The initial vaccine research unit was Haffkine Institute for plague vaccine. The smallpox vaccine lymph was being produced in Shillong and a few other places since 1890<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. In 1904/1905, Central Research Institute was set up in Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh and then Pasteur Institute of Sothern India (as it was known then) in Coonoor in 1907 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table III</xref>)<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>.

In May 1948, the Government of India issued a press note stating that tuberculosis was &#x0201c;assuming epidemic proportions&#x0201d; in the country, and that it had &#x0201c;after careful consideration&#x0201d; decided to introduce BCG vaccination on a limited scale and under strict supervision as a measure to control the disease<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. A BCG Vaccine Laboratory at King Institute, Guindy, Madras (Chennai), Tamil Nadu, was set up in 1948<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. In August 1948, the first BCG vaccinations were conducted in India. The work on BCG had started in India as a pilot project in two centres in 1948. In 1949, the BCG vaccination was extended to schools in almost all States of India. The International Tuberculosis Campaign (ITC) supported Government of India in expansion and scale up of BCG vaccination. From February 1949, five ITC teams demonstrated BCG vaccination in various urban centres with the start of a small scale pilot in Madanapalle. In a Conference in the summer of 1951 attended by representatives of the State Government, a proposal for the extension of mass BCG Vaccination Campaign throughout India was endorsed. The Government of India prepared a Plan of Operations laying down the organizational set-up required in each State to cover the total young population during a five to seven year period. The BCG vaccination was expanded through mass campaigns in 1951. The ITC support ended in June 1951 and from July 1951, BCG vaccination was conducted by the Indian authorities in close cooperation with UNICEF, which continued to provide financial support, and WHO, which gave technical advice<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. In 1955-1956, the BCG vaccination mass campaign covered all the States of the Indian Union<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. BCG vaccination became a part of the National Tuberculosis Control Programme (NTCP), which was started in 1962<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. The related events of this period were establishment of Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Center, later known as Tuberculosis Research Center (TRC) in Madras (Chennai) (now renamed as National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis) in 1956 and that of National Tuberculosis Institute (NTI) in 1959<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>.</p><p>There were targeted efforts to control TB and the efficacy of BCG vaccine in prevention of pulmonary TB was in questions, since the very beginning. However, BCG vaccination was the only available protective measure against TB. A large BCG trial named &#x02018;Feasibility Study for TB Prevention Trial&#x02019; was conducted in Chingelput, Tamil Nadu. This trial was started in 1968, recruitment and fifteen year follow up for all cases was completed by 1987. The trial showed that BCG vaccination did not offer significant protection against TB of the lung which occurs mostly in adults. After that, in India BCG vaccination policy was revised and it was recommended to be given at an early age preferably before the end of the first year after birth by integrating under UIP.

After much deliberation in 1958, the World Health Assembly (WHA) passed a resolution to eradicate smallpox, an event which changed the entire public health in the years to come. Following this resolution, India started National Smallpox Eradication Programme (NSEP) in 1962, with an objective of successfully vaccinating entire population in the next three years<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.

However, after five years of implementation, the coverage remained low and outbreaks were still being reported.

In 1969, the vaccination technique changed from antiquated &#x02018;rotary lancet&#x02019; to a new &#x02018;bifurcated needle technique&#x02019;. Another major change was availability of a more potent, heat stable and freeze dried vaccine in 1971, replacing old liquid vaccine.

In the same year, a national mobilization of health workforce was done and intensive campaign started. In the first phase (July-August 1973) search and containment efforts were done. In the second phase, UP, Bihar, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh States were targeted between October to December 1973. Every village, every household in these States was visited to detect any suspected case within a period of one week. The next three weeks were spent in case investigation and doing containment operations by health staff. In 1974, following massive efforts, 188,000 cases and 31,000 deaths were reported due to smallpox. The Government of India intensified the search and containment and vaccination efforts.

Data recording and reporting is sub-optimal and disease surveillance system desires a lot for improvement. The lack of supervision and monitoring is often cited and communication for increasing immunization coverage is limited. The system for AEFI surveillance is improving but still need to be strengthened<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>. There have been systematic efforts in the last decade to show a hope that immunization coverage would be improved in coming months and years.</p><p>The history of vaccination efforts suggests that the systematic methodological rigour is required to improve coverage with all antigens in a diverse country like India, with health being state subject. The methodological rigour of past and focus on research has a lot to guide immunization programme in India. Some of the key common areas in early vaccination efforts and current times are as follows : <italic>(i)</italic> Smallpox control efforts focused both on hygiene and sanitation measures and vaccination. This approach has to be followed for many new antigens such as Rotavirus diarrhoea <italic>etc</italic>.; <italic>(ii)</italic> There was strong opposition of vaccination by a section of experts and society. These groups derived strength from similar groups in other countries. Though time has changed, the similar groups exist in the present times, <italic>(iii)</italic> Limited and incomplete reporting of smallpox cases and deaths (disease surveillance) failed the programme managers to prove that vaccination is making any significant change. The disease surveillance scenario poses similar challenges in the current times.</p><p>The programme has become more complicated with addition of new antigens and disappearing diseases (as a result of improved coverage) has raised people's expectations on the safety standards of the vaccines. During this period, stringent safety regulation has made vaccine research costly with more sophisticated technique. These factors have led to reduction in the number of vaccine manufacturers in both public and private sectors.</p><p>A major challenge in vaccine production in India is sub-optimal investment by public sector for vaccine research. The vaccine manufacturing units set in India are still producing some of the traditional vaccines and there appears to be a need for more funding and research on newer antigens. Indian manufacturers are participating in the development and clinical trials of a number of other candidate vaccines which would ensure that these vaccines are accessible to Indian population, as and when these become available<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>. The national vaccine policy of India has suggested that &#x02018;a number of linkages need to be explored between academia, industry and international institutions such as National Institute of Health (NIH), Gates Foundation, the GAVI Alliance, PATH, World Health Organization and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), <italic>etc</italic><xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>.</p><p>Immunization programme needs better support and funding for conducting operational research to address programmatic issues and to improve coverage with all antigens in UIP of India. There is increasing demand for additional antigens such as mumps, rubella, and typhoid vaccine in India. The immunization programme in India is a centrally funded programme. A good proportion of children are vaccinated with available and licensed non UIP antigens. Increasing proportion of immunization is being provided by private sector and the proportion is likely to increase over coming years. The benefits of vaccination need to be extended beyond traditional childhood period and new approach of &#x02018;life-course immunization&#x02019; for including larger age groups such as adolescent and elderly is being contemplated globally, with an argument that not offering the benefits of available safe and effective vaccines is an ethical issue<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. The national technical bodies need to deliberate and come up with its advice and opinion. This would change the dynamics and government may not be able to finance all vaccination efforts and there would be increasing role of professional association in supporting vaccination efforts of the country. This highlights the futuristic need for better and regular interactions in government programme managers and professional bodies to shape the vaccination efforts in the country.</p><p>The systematic efforts are needed to generate evidence for making a decision to (or not to) introduce new antigens in the programme and to prove the impact of vaccine introduction on disease, once the vaccine is introduced. There have been discussions for strengthening VPD surveillance in the country since the beginning of UIP; however, surveillance for VPDs is far from optimal. The discussion should be moved from implementation and a robust VPD surveillance system, encompassing all existing and upcoming antigens, should be developed with ability to provide sufficiently representative data from all parts of the country.</p><p>Implementing immunization programme cannot be segregated from the &#x02018;knowledge-base&#x02019; in immunology. The number of trained people in vaccinology and immunology in India is less than what country of this size requires. Globally, the practice of immunology has slowly become part of vaccinology; however, in India there is still limited focus on training in vaccinology and immunology. The technologies for ensuring efficient and potent vaccines to the beneficiaries are becoming available and should be optimally utilized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The evolution of vaccination efforts in India is far more complex than presented in this review and every single event merits a detailed analysis. Though preventive efforts from diseases were practiced in India, the reluctance, opposition and slow acceptance of vaccination have been the characteristic of vaccination history. The operational challenges keep the coverage inequitable in the country. The lessons from the past events have been analysed and interpreted to guide immunization efforts. There are many lessons learnt from the history from extending the benefits of immunization to every possible beneficiary in the country to achieve the stated policy goals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>A part of this work was done when the author was a faculty member at GR Medical College, Gwalior, India.
