Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is a newly characterized oncoprotein and its overexpression has been reported to promote cellular epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the tumor progression of ccRCC. The present study examined the effects of miR-218 on CIP2A expression in ccRCC cells. The results demonstrated that the expression level of miR-218 was lower in ccRCC tissues compared with that in adjacent non-tumor renal tissues. In addition, it was identified that miR-128 could directly bind to the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region of CIP2A. Furthermore, a negative correlation between the expression levels of miR-218 and CIP2A was detected in ccRCC. Additionally, the downregulation of CIP2A or overexpression of miR-218 in ccRCC cells was revealed to inhibit cell proliferation and migration. In summary, these data suggest that miR-218 serves a role in the regulation of CIP2A and elucidate its consequences on tumor progression, tumor cell proliferation and migration. These results indicate that miR-218 may exhibit potential as a molecular target for the treatment of ccRCC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>microRNA-218</kwd><kwd>cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A</kwd><kwd>clear cell renal cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>tumor suppressor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer type in human urological systems and accounts for almost 3% of all adult malignancies (<xref rid="b1-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of RCC and accounts for 70&#x02013;80% of all occurrences of RCC (<xref rid="b2-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). At the time of diagnosis, ~33% of patients with ccRCC have distant metastases, which makes it difficult or occasionally impossible to perform surgery (<xref rid="b3-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In addition, treatment strategies for metastatic ccRCC are limited, as it is often resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (<xref rid="b4-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, biomarkers that can assist with early diagnosis or prognosis prediction are urgently required.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional stage (<xref rid="b5-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It is understood that this process is mediated via direct binding to the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA transcripts (<xref rid="b6-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The value of miRNAs in the diagnosis or treatment of ccRCC has received considerable attention (<xref rid="b7-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Detection of aberrantly expressed miRNAs can distinguish ccRCC from normal tissue and predict the prognosis of patients with ccRCC (<xref rid="b8-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>miR-218 is a vertebrate-specific intronic miRNA and the gene that encodes miR-218 is located at the introns of tumor suppressor slit guidance ligand (SLIT)2 and SLIT3 (<xref rid="b10-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of miR-218 is significantly reduced in numerous types of human cancer, including colorectal cancer (<xref rid="b11-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), breast cancer (<xref rid="b12-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), gastric cancer (<xref rid="b10-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), non-small cell lung cancer (<xref rid="b13-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and ovarian cancer (<xref rid="b14-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), which suggests that miR-218 can function as a tumor suppressor. Reduced expression of miR-218 was associated with advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasis in ovarian cancer, and restoration of miR-218 expression levels inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> by targeting runt-related transcription factor 2 (<xref rid="b14-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Another study demonstrated that miR-218 serves as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer by targeting interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and that it negatively correlates with a poor prognosis (<xref rid="b15-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, the expression status and the mechanism by which miR-218 exerts its clinical significance in ccRCC remain largely unknown.</p><p>Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the expression of miR-218 in ccRCC. In addition, the biological roles of miR-218 on proliferation and migration were examined. In addition, the downstream target of miR-218 was examined by bioinformation analysis tool and western blot analysis. The present study provided a novel insight into the mechanism of ccRCC tumor progression and identified a novel biomarker for ccRCC treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Patients and tissue samples</title><p>A total of 43 patients (mean age, 56.7; range, 42&#x02013;73 years old) with ccRCC treated at The First Central Hospital of Baoding (Baoding, China) between January 2011 and October 2012 were enrolled in the study.

However, the expression pattern and significance of miR-218 in ccRCC is poorly understood. Therefore, the current study first examined miR-218 expression in ccRCC tissues, and it was identified that the expression level of miR-218 was lower in ccRCC tissues compared with that in adjacent non-tumor tissues. Low-level expression of miR-218 exhibited a significant association with characteristics of a more aggressive tumor phenotype, including larger tumor size and higher tumor stage. Notably, it was revealed that low expression of miR-218 was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival rate for patients with ccRCC. In functional assays, cell proliferation and migration were significantly suppressed by miR-218 expression. These findings suggest that miR-218 serves a tumor suppressor role in the development of ccRCC.</p><p>It is understood that cell proliferation and migration are important hallmarks of malignant tumors (<xref rid="b24-ol-0-0-9986" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Therefore, identification of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of ccRCC proliferation and migration is crucial. In the present study, miR-218 targets were predicted to investigate the mechanism underlying the function of miR-218 in ccRCC. Using online predication and luciferase reporter assay, it was revealed that CIP2A may be a target of miR-218 in ccRCC. To support this, it was identified that the expression level of CIP2A was inversely correlated with the expression level of miR-218 in ccRCC, and that CIP2A expression could be negatively regulated by miR-218. Further <italic>in vitro</italic> functional assays revealed that knockdown of CIP2A reduced cell proliferation and migration. Cell proliferation and migration were lower in cells co-transfected with si-CIP2A and miR-218 inhibitor compared with that in the cells only transfected with miR-218 inhibitor. In summary, these findings indicate that miR-218 exerts its biological function in ccRCC by regulating the expression of CIP2A.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study investigated the possible role of miR-218 in ccRCC progression and its underlying mechanisms. The results suggest that miR-218 functions as a novel tumor suppressor by regulating the expression of CIP2A in ccRCC and that miR-218 may be used as a therapeutic target for ccRCC treatment in the future. Although certain novel insights into the mechanisms regarding the progression of ccRCC were provided in the present study, the mechanisms by which miR-218 is downregulated require elucidation in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by the Hebei Province Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no.
