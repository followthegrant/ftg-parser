A number of algorithms and tools have been developed for analyzing the large datasets generated by ChIP-chip (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]) and ChIP-seq experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The output from such algorithms is typically presented as a list of binding sites (also referred to as peaks) that are significantly enriched in the ChIP sample compared to the control sample(s). The identified binding sites are usually converted to a format, such as BED or Wiggle (WIG), that can be uploaded to the UCSC Genome Browser, an open-access, web-based, up-to-date source for genome sequence data integrated with a large collection of related annotations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This resource allows the user to build a custom annotation track to view the proximity of the DNA-binding sites to various genomic features such as genes, exons, transcription start sites and conserved elements. However, searching the UCSC Genome Browser can be a daunting task for the user, particularly if there are a large number of binding sites or the binding sites are distributed widely across the genome.</p><p>Several useful web applications have been developed for managing and annotating ChIP-chip data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and ChIP-seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, there is a need for technology platform-independent and genome-independent batch annotation tools. Here we describe a Bioconductor package called <italic>ChIPpeakAnno </italic>that facilitates batch annotation, using a variety of annotation sources, of binding sites identified by any technologies which result in large number of enriched genomic regions, such as ChIP- chip, ChIP-seq and CAGE. <italic>ChIPpeakAnno </italic>leverages the statistical environment R/Bioconductor with various sources of annotations, such as Ensembl, the UCSC genome database and others. In addition, users have the flexibility to label enriched regions with any annotation of interest such as a dataset from the literature. This package is available from Bioconductor, an open source and open development software project specializing in biological data analysis and integration based on R, a system for statistical computation and graphics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Bioconductor tools are distributed as separate but interoperable packages, each specializing in different areas of biological data analysis, such as the <italic>limma </italic>package for analyzing microarray data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and the <italic>biomaRt </italic>package for retrieving genomic annotation from the federated query system BioMart Ensembl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The <italic>ChIPpeakAnno </italic>package contains various functionalities to batch-annotate enriched regions identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip or CAGE experiments.</p><p><italic>ChIPpeakAnno </italic>emphasizes flexibility, integration and ease of use. Users are supplied with functionalities for annotating peaks from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, CAGE or any experiment resulting in a list of chromosome coordinates with any annotation track users are interested in. Even though some of the functionalities such as the retrieval of neighbouring sequences for a set of peaks are available in other software programs, the complete set of tools and the flexibility offered by <italic>ChIPpeakAnno </italic>are not available in any other software. The main differentiating point from <italic>CEAS, CisGenome </italic>and other software is that <italic>ChIPpeakAnno </italic>enables comparison between a set of peaks with any annotation feature objects, for example comparing to CpG islands, to conserved elements (or other annotated features not captured by <italic>CEAS </italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ceas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/submit.htm">http://ceas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/submit.htm</ext-link> or <italic>CisGenome </italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/cisgenome/index.htm">http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/cisgenome/index.htm</ext-link>) (survey results) or comparing two sets of peaks between replicates (personal communication with Ivan Gregoretti at NIH) or transcription factors within a complex (unpublished data). In addition, unlike <italic>ChIPpeakAnno</italic>, <italic>CEAS </italic>or <italic>CisGenome </italic>does not have overlapping significance testing or Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment testing implemented. GO is a system for describing the molecular function, biological process and cellular compartmentalization of gene products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Another main advantage of <italic>ChIPpeakAnno </italic>is the ability/flexibility to plug in with other annotation packages, such as <italic>biomaRt </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and <italic>GO.db</italic>, ChIP-chip analysis packages such as <italic>Ringo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and <italic>ACME </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], other fast moving deep-sequencing analysis capabilities and infrastructure (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) such as <italic>ShortRead </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], <italic>DEGseq </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], edgeR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], <italic>BayesPeak </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], <italic>chipseq, ChIPseqR, Rolexa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], <italic>BSgenome, IRanges, Biostrings, rtracklayer </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], GenomeGraphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and statistical analysis tools such as <italic>multtest and limma </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] in Bioconductor (survey results).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>An overview of Bioconductor packages for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Package</th><th align="left">Classification</th><th align="left">Functionalities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>ShortRead</italic></td><td align="left">Input/Output<break/>QA<break/>Filtering</td><td align="left">Supplies methods for reading, quality assessment (QA) and basic manipulation of high-throughput sequencing data.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Rolexa</italic></td><td align="left">Base Calling<break/>QA</td><td align="left">Supports probabilistic base calling, quality checks and diagnostic plots for Solexa sequencing data.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>IRanges</italic></td><td align="left">Infrastructure<break/>Ranged-based algorithm</td><td align="left">Provides infrastructure for representing and manipulating sets of integer ranges, and implements algorithms for range-based calculations such as intersect, union, disjoint, overlap and coverage.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>BSgenome</italic></td><td align="left">Whole Genome Annotation Data</td><td align="left">Supplies infrastructure for efficiently representing, accessing and analyzing whole genome.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>Biostrings</italic></td><td align="left">String manipulation</td><td align="left">Implements functions for pattern matching, sequence alignment and string manipulation</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>rtracklayer</italic></td><td align="left">Visualization</td><td align="left">Provides an interface between R and genome browsers and implements functions to import, create, export, and display track data by linking R with existing genome browsers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>GenomeGraphs</italic></td><td/><td align="left">Integrates Ensembl annotation obtained using the biomaRt package and the grid graphic package to facilitate visualization, plotting and analysis of a diverse genomic datasets.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>ChIPpeakAnno</italic></td><td align="left">Annotation<break/>Plotting<break/>Overlap test<break/>Enrichment test</td><td align="left">Implements a common annotation workflow for ChIP-seq data such as finding nearest or overlapping features and obtaining enriched GO terms.

Once the package is loaded, one line of code (<italic>annotatePeakInBatch</italic>) enables users to find nearest or overlapping features such as gene, exon, miRNA, 5' utr, 3' utr, peaks from another dataset or any annotation track of interest. Users are also provided with the flexibility and functionality to get the annotation on the fly (<italic>getAnnotation</italic>). Two lines of code (<italic>getEnrichedGO</italic>) allow users to find enriched gene ontology terms. One line of code (<italic>makeVennDiagram</italic>) allows users to draw a Venn diagram and provide a p-value for determining the significance of the overlapping between datasets. Repeated calling of function <italic>findOverlappingPeaks </italic>enables users to find the overlapping among peaks from several different experiments, which will help users to determine how peaks from different replicates overlap and how peaks from different transcription factors within a complex overlap.</p></sec><sec><title>Implementation</title><p><italic>ChIPpeakAnno </italic>implements a common annotation workflow for ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip data in R, a system for statistical computation and graphics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To promote component reuse and compatibility among Bioconductor packages, <italic>ChIPpeakAnno </italic>utilizes the <italic>IRanges </italic>package and represents the peak list as <italic>RangedData </italic>to efficiently find the nearest or overlapping gene, exon, 5' utr, 3' utr, microRNA (miRNA) or other custom feature(s) supplied by the user, such as the most conserved non-coding element, CpG island or transcription factor binding sites. All peak-calling software produces a file containing at least a list of chromosome coordinates that is all <italic>ChIPpeakAnno </italic>package needs. Both BED <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1">http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1</ext-link> and GFF (General Feature Format, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format3">http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format3</ext-link>) are common file formats that provide a flexible way to define peaks or annotations as data lines. Therefore, conversion functions <italic>BED2RangedData </italic>and <italic>GFF2RangedData </italic>were implemented for converting these data formats to a <italic>RangedData </italic>object. Since the genome annotations are updated periodically/frequently, we have leveraged the <italic>biomaRt </italic>package from Bioconductor to enable retrieval of annotation data on the fly from Ensembl. For fast access, transcription start sites from common genomes such as <italic>TSS.human.NCBI36, TSS.human.GRCh37, ExonPlusUtr.human.GRCh37, TSS.mouse.NCBIM37, TSS.rat.RGSC3.4 and TSS.zebrafish.Zv8 </italic>were included as pre-built annotation data packages. Users also have the flexibility to pass annotation data from the <italic>GenomicFeatures </italic>package as well as their own annotation data, such as a list of binding sites from other transcription factors, a different ChIP preparation or a different peak-calling algorithm. We have also utilized the <italic>BSgenome </italic>package to implement functions that allow retrieval of flanking sequences associated with peaks of interest. This facilitates subsequent PCR amplification, cloning and/or motif discovery using algorithms such as MEME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To ascertain whether the identified peaks are enriched around genes with certain GO terms, we have implemented a GO enrichment test. This test applies the hypergeometric test <italic>phyper </italic>in R and integrates with GO annotation from the <italic>GO.db </italic>package, species-specific GO annotation packages such as <italic>org.Hs.eg.db </italic>and multiplicity adjustment functions from the <italic>multtest </italic>package in Bioconductor. GO annotation packages are updated per release that corresponds to twice a year. Binding sites annotated with <italic>ChIPpeakAnno </italic>can be exported as an Excel file to allow easy sorting and statistical analysis of larger lists of peaks. Alternatively, the distribution of peaks relative to genomic features of interest (e.g., transcription start site or exon start site) can be easily plotted for viewing as pie chart or histograms. In addition, we have implemented functionalities using hypergeometric test for determining the significance of overlap between replicate experiments, different peak-calling algorithms or binding sites among transcription factors within a complex, and for drawing Venn diagrams to visualize the extent of the overlap between replicates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Example 1: Finding the nearest gene and the distance to the transcription start site of the nearest gene</title><p>The output from ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip analysis is a list of binding sites (as chromosome locations) that are significantly enriched in the ChIP sample(s) compared with the corresponding control sample(s).
