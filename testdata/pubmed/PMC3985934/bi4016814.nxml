is a well-conserved residue in pyruvate carboxylases and,
on the basis of structures of the enzyme, appears to have a role in
the binding of MgATP, forming an interaction with the 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl
group of the ribose ring. Mutation of this residue to asparagine results
in a 9-fold increase in the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for MgATP
in its steady-state cleavage in the absence of pyruvate and a 3-fold
increase in the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for MgADP in its steady-state
phosphorylation by carbamoyl phosphate. However, from single-turnover
experiments of MgATP cleavage, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of
the enzyme&#x000b7;MgATP complex is essentially the same in the wild-type
enzyme and H216N. Direct stopped-flow measurements of nucleotide binding
and release using the fluorescent analogue FTP support these observations.
However, the first-order rate constant for MgATP cleavage in the single-turnover
experiments in H216N is only 0.75% of that for the wild-type enzyme,
and thus, the MgATP cleavage step is rate-limiting in the steady state
for H216N but not for the wild-type enzyme. Close examination of the
structure of the enzyme suggested that His216 may also interact with
Glu218, which in turn interacts with Glu305 to form a proton relay
system involved in the deprotonation of bicarbonate. Single-turnover
MgATP cleavage experiments with mutations of these two residues resulted
in kinetic parameters similar to those observed in H216N. We suggest
that the primary role of His216 is to coordinate the binding of MgATP
and the deprotonation of bicarbonate in the reaction to form the putative
carboxyphosphate intermediate by participation in a proton relay system
involving Glu218 and Glu305.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi4016814</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2013-016814</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes id="notes-1"><fn-group><fn id="d31e176" fn-type="funding-statement"><p>This work was

carboxylase (PC, EC
6.4.1.1.1) is a member of the family of biotin-dependent metabolic
enzymes and supplies oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis and the replenishment
of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates that have been removed to
synthesize other molecules such as amino acids and fatty acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> In vertebrates and many bacteria, the enzymic activity is tightly

in the other biotin-dependent carboxylases, the initial step in the
reaction catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase involves the ATP-dependent
carboxylation of the biotin prosthetic group in the biotin carboxylase
(BC) domain active site. This reaction is thought to proceed via a
carboxyphosphate intermediate produced by the transfer of a phosphoryl
group from MgATP to bicarbonate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, reaction 1). This intermediate is then thought to decarboxylate
in the BC domain active site to produce carbon dioxide that carboxylates
the biotin (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, reaction 2). The carboxybiotin
thus formed then moves to the carboxyl transferase (CT) domain where
it transfers its carboxy group to pyruvate to form oxaloacetate (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, reaction 3). From the structure of <italic>Rhizobium

not affect the stability
of the quaternary structure of the enzyme. Hence, the effects of the
mutation are due to direct effects on the reactions of the enzyme
and are informative of the role of this residue in those reactions.
His216 obviously has an important role or roles in catalysis as mutation
of this residue reduces the rate of the overall pyruvate carboxylation
reaction by &#x0003e;99%. As might be expected, the main effects of the
mutation
lie in the reactions that occur in the BC domain of the enzyme where
MgATP cleavage and biotin carboxylation occur and not in the CT domain,
where pyruvate carboxylation itself occurs. This is evidenced by the
relatively weak effect of the mutation of His216 to asparagine on
oxamate-stimulated oxaloacetate cleavage that occurs in the CT domain
and the much larger effects on MgATP cleavage and MgADP phosphorylation
that occur in the BC domain.</p><p>Steady-state bicarbonate-dependent
MgATP cleavage is coupled with
biotin carboxylation and primarily rate-limited in the absence of
pyruvate by a combination of the rates of decarboxylation of carboxyphosphate
and carboxybiotin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> The decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for bicarbonate-dependent MgATP cleavage observed
in mutant H216N may be as a result of a change in the rate-limiting
step, perhaps to that of the formation of carboxyphosphate. The increase
in <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> in H216N may be in part due to a
decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for MgATP. From the structure
of the enzyme,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> His216 appears to play
a role in the binding of the nucleotide by interacting with its 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl
group, with N1 of the imidazole ring of His216 positioned 3.0 &#x000c5;
from the 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl oxygen of the bound ATP&#x003b3;S (see Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The strong effect of the His216 mutation on MgADP
phosphorylation in terms of the reduction in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> indicates that His216 has a major role in the formation
of carboxyphosphate and the cleavage of MgATP. This is because carbamoyl
phosphate is an analogue of carboxyphosphate and the MgADP phosphorylation
reaction is analogous to the reverse of reaction 1 in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Reaction scheme showing

intrinsic rate constant of MgATP cleavage and the dissociation constant
of the enzyme&#x000b7;MgATP complex. The results described above clearly
show that the H216N mutation has little effect on the binding of MgATP
to the enzyme, but a very strong effect on the catalytic step in the
reaction compared to that of wild-type <italic>Re</italic>PC. The
lack of an effect of the H216N mutation on nucleotide binding is supported
by the similarity of the kinetics of MgFTP binding and dissociation
between wild-type and H216N <italic>Re</italic>PC. This indicates
that either the interaction between N1 of the imidazole of His216
and the 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl group of MgATP (see Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) provides little in the way of binding stabilization or the
replacement of His216 with asparagine still allows this interaction
to occur in much the same way as with histidine. This lack of an effect
of the H216N mutation on MgATP binding suggests that its effects on
the steady-state bicarbonate-dependent MgATP cleavage reaction are
largely due to the inhibition of the MgATP cleavage step itself. In
fact, the value of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> determined from
the single-turnover experiment is very similar to the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> determined in the steady-state experiments for mutant
H216N. This indicates that in the steady-state reaction, the phosphoryl
transfer step between MgATP and bicarbonate in mutant H216N has become
slow enough to be rate-limiting.</p><p>Similar single-turnover MgATP
cleavage experiments were also performed
with mutants E218Q and E305A. The resulting kinetics are remarkably
similar to those of the H216N mutant, with the mutations having little
effect on MgATP binding but strong inhibitory effects on the phosphoryl
transfer reaction itself. Because neither Glu218 nor Glu305 has direct
contact with bound MgATP in the BC domain active site, the lack of
an effect of mutation of these residues on MgATP binding is not unexpected.
As shown in Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, in the active site of
the BC domain of <italic>Re</italic>PC with MgATP&#x003b3;S bound, His216
is positioned to potentially form hydrogen bonds with both the 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl
group of the nucleotide and the carboxyl group of Glu218, which in
turn could hydrogen bond with that of Glu305. In the BC domain with
no bound nucleotide, His216 moves away from and out of alignment with
Glu218, so that it no longer interacts so strongly with that residue.
This suggests that the binding of the nucleotide correctly positions
His216 to optimally interact with Glu218. The presence or absence
of the acetyl CoA bound to the subunit does not affect the positioning
of these residues, indicating that this is not a locus of activation
of the enzyme by this allosteric activator. In the presence of a bound
nucleotide, N3 of the imidazole ring of His216 is &#x0003e;1 &#x000c5; closer
to Glu218 than the side chain amino group nitrogen of Lys245, which
is closer to the &#x003b3;-thiophosphoryl group of the bound ATP&#x003b3;S
and is indeed important for MgATP binding as shown by Zeczycki et
al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></p><p>If we accept the proposal of
Zeczycki et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> that Glu305 deprotonates
bicarbonate concomitant with the
transfer of a phosphoryl group from MgATP and there is a proton relay
system involving proton transfer from Glu305 to Glu218, how might
His216 fit into this scheme? We can postulate that the binding of
MgATP to the BC domain active site results in the repositioning of
His216 through its interaction with the 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl group (see
Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This places N3 of the imidazole
ring adjacent to the protonated carboxyl group of Glu218. If N3 is
unprotonated, it could extract the proton from Glu218, triggering
the series of proton transfers that ultimately results in the deprotonation
of bicarbonate and the formation of carboxyphosphate. Once biotin
has been carboxylated and leaves the BC domain active site, the proton
relay would be reversed and dissociation of MgADP from the active
site would result in the movement of His216 away from Glu218. The
positioning of residues and proton transfer leading to phosphoryl
transfer are coordinated by the binding of the nucleotide through
its interaction with His216.</p><p>If this proton relay scheme is
correct, the mutation of any of
the three residues involved would be expected to have a similar effect
on the catalysis of MgATP cleavage, which is exactly what was observed
in the single-turnover MgATP cleavage experiments described above.
Adina-Zada et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> measured pH profiles
of bicarbonate-dependent MgATP cleavage catalyzed by a mutant form
of PC from <italic>Bacillus thermodenitrificans</italic> that lacked
biotin and thus decoupled MgATP cleavage from biotin carboxylation.
A residue with a p<italic>K</italic> of 6.6 was observed in the pH
profile for the reaction; this residue needed to be deprotonated for
the reaction to occur and could correspond to His216.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> In the reverse reaction, His216 would need to be protonated
so that the transfer of a proton to carbonate could occur as MgATP
is formed from carboxyphosphate.</p><p>Apart from being well-conserved
among pyruvate carboxylases, residues
equivalent to His216, Glu218, and Glu305 in <italic>Re</italic>PC
are also well-conserved among other biotin-dependent carboxylases,
including acetyl CoA carboxylase, propionyl CoA carboxylase, and methylcrotonyl
CoA carboxylase. This suggests that the proposed mechanism of coordination
of MgATP binding with catalysis and the proton relay mechanism is
also likely to occur in these related enzymes. The biotin carboxylase
subunit of acetyl CoA carboxylase also has an ATP grasp fold,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> as does carbamoyl phosphate synthetase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> which shares some mechanistic similarities with
the biotin-dependent carboxylases. However, sequence alignments show
that in the carbamoyl phosphate synthetases, the residues equivalent
to His216 and Glu305 in <italic>Re</italic>PC are glutamate and serine,
respectively (Glu215 and Ser307, respectively, in the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme). In the structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> carbamoyl
phosphate synthetase, Glu215 interacts with both the 2&#x02032;- and
3&#x02032;-hydroxyls of the bound nucleotide but is not positioned
to interact with Glu217 (the residue equivalent to Glu218 in <italic>Re</italic>PC). Thus, the proposed proton relay mechanism may be
restricted to the biotin-dependent carboxylases.</p><p>In this work,
we have provided evidence that supports the proposal
that three residues in the BC domain active site of <italic>Re</italic>PC form a proton relay system to promote the phosphorylation of bicarbonate.
We have also proposed that the binding of the nucleotide in the BC
domain active site repositions His216 to establish this proton relay
system; thus, His216 coordinates catalysis with substrate binding.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="NOTES-d2186e1617-autogenerated" notes-type="conflict-of-interest"><p>The
