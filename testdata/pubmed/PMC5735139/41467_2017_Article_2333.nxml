They can be blocked, however, by the presence of unrepaired DNA damage on the template strand. This blockage can lead to replication fork collapse, double-strand DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death. Translesion synthesis (TLS) is one pathway for managing unrepaired DNA damage encountered during replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In this process, a specialized TLS polymerase exchanges with a stalled replicative polymerase, extends the nascent DNA strand past the lesion, and then returns the template to the replicative polymerase for the continuation of normal synthesis. TLS polymerases, many of which are members of the Y-family of DNA polymerases, are typically error-prone and slow enzymes; their access to the template must therefore be tightly regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Across all domains of life, misregulation of TLS can have severe consequences. In humans, mutations in the TLS polymerase Pol &#x003b7; give rise to the disorder xeroderma pigmentosum, in which sunlight sensitivity and skin cancer susceptibility are enhanced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Increased expression of TLS polymerases, conversely, is common in a range of different cancer types and is thought to contribute to the mutator phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>; TLS polymerases may therefore represent a therapeutic target in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In the model bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, overproduction of TLS polymerases slows DNA replication and leads to cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and may contribute to the lethality of certain antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">
<italic>E. coli</italic> has five DNA polymerases, three of which are TLS polymerases. Pol IV, a Y-family polymerase and homolog of human Pol &#x003ba;, is the most abundant TLS polymerase in the cell. There are ~200 copies of Pol IV in normally growing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, and Pol IV expression is induced further under conditions of stress. In particular, the SOS DNA damage response upregulates Pol IV levels 10-fold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Pol IV is thought to be specialized for small minor groove lesions. In particular, it bypasses <italic>N</italic>
<sup>2</sup> adducts of guanine (<italic>N</italic>
<sup>2</sup>-dG) of the type formed by the DNA damaging agent nitrofurazone (NFZ) with high efficiency and accuracy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; it also plays a role in bypassing alkyl adducts such as the <italic>N</italic>
<sup>3</sup>-methyladenine (<italic>N</italic>
<sup>3</sup>-mdA) lesions generated by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, the highly mutagenic TLS polymerase Pol V only accumulates late in the SOS response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and is able to bypass more severe forms of DNA damage, including major groove lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">How TLS polymerases gain access to the DNA template remains poorly understand. One model suggests that Pol IV remodels the replisome at a lesion site, exchanging dynamically with a stalled replicative polymerase to carry out TLS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Alternatively, the replisome may skip over leading strand lesions, repriming downstream to continue replication. In this second model, TLS occurs behind the replication fork in a gap-filling reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In either case, however, it is clear that interactions with the sliding clamp processivity factor are essential for TLS in prokaryotes and eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, including TLS by Pol IV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. All five <italic>E. coli</italic> polymerases interact with the &#x003b2;-clamp through conserved clamp-binding motifs (CBMs). Since &#x003b2; is dimeric and therefore has two polymerase-binding sites, it has been proposed to act as a molecular &#x0201c;toolbelt&#x0201d; that binds a replicative polymerase and a TLS polymerase simultaneously in order to facilitate polymerase exchange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">We recently reconstituted TLS in vitro and observed polymerase exchange at the single-molecule level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These experiments demonstrated that &#x003b2; can simultaneously bind Pol IV and Pol III, the <italic>E. coli</italic> replicative polymerase, and that polymerase exchange can occur through conformational dynamics of polymerases on the clamp. In cells, however, there are many other competitors for &#x003b2;-clamp binding. In addition to Pol III and Pol IV, at least 10 other proteins have been shown to bind &#x003b2;, including factors involved in Okazaki fragment maturation, mismatch repair, and cell cycle regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Given the limited number of &#x003b2;-binding sites and the abundance of possible binding partners, Pol IV may not have access to the clamp when the replisome encounters a lesion. It is also not known whether previously identified interactions with other replication-associated and repair-associated proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> play a role in recruiting Pol IV.</p><p id="Par8">To better understand how access of Pol IV to the replisome is regulated in vivo, we have created a strain bearing a new functional fusion of the genomic copy of Pol IV to a photoactivatable fluorescent protein, PAmCherry. By imaging this strain using particle-tracking photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM), we have characterized the localization and dynamics of Pol IV in cells under normal growth conditions and after treatment with DNA damaging agents. We find that Pol IV is localized broadly throughout the cell during normal growth, with only modest &#x003b2;-dependent enrichment at replication forks. In the presence of DNA damage, however, Pol IV is strongly enriched at particular cellular positions. Surprisingly, the nature of the DNA damage has a profound impact on both the cellular localization of Pol IV and the recruitment mechanism. For MMS-treated cells, there is a high degree of Pol IV enrichment, which requires the well-characterized &#x003b2;-clamp interaction. In contrast, this interaction is not required for the majority of Pol IV localizations in NFZ-treated cells, indicating that Pol IV recruitment involves non-clamp interactions under some circumstances. Taken together, our results suggest that Pol IV recruitment is strongly influenced by the type of DNA lesion and that it involves multiple damage-induced interactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Creation of a functional Pol IV-PAmCherry fusion</title><p id="Par9">To study the behavior of individual Pol IV molecules in live <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, we used the &#x003bb; Red recombineering system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to replace the endogenous copy of Pol IV, encoded by the <italic>dinB</italic> gene, with a C-terminal fusion to the photoactivatable fluorescent protein PAmCherry (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Because the C terminus of Pol IV is implicated in clamp-binding interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, we introduced a 20-amino acid flexible Gly-Ser linker between Pol IV and PAmCherry. Cells bearing the Pol IV-PAmCherry fusion in the MG1655 wild-type (WT) strain background grew normally (Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and displayed close to WT levels of resistance to the DNA damaging agent nitrofurazone (NFZ) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>).

Pol IV contains two domains, an N-terminal catalytic domain (residues 1&#x02013;230) and a C-terminal little finger domain (residues 243&#x02013;351), connected by a flexible linker (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The little finger domain of Pol IV makes two separate contacts to &#x003b2;, one to a cleft on the face of one protomer and a second to the clamp rim near the dimer interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Mutation of these two sets of residues (see Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> for strain JEK717) yields a mutant (Pol IV<sup>R,C</sup>) that is deficient for clamp binding. In contrast to the weak enrichment of WT Pol IV (Pol IV<sup>WT</sup>), there was no enrichment of Pol IV<sup>R,C</sup> near SSB foci in undamaged cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

</p><p id="Par19">We next asked whether DNA damage affected the Pol IV binding time, which we determined by measuring the length of static Pol IV trajectories. Trajectories end when a Pol IV-PAmCherry molecule blinks, photobleaches irreversibly, or unbinds. Thus the apparent binding lifetime that we measure reflects both PAmCherry photophysics and the Pol IV binding lifetime. Even with these limitations, comparison of the binding lifetime distributions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) revealed that Pol IV remained bound significantly longer in 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;M NFZ-treated cells than in undamaged cells (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0226a;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>).

The localization of Pol IV along the short cell axis remained peaked at midcell, although its distribution was somewhat narrower. SSB localization, by comparison, was peaked at the 1/3 and 2/3 long-axis positions, with more density at midcell than in undamaged cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), likely reflecting a 16% decrease in mean cell length upon NFZ treatment (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a,b</xref>) and the tendency of SSB to be localized closer to midcell in smaller cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Pol IV was shifted toward the cell pole relative to SSB in NFZ-treated cells. Consistent with the average cellular localization profiles, single-cell colocalization analysis confirmed that Pol IV was not strongly colocalized with SSB foci in NFZ-treated cells. Instead, there was a 13% increase in the average Pol IV-SSB distance (<italic>p&#x02009;</italic>&#x0226a;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) in comparison to undamaged cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), and the radial distribution function <italic>g(r)</italic> revealed no enrichment at short distances (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">The characteristic Pol IV localization pattern was established by 20&#x02009;min after NFZ addition and persisted for at least 2&#x02009;h (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a,b</xref>). The somewhat weaker response at the 20&#x02009;min time point may reflect the fact that NFZ is activated after processing by cellular nitroreductases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and thus it may take some time for DNA damage to accumulate.

</p><p id="Par22">The distinct Pol IV localization pattern observed after NFZ treatment was found across the whole population of cells, not just in a small fraction of potentially non-viable cells. Comparison of the cellular localization of Pol IV in two populations sorted by the number of static tracks per cell shows that the Pol IV localization pattern was qualitatively the same for cells in the top 25% and the bottom 75% of the population (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). We observed a similar Pol IV localization pattern in the isogenic <italic>lexA</italic>

To confirm that the Pol IV localization was not due to fluorescent protein oligomerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, we tested a Pol IV fusion to a different photoactivatable fluorescent protein, mMaple3, which was found to have undetectable levels of dimerization in a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Although this fusion appeared to be less functional than the corresponding PAmCherry fusion (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>), the cellular localization was very similar in both undamaged and NFZ-treated cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11a</xref>). Furthermore, we saw substantially fewer static localizations in a strain where the <italic>dinB</italic> gene was replaced with PAmCherry (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a,b</xref>), indicating that the effects we observe are Pol IV dependent.</p><p id="Par23">Next, we investigated whether other polymerases were recruited to a similar cellular position upon NFZ treatment by imaging strains bearing PAmCherry fusions to either Pol I or the &#x003b5; exonuclease subunit of the replicative polymerase Pol III under the same conditions.

These results are consistent with a previous finding that the localization of Pol I did not change significantly upon treatment with MMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found that &#x003b5;-PAmCherry was recruited to a similar cellular position as Pol IV in NFZ-treated cells, although less strongly (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11b</xref>), raising the possibility that these areas contain DNA replication intermediates.</p><p id="Par24">To determine how the replisome was affected by NFZ treatment, we analyzed the response of several replisome markers.

Therefore, the change in Pol IV localization is not due to dramatic reorganization of the nucleoid. Comparison of the nucleoid profile to the cellular localization of Pol IV-PAmCherry in NFZ-treated cells revealed that Pol IV was localized toward the periphery of the nucleoid (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>MMS treatment alters the localization of static Pol IV</title><p id="Par26">Next we attempted to determine whether the observed Pol IV recruitment was a general phenomenon in damaged cells or specific to NFZ treatment.

In MMS-treated cells, Pol IV localized to the midcell position along the long axis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), in contrast to its localization upon NFZ treatment. The localization pattern of SSB foci was sharply peaked at midcell (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>), which may in part reflect the 25% reduction in cell length for MMS-treated cells (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a,b</xref> and Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>), and more strongly overlapped with that of Pol IV.

As the SSB foci are larger than diffraction-limited PSFs, this 115&#x02009;nm offset is well within the average focus width, indicating colocalization of Pol IV and SSB. The dip at Pol IV-SSB separation distances close to zero reflects a number of factors, including the localization error for PAmCherry and mYPet (Methods section), and the measured separation cannot therefore be interpreted as the actual distance of Pol IV from the center of replication forks. Strikingly, radial distribution analysis revealed a strong increase in Pol IV enrichment near SSB foci, with a 6-fold higher maximum <italic>g(r)</italic> value relative to undamaged cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).</p><p id="Par27">The Pol IV localization pattern was stable for at least 1&#x02009;h after exposure to MMS (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8c</xref>), with an additional modest increase in <italic>g(r)</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9b</xref>).

Likewise, the characteristic localization pattern in NFZ-treated cells was equivalent to that of the WT protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), indicating that the observed Pol IV recruitment was independent of &#x003b2;. To determine what domains and what other interactions might be responsible for Pol IV recruitment in NFZ-treated cells, we constructed strains with the truncated N-terminal catalytic domain (Pol IV<sup>CD</sup>) or the C-terminal little finger domain (Pol IV<sup>LF</sup>) fused to PAmCherry (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>, and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).

The Pol IV<sup>LF</sup> fusion, however, appeared to be completely cleaved and failed to localize in cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a,c</xref>). The Pol IV<sup>CD</sup> mutant behaved similarly to Pol IV<sup>WT</sup> in NFZ-treated cells, although, as for the Pol IV<sup>R,C</sup> mutant, there were fewer localizations in undamaged cells. Given that the Pol IV catalytic domain was sufficient for localization, we tested whether Pol IV catalytic activity was also required by imaging the Pol IV-D103N mutant. The binding and localization of Pol IV-D103N was very similar to that of Pol IV<sup>WT</sup> in both undamaged and NFZ-treated cells, indicating that the Pol IV recruitment which we observe does not require catalytic activity.

For that reason, we chose to look for possible Pol IV&#x02013;RecA interactions by determining the cellular localization of RecA rather than deleting it. We introduced a previously characterized RecA-GFP fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> into the &#x00394;<italic>lexA</italic> strain background and looked at its behavior in undamaged and damaged cells. In agreement with the initial report, RecA forms foci even in undamaged cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17a</xref>), and these foci are primarily localized toward the cell poles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) in a similar position to that of Pol IV in NFZ-treated cells. Upon NFZ treatment, we found that the RecA localization pattern remained largely unchanged (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), and there was a 36% decrease in the number of RecA foci per cell, from a mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;s.e.m. of 1.38&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.06 foci in undamaged cells to 0.92&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.05 foci in NFZ-treated cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17b</xref>; <italic>p&#x02009;</italic>&#x0226a;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). In MMS-treated cells, however, there was a marked change in the cellular localization of RecA.

Consistent with studies of other DNA and RNA polymerases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, we observed two populations of Pol IV in cells, one diffusing and one statically bound. Selective imaging of static molecules revealed that Pol IV binds widely throughout the cell under normal growth conditions. A previous study, using a Pol IV-EYFP construct overexpressed from a plasmid, did not observe Pol IV binding in undamaged cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>; unlike PALM, however, this imaging technique is not sensitive to short binding events of single molecules. Importantly, we did not observe strong Pol IV localization in the vicinity of replication forks marked by SSB-mYPet. Instead, radial distribution function analysis revealed weak enrichment of Pol IV near SSB foci; this enrichment was dependent on interactions with the &#x003b2;-clamp. Given that there is a steady-state level of ~50 clamps near the fork during replication in <italic>E. coli</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, our results suggest that, in the absence of DNA damage, the average occupancy of Pol IV on these &#x003b2;-clamps is relatively low. This finding is consistent with the model that the access of Pol IV to the DNA template is tightly controlled under normal growth conditions in order to minimize mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">A prior study reported the formation of multi-copy Pol IV foci in response to treatment with the DNA damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) or double-strand break induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In this work, we found that DNA damage by NFZ or MMS led to strong Pol IV enrichment at particular cellular positions, with the nature of the enrichment dependent on the type of damage. In MMS-treated cells, we observed strong Pol IV recruitment to replication forks marked by SSB foci, whereas Pol IV binding was not enriched near SSB foci in NFZ-treated cells, except modestly at an early timepoint after NFZ exposure. Corresponding to these differences in the pattern of Pol IV enrichment, we found differences in the Pol IV recruitment mechanism in NFZ-treated and MMS-treated cells. In MMS-treated cells, localization of a &#x003b2;-binding-deficient Pol IV mutant was attenuated, with a reduction in Pol IV-SSB colocalization and in the number of Pol IV-binding events, indicating that interactions with the clamp were necessary for the observed recruitment under those conditions. Surprisingly, we found that clamp-binding was not required for Pol IV recruitment in NFZ-treated cells, nor was Pol IV catalytic activity. Instead, the Pol IV N-terminal catalytic domain was sufficient for recruitment. We note that localization alone is not sufficient for TLS; the Pol IV<sup>R,C</sup>, Pol IV-D103N, and Pol IV<sup>CD</sup> mutants that localize in NFZ-treated cells are nonetheless deficient for TLS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">Why might there be differences in the response of Pol IV to DNA damage caused by NFZ and MMS? One key distinction between the two compounds is their differential induction of the SOS response, which is suggestive of different effects on replication. At drug concentrations to which &#x00394;<italic>dinB</italic> cells are sensitized, MMS was found to induce the SOS response more strongly than NFZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Because SOS induction is triggered by persistent ssDNA tracts, this result implies that MMS lesions block replication more potently. Characterization of YPet-&#x003b2; foci before and after MMS treatment revealed a 61% increase in the average number of clamps at the fork; these additional clamps may be left behind at lesion sites after the replisome has stalled. It is unlikely that the relatively modest increase in the &#x003b2; copy number after MMS treatment is enough to explain the observed recruitment if mass action is the only determinant; instead, these results suggest that the access of Pol IV to the clamp is regulated in response to DNA damage, perhaps through conformational dynamics of Pol III<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> or activation by RecA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In contrast to the increased Pol IV binding lifetime in NFZ-treated cells, the slight decrease in lifetime upon MMS treatment shows either that many of the localizations that we observe represent transient clamp-binding without TLS or that Pol IV does not carry out extensive synthesis under these conditions. Consistent with this picture, we find only a modest increase in the binding lifetime of the Pol IV-D103N mutant. Previous work proposed that Pol IV-D103N becomes &#x0201c;locked&#x0201d; at a DNA lesion, unable to complete the catalytic cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. If most of the &#x003b2;-dependent binding events in MMS-treated cells represented active synthesis, we would expect a larger increase in the Pol IV-D103N binding lifetime.</p><p id="Par35">We also explored the role of non-clamp interactions in Pol IV recruitment in MMS-treated cells. In particular, we focused on UmuD and RecA based on reports that these three proteins form a ternary complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We found that MMS treatment led to the cellular reorganization of RecA, with RecA foci moving to the same midcell position as Pol IV and SSB, in agreement with a previous study that observed colocalization of Pol IV and RecA upon the induction of DNA damage with different agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. This result is consistent with the generation of persistent ssDNA tracts near the replication fork by MMS damage. There was no change in Pol IV localization in a &#x00394;<italic>umuDC</italic> strain, however. Deletion of Pol V does not affect cell survival in the presence of MMS but it does reduce the frequency of MMS-induced mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, indicating that Pol V carries out some DNA synthesis under these conditions. Our results suggest that, although Pol V gains access to the template in MMS-treated cells, it does not compete directly with Pol IV for binding sites and that TLS by the two polymerases typically occurs in different cellular contexts. They also reveal that interactions with UmuD do not play a role in Pol IV recruitment in response to DNA damage by MMS. We note that the residual Pol IV-SSB colocalization seem for the Pol IV<sup>R,C</sup> mutant likely arises from interactions with other factors, possibly SSB or RecA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par36">What other interactions might be responsible for Pol IV recruitment in NFZ-treated cells if interactions with &#x003b2; are not required? One possible interacting partner is SSB, which was shown to bind Pol IV in a previous biochemical study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, we did not see increased Pol IV-SSB colocalization in NFZ-treated cells, except possibly at an early stage of the response, arguing that SSB is unlikely to be responsible for Pol IV recruitment under these conditions. The presence of the &#x003b5; subunit of Pol III in a similar cellular position in NFZ-treated cells suggests that these may be replication intermediates, although the lack of SSB enrichment indicates that they are unlikely to represent normal replication forks. Other putative Pol IV binding partners are UmuD and RecA. As in MMS-treated cells, there was no change in Pol IV localization in a &#x00394;<italic>umuDC</italic> strain after treatment with NFZ, indicating that UmuD is not involved in Pol IV recruitment under these conditions. We found that RecA localized to the same cellular position as Pol IV in NFZ-treated cells, suggesting a possible interaction. RecA also localized to the same position in undamaged cells, however, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the average number of RecA foci per cell after NFZ treatment. Therefore, if RecA is responsible for recruiting Pol IV in NFZ-treated cells, it is not clear how it does so in a damage-dependent manner.</p><p id="Par37">In the case of NFZ, our results demonstrate that &#x003b2;-independent interactions, whether with RecA or with other factors, play a role in the response of Pol IV to DNA damage. Future studies will be needed to better elucidate which non-clamp interactions are responsible for Pol IV recruitment and to determine if they stimulate TLS in cells. Radial distribution function analysis shows that Pol IV is not strongly enriched at replication forks at any point during the response to NFZ damage, in contrast to the large and stable enrichment seen in MMS-treated cells. This result suggests that TLS is carried out rapidly by single copies of Pol IV at the replication fork upon NFZ treatment, consistent with recent in vitro experiments which have demonstrated that Pol IV can exchange with Pol III and carry out rapid bypass of <italic>N</italic>
<sup>2</sup>-dG DNA adducts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In this case, the Pol IV recruitment that we observe might represent molecules involved in a different pathway that leads to greater Pol IV enrichment or occurs on a slower timescale, which would explain the longer Pol IV binding lifetime in NFZ-treated cells. In addition to its role in replication-coupled TLS, Pol IV has also been implicated in error-prone recombination through extension of D-loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, even in the absence of &#x003b2;, and transcription-coupled TLS through interactions with the transcription elongation factor NusA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par38">This study points to an unexpected degree of complexity in the mechanism of TLS polymerase recruitment in bacteria, which we show is dependent on the type of DNA damage.

PAmCherry was activated with a 405&#x02009;nm laser (Coherent OBIS, 100&#x02009;mW) and imaged with a 561&#x02009;nm laser (Coherent Sapphire, 200&#x02009;mW). The laser powers were adjusted individually using neutral density filters. The 405&#x02009;nm, 514&#x02009;nm, and 561&#x02009;nm laser beams were expanded with a telescope, passed through excitation filters (Chroma ZET405/20X, ZET514/10X, and ZET561/10X respectively), and combined with dichroic filters (Chroma ZT405rdc, Chroma ZT514rdc, and a mirror, respectively), then expanded further by a second telescope. The beams were focused to the back focal plane (BFP) of a Nikon CFI Apo 100&#x000d7;/1.49 NA TIRF objective with a 400&#x02009;mm focal length lens. The lens was translated using a micrometer to move the focused beam away from the center of the objective BFP in order to obtain highly inclined thin illumination, or near-TIRF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> RecA-GFP and HU-YFP were imaged using a single-band TIRF filter cube (Chroma TRF49905, containing a ZT514rdc dichroic filter, a ET545/40&#x02009;m emission filter, and a ET525lp longpass filter). Imaging of Pol IV-PAmCherry, &#x003b5;-PAmCherry, SSB-mYPet, and &#x003b5;-mYPet, either individually or in dual-color colocalization experiments, was performed using a custom dual-band TIRF filter cube (Chroma 91032 Laser TIRF Cube, containing a ZT405/514/561rpc dichroic filter, ZET442/514/561m emission filter, and ET525lp longpass filter).

Computer controlled shutters (Uniblitz VS14) and a filter wheel (Thorlabs FW103H) were used to automate excitation sequences for different types of imaging experiments and to ensure reproducibility. For all movies, brightfield images of cells were recorded using white light transillumination.</p><p id="Par50">Short exposure single-color PALM imaging was performed using an integration time of 13.3&#x02009;ms (~71&#x02009;Hz, accounting for the camera readout time) with an initial pre-bleaching period of 400 frames of ~120&#x02009;W/cm<sup>2</sup> 561&#x02009;nm excitation. After this pre-bleaching period, continuous 405&#x02009;nm and 561&#x02009;nm excitation was used to activate and image PAmCherry with the same 561&#x02009;nm power. The 405&#x02009;nm laser power was set so that on average no more than one PAmCherry molecule was activated per cell at any time. Because the activation rate drops as PAmCherry molecules are irreversibly photobleached, the 405&#x02009;nm power was increased in two steps at fixed time points during the movie (starting at ~15&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> power and increasing to ~ 105&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> power).</p><p id="Par51">Long exposure two-color PALM imaging was performed using an integration time of 250 ms (~4&#x02009;Hz). An initial pre-bleaching period of 50 frames was performed using ~120&#x02009;W/cm<sup>2</sup> 561&#x02009;nm excitation, after which the 561&#x02009;nm laser power was lowered 10-fold to ~12.5&#x02009;W/cm<sup>2</sup> and 10 additional frames were recorded. Next 10 frames of 514&#x02009;nm excitation at ~0.4&#x02009;W/cm<sup>2</sup> (for SSB-mYPet and MukB-mYPet), ~1.4&#x02009;W/cm<sup>2</sup> (for &#x003b5;-mYPet), or ~0.2&#x02009;W/cm<sup>2</sup> (for YPet-&#x003b2;) power were recorded to image YFP variant fusion proteins. Finally, continuous 405&#x02009;nm and 561&#x02009;nm activation was used to activate and image PAmCherry. The 405&#x02009;nm power was increased in two steps at fixed time points during the movie (starting at ~2.5&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> power and increasing to ~17.5&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> power). ParC-PAmCherry imaging used the same 405&#x02009;nm activation power as for Pol IV. &#x003b5;-PAmCherry and Pol I-PAmCherry imaging used a lower initial 405&#x02009;nm activation power of ~1.4&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and HU-PAmCherry imaging used ~0.06&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="Par52">RecA-GFP imaging was performed using an integration time of 250 ms (~4&#x02009;Hz) with continuous 514&#x02009;nm excitation at ~60&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> power.

Cell outlines were obtained from brightfield images using MicrobeTracker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Cells were excluded from analysis if they contained a bright spot that did not bleach during the 561&#x02009;nm pre-bleaching period or if they had an unusually high fluorescence background. Crosstalk between the mYPet and PAmCherry channels under our imaging conditions was only observed for a small fraction of cells treated with 100&#x02009;mM MMS for 1&#x02009;h. In that case, cells that contained a track starting in the first frame of the PALM movie were excluded from analysis, since activation of PAmCherry in the first frame of 405&#x02009;nm excitation was rare and these tracks appeared largely to be due to crosstalk. A very small number of cells, fewer than 1% of the total, were removed manually due to severe crosstalk that was not detected by the automated procedure. In total, ~7% of cells were removed. Dividing cells were split if a septum was visible in the brightfield image and if there was a dip in the fluorescence background intensity corresponding to the position of the septum.</p><p id="Par55">PAmCherry and mYPet fusion proteins were detected, fit to symmetrical 2D Gaussian point spread functions (PSFs), and tracked using the MATLAB-based package u-track<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. A custom script was used to generate regions of interest (ROIs) based on the cell outlines generated by MicrobeTracker. u-track analysis was then performed separately for each ROI. The point source detection algorithm was used for spot detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. The free parameters for PSF fitting were <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> centroid, amplitude, width (&#x003c3;), and background offset. For tracking, the nearest neighbor distance was not used to expand the search radius.

Gaps of one frame in length were permitted in tracks to account for PAmCherry blinking or missed localizations, but tracks were required to be at least two frames in length. A multiplier factor of 5 was used for the Brownian search radius.</p><p id="Par57">For long exposure two-color PALM movies, a more stringent significance threshold of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> was used. Gaps were not allowed in tracks, and tracks of one frame in length were permitted. The Brownian search radius upper bound was set to three pixels. Tracks were further filtered on the basis of the mean track PSF width in order to identify statically bound molecules. Mobile molecules have a broader PSF than static molecules due to motion blurring, as shown previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. A mean track PSF width was calculated as the average of the individual PSF widths of each single-frame localization in the track. Static tracks were identified as those with a mean track PSF within two standard deviations of the mean value in fixed cells. The distribution of mean track PSF width in fixed cells is shown in Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>.

<italic>Cell rotation and normalization:</italic> cell outlines were rotated and normalized so that cellular coordinates range from 0 to 1 along the long (<italic>x</italic>) axis and short (<italic>y</italic>) axis.

Next the rotation angle was defined as the angle formed by the line between the two cell poles and the <italic>x</italic> axis. The subtracted cell mesh was rotated by this angle to align the cell poles with the <italic>x</italic> axis. The rotated cell mesh was divided by the cell length and then the minimum <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> coordinates were set to 0. Following this normalization, the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> cell coordinates range from 0 to 1.

<italic>Cellular localization analysis:</italic> cellular localization distributions in long exposure PALM imaging were generated by taking the centroid of foci or the mean trajectory x and y positions. This approach weights all trajectories equally regardless of track length.</p><p id="Par64">
<italic>Cell length filtering:</italic> where indicated, cellular localization distributions and HU-EYFP intensity profiles were filtered using a cell length threshold of 3.2&#x02009;&#x000b5;m to differentiate small and large cells. This cell length threshold was determined by analyzing the cell length distributions for cells with one or two nucleoid lobes in the HU-EYFP intensity profiles.

<italic>Colocalization analysis:</italic> single-cell Pol IV-SSB colocalization analysis was performed by taking the distance between each localization in a static Pol IV-PAmCherry track and the nearest SSB-mYPet focus in the cell. Then a mean distance was calculated for each Pol IV track by averaging the single-frame localization distances. Colocalization was also characterized using radial distribution analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The radial distribution function <italic>g(r)</italic> expresses the increased likelihood of Pol IV localization at a distance <italic>r</italic> from a SSB focus relative to random cellular localization. It accounts for the geometry of the cell and differences in cell size between different strains and treatment conditions. To calculate <italic>g(r)</italic>, the mean Pol IV-SSB distances were determined for each cell as described above. Then an equivalent number of random localizations were generated within the cell outline and the distance to the nearest SSB focus was calculated for each random localization. This procedure was repeated for each cell. Histograms were generated for the measured and random distance distributions and the measured histogram was divided by the random histogram to give <italic>g(r)</italic>. A <italic>g(r)</italic> value of 1 indicates no enrichment relative to a random distribution. To account for variability in the simulated random localization distributions, we repeated this analysis for 100 random distributions and took the mean of the resulting 100&#x02009;<italic>g(r)</italic> curves. For each data set, an independent random distribution was generated in the same fashion and normalized by the 100 random distributions. These 100 random <italic>g(r)</italic> curves were averaged to give a mean random <italic>g(r)</italic> function. Deviations of the random <italic>g(r)</italic> curve from 1 reveal variability due to the finite sample size.
