It is a major concern for public health issues across Asia-Pacific region. The most effective way to control the disease caused by EV-71 is by vaccination thus a novel vaccine is urgently needed. Inactivated EV-71 induces a strong, virus-neutralizing antibody response in animal models, protecting them against a lethal EV-71 challenge and it has been shown to elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies in human trials. Hence, the large-scale production of purified EV-71 is required for vaccine development, diagnosis and clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>CIM<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Monolith columns are single-piece columns made up of poly(glycidyl methacrylate <italic>co</italic>-ethylene dimethacrylate) as support matrix.

As monolithic columns have a high binding capacity, flow rate and resolution, a CIM<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> DEAE-8f tube monolithic column was selected for purification in this study. The EV-71 infected Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell supernatant was concentrated using 8% PEG 8000 in the presence of 400&#x000a0;mM sodium chloride.

Since then it has become a major public health issue across Asia-Pacific region causing Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in infants and children under the age of five [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is an important neurotropic virus in Asia for which no effective vaccine is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The most effective way to control the disease caused by EV-71 is by vaccination and thus arises the need for the development of new vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As inactivated polio vaccine elicits long term protection against the virus, this strategy might be efficacious for chemically inactivated EV-71 as a vaccine candidate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In recent years, several researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have shown that inactivated EV-71 (heat or formalin inactivation) induces a strong, viral-neutralizing antibody response in animal models, thus protecting them against a lethal EV-71 challenge.</p><p>Viruses possess various distinct characteristics some of which are: the number and distribution of positive or negative charges, distribution of aliphatic and aromatic hydrophobic residues and finally, their size. These virus characteristics can be utilized to fractionate them from other molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The initial step in any purification process is to concentrate the molecules of interest. Precipitation by polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a widely employed method to concentrate larger proteins during the initial step of the purification process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. PEG, even at higher concentrations, does not interact with proteins or denature them and there is no need to remove it from the sample. PEG, due to its non-ionic nature, does not bind to ion-exchange columns and is therefore removed in the flow-through [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Magar and Lecomte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] compared the use of ultrafiltration (UF) and PEG for the concentration of Bovine Diarrheal virus, where they found PEG to be superior to UF as it retains almost 100% infectivity with lower protein content. The combination of PEG precipitation and monolithic chromatography was also used for the purification of mycobacteriophage D29 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Ion-exchange chromatography is widely used as an initial chromatographic procedure in which 80% of the impurities are removed and is usually followed by a polishing step. The disadvantages of bead-based media is their smaller pore size distribution (60&#x02013;100&#x000a0;nm), where many viral particles cannot enter the matrix. This in turn affects the total binding capacity of the column. Monoliths are ready to use columns, made from porous materials, with interconnected channels forming rigid chromatographic support. They provide large adsorbing surfaces, leading to increased binding capacities while higher flow rates are achieved through the movement of particles by convective flow. These monolithic columns have the additional advantage of short separation time and flow-independent separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, the biological activity of viruses is retained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus, the use of methacrylate based monoliths for protein purification appears to be a better alternative to conventional gradient centrifugation techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Chromatographic columns used for the purification of viruses should be sanitized immediately to prevent cross-contamination of products or transmission of viruses. Sodium hydroxide is widely used for regeneration and sanitation of chromatographic columns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus monolithic columns are stable at high alkali conditions making them useful for sanitation by sodium hydroxide. A study on the chemical and chromatographic stability of methacrylate-based monoliths (QA and DEAE) in the presence of sodium hydroxide and ethanol found that the degradation of DEAE groups is relatively small compared to QA groups even after 50&#x000a0;cycles of CIP procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Because of their superior mass transfer and open porous structure, the monolith columns are able to provide very fast biospecific pair formation involving viruses that reduce the risk of product degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The need for the production of large quantities of purified EV-71 to be used as vaccine candidates and for clinical trials drove us to find an alternative way for the purification of EV-71 with high yield and faster processing time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sample preparation and concentration of virus</title><p>One litre of cell culture supernatant containing EV-71 virus collected from T175 cm<sup>2</sup> tissue culture flasks was used for purification.

After a quick diagnosis of the strain type, large amounts of vaccine should be produced for use in prophylactic measures. The particular use of inactivated EV-71 particles as a potent vaccine requires high quantities of the virus to be produced, inactivated and purified as rapidly as possible. A literature survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] showed that EV-71 is preferably purified by conventional techniques such as ultracentrifugation or precipitation followed by sucrose gradient/caesium chloride centrifugation or size-exclusion chromatography, which are laborious and time consuming processes.</p><p>A serum-free cell-based EV-71 vaccine candidate was proposed by Chou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], in which a combination of sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation and/or gel-filtration liquid chromatography purifications was studied. They employed a pilot liquid chromatography system using Sepharose Fast Flow 6 gel. Even though the procedure yielded infectious viral particles of high purity, the overall yield was only 7&#x02013;10% as determined by a VP2-based quantitative ELISA. They further demonstrated that the purified, formalin-inactivated vaccine candidate was stable and could induce strong virus-neutralizing antibody responses in mice, rats, rabbits, and non-human primates. Production of bulk EV-71 vaccines in roller bottles/bioreactor using a serum-free media and its purification by Sepharose Fast Flow 6 gel was reported by Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] where the average recovery was about 50%, as is the case with our results with a slight (5%) increase in recovery. A 50% recovery of EV-71 during the purification by gel-filtration chromatography was also reported by Chang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] but they suggested that the chromatographic process needs to be improved due to the inconsistent results obtained.</p><p>Thus, for the bulk production of different strains of EV-71 as vaccine candidates, a number of factors should be considered. This includes the formulation of a growth medium that supports the production of a high virus titre combined with minimal downstream steps, two factors that are critical for economic viability. During infection of RD cells, we used serum-free DMEM to minimize binding of serum proteins during the purification process.</p><p>Ion-exchange columns are extensively used in downstream applications due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Anion exchange columns are widely used as the first step in the purification of viruses and viral vectors because of their enhanced binding of viruses instead of contaminating proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This might be the reason that the majority of the contaminating proteins are easily eluted in lower salt concentrations in the earlier steps of purification.</p><p>Monoliths are highly interconnected porous structures, made up of different chemistries, currently being used for purification of large biomolecules such as viruses and bacteriophages. They are considered advantageous over other columns as they have properties unaffected by flow, shorter separation times and a high binding capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, the purification protocol is simple and the total time taken can be shortened from several days to a few hours without compromising purity. The method developed from a disk/tube monolithic column can be easily scaled-up to litres for bulk purification of biomolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Recently, CIM DEAE monolithic columns have been used for the purification of many viruses and bacteriophages including Tomato mosaic virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], filamentous potato virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], Pseudomonas phage LUZ19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], Rubella virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], Staphylococcus phage ISP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], viral vectors such as Canine Adenoviral Vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and Lentiviral Vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Presence of three bands (VP1, VP2 and VP3) suggested of viral particles and similar results were presented by Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] during the production and purification of EV-71 viral particles in a serum free bioreactor system. Western blotting with anti-VP2 monoclonal antibody showed two bands (VP0 and VP2), as reported by Liu et al. using the commercial monoclonal antibody mAb 979 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our method of purification yielded some empty particles when analysed by TEM (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The antigenicity of the empty particles may be different from native virus but they only represent a minority of the particles. Hence their presence is unlikely to have a major effect on the overall vaccine efficacy of the purified virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our present work demonstrated, for the first time, the purification of EV-71 particles by monolithic weak anion exchange (DEAE) chromatography where the recovery was around 55% with a 100-fold increase in virus titre and 95% purity. Further improvements in the process of EV-71 purification can be made by employing monolithic columns of different chemistries along with different buffers of varying pH. This ensures the determination of best column and buffer combination for the highest possible recovery of virus particles. Moreover, the host cell protein and DNA content of the harvest, intermediary and final product should be assessed, which is a prerequisite for use as a vaccine candidate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Growth and harvesting of virus</title><p>EV-71 B2 strain (7423/MS/87, GenBank # U22522.1) was used for the purification process.

The monolithic column was washed and equilibrated in the following order: Deionized water &#x02013; 1&#x000a0;M NaOH &#x02013; deionized water &#x02013; elution buffer (50&#x000a0;mM HEPES&#x02009;+&#x02009;1&#x000a0;M NaCl, p<sup>H</sup>&#x000a0;8) &#x02013; binding buffer (50&#x000a0;mM HEPES, p<sup>H</sup>&#x000a0;8).</p><p>Prior to purification, 1 volume of the PEG concentrated sample was diluted with 4 volumes of binding buffer. To determine the salt concentration required to elute the virus particles, 2&#x000a0;mL of the sample was injected in to the column at a flow rate of 1.6&#x000a0;mL/min and a linear gradient elution was performed at a flow rate of 5&#x000a0;mL/min, using elution buffer. Once the appropriate salt concentration was determined, subsequent purifications were done in a step gradient mode. Briefly, 40&#x000a0;mL of the sample was loaded to the column at a flow rate of 1.6&#x000a0;mL/min. Unbound sample was washed by passing 5 CV of binding buffer. The sample was then eluted using different concentration of elution buffer as follows: 20% (200&#x000a0;mM NaCl), 35% (350&#x000a0;mM NaCl) and 100% (1&#x000a0;M NaCl) at a flow rate of 5&#x000a0;mL/min for 6.25 CV (50&#x000a0;mL) each. The virus sample, eluted in the second step (350&#x000a0;mM NaCl), as 5&#x000a0;mL fractions was pooled, concentrated and buffer exchanged with NTE buffer using Vivaspin 20, MWCO 100&#x000a0;kDa (Sartorius AG, Germany). The purified samples were stored at -80&#x000b0;C as 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L aliquots.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of TCID<sub>50</sub> by immunofluorescence assay</title><p>To determine the tissue culture infective dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) of the purified and unpurified samples, a 50% end-point dilution assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] was performed on Vero cells. Briefly, 96-well micro titre plates were seeded with Vero African green monkey kidney cells and infected with the different dilutions (10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup>) of the unpurified and purified virus samples for approximately 48&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000b0;C. From the onset of cytopathic effect (CPE), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH&#x000a0;7.4) for 20&#x000a0;min at room temperature. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS for 5&#x000a0;min, followed by blocking in 5% milk (Skim milk powder&#x02009;+&#x02009;PBST) for 1&#x000a0;h. The cells were then washed with PBST and incubated with monoclonal antibody mAb 51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] specific to VP1 of EV-71 for 1&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000b0;C. After washing, FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse (Dako, Denmark) secondary antibody was added and incubated for 1&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000b0;C. Cells were washed with PBST twice for 5&#x000a0;min in between the steps. Results were documented with an inverted microscope (Olympus) with Nikon ACT-1 software.</p></sec><sec><title>SDS-PAGE and Western blotting</title><p>10% acrylamide gels were run at 100 volts for 100&#x000a0;minutes to resolve the purified samples along with a protein molecular weight marker (Bio-Rad, USA) and used for coomasive brilliant blue R-250 staining. Resolved proteins in SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and non-specific sites were blocked with 5% milk. In-house monoclonal antibodies against VP1 (mAb 51) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], VP2 (mAb 7C7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and polyclonal antibody against VP3 (raised against rVP3 from <italic>E.coli</italic>) were used as primary antibodies. Goat anti-mouse antibody (in 5% skim milk), conjugated with HRP, was used as secondary antibody. Detection was done using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Plus western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>Copper grids were allowed to stand on the purified virus sample for 5&#x000a0;minutes, after which the excess sample on the grid was removed by blotting. Negative staining was performed by placing the sample coated grids on 2% phospho tungstic acid (Sigma) for 2&#x000a0;minutes, blotted, air dried and viewed by JEM-1230 (Jeol) transmission electron microscope.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CIM: Convective interaction media; CV: Column volume; DEAE: Diethylaminoethyl cellulose; EV-71: Enterovirus 71; HEPES: 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic acid; HFMD: Hand, foot and mouth disease; mAb: Monoclonal antibody; mM: Millimolar; NaCl: Sodium chloride; PEG: Polyethylene glycol; VP: Viral protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ARKV carried out the experiments and wrote the manuscript.
