The volume of multi-dimensional images generated in such experiments and the computation time required to detect, associate, and track cells and subcellular features pose considerable challenges, especially for high-throughput experiments. Therefore, there is a need for a versatile, computationally efficient image analysis tool capable of extracting the desired relationships from images in a meaningful and unbiased way. Here we present MicrobeJ, a plug-in for the open-source platform ImageJ. MicrobeJ provides a comprehensive framework to process images derived from a wide variety of microscopy experiments with special emphasis on large image sets. It performs the most common intensity and morphology measurements as well as customized detection of poles, septa, fluorescent foci, and organelles, determines their sub-cellular localization with sub-pixel resolution, and tracks them over time. Because a dynamic link is maintained between the images, measurements, and all data representations derived from them, the editor and suite of advanced data presentation tools facilitates the image analysis process and provides a robust way to verify the accuracy and veracity of the data.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">The bottleneck in the ability to perform automated, quantitative analysis of cell shape, behavior, and fluorescence patterns of high throughput experiments is that analysis tools for extracting unbiased data efficiently from these image sets have lagged behind the technology used to collect them. This is especially true for bacterial cells, which pose additional challenges due to their size, and the ability to distinguish them from background particles due to their low contrast and irregular morphologies. In addition, bacterial cells often have external features, such as flagella, adhesive organelles, and pili that are difficult to readily detect, measure and associate with cells. In order to accomplish these tasks, and obtain information about cellular features such as poles, external organelles, sub-cellular localization patterns (mid-cell or polar), track these features over time, and relate the features to each other in meaningful ways, biologists either need to use specifically tailored analysis tools, be user savvy at applying individual algorithms, or have programming skills to extract data from images.</p><p id="P4">Currently, the available software tools for image analysis of bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) offer analysis methods that typically address some, but not all of these needs, and perform best within their specialized application areas <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. The vast majority of these tools fall into MATLAB or ImageJ based solutions. Many microbiologists are familiar with the MATLAB-based program MicrobeTracker<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, which has been available for many years to perform quantitative analysis of bacterial cells. MicrobeTracker allows detailed analysis of bacterial cells, including subpixel resolution contours, quantitative measurements of fluorescence, cell segmentation, and subpixel localization of fluorescent foci. The current stand-alone implementation of MicrobeTracker, Oufti<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, has improved its ability to detect confluent cells, non-rod shaped morphologies, handle large datasets, perform automated image analysis, and provides powerful tools for data analysis and plotting with an easier to use graphical user interface (GUI). However, while Oufti provides the ability to change the input values used by the segmentation algorithms, understanding the meaning of these values and their effect on the resulting output requires good knowledge of signal treatment. Because MATLAB has not been developed to deal with images per se, many common features available for working with image sets such as working with multiple images, selecting a region of interest (ROI), applying filters, and changing look-up tables (LUT) available in ImageJ-based programs are more difficult to accomplish in Oufti.</p><p id="P5">ImageJ-based<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> or Icy-based<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> solutions, such as Coli-Inspector<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> or BactImAS<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> provide an integrated and user-friendly approach to analyze spatio-temporal localization patterns and/or intensity of fluorescent protein fusions in time-lapse movies, but are specific to certain tasks and/or organisms. Coli-Inspector, for instance, is based on ObjectJ, which provides an integrated platform that dynamically links user-defined objects, such as cell axes, cell diameters, or constriction sites across images with their corresponding properties. With ObjectJ the user can easily interact with the images, the user-defined objects, and the associated results, and has access to interactive methods and visual inspection tools for quick elimination of artifacts. However, ObjectJ and similar tools offer a limited level of automation or rely on manual detection to delineate each cell on each micrograph.</p><p id="P6">Here we describe MicrobeJ, an ImageJ plugin, offering tools dedicated to address the challenges posed by automatically detecting and analyzing the wide variety of morphologies of bacterial cells and their associated organelles. This plugin was optimized to handle high throughput time-lapse microscopy experiments and deal with the obstacles described above for image analysis. MicrobeJ has an interactive GUI, including drag and drop loading of images, settings and template files, icon access to frequently used functions, hover box guidance for icon functions and user-interactive boxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). The GUI facilitates interaction between image sets, data, and post-processing data representation outputs, allowing users to determine the best detection parameters and ensure accuracy. MicrobeJ can be used in conjunction with the extensive library of functions and plugins that have been developed over the years as practical image analysis tools for ImageJ. A comprehensive description of the software is available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">supplementary information</xref>.</p><p id="P7">Bacterial cell detection can be achieved from either phase contrast or fluorescence images. Using conventional thresholding techniques, MicrobeJ detects particles with virtually any type of morphology, and then generates subpixel resolution contours and extracts medial axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Branched cells can be detected by selecting the &#x0201c;Branching&#x0201d; option, whereas other shapes are automatically detected, with the ability to reject inappropriate particles based on their properties and attributes. Medial axes allow the determination of the geometrical and topological properties of the particle shape, such as its length, width, sinuosity, curvature and angularity, and establishment of the spatial information relative to the sub-cellular coordinate system (see below). Both the accuracy and the precision of MicrobeJ measurements are in accordance with those reported by other cell sub-pixel contour detection methods<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Information</xref>).</p><p id="P8">For each particle, MicrobeJ provides a data structure that contains properties or complementary information, based on user-selected options, in the form of fields that can be accessed using an intuitive object-oriented semantic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). For instance, the average and the minimal value of width measured along the medial axis of a particle can be obtained respectively using the semantics &#x02018;SHAPE.width.mean&#x02019; and &#x02018;SHAPE.width.min&#x02019;. Using this terminology, particle properties can be used to define cellular types based on user-defined criteria. To demonstrate this, we mixed cells of various species with different morphologies or refractive index and used morphological and signal properties to define 6 different cellular types to determine their relative abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b&#x00026;c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Options are available for processes such as feature detection (constriction, fluorescent septa, or fluorescent patches) and fluorescence or width profile extraction. Using the selected options, MicrobeJ computes the specific properties and selected outputs for each particle during the detection process. Particle properties can be used to define cellular types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b&#x00026;c</xref>), cell polarity, or temporal events. To illustrate those functionalities, we analyzed time-lapse images of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> cells harboring FtsZ-YFP and tracked the respective localization of FtsZ and the cell constriction during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Video 2</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">3</xref>). In order to extract the time delay between these events and cell separation, we defined two temporal events. Temporal events consist of user-defined criteria designed to evaluate the particle properties over the time course of the experiment. When the particle meets the criteria of a specific event, the absolute and relative timing are recorded in the results table. In this example, we determined two temporal events based on the first appearance of a FtsZ-YFP fluorescent septum and a constriction, and from within MicrobeJ&#x02019;s results interface, plotted the distribution of their timing before division for all the cell time courses detected in this experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">By default, the polarity of each particle is attributed randomly. However, cell polarity can be defined, based on user-defined criteria, with any geometrical and signal property (such as the width, the curvature, or the fluorescence intensity) or the presence or absence of fluorescent foci or cellular features (such as constrictions or septa). The division plane in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells is asymmetrically positioned between the old-pole (&#x02018;stalked&#x02019;) and new-pole (&#x02018;swarmer&#x02019;)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Consequently, in the example of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, we used the relative position of the constriction site as a criterion to define the longitudinal polarity and extracted the fluorescence and the width profiles along the medial axes of the cells. The pixel intensity and the width are measured along the medial axis using the specified polarity and can be used to generate an oriented map of profiles also called a demograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Finally, we measured the sub-cellular localization of the septa and the constrictions, and plotted their distribution relative to the center of the cell using sub-cellular localization charts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To accommodate diverse applications requiring sub-cellular localization depiction, MicrobeJ provides four types of relative coordinate systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Information</xref>). Each coordinate system provides specific coordinates, such as the relative position along the medial axis of the parent particle or the angle relative to the medial axis of the parent particle. These properties can be used to study the spatial distribution or the dynamics of fluorescent foci inside their parent particle using dedicated subcellular representations such as charts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>) or heatmaps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Also, when fluorescent foci or features are detected and associated with bacterial cells, the sub-cellular localization, the localization type, and specific information (such as the number of foci per cell and their average fluorescence intensity per cell), are automatically computed for each associated particle.</p><p id="P12">Depending on image quality, most users can simply use the software&#x02019;s default attribute values to detect bacterial cells with good results. In addition, MicrobeJ permits direct user interaction with the active image(s) during the detection process to optimize cell and subcellular particle detection parameters. Users can systematically change and test the settings, which may vary from experiment to experiment, prior to applying them to a full set of images for final analysis. In addition, the settings can be saved and applied to future image sets.</p><p id="P13">To improve the accuracy of detection in the final analysis, MicrobeJ has a comprehensive vetting system. The user can easily define a set of specific attributes referred to as &#x02018;morphology&#x02019;, including but not limited to area, length, width, circularity, curvature, sinuosity, angularity, solidity, and signal intensity, designed to evaluate the particles in the active image. Attribute values are displayed in the image, adjacent to each detected particle. Using the attributes of particles in the image, the user can constrain the attributes in the user interface in order to exclude inappropriate particles or include missed particles upon reanalysis. This strategy can also be used to exclude certain particles, for example filamentous cells, from subsequent analysis. Rejected particles or group of particles can be automatically segmented using the segmentation option. During the segmentation process, a set of methods are applied in parallel on the image in order to segment particles. Each method consists of specific filters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Information</xref>) or user-defined ImageJ macros. For each rejected particle, the method maximizing the number of particles that meet the specified morphology attributes is chosen.</p><p id="P14">To illustrate the segmentation capabilities of MicrobeJ, we analyzed a micro-colony of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells harboring defects in cell division by time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Video 4</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">5</xref>). Defects in cell division can lead to poorly defined septa or randomly localized division sites, both of which make the segmentation process more challenging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a&#x00026;b</xref>). In this example, we optimized attribute values and used the default set of segmentation methods (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Information</xref>) in order to segment the rejected particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Error and imprecision in the contour detection or particle segmentation are sometimes observed when particles are in close proximity to each other or when there is poor resolution. In that case, a manual correction can be performed in order to add, edit, or delete any particles detected or missed during the automated detection process. In our example, we manually separated unsegmented cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Video 4</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">5</xref>) and then generated the montage of straightened phase contrast and fluorescence images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Once the final image analysis has been completed, MicrobeJ provides a results interface for fast data post-processing workflow and to evaluate the accuracy of the output. This interface combines information about the experiment, the detected particles, and complementary data based on user-selected options (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Although particle measurements can be saved as a .csv file or copied into other programs for subsequent data analysis, the user can easily produce data representations of common statistical analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), interactive charts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>), fluorescence map profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>), regression analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>), or simple custom results tables directly from within the results interface. The major advantage of data post-processing in MicrobeJ is that each row of data for a cell or focus is dynamically linked to the image and to each type of data representation derived from it. Thus, users can rapidly display subsets of data easily across all data representations. Since one major challenge biologists face when using automated image analysis programs lies in determining the accuracy and veracity of the data, exploiting the dynamic link between the images, data, and data representations provides an efficient strategy to verify data points and exclude any from further analysis that appear to be artifacts. Finally, the user can save the list of the generated data representation outputs as a template that can be reused for future image analyses. The use of templates significantly speeds up the creation of frequently compared cellular parameter outputs, simplifying analysis and interpretation of data without specific training in image analysis or programming (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). Finally, a batch-processing interface allows consistent analysis across images and experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). These features facilitate customizable, high-throughput analysis of large image datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Information</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In summary, we have shown how MicrobeJ can be used to analyze the large amounts of data contained in multi-dimensional image sets. MicrobeJ introduces several new features and concepts for analyzing bacterial cells within a highly customizable user interface. Earlier versions of MicrobeJ were successfully used to analyze different types of bacterial cells, notably to quantify the sub-cellular localization patterns of a developmental regulator and morphogen in the genera <italic>Caulobacter</italic> and <italic>Asticcacaulis</italic><sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, the spatial dynamics of a versatile surface transporter in <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic><sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, as well as the dynamic subcellular localization of a respiratory complex in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. MicrobeJ is supported by a detailed user&#x02019;s guide and video tutorials with examples that are available on a dedicated website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.indiana.edu/~microbej/">http://www.indiana.edu/~microbej/</ext-link>), and will remain freely available and open-source. Additional functionalities will be added over time based on user feedback and new research needs, and the latest releases will be updated on-line. We expect that MicrobeJ will facilitate quantitative image analysis for both novices and experts in image analysis.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S1"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="S2"><title>Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth</title><p id="P17"><italic>C. crescentus, B. subtilis, A. biprosthecum, Rhodomicrobium sp,</italic> and <italic>P. hirshii</italic> were grown in PYE<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> at 30&#x000b0;C. <italic>A. tumefaciens, S. venezuelae, L. lactis,</italic> were grown in LB<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> at 30&#x000b0;C and <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown in LB<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> at 37&#x000b0;C. <italic>M. xanthus</italic> were grown at 32&#x000b0;C in CYE<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. <italic>S. pneumonia</italic> were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in THY<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. <italic>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</italic> CGA009 was grown anaerobically in defined mineral medium (PM)<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> supplemented with 10 mM succinate and incubated at 30&#x000b0;C with constant illumination from a 60 W incandescent light bulb.</p><p id="P18">Phase and fluorescence time-lapse imaging was performed on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope, equipped with a Plan Apo 60&#x000d7;, 1.40 NA, Oil, Ph3 DM objective and 1.5&#x000d7; magnifier.

(b) To start, the user can simply drag and drop an image file or stack from a disk onto the MicrobeJ GUI (1), here a stack of images with <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells expressing the polarly localized PleC-GFP. Once the images are loaded and selected, the user can test the bacterial cell detection settings. At any time, the user can also select dedicated options such as cell segmentation (Segmentation), fluorescence intensity measurements (Intensity), cellular type detection (Type), features detection (Feature), (Branching), assign poles polarity based on any particle&#x02019;s property (Polarity), measure number of particles within a defined distance of cell (Contact), or display cell profile along chosen axis (Profile) (2). To detect fluorescent foci, the user can test the maxima detection settings and further refine using another set of dedicated exclusion filters. The user can also select dedicated options such as the sub-pixel resolution (Gaussian Fit, not shown) or fluorescence intensity measurement (Intensity, not shown) (3). When both bacterial cells and fluorescent foci are detected, the user can associate them hierarchically using the association panel (4). At that point the user can either manually add, edit or delete any particles detected or missed during the detection process, as in this example of a cell contour being re-adjusted using the active handles distributed along the polygon (5), or run the analysis on the stack of images (6) and obtain the raw data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms782612f1"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>MicrobeJ can detect various cell morphologies</title><p id="P24"><bold>(a)</bold> Representative phase contrast images of (1) <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells, (2) <italic>Streptomyces venezuelae</italic> cells, (3) <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> cells, (4) <italic>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</italic> cells, (5) <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> branched mutant cells, (6) <italic>Bacillus subtilis cells</italic>, (7) Cephalexin-treated <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells, (8) <italic>Asticcacaulis biprosthecum</italic> cells, (9) 2 week old, viable, late stationary phase-adapted <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells, (10) Vegetative <italic>S. venezuelae</italic> cells, (11) long-stalked morphotype <italic>Prosthecomicrobium hirshii</italic> cells, and (12) <italic>Rhodomicrobium sp</italic>. cells.

Time points are indicated for each time frame (Scale bar = 1 &#x000b5;m). The bacterial cell contours (green), their corresponding medial axes (orange), the position of fluorescent septum (red) and the position of the constriction (orange) are shown. Septa were detected using the intensity profile of pixels from the fluorescent image along the medial axis of the particle. Constrictions were detected using the width profile measured along the medial axis of the particle. The orientation of the medial axis of each cell, marked by the position of the pole polygon (cyan), is determined based on the position of the constriction relative to the cell center. (b) Distribution of the time delay between the first appearances of the fluorescence septum (red), the constriction (orange), and cell division (n=352). (c) Demographic representation of the FtsZ-YFP fluorescence intensities and the cellular widths measured along the medial axis of the cells. Cells are sorted according to their length. The Y-axis of each demograph represents the relative position along the cell body, where 0 represents mid-cell and 1 or &#x02212;1 the cell poles.
