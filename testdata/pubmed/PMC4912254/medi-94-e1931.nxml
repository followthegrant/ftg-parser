To evaluate the causative bacteria and identify risk factors for BSI associated mortality in febrile neutropenia patients undergoing HSCT, we collected the clinical and microbiological data from patients underwent HSCT between 2008 and 2014 and performed a retrospective analysis. Throughout the study period, among 348 episodes of neutropenic fever in patients underwent HSCT, 89 episodes in 85 patients had microbiological defined BSI with a total of 108 isolates. Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were the most common isolates (76, 70.3%) followed by gram-positive bacteria (GPB, 29, 26.9%) and fungus (3, 2.8%). As to the drug resistance, 26 multiple drug resistance (MDR) isolates were identified. Resistant isolates (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;23) were more common documented in GNB, mostly <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (9/36, 25%) and <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (6/24, 25%). A total of 12 isolated were resistant to carbapenem including 4 <italic>K pneumoniae</italic> (4/24, 16.7%), 3 <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>, and 1 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and other 4 GNB isolates (<italic>Citrobacter freumdii</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter baumanii</italic>, and <italic>Chryseobacterium indologenes</italic>). As to the GPB, only 3 resistant isolates were documented including 2 methicillin-resistant isolates (<italic>Staphylococcus hominis</italic> and <italic>Arcanobacterium hemolysis</italic>) and 1 vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>. Among these 85 patients with documented BSI, 11 patients died of BSI as primary or associated cause with a BSI-related mortality of 13.1&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;3.7% and 90-day overall survival after transplantation at 80.0&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;4.3%. Patients with high-risk disease undergoing allo-HSCT, prolonged neutropenia (&#x02265;15 days) and infection with carbapenem-resistant GNB were associated with BSI associated mortality in univariate and multivariate analyses. Our report revealed a prevalence of GNB in BSI of neutropenic patients undergoing HSCT. Patients with high-risk diseases with prolonged neutropenia and carbapenem-resistant GNB were independent risk factors for BSI-related mortality.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neutropenic infection is a major adverse effect of cancer treatment particularly in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Microbiologically documented bloodstream infection (BSI) account for 10% to 30% of the febrile neutropenia (FN) episodes and remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HSCT recipients.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The epidemiology data provided the basis for selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for FN.

Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E coli</italic>) is an increasing issue in the treatment of patients with hematological malignancies. Other MDR bacteria such as <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>Enterobacter</italic> spp. pathogens were also noticed.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Although the prevalence and pattern of resistance varies among centers; the emergence of resistant bacteria became an even more important problem in China. In the latest released data from national surveillance CHINET study year 2013 based on a total of 84,572 clinical isolates, the average prevalence of methicillin-resistant strains in <italic>S aureus</italic> (MRSA) and coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> was 45.2% and 73.5%, respectively, while the prevalence of ESBLs producing strains was 54.0% in <italic>E coli</italic>, 31.8% in <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp. (<italic>K pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>K oxytoca</italic>) and 16.0% in <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> on average.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Since neutropenic BSI and prevalence of drug resistance remained as important clinical issues for patients undergoing HSCT; therefore, we performed a retrospective study to evaluate the local epidemiology of causative bacteria, the prevalence of drug resistance in patients with BSI and the impact of BSI on the treatment outcome in the Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Rui Jin Hospital to further optimize the strategies of infection control and antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment in transplantation recipients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design and Data Collection</title><p>We conducted a 7-year retrospective study of patients undergoing HSCT at the transplant unit of Department of Hematology at Rui Jin Hospital between January 1, 2008 and December 30, 2014. The aims of this study were: to describe epidemiology and outcome of BSI in neutropenic patients underwent HSCT; to understand the risk factors of BSI associated mortality. All patients undergoing HSCT with neutropenic (neutrophil count&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.5&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;10<sup>9</sup>/L) fever with documented BSI were included for analyzed. All microbiology data were provided by the Department of Microbiology and clinical data were gathered from the patient's clinical records and prospectively kept transplantation database as appropriate. This study was a retrospective evaluation of epidemiology data and therefore did not require ethical approval based on advice of ethics committee, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Management</title><p>All patients undergoing transplantation were cared in rooms with laminar airflow until discharge. Before admission to blood and marrow transplantation unit, decontamination using chlorhexidine solution was performed. Routine surveillance cultures and active screening (stool, urine, nose, throat, vagina or penis, and anus) were obtained weekly. In case of colonization of multiple-drug resistance bacteria documented, further contact barrier precautions, environmental cleaning, and surface decontamination were carried out. All patients had an indwelling central venous catheter and received oral levofloxacin and fluconazole prophylaxis until engraftment and until day 100, respectively. Both types of prophylaxis were discontinued in case of need for antibacterial or antifungal therapy.</p><p>At the onset of fever (&#x02265;38.1&#x000b0;C) or in the presence of any clinical symptom compatible with an infection, 2 sets of blood cultures were drawn from peripheral vein and central catheter. An empirical antibiotic therapy was started, usually with imipenem or cefoperazone sulbactam alone. If patients developed severe mucositis or septic shock, vancomycin was added as combination therapy. Otherwise, vancomycin was added until 48&#x0200a;hr in case of persistent fever. For those patients who remained febrile for 5 days, an empirical antifungal therapy was also started after a chest computed tomography scan and blood test for (1&#x02013;3)&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucan (G) and/or galactomannan test. Additional blood cultures were then repeated at least every 2 to 3 days or clinically indicated throughout the febrile/infectious episode.</p></sec><sec><title>Definitions</title><p>According to the definitions of the Infectious Diseases Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), BSI was defined by the isolation of bacteria or fungi from any blood culture in the context of fever or other clinical signs consistent with infection.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> For coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococci</italic>, at least 2 blood cultures were required to be positive.

Neutropenia and severe neutropenia were defined as an absolute granulocyte count &#x0003c;0.5 or &#x0003c;0.1&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;10<sup>9</sup>/L, respectively.</p><p>BSI-related death was defined as following: BSI was considered as the primary cause of death if the patient died within 1 week after the last positive blood culture and no other cause (including the underlying disease, persistent neutropenia, other infections and hemorrhage) was identified. BSI was considered an associated cause of death when another cause was also present (uncontrolled underlying disease, persistent neutropenia, and/or graft versus host disease [GvHD]). Death not related or associated with BSI was defined as death considered due to other causes when BSI was cleared at time of death (as indicated by the lack of infection-related symptoms or positive cultures).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Pathogen, Identification, and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing</title><p>Blood cultures were performed using the BACTEC 9240 (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) automated system.

These data were comparable to the surveillance study from Institute of Hematology, Peking University between January 2008 and October 2010. In their report of 75 BSI, the incidence of GNB, GPB, and fungal were 64.4%, 30.1%, and 5.5%, respectively. The mortality rate was 6.7% (5/75) while only 1 case of carbapenem-resistant GNB was identified.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>TABLE 6</label><caption><p>Summary of BSI Study in Patients Undergoing HSCT</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-94-e1931-g009"/></table-wrap><p>There are 2 possible explanations of the predominance of GNB in our study. First, though it is difficult to make confirmed conclusion due to limited data in HSCT patients, the 2 separate reports from China including ours (23) were comparable to the Chinese national surveillance studies of all clinical isolates (CHINET year 2013), which reported an overwhelming predominance of GNB (71.9%) over GPB (28.1%),<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> thus reflects the local epidemiology in China which was significantly different from Europe and North American. Secondary, there were clinical reports from various studies show that epidemiological predominance of GNB causing severe infections in neutropenic patients was associated with antibacterial prophylaxis, while the levofloxacin was routinely used in our transplantation program as part of antibiotics prophylaxis.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>As to the drug resistance, in our series, the resistant isolates were mostly observed in GNB with more commonly in <italic>E coli</italic> (25%) and <italic>K pneumoniae</italic> (25%) which was compatible to the CHINET study.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Of note, a relatively high percentage of carbapenem-resistant GNB was documented in our series. A total of 12 isolated out of 76 (15.7%) GNB isolates were MDR and carbapenem resistance. Even the natural resistant <italic>S maltophilia</italic> were excluded, the incidence of MDR and carbapenem resistant remained as high as 30.1% and 12.3%, respectively. This observation was significantly higher than the report from Peking University.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> More importantly, the BSI with carbapenem-resistant GNB was associated with a higher mortality rate (7/12) compared with all other patients (4/73) including BSI with other non-CRE MDR isolates. Since carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were resistance to many classes of antibiotics, thus limiting the therapeutic options, those patients who underwent stem cell transplantation and were infected with carbapenem-resistant GNB were very high-risk patients and should be carefully monitored.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>To our surprise, our data not only revealed a lower incidence of GPB BSI, but also a relative low incidence of drug resistance (no MRSA and only 1 VRE) while the prevalence of MRSA were reported as high as 47.9% in the national surveillance CHINET study and VRE was also more commonly documented in recent years.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> There was no clear explanation for these findings because gram-positive MDR is also reported being associated with fluoroquinolones prophylaxis.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>As to the mortality of BSI, the type of pathogen, underlying disease and status played a pivotal role.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Prior studies revealed that bacteremia due to GNB is usually associated with higher mortality, and the risk is further increased due to antimicrobial resistance.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In the present analysis, all 11 patients died of BSI were associated with GNB infection. The particular high mortality of BSI with CRE (70.0&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;14.5%, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) infection might have contributed to the significantly high BSI-related mortality associated with GNB. To the contrary, no patients died of gram-positive BSI in our series, which is compatible to the low mortality as previously reported.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Besides, underlying disease and prolonged neutropenia also played a pivotal role in BSI-related mortality in our study. BSI mortality was high in high-risk patients usually with uncontrolled disease compared to those with standard-risk disease at HSCT. Such a difference might be due to the fact that patients with high-risk disease usually have received multiple cycles of intensive chemotherapy, resulting in more severe immunosuppression, longer hospitalization, higher exposure to antimicrobial treatment and sometimes, the presence of severe infections before HSCT or prolonged pretransplantation neutropenia as previously reported.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>Limitations of the study include its retrospective nature, limited number of patients with BSI, diagnosis, and treatment procedure based on single hospital protocol. Although the data reflect real-life practice in our hospital, these limitations precluded any confirmed conclusion particularly concerning the analysis of risk factors for BSI-related mortality.</p><p>Overall, our report revealed a unique epidemiology feature of BSIs in patients undergoing HSCT, which was characterized by predominance of GNB with emerging of MDR/CRE isolates. This may highlight the importance to raise awareness of the local epidemiology data and the drug resistance features to guide the infection control, optimization of empirical antibiotic therapy, and antimicrobial therapy stewardship particularly for those patients undergoing with high-risk diseases, when encountered with prolonged neutropenia.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Dr Ming Wan and Dr Jun-Cai Xu from Shanghai Clinical Research Center for assistance in the statistics analysis.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ALL = acute lymphoblastic leukemia, AML = acute myeloid leukemia, BSI = bloodstream infection, CML = chronic myeloid leukemia, CoNS = coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp., CR = complete remission, CRE = carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae,
