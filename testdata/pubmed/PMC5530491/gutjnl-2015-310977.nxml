Vitamin D deficiency is associated with high CRC incidence and mortality, suggesting a protective effect of vitamin D against this disease. Given the strong influence of tumour stroma on cancer progression, we investigated the potential effects of the active vitamin D metabolite 1&#x003b1;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>) on CRC stroma.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>Expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and two 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> target genes was analysed in 658 patients with CRC with prolonged clinical follow-up. 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> effects on primary cultures of patient-derived colon normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were studied using collagen gel contraction and migration assays and global gene expression analyses.

There is thus a clear need for increased prevention, early diagnosis, novel treatments and better knowledge of this disease. Many epidemiological and preclinical studies indicate a beneficial effect of vitamin D on CRC incidence and mortality.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;7</xref> Moreover, higher prediagnostic or postdiagnostic serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are associated with better survival outcome in CRC.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Accordingly, the most active vitamin D metabolite (1&#x003b1;,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>) inhibits the proliferation and promotes the differentiation of cultured colon carcinoma cells by mechanisms that include cell cycle arrest at G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase, blockade of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway and induction of E-cadherin and other epithelial adhesion proteins.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

</p><p>Tumour stroma has a strong influence on cancer progression. Fibroblasts are the main cellular component of tumour stroma. Upon activation by the tumour microenvironment, they contribute to tumourigenesis by several mechanisms: secretion of molecules that act paracrinally on carcinoma and immune cells, modulation of extracellular matrix organisation and recruitment of bone marrow precursors.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;15</xref> Accordingly, stromal fibroblasts increase the frequency of tumour-initiating cells and contribute to poor prognosis in CRC.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Despite this and the beneficial action of vitamin D against this neoplasia, the potential effects of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on the stroma of patients with CRC are unknown.</p><p>1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> action is mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors that upon ligand activation regulates the transcription rate of hundreds of human genes. Thus, VDR expression is the main determinant of cell responsiveness to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In this study, we explored VDR expression and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> action on CRC stroma. We report that high VDR expression in tumour stromal fibroblasts is associated with a better clinical outcome in CRC. In addition, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> inhibits the protumoural properties of patient-derived primary colon normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and imposes in CAFs a gene signature that correlates with longer survival of patients with CRC. Thus, we show that CRC stromal fibroblasts express VDR and evidence that the modulation of their gene expression and physiology by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> contributes to the antitumoural action of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on this disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Details for cells and cell culture, cell immunofluorescence, RNA isolation and reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR, western blot, cell proliferation and detection of microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype and B-RAF V600 mutations in colorectal tumours are included in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary methods</xref>.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310977.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p>

Specimens with values above or below that point were considered as tumours with high or low expression, respectively. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival analysis with log-rank test was used to plot survival curves and estimate differences between patients with high or low VDR, S100A4 or CD82 expression. The prognostic effect of VDR expression and other clinicopathological variables was first assessed by univariate Cox regression analysis using as clinical endpoint OS or PFS from metastatic event. Then, multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusting for the previously identified prognostic factors was performed to show those factors with independent prognostic effect on OS or PFS. Associations between VDR expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics of the patients were analysed with &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (Fisher's exact test). Correlations between VDR expression levels and CD82 or S100A4 expression in tumour stromal fibroblasts were assessed by Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test.

Accordingly, high VDR expression in tumour stromal fibroblasts predicts a better clinical outcome in a large cohort of patients with metastatic CRC. Furthermore, the expression of two genes from the 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-associated gene signature, CD82 and S100A4, in the stromal compartment of colorectal tumours from the metastatic CRC patient cohort correlates with VDR expression and clinical outcome. These results widen our knowledge of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> action and indicate that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> exerts its antitumoural action on CRC by directly acting on colon carcinoma cells<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

Thus, our data support the possible beneficial effects of therapies using VDR agonists against this disease.</p><p>This study reveals that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> has a wide and partially coincident gene regulatory effect on colon NFs and CAFs. The results from our global gene expression analysis suggest that in normal colon 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> may participate in the maintenance of homeostasis as it regulates genes involved in cell adhesion and differentiation, tissue remodelling, wound healing, blood vessel development and inflammatory response. CAFs contribute to tumour progression by modulating extracellular matrix composition and secreting soluble factors that act in a paracrine manner and affect carcinoma cells and other cell types of tumour stroma.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;15</xref> Remarkably, we found that approximately 15% of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>-regulated genes in CAFs are classified as extracellular region components, including growth factors, cytokines and extracellular matrix constituents. In addition, our data indicate that the gene expression programme imposed by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> in CAFs comprises genes involved in cell migration, angiogenesis, hypoxia and immune response that probably contribute to the newly identified role that stromal fibroblasts play in the antitumoural action of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> on CRC.</p><p>Several ongoing clinical trials investigate the preventive and therapeutic role of VDR agonists, alone or in combination with other anticancer agents, against CRC and other neoplasias (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">http://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>). In 1998, a small study that analysed <italic>VDR</italic> RNA expression in whole tumour samples from a reduced set of 44 patients with CRC proposed VDR as a marker of favourable prognosis.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Accordingly, in the current study, we found that high VDR expression in carcinoma cells is associated with longer OS in metastatic CRC. Various reports showed that VDR expression is enhanced in precancerous lesions and early stages of colorectal tumourigenesis (aberrant crypt foci, polyps, adenomas), whereas it decreases in advanced stages.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45&#x02013;49</xref> Accordingly, other studies indicated that the transcription factors SNAIL1 and SNAIL2 repress VDR expression in colon carcinoma cells and confirmed that low VDR expression was found in a proportion of colon tumours associated with poor tumour differentiation.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> These data limited the applicability of VDR agonists for CRC to the prevention in high-risk population and treatment in patients at early steps of tumour progression.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>
<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> The present study changes this view and shows that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> has additional anticancer effects in CRC by acting on tumour stromal fibroblasts and, thus, that the therapeutic action of VDR agonists extends to patients with CRC who express VDR in tumour stromal fibroblasts independently of their VDR expression levels in carcinoma cells (over one-fourth in our cohort of patients with metastatic CRC).</p><p>Interestingly, we found that 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> also modulates gene expression and inhibits the protumoural properties of mouse embryo and human lung and foreskin fibroblasts, indicating that the modulation of fibroblast biology by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> seems to be a general action and not exclusive of the colon. This is in agreement with the recent report of VDR expression in pancreatic stellate cells and the enhancement of the anticancer therapy by a 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> analogue in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>
</p><p>Fibroblasts are the most abundant but not the unique cellular component of tumour stroma. Although we observed VDR expression in CRC-associated lymphocytes, no significant association between VDR expression in this cell type and clinical outcome has been found in our cohort of patients with metastatic CRC. The results from our global gene expression analysis indicate that several chemokines and extracellular matrix proteins with immune cell chemoattractant potential are among 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> target genes in CAFs. Thus, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> may indirectly modulate tumour stromal lymphocyte properties through its action on stromal fibroblasts. In addition, the expression and putative role of VDR in colorectal tumour stromal endothelial cells and immune cell types other than lymphocytes remain unexplored. Finally, our findings reinforce the relevance of tumour stroma and tumour microenvironment as targets for anticancer therapies and strongly support 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> as an important and multifaceted protective agent in CRC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected since it published Online First.
