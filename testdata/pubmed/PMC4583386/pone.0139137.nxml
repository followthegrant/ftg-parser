This pair of derivatives is capable of forming a disulfide bond through the newly introduced cysteine residues. SAVSBPM32 binds SBP-tag and biotin with binding affinities (K<sub>d</sub> ~ 10<sup>-8</sup>M) that are similar to SAVSBPM18. Although SBP(A18C) binds to SAVSBPM32 more weakly than SBP-tag, the binding affinity is sufficient to bring the two binding partners together efficiently before they are locked together via disulfide bond formation&#x02013;a phenomenon we have named affinity-driven thiol coupling. Under the condition with SBP(A18C) tags in excess, two SBP(A18C) tags can be captured by a tetrameric SAVSBPM32. The stoichiometry of the disulfide-bonded SAVSBPM32-SBP(A18C) complex was determined using a novel two-dimensional electrophoresis method which has general applications for analyzing the composition of disulfide-bonded protein complexes. To illustrate the application of this reversible immobilization technology, optimized conditions were established to use the SAVSBPM32-affinity matrix for the purification of a SBP(A18C)-tagged reporter protein to high purity. Furthermore, we show that the SAVSBPM32-affinity matrix can also be applied to purify a biotinylated protein and a reporter protein tagged with the unmodified SBP-tag. The dual (covalent and non-covalent) binding modes possible in this system offer great flexibility to many different applications which need reversible immobilization capability.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by Discovery grant (690573) from The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to SLW, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/</ext-link>; Discovery grant (262089) from The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) to KKSN, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/">http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/</ext-link>.

Streptavidin has also been successfully modified to create artificial metalloenzymes [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The core technology underlying these many applications is based on the strong non-covalent interaction between biotin and streptavidin, a homotetrameric protein with a biotin binding site in each subunit [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139137.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This interaction (K<sub>d</sub> of 4 x10<sup>-14</sup> M) is one of the strongest non-covalent interactions known [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. With the development of short peptide streptavidin-binding tags which mimic the binding of biotin to streptavidin without the requirement of biotinylation, the streptavidin technology platform has expanded to include the development of affinity matrices for the purification of tagged recombinant proteins. Several tags with streptavidin-binding affinity in the range from &#x003bc;M (Strep-tag II) to nM [nano-tag and the streptavidin-binding peptide tag (SBP-tag)] are available [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The SBP-tag is particularly attractive since it has a high binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub> of 2.5 nM) and can be introduced to recombinant proteins at various positions, including the N- and C-termini as well as many internal locations. SBP-tagged proteins can be affinity purified in one step using wild-type streptavidin agarose matrix [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The major drawback of this technology is that the affinity matrix can be used only once, since biotin is typically used as an effective competitor to elute SBP-tagged proteins from the matrix and the tight binding of biotin to streptavidin makes it impractical to remove biotin from the column. With the recent development of SAVSBPM18, an engineered form of streptavidin that can bind both SBP-tag and biotin with affinities in the range of 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we have shown that a SAVSBPM18-based affinity matrix can be used to purify either SBP-tagged or biotinylated biomolecules in a manner where the column can be easily regenerated and reused.</p><p>For all of the streptavidin-binding tags, the ability to bind to streptavidin in a reversible manner is a key strength. However, as this reversibility depends on the relatively weak binding affinity to streptavidin, it can also be a key weakness for many applications where a more stable binding interaction is required. None of the peptide tags can bind to streptavidin as strongly as biotin; in fact, biotin binds nearly 10<sup>5</sup>-fold better than the most tightly binding peptide. Therefore, these tags cannot be applied effectively for the purpose of immobilization. It would be ideal to have a designer streptavidin-SBP tag system which allows the engineered SBP-tag to have infinite affinity to streptavidin via covalent bond formation. With this feature, the peptide-tagged biomolecules could be immobilized to streptavidin with a bond strength that is even stronger than the traditional streptavidin-biotin interaction. Under appropriate conditions, breakage of the covalent bond between streptavidin and SBP tag would also be desirable. This would allow reversible interactions between these molecules. Therefore, this system would allow both immobilization and reversible binding to take place under different conditions. In this study, we report the successful development of a designer streptavidin-SBP tag system designated SAVSBPM32-SBP(A18C) with the above-mentioned desirable features. A cysteine residue was introduced to strategic positions in each of SAVSBPM18 and SBP-tag to develop such a system. Application of this designer system for protein purification shows that this system offers several advantages. First, the SAVSBPM32 matrix is backward compatible with the wild-type SBP-tag. Therefore, it can be applied to purify proteins tagged with either SBP, SBP(A18C) or biotin as well as other biotinylated molecules. Second, under optimized wash conditions, the new system does not show protein leakage in the wash fractions even when an affinity column is overloaded with the tagged protein, a problem previously observed in the SAVSBPM18-SBP system [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This newly developed system further advances the streptavidin-SBP technology to have the flexibility for both immobilization and reversible binding applications. A novel two-dimensional electrophoresis method was also developed to examine the stoichiometry of the SAVSBPM32-SBP(A18C) complexes. This method can be applied to other systems for analyzing the composition of disulfide-bonded protein complexes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Construction of pSSAVSBPM32, pSSAVSBPM32F, pSSAVSBPM96 and pWB980-BLA-L-SBP(A18C)</title><p>The genes encoding the SAVSBPM32, SAVSBPM32F and SAVSBPM96 versions of streptavidin were chemically synthesized by Bio Basic Canada Inc.

Fractions containing purified streptavidin muteins were pooled together and concentrated on Amicon ultra-15 centrifugal filters. Excess biotin in the purified samples was then removed by dialysis in PBS.

BLA-L-CPFB(-2) was purified to homogeneity via a two-step ion-exchange chromatography involving a DEAE column followed by a CM Sepharose column as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Application of the SAVSBPM32 affinity chromatography for BLA-L-SBP(A18C) purification</title><p>Purified SAVSBPM32 was immobilized to the activated Affi-gel 15 media (BioRad, Canada) as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and washed with two column volumes of PBS containing 2 mM TCEP followed by a final wash with 2 column volumes of PBS before use. Purification of BLA-L-SBP(A18C) by SAVSBPM32 affinity chromatography was performed under both the overloaded (150% the theoretical binding capacity of the column) and non-overloaded (20% the theoretical binding capacity of the column) conditions with modifications [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, the amount (&#x003bc;g) of BLA-L-SBP(A18C) loaded to the column was based on the theoretical binding capacity of the matrix. This was estimated on the assumption that one BLA-L-SBP(A18C) molecule binds across two subunits in the SAVSBPM32 tetramer. Thus, 1 &#x003bc;g of SAVSBPM32 dimer (Mr = 33,102) will bind 1.061 &#x003bc;g of BLA-L-SBP(A18C) (Mr = 35,113.8). Crude BLA-L-SBP(A18C) was dialyzed in PBS and the concentration was semi-quantified (described below). Samples were then reduced using immobilized TCEP disulfide reducing gel (Pierce) for 1 hour at 23&#x000b0;C with occasional agitation and separated from the immobilized TCEP by centrifuging the mixture at 1,000 g for 1 minute. For the non-overloaded purification condition, an aliquot containing 176 &#x003bc;g of reduced BLA-L-SBP(A18C) was loaded to a 1-ml SAVSBPM32 column. Binding was maximized by capping the column and incubating the mixture for 1 hour at 23&#x000b0;C. Following the incubation, unbound protein was removed by washing the column with 6 column volumes of PBS. Bound protein was then eluted using 6 column volumes of S-Elution buffer (PBS, 2 mM TCEP, 5 mM D-biotin). The first column volume of S-Elution buffer was incubated in the column for 30 minutes prior to elution. The column was regenerated with 10 column volumes of PBS. The same procedure was used for the overloaded condition with the exception that 1,320 &#x003bc;g of reduced BLA-L-SBP(A18C) was loaded to the regenerated SAVSBPM32 column. To optimize the wash conditions, the purification procedure was performed under the overloaded condition with the supplement of one [2% (v/v) Tween-20, 300 mM KCl or 5 mM biotin] or two [300 mM KCl + 5 mM biotin] additional components in PBS. Purification of BLA-L-SBP by immobilized SAVSBPM18 or SAVSBPM32, and purification of BLA-L-SBP(A18C) by immobilized SAVSBPM18 followed a similar approach.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Application of the SAVSBPM32 affinity chromatography for purification of biotinylated maltose binding protein</title><p>Maltose binding protein (MBP) with a C-terminal biotinylation tag (MBP-AviTag fusion, Avidity, USA) was used as a model protein for the purification study.

The advanced kinetics module in the BLITz Pro software (version 1.1.0.25) was used for programming experimental steps and data acquisition. For studying the interactions between streptavidin muteins (SAVSBPM18 and SAVSBPM32) and their interacting partners, purified BLA-L-SBP(A18C), BLA-L-SBP and biotinylated BSA (BioVision, USA) were immobilized individually to separate AR2G biosensors using the amine coupling method as specified by the manufacturer. Binding of SAVSBPM32 to the immobilized ligands on the biosensors was performed under the following conditions. The initial baseline for binding was measured by placing the biosensor in Buffer A [PBS containing 0.005% Surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare) and 2 mM TCEP] for 60 seconds. Association measurements for SAVSBPM32 were obtained by placing the biosensor in solutions of purified SAVSBPM32 at different concentrations (157, 117.8, 78.5, 39.25 and 0 nM) in Buffer A and measuring the increase in the BLI signal for 400 seconds. Dissociation measurements were obtained by transferring the biosensor to a fresh solution of Buffer A and measuring the decrease in BLI signal for 800 seconds. The same procedure was then performed using SAVSBPM18. Sensorgram data were plotted on dRU/dt versus RU plot. The time constant T1 was calculated from the plot using the equation Y<sub>max</sub> (1-e<sup>(-(t-t</sup>

The observed or apparent rate constant k<sub>s</sub> was calculated using the equation k<sub>s</sub> = (1/T1)C where C is the analyte concentration.

To locate positions where cysteine replacement would satisfy these constraints, the Disulfide by Design 2 program [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was applied to probe the recently determined crystal structure of the streptavidin:SBP-tag complex (PDB 4JO6) [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0139137.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This program uses an energy function to reflect the potential for the formation of disulfide bond with the lowest one having the highest possibility to form a disulfide bond. The analysis is based on a consideration of proximity and a comparison of the modelled disulfide bond geometry in comparison with idealized geometry. A86 of streptavidin and A18 of the SBP-tag were chosen for mutagenesis to cysteine residues (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, panels B and C) as they are the best candidates for three reasons. First, among all the candidates predicted, this pair has the highest probability to form a disulfide bond with the calculated energy in the range of 1.5 kcal/mol (<xref rid="pone.0139137.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The second best pair (Q24 in streptavidin and G11 in SBP-tag) has a higher calculated energy of 3.67 kcal/mol. Second, to limit the loss of binding interactions caused by mutations, the residues in the SBP-tag selected for mutagenesis should not have extensive interactions with streptavidin. A18 in SBP-tag only has limited interactions with streptavidin based on the crystal structure of the streptavidin:SBP-tag complex [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Third, A86 in streptavidin does not play a vital role in interacting with biotin. Thus, the A86C mutation is not expected to significantly weaken the biotin-binding affinity in the mutated streptavidin. This last consideration is important because biotin needs to be an effective competitor to elute SBP-tagged proteins from the streptavidin-mutein affinity matrices after reduction of the intermolecular disulfide bond. In this study, the A86C mutation was introduced to SAVSBPM18 which binds both biotin and SBP-tag with the binding affinity in the range of 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> M [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The resulting mutein is named SAVSBPM32 (<xref rid="pone.0139137.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The SBP(A18C) tag (<xref rid="pone.0139137.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) was fused to the C-terminal end of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> TEM-1 &#x003b2;-lactamase (BLA) reporter with a 19-amino-acid linker to project the SBP(A18C) tag away from BLA. Finally, an additional Ala residue was included at the C-terminal end of the SBP-tag to enhance protein stability. The original SBP-tag ends with a proline residue, but in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, proteins with a C-terminal proline residue are marked for degradation by the addition of the ssrA tag [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although it is not clear whether a similar process occurs in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic>, we chose to end the protein with alanine to minimize the chance for potential degradation of the tagged protein. The final construct is named BLA-L-SBP(A18C) (L stands for linker). An SAVSBPM32 variant termed SAVSBPM32F (<xref rid="pone.0139137.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) which included the insertion of a 9-amino-acid Flag tag (<underline>S</underline>DYKDDDDK) between E14 and A15 of SAVSBPM32 was also constructed. The serine residue (underlined) located in front of the standard Flag tag sequence serves as a spacer. Because of the introduction of this highly charged peptide sequence to SAVSBPM32, this streptavidin mutein offers better separation of streptavidin from SBP(A18C)-tagged BLA and other complexes during the analysis of the disulfide-bonded complexes using s-native PAGE and M2D-PAGE.</p><fig id="pone.0139137.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0139137.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Modeled cysteine residues in streptavidin variants SAVSBPM32, SAVSBPM96 and the SBP(A18C) peptide tag.</title><p>(A) Geometric and steric features of a disulfide bond formed by a pair of cysteine residues.

Our data indicate that the introduction of A86C mutation to SAVSBPM18 to generate SAVSBPM32 did not dramatically affect either the binding kinetics or affinity towards SBP-tag (<xref rid="pone.0139137.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139137.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). In contrast, the A18C mutation in the SBP-tag resulted in a 9-fold reduction in binding affinity towards SAVSBPM18.

As long as the cysteine residues are surface exposed, two cysteine-containing proteins can form disulfide bonds even though these proteins do not have any binding affinity to each other. This is traditionally known as thiol coupling or thiophilic adsorption [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139137.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast, disulfide bond formation between SAVSBPM32 and BLA-L-SBP(A18C) in this study is expected to be guided or enhanced by the specific binding interactions between streptavidin and SBP. The efficiency for disulfide bond formation should be much higher than expected for random collisions between two molecules, thus making disulfide bond formation efficient even at low concentrations of SAVSBPM32 and BLA-L-SBP(A18C). In order to confirm that the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between the two target proteins is significantly enhanced by affinity-driven thiol coupling in comparison with thiol coupling through random intermolecular collisions, two controls were needed. For the streptavidin control, a surface exposed residue, A63, which is located far away from the SBP-tag binding pocket of SAVSBPM18 was replaced by cysteine. The resulting SAVSBPM18 derivative is termed SAVSBPM96 (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, panel D). For the peptide tag control, BLA-L-CPFB(-2) was selected [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This protein is a BLA fusion carrying a 15-amino-acid biotinylation tag (PFB, peptide for biotinylation) which can be enzymatically biotinylated by the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> biotin ligase (BirA) [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The CPFB(-2) tag has a surface-accessible cysteine located two residues upstream of the biotinylated lysine residue in PFB (<xref rid="pone.0139137.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). If this tag is not biotinylated, it has no binding affinity to streptavidin. Therefore, SAVSBPM96 in combination with BLA-L-SBP(A18C) as well as SAVSBPM32 in combination with non-biotinylated BLA-L-CPFB(-2) serve as the control reactions to monitor the degree of disulfide bond formation mediated by a thiol-coupling process through random intermolecular collisions (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, panels B and C, lanes 5 and 7).</p><fig id="pone.0139137.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0139137.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Disulfide-bond formation between SAV muteins and cysteine-containing tags.</title><p>(A) Schematic of reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE analyses of disulfide-bonded complexes.

Analysis of disulfide bond formation between streptavidin muteins and BLA derivatives was performed utilizing reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE. To ensure that cysteine residues in the protein samples were freely available, immobilized TCEP beads were first added to create a reducing environment. At the time for disulfide bond formation, TCEP beads were removed to create an oxidizing environment. Since each subunit in the streptavidin tetramer and each of the SBP(A18C) tag in the BLA fusions contain a cysteine, an array of potential complexes are predicted based on random collisions (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, panel A).

The results show that SAVSBPM32 was able to effectively form intermolecular disulfide bonds with BLA-L-SBP(A18C) (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, panel C, lane 6, the 48-kDa crosslinked SAV-BLA protein complex). Under the same reaction conditions, only a small amount of SAVSBPM32 was observed to be covalently linked to the non-biotinylated CPFB(-2) tag (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, panel C, lane 7). These data indicate that affinity-driven thiol coupling can greatly enhance the efficiency of disulfide bond formation in comparison with random collisional processes. This conclusion is further supported by the inefficiency of disulfide bond formation between SAVSBPM96 and BLA-L-SBP(A18C) (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, panel C, lane 5). Since the cysteine residue of SAVSBPM96 is on the accessible surface and is located far away from the SBP-tag/biotin binding pocket, the absence of covalently linked heterodimers and presence of covalently linked homodimers suggests that the observed dimerization reactions are primarily the result of random collisions between the accessible cysteine residues on the surface of the two proteins. Both results indicate that effective affinity-driven thiol coupling between SAVSBPM32 and BLA-L-SBP(A18C) requires affinity between the SBP-tag and streptavidin.</p><p>It is interesting to note that under identical reaction conditions, SAVSBPM96 was observed to form disulfide-bonded homodimers but SAVSBPM32 was not (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, panel C, lanes 1 and 2). This is likely due to the difference in the position of the cysteine residue in the two variants. As previously mentioned, the cysteine residue in SAVSBPM96 is located on a surface exposed area that is outside of the SBP-tag binding pocket (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, panel D). The highly exposed location of this residue is expected to facilitate the formation of a disulfide bond between two SAVSBPM96 molecules. In contrast, self-dimerization is expected to be less efficient in SAVSBPM32 because the cysteine residue in this mutein is less accessible and the side chain is somewhat protected inside the SBP-tag binding pocket (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, panel C).</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Examination of disulfide-bonded complex formation with increasing concentration of cysteine-containing SBP-tags</title><p>A tetrameric SAVSBPM32 is expected to bind two BLA-L-SBP(A18C) molecules because a single molecule of SBP-tag binds to the biotin-binding pockets of two adjacent subunits of streptavidin [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions allows the demonstration of the formation of the disulfide-bonded SAVSBPM32/BLA-L-SBP(A18C) complex. However, limitations in the size resolution and absolute size accuracy of SDS-PAGE make it difficult to determine the precise stoichiometry of the two proteins in each complex. To determine the stoichiometry and composition of the complex formed, a semi-native (s-native) PAGE procedure was devised. S-native PAGE is a variation of the traditional native PAGE method by the inclusion of 0.1% SDS in the electrophoresis running buffer. The modest amount of SDS in s-native PAGE was found to be strong enough to dissociate non-covalently bound SBP-tags from SAVSBPM32 without denaturing the streptavidin tetramer (data not shown). To offer better resolution of the complexes, the FLAG-tagged (DYKDDDDK) version (SAVSBPM32F) of SAVSBPM32 was used in this study. SAVSBPM32F has a higher charge to mass ratio than SAVSBPM32. To form complexes, samples containing 5 &#x003bc;M of SAVSBPM32F tetramer in the presence of various concentrations (0&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;M) of BLA-L-SBP(A18C) were prepared. The mixtures were first pretreated with immobilized TCEP beads to break any preformed disulfide bonds. The immobilized TCEP beads were then removed and the samples were left for an hour before s-native PAGE. Lanes 10&#x02013;13 (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, panel A) show six distinct bands in each lane. These bands are labelled according to their increasing migration mobility through the gel as a1, a2, b, c, d, and e. Lanes 1 and 14 contain 5 &#x003bc;M SAVSBPM32F and 26.2 &#x003bc;M BLA-L-SBP(A18C) respectively. Bands c, d and e are composed of tetrameric SAVSBPM32F, disulfide bonded homodimeric BLA-L-SBP(A18C) and monomeric BLA-L-SBP(A18C), respectively. Since the concentration of SAVSBPM32F shown in lane 1 is kept constant throughout the reactions, any band shifts seen in subsequent reactions are likely not caused by the self-crosslinking of SAVSBPM32F. For BLA-L-SBP(A18C), the concentration of BLA-L-SBP(A18C) for the reaction in lane 14 is the highest concentration used throughout the titration experiment. Band shifts associated with the self-crosslinking of BLA-L-SBP(A18C) are accounted for (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, panel A, lane 14). When SAVSBPM32F and BLA-L-SBP(A18C) are mixed together, the first visible band shift (band b) occurs when the molar ratio of BLA-L-SBP(A18C) to tetrameric SAVSBPM32F is 1.3 (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, panel A, lane 4). Since this ratio is close to one SBP tag per tetramer, the composition of complex b is most likely a tetrameric SAVSBPM32F disulfide-bonded to a single BLA-L-SBP(A18C).</p><fig id="pone.0139137.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0139137.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Analysis of disulfide bond formation between SAVSBPM32 and BLA-L-SBP(A18C) using semi-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.</title><p>Reduced BLA-L-SBP(A18C) were mixed with 5 &#x003bc;M reduced tetrameric SAVSBPM32F (M32F) at molar ratios ranging from 0.43:1&#x02013;5.3:1 (A) and 30:1 (B).

This suggests that bands a1 and a2 contain protein complexes in which more than one molecule of BLA-L-SBP(A18C) is bound to a single tetramer of SAVSBPM32F. As the concentration of BLA-L-SBP(A18C) is increased up to a 4.3-fold molar excess over SAVSBPM32F, the intensities of bands a1 and a2 increase, whereas the intensity of band b only increases up to a molar ratio of 3.5 (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, panel A). The intensity of band b decreases slightly when the concentration of the SBP(A18C)-tag is increased further from 4.8 to 5.2 times the concentration of SAVSBPM32F (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, panel A, lanes 12 and 13), and the intensity drastically decreases at a ratio of 30 to 1 (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, panel B). These observations suggest that band b contains protein complexes composed of tetrameric SAVSBPM32F covalently linked to a single BLA-L-SBP(A18C) and bands a1 and a2 have more than one BLA-L-SBP(A18C) covalently linked per tetrameric SAVSBPM32F. This interpretation is consistent with the crystal structure of the SBP-tag:streptavidin complex [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which shows that two SBP tags can bind to one streptavidin tetramer.</p><p>It is interesting to note that when BLA-L-SBP(A18C) is at a 5.2-fold molar excess over the SAVSBPM32F tetramer, band c (free form of SAVSBPM32F) is still present (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). This means that even when BLA-L-SBP(A18C) is in excess, a small portion of the SAVSBPM32F population is still unable to covalently link to the ligand. One explanation could be that some of the SAVSBPM32F tetramers are &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d; protein and unable to bind. This idea was tested by further increasing the ratio of BLA-L-SBP(A18C) to 30 times that of SAVSBPM32F. When BLA-L-SBP(A18C) is present at such high levels, almost none of the unreacted SAVABPM32F remains (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, panel B).

Although an affinity matrix containing SAVSBPM18 binds BLA-L-SBP effectively for affinity purification, it was previously observed that loading excess BLA-L-SBP at up to 150% of the theoretical column capacity leads to the leakage of BLA-L-SBP from the column during washing [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As the new SAVSBPM32 system has the capability to form disulfide bonds, it is interesting to see whether the leakage problem can be addressed. Throughout this study, leakage refers to proteins that are eluted from the column during washing. Proteins in both the flow-through and initial wash (W1) fractions are not considered as leakage because an excess amount of SBP-tagged protein was loaded, and it is not possible to distinguish protein flowing through the column and protein that is washed off the column in the first wash fraction. Purified SAVSBPM32 and SAVSBPM18 were coupled to the activated Affi-gel 15 matrices (BioRad) and used throughout the purification studies. Culture supernatants from the model proteins, BLA-L-SBP and BLA-L-SBP(A18C) were loaded onto each matrix under both overloaded and non-overloaded conditions (150% and 20% the theoretical column capacity, respectively).

However, under the practical conditions, the actual interaction strength can be significantly lower. One of the possible reasons is that the biotin moieties are no longer in the free and non-conjugated form. They are commonly coupled to biomolecules or other nanostructures such as quantum dots. The same is true for streptavidin. Many studies show that the binding affinity for streptavidin-biotin at the solution-surface interface is much lower than that for the streptavidin-biotin interaction in solution. For example, the binding of biotinylated DNA to streptavidin beads has been shown to have a K<sub>d</sub> value in the range of 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> to 10<sup>-11</sup>M [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Furthermore, high rates of dissociation for biotinylated biomolecules from streptavidin have been reported under the low pH conditions of the endosome [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, for many practical applications, there is a need to have stronger interactions. Traptavidin with a biotin binding affinity that is 10 times stronger than that of the natural streptavidin-biotin system can potentially fulfill some of these needs [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

It can also be applied to purify or immobilize SBP(A18C)-tagged proteins (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Users thus have the flexibility to use the same protein-coupling system for applications that require reversibility and applications that require highly stable immobilization. The SAVSBPM32-affi gel column utilized throughout this work has been used more than 20 times over a four-month period. No noticeable loss in binding has been observed. The column can be easily regenerated by a simple and gentle wash step with PBS buffer.</p><p>In addition to streptavidin-based technologies, many powerful immobilization systems including SpyTag, HaloTag, SnapTag and sortagging are also available [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The most important advantage of the SAVSBPM32 system over these other systems is that this immobilization method offers reversibility through the application of a gentle reducing agent. This feature allows the potential application of this system for the development of reusable biosensor chips, bioreactors and protein arrays. Although many purification matrices such as ion exchangers, IMAC resins and gel filtration media are reusable, it is not the case for any of the common immobilization matrices (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., Sortagging). Reusability makes this system a green and economically attractive technology for both purification and immobilization.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Electrophoretic mobility difference of the streptavidin complexes with the same composition</title><p>The novel two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) successfully showed that both complexes a1 and a2 contain the same composition and stoichiometry of SBP(A18C)-tagged fusion proteins and SAVSBPM32F (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., two molecules of BLA-L-SBP(A18C), each forming a disulfide bond with a single SAVSBPM32 tetramer). Although it is somewhat puzzling that these two complexes migrate differently on the s-native gel, differences in the quaternary structures of the two possible complexes elegantly explain the differences in their electrophoretic mobility. The crystal structure of the SBP-tag complex with wild-type streptavidin suggests that two distinct quaternary arrangements can be formed when two SBP-tags bind to a single streptavidin tetramer [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In Arrangement 1, which is actually observed in the crystal structure of the SBP-tag:streptavidin complex [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the N- and C-terminal ends of a SBP-tag bind to subunits A and C of streptavidin, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>, panel A), while the second SBP-tag has its N- and C-terminal ends bound to subunits D and B on the opposite face of streptavidin (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>, panel B). When the two molecules of SBP-tagged fusion proteins are bound in this manner, the two BLA reporter enzymes are pointing towards opposite directions in a <italic>trans</italic>-configuration (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>, panel E). In contrast, when Arrangement 2 occurs, the first SBP-tag has its N- and C-terminal ends arranged in the same manner as the first tag observed in Arrangement 1 (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., the N- and C-terminal ends bind to subunits A and C, respectively, panel C). However, the second SBP-tag in Arrangement 2 (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>, panel D) binds in the opposite orientation when compared to the binding orientation of the second tag in Arrangement 1 (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., the N- and C-terminal ends bind to subunits B and D, respectively) (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>, panel D). In this arrangement, both BLA reporter enzymes are pointing towards the same side of the tetramer in a <italic>cis</italic>-configuration. The <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-arrangements of the BLA reporter enzymes result in complexes with large differences in hydrodynamic radius that likely account for the observed differences in electrophoretic mobility. A similar explanation for differences in electrophoretic mobility is well characterized with respect to DNA molecules where bound proteins or unique sequences can induce bent structures [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This explanation predicts the presence of a doublet only when two tagged proteins are bound to one streptavidin tetramer. In contrast, a singlet should be observed when a single tagged protein is associated with a streptavidin tetramer. The observed binding profile shown in the titration study (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) is indeed consistent with these predictions.</p><fig id="pone.0139137.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0139137.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Two possible quaternary arrangements of protein complexes containing two SBP(A18C) tags per SAVSBPM32 tetramer.</title><p>(A) and (B) show the orientation of the two bound SBP tags (grey and orange) in a streptavidin tetramer.

The titration study (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) indicates that high levels of SBP(A18C)-tags are needed to drive the formation of the SAVSBPM32 complexes with two SBP(A18C)-tags. When the tag to streptavidin ratio is 30:1, disappearance of the free form of the SAVSBPM32 tetramers and the formation of the majority of the complexes with two SBP(A18C)-tags per streptavidin tetramer indicate that the inefficiency of complex formation at lower tag to streptavidin ratios is not caused by the presence of inactive streptavidin tetramers (either in the misfolded state or with biotin in the biotin binding pocket) in the binding reaction. Although it is not clear why such a high tag to streptavidin ratio (30:1) is required to drive most of SAVSBPM32 into complexes with two SBP(A18C) tags bound per streptavidin tetramer, this requirement has also been shown in related studies. In a study to create tetramerized single-chain antibody (SCA) complexes using streptavidin as the tetramerization agent, mixing biotinylated single-chain antibodies with streptavidin in a 8:1 ratio only leads to a population of complexes where the majority of complexes have three single-chain antibodies per streptavidin [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. When using biotinylated DNA as a binding ligand, the majority of streptavidin complexes have two to three DNA fragments per streptavidin even when the DNA:streptavidin ratio is five [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. With the recent development of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-divalent streptavidin [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139137.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], steric hindrance is shown to be a factor accounting for the observed negative cooperativity for binding two biotinylated molecules to the <italic>cis</italic>-sites in streptavidin. In the SAVSBPM32-SBP(A18C) system described above, each bound SBP-tag occupies the two biotin binding pockets located on the same side of streptavidin (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). As a result, each SBP-tag appears to bind independently of the other and so steric hindrance is not expected to be a major factor accounting for the observed lower binding efficiency. The predicted structure of the SBP(A18C)-tag suggests another explanation for the importance of a high ligand to streptavidin ratio to drive complex formation. Kinetics measurements indicate that the introduction of the A18C mutation into the SBP-tag increases the rate of dissociation from SAVSBPM18 by almost 10 times. Since the A86C mutation in SAVSBPM32 does not change the binding properties towards the SBP-tag, it is expected that SAVSBPM32 would behave like SAVSBPM18 and bind the SBP(A18C)-tag with lower binding affinity. Although the A18C mutation in the SBP-Tag was designed to be minimally disruptive to binding interactions with SAVSBPM18 and SAVSBPM32, the replacement of A18 with cysteine may disrupt the helical secondary structure observed in the central portion (residues L17-R27) of the SBP-Tag bound to streptavidin (<xref rid="pone.0139137.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>, panel A). Prediction of the secondary structure of SBP(A18C) (<xref rid="pone.0139137.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>, panel B) by the PEP-FOLD program [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] suggests that the replacement of A18 by cysteine may increase the tendency of the tag to form a kink around the cysteine residue (<xref rid="pone.0139137.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>, panel C). Cysteine has a much lower propensity to be in a helical structure than alanine [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139137.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Furthermore, glycine, a strong helix breaker residue [<xref rid="pone.0139137.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0139137.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], was present at position 19 of SBP-tag (<xref rid="pone.0139137.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The combination of these two residues (Cys-Gly) may increase the chance of this region to adopt a kink at the beginning of the helical structure. In this conformation, the cysteine residue may not position properly to form the expected disulfide bond. Consequently, the N-terminal portion of the SBP tag may not optimally position itself to the binding pocket, thus leading to the observed increase in off-rate. Structure determination of the complex formed between SAVSBPM32 and SBP(A18C) is currently under way and may shed further light on the conformation of this critical region of SBP(A18C).</p><p>This explanation is consistent with the chromatographic behavior of SBP-tagged BLA on the SAVSBPM32 column. Based on the observed wash and elution profiles, the binding of SBP(A18C)-tags to SAVSBPM32 can be divided into two different binding modes. The first one is a high-affinity binding mode in which the SBP(A18C)-tag binds to streptavidin as observed in the crystal structure of the streptavidin-SBP tag complex and favors the formation of disulfide-bonded complexes. The second, lower affinity binding mode is characterized by the formation of a kink near the beginning of the helical region of the SBP(A18C)-tag. When bound in this manner, an intermolecular disulfide bond does not form efficiently and the non-covalently bound proteins can be eluted off from the column by the inclusion of 5 mM biotin and 0.3 M KCl in the wash buffer in the absence of reducing agents. SBP(A18C)-tags bound in this mode will occupy the biotin binding pocket and will prevent the binding of another SBP(A18C)-tag to the same site. Therefore, under the binding conditions with the SBP(A18C)-tag in excess, each SAVSBPM32 tetramer in solution may actually be saturated with two SBP(A18C)-tags although not all the bound SBP(A18C) tags can form the disulfide-bonded structure. The apparent lower binding efficiency observed in the titration study (<xref rid="pone.0139137.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) reflects that tags bound to streptavidin in the lower affinity binding mode are stripped off from the complexes because of the inclusion of 0.1% SDS in the electrophoretic buffer in the semi-native gel system.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0139137.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Determination of the kinetic parameters (on-rate and off-rate) of the interaction between streptavidin (or its muteins) and SBP [or SBP(A18C)] tagged &#x003b2;-lactamase.</title><p>For studying interactions of SAVSBPM32 and SAVSBPM18 with SBP-tagged BLA and its derivative, BLA-L-SBP and BLA-SBP(A18C) were immobilized to biosensor chips.
