It exhibited anticancer activity and induced apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells according to our previous data. In this study, we investigated whether p53 is involved in DHM-triggered viability inhibition and apoptosis induction in cancer cells. MTT [3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay was employed to evaluate the viability of HepG2 cells after DHM treatment. Meanwhile, p53 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was adopted to silence p53 expression. Protein level of p53 and Bax/Bcl-2 were evaluated by western blot analysis. Cell counting assay showed that DHM inhibited HepG2 cell growth effectively in a time- and dose-dependent manner. P53 expression was significantly increased after DHM treatment, whereas Bcl-2 was reduced potently. Furthermore, after co-treatment with Pifithrin-&#x003b1; (PFT-&#x003b1;, p53 inhibitor), Bcl-2 expression was reversed. The expression of Bax was no significant change, which was also observed after p53 silence. These findings defined and supported a novel function that DHM could induce human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells apoptosis by up-regulating Bax/Bcl-2 expression via p53 signal pathway.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by the following grants: The National Natural Science Funds (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/">http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/</ext-link>) and Guangdong Province Natural Science Funds (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gdsf.gdstc.gov.cn/">http://gdsf.gdstc.gov.cn/</ext-link>), China.

We found that DHM could inhibit HepG2 cell growth in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In this study, we demonstrated that DHM induced human hepatoma HepG2 cells apoptosis by reducing Bcl-2 expression via p53 and highlighted the importance of p53 in DHM induced cell apoptosis.</p><p>High-throughput sequencing of cancer genomes, interestingly, uncovered the surprising fact that only a small number of mutated, deleted or amplified genes were discovered in sporadic cancers. The most frequently mutated genes independently from the origin of the tumor are the DNA damage checkpoint tumor suppressor genes <italic>TP53</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0076886-Negrini1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The apoptosis-inducing effect is more dependent on the balance of Bcl-2 and Bax than on Bcl-2 quantity alone <xref rid="pone.0076886-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, which plays a role in cell proliferation. Cell survival is steady if the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax keep balance. The higher Bcl-2 expression level leads to inhibition of cell apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0076886-Tasyriq1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076886-DelPoeta1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In our study, there are close connection between p53 and Bax/Bcl-2 in HepG2 cell apoptosis induced by DHM. Previous study demonstrated that ZnO nanorods induced apoptosis in human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells. The expressions of cell-cycle checkpoint protein p53 was up-regulated and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased <xref rid="pone.0076886-Ahamed1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Targeting the apoptosome in HepG2 cells by a cytotoxic component of Garcinia cowa, dulxanthone A has been reported. Dulxanthone A activated the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway via p53 upregulation, subsequent increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release, which induced apoptosome formation <xref rid="pone.0076886-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Notably, previous research confirmed that VX-680 increased Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio, a favorable proapoptotic predictor for drug response and survival in AML <xref rid="pone.0076886-Huang2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>When DHM was blocked by PFT-&#x003b1; or by p53 siRNA, here we found that DHM inhibited Bcl-2 expression via increasing p53 which was supported by the results that DHM modulated p53 before Bcl-2 and Bcl-2 repression was attenuated dramatically. Undoubtedly, p53 has been regarded as a comprehensive and valuable target in cancer research <xref rid="pone.0076886-Goeman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Recently it was reported that p53 was associated with cancer cell metastasis, metabolism, and small G protein signal transduction. As an apoptosis inducer, p53 could cause cell growth arrest, apoptosis, and senescence in response to various types of stimuli <xref rid="pone.0076886-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0076886-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Consistent with our previous studies, we observed that DHM up-regulated p53 expression potently and this high expression level of p53 was maintained within 6 hours even after DHM withdrawal, indicating the long-lasting effect of DHM. Furthermore, DHM act as an efficient apoptosis inducer in HepG2 cells, could effectively increase Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio via increasing p53. Previous studies demonstrated that the expression of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein) was significant to cell apoptosis. And the higher expression level of Bax/Bcl-2 proteins ratio in cells treated with DHM suggested that both p53 and Bax/Bcl-2 proteins also play a role in the pathway of DHM-induced apoptosis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0076886-Woo1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
