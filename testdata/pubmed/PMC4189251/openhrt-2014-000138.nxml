<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Even when the entire chain of survival is working efficiently and effectively, outcome is difficult to predict, reflecting the many factors, both known and unknown, that contribute to overall survival. While many important predictors for survival are understood, such as an initial shockable rhythm, a witnessed arrest and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), many other more subtle predictors are likely to be in play.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>In many areas of medicine, the genetic influence on health, disease progression and response to therapy is becoming apparent. The understanding of genetic-based alterations and diseases of the human body has expanded enormously during the past 20&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Several correlations between genetic polymorphism and increased risk for disease development and outcome have since been established and it is likely that a genetic component determines response to some of the many pathophysiological pathways at play during attempted resuscitation from OHCA.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>An important determinant of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during resuscitation from OHCA is the diastolic blood pressure generated during external cardiac chest compressions; this determining the subsequent coronary perfusion pressure.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Vascular tone is a major factor determining diastolic blood pressure during CPR and is known to be influenced by genetic polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> The peptide hormone angiotensin II (AGII) is part of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system which controls blood pressure regulation. AGII acts to constrict vascular smooth muscle resulting in increased vascular tone and therefore increased blood pressure. The ACE gene has three genotypes: insertion polymorphism (II); insertion/deletion polymorphism (ID) and deletion polymorphism (DD). The absence (deletion, D) rather than the presence (insertion, I) of a 287 base pair fragment in the ACE gene is associated with higher circulating and tissue ACE activity.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This genetic effect accounts for 47% of the total variance of serum ACE.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The ACE genotype appears to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of several disease processes, although the exact mechanisms are poorly understood. In patients with the DD/DI genotype, excess mortality has been shown in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and paediatric meningococcal infection<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and the genotype has also been linked to trauma survival and worse functional outcome from traumatic brain injury.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In view of the significant effects on ACE genotype on survival from critical illness and major trauma and the role of the ACE genotype in determining vascular tone, we decided to perform a pilot study of the relationship between ACE genotype and outcome from OHCA of presumed cardiac cause. We felt such a pilot study focusing on feasibility could generate valuable information for future genetic OHCA studies independent of its findings. Hence, we established a study protocol with ethical approval, which made it possible to collect blood samples from OHCA victims with ongoing resuscitation or return of spontaneous circulation, to analyse the ACE genotype in OHCA victims in Western Norway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>We performed a prospective observational study of all patients suffering OHCA in the Stavanger region of Norway; an area with a primarily Caucasian population of about 320&#x02005;000.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> During the study period (February 2007&#x02014;November 2010), the EMS responded to 787 emergency calls to patients with OHCA, of which a presumed cardiac origin, according to the Utstein definitions,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

The study and the use of local databases were approved by the Norwegian Social Science Data Service, the Regional Committee for Research Ethics and the local EMS. The Regional Committee for Research Ethics accepted that no informed consent could be obtained before blood sampling from the patient or from the next-of-kin. Therefore, informed consent was obtained retrospectively, either from the patients directly if they regained the ability to consent after the treatment for their OHCA or from the next-of-kin in cases where the patient did not survive or did not make sufficient neurological recovery to give informed consent. If informed consent from next-of-kin was necessary this was obtained several weeks after the OHCA event to allow next-of-kin to recover from their severe loss. Oral and written information was given by the investigators to those giving consent and signed approval was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Cardiac arrest registry</title><p>All patients treated for OHCA by the EMS routinely have their details entered into the hospital-owned Utstein-based database.

Most of the blood samples were therefore obtained either after establishing ROSC or once CPR efforts were terminated. If the resuscitation efforts were terminated on scene, the deceased was, according to local law, no longer in the sphere of responsibility of the EMS. Therefore, no blood samples could be collected after death was declared by the on-scene physician. In order to improve recruitment, 10 additional blood samples were collected in the Bergen region, which have a similar EMS physician-manned service.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

We could not demonstrate such a relationship between ACE genotype and ROSC in OHCA victims. Had the association of ACE genotype with ROSC been as strong as that reported with survival from major trauma,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> we would have expected to see a significant association despite the relatively small number of patients studied. Although probably related to mechanisms other than vascular tone, ACE gene polymorphism has also shown a strong association in other diseases where it determines variations in acute lung injury in sepsis,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

ACE genotype alone as a marker of risk in disease processes may well be too simplistic an approach to understanding the effects of genotype on disease processes. A more targeted approach and larger sample sizes may be appropriate for future studies. Since the inception of this study, more specific methods of analysing ACE genotype and associated metabolic pathways have become available, such as measured-haplotype analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and future studies may be better directed using these methods.</p><p>Where genotype is associated with a specific phenotypic defect, rather than a subtle influence on metabolic pathways, a clearer association with genotype is often apparent. A number of studies have demonstrated that sudden cardiac death has a strong genetic component, particularly in association with structural defects and sudden malignant arrhythmias.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> A number of other genetic polymorphisms have all been associated with an altered risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction which are indirect risk factors for cardiac arrest.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> An understanding of the genetic contributions to outcome from resuscitation could add substantially to the prediction and management of cardiac arrest and is a goal worth pursuing. We therefore believe that the main value of our pilot study is to serve as a feasibility model for future prehospital genetic studies in OHCA victims unable to give informed consent.</p><p>With regard to our study design, we believe that the present study has demonstrated the practical and ethical feasibility of collecting blood samples from patients in the prehospital arena, even if not admitted to the receiving hospital later. This design facilitates the collection of important information from OHCA victims who were declared dead on the scene even if no blood was drawn after declaration of death as described by Johnson.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The approach used in this study can be used as an example for other studies where human material needs to be collected. The ethical details are applicable to other research studies in the prehospital arena. The ethical aspects of this study were universally accepted by EMS personal, but we found that about 20% of patients and/or relatives later declined to give informed consent. The main reason to decline informed consent from relatives was the wish not to be reminded about the death of the deceased and therefore the unwillingness of involvement. Some patients and/or relatives were uncontactable, thus preventing the use of these samples and data in the study.</p><p>In summary this demonstrates that it is possible to conduct genetic research in the ethically challenging prehospital environment with patients unable to give consent, but that studies must take into account a relatively large drop-out rate. Our experience also indicates that there may be a need for extra staff on scene, responsible solely for collection of biological specimens.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>The major limitation of this study is the small sample size, which is of particular relevance for genetic studies that often require sample size orders of a magnitude much greater than was possible in our study.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The small patient cohort studied may also explain why other factors like age and witnessed OHCA did not show significant associations with ROSC.</p><p>A main concern in the present pilot study was that the delivery of advanced life support by EMS crews should not be interrupted by the need to obtain a blood sample for the study. It was only possible to collect blood samples when enough resources were present at the OHCA scene. Several patients could not be included due to this limitation. Other ethical or logistical considerations on scene may also have influenced the inclusion of patients when effort was focussed on the resuscitation attempt. This may have inflated the proportion of patients with ROSC in our study cohort and thus limited the sample size in the comparator group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This pilot study of 127 OHCA victims did not demonstrate a clear association between ACE gene polymorphism and ROSC, and was limited in its interpretation by the relatively small sample size. However, the pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility of collecting blood samples from patients with OHCA and demonstrates how practical, legal and ethical challenges might be overcome in such pre-hospital studies. More pre-hospital genetic studies in adequately powered cohorts of OHCA victims will help move forward the frontier of genetic influence on resuscitation outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are deeply grateful to the EMS employees who made this work possible.
