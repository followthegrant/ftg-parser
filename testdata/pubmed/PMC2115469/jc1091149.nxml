The sea urchin CSL protein has been found to bind Ca++ similarly to calsequestrin, the well-characterized Ca++ storage protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells. In semi-thin frozen sections of unfertilized eggs, immunofluorescent staining revealed a tubuloreticular network throughout the cytoplasm. Staining of isolated egg cortices with the CSL protein antiserum showed the presence of a submembranous polygonal, tubular network similar to ER network patterns seen in other cells and in egg cortices treated with the membrane staining dye DiIC16[3]. In frozen sections of embryos during interphase of the first cell cycle, a cytoplasmic network similar to that of the unfertilized egg was present. During mitosis, we observed a dramatic concentration of the antibody staining within the asters of the mitotic apparatus where ER is known to aggregate. Electron microscopic localization on unfertilized eggs using peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody demonstrated the presence of the CSL protein within the luminal compartment of ER-like tubules. Finally, in frozen sections of centrifugally stratified eggs, the immunofluorescent staining concentrated in the clear zone: a layer highly enriched in ER and thought to be the site of calcium release upon fertilization. This localization of a CSL protein within the ER of the egg provides evidence for the ability of this organelle to serve a Ca++ storage role in the regulation of intracellular Ca++ in nonmuscle cells in general, and in the regulation of fertilization and cell division in sea urchin eggs in particular.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
