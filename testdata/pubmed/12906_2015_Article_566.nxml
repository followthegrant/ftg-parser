RA is characterized by inflammatory synovitis and destruction of cartilage and bone, which usually leads to substantial loss of function and mobility. How to delay with or prevent bone destruction caused by RA, and improve the life quality of patients has been the ultimate goal of RA treatment and nursing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Tripterygium Wil&#x02019;fordii Hook.F, belonging to plants of the genus Euonymus Corey Gong, is a traditional Chinese medicine, the extracts of which have a variety of pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antibiosis, antifertility, immunosuppression, anti tumor and etc. Thus, they are widely used in the treatment of rheumatic disease, autoimmune disease, organ transplantation, nephroma, asthma and tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among the extracts, Ttriptolide is the most active compound, which has strong immunosuppressive activity. However, Ttriptolide could not be directly used in clinic because of its biological toxicity and narrow therapeutic window [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. (5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT-8) is a new analog of Ttriptolide, which has been qualified and optimized in structure, and shows lower cytotoxicity and relatively higher immunosuppressive activity. In our previous study, we found that the toxicity of LLDT-8 is significantly reduced compared with triptolide. General speaking, it showed a 122-fold lower cytotoxicity in vitro and 10-fold lower acute toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Previous studies also demonstrated that LLDT-8 has a variety of immunosuppressive activities and significant therapeutic effects <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, how LLDT-8 influences osteoclastogenesis is still unknown.</p><p>The purpose of our study was to assess the effects of LLDT-8 on RANK/RANKL/OPG signaling pathway and osteoclastogenesis. Our work suggested that LLDT-8 up-regulated OPG expression in CD3<sup>+</sup>T leukomonocytes in peripheral blood as well as the ratio of OPG/RANKL in both peripheral blood and synovial fluid, and it also inhibited inflammatory cytokine secretion in the supernatants of PBMCs and SFMCs. Besides, LLDT-8 may reduce osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B signaling. These results guarantee a good prospect in further clinical tests of LLDT-8 for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of RA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Human sample</title><p>Thirty two specimens in this study were obtained from Shanghai Guanghua Hospital, among which 21 specimens were peripheral blood and 11 specimens were synovial fluid.

RANKL interacts with its receptor RANK locating on the osteoclast membrane to initiate osteoclastic activation, subsequently induces osteoclasts differentiation and inhibits their apoptosis. OPG acts as an endogenous decoy receptor that competitively inhibits osteoclasts differentiation through its interaction with RANKL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the balance of RANKL/RANK/OPG signaling pathway is broken in RA patients. Compared with healthy individuals, RA patients showed significantly higher serum levels of RANKL, lower levels of OPG, and decreased OPG/RANKL ratio in peripheral blood. Moreover, there is a strictly positive interrelation between OPG/RANKL ratio and joint swelling index, as well as health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, to change the ratio of OPG/RANKL might stop or at least slow down the deterioration of this disease.</p><p>Our results demonstrated that LLDT-8 up-regulated the OPG expression on CD3<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in peripheral blood of RA patients, leading to the increased OPG/RANKL ratio on CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells both in peripheral blood and in synovial fluid. Meanwhile, LLDT-8 treatment suppressed the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-21 and IL-23, but promoted the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, in order to regulate RANKL/RANK/OPG system. The ratio of OPG/RANKL was significantly increased by LLDT-8, which indicated that corresponding improvement might be achieved in the patients under LLDT-8 treatment.</p><p>The mechanism on which LLDT-8 regulates OPG/RANKL ratio and inhibits osteoclastic activation may involve several aspects. RANKL expression is regulated by various cytokines, such as bone resorbing factor, glucocorticoid, 1&#x003b1;,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3, IL-1, IL-6, IL-11, IL-17, TNF-&#x003b1;, PGE2, PTH and so on. They carry out their functions via inducing RANKL expression in osteoblasts, and thus promote bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. IL-21 enhances osteoclastogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> by up-regulating the expression of RANKL in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in CIA mice as well as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and fibroblast-like FLS of RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Besides, IL-23 also induces RANKL expression in FLS of RA patients through MEK1/2, NF-&#x003ba;B and STAT3 signaling pathway, which was reported to involve in the pathogenesis of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The serum level of IL-23 is associated with the symptom of RA. In contrast, IL-10 suppresses RANK-induced osteoclastogenesis and selectively inhibits calcium signaling downstream of RANK by suppressing the transcription of TREM-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. IL-4 also serves as a protective cytokine in RA, which inhibits osteoclasts formation by stimulating osteoblasts to produce OPG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These studies confirmed that pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, IL-21, IL-23 and TNF-&#x003b1; induce osteoclasts formation via RANKL signaling pathway; on the other hand, anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4 and IL-10 block RANKL signaling pathway and in turn inhibit osteoclasts formation. In our study, we showed that LLDT-8 enhanced the ratio of OPG/RANKL by increasing OPG expression and down-regulated the production of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and IL-21 in PBMCs and SFMCs. LLDT-8 also suppressed the production of IL-23 in PBMCs, but promoted IL-10 secretion in PBMCs and SFMCs. Previous studies reported that LLDT-8 inhibited TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-17 secretion in PBMCs and SFMCs but up-regulated IL-4 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. All these results suggested that LLDT-8 probably regulated RANKL/RANK/OPG system by up-regulating the expression of osteoclasts inhibitive factors in RA patients. These data also explained how LLDT-8 exerts its function on anti-osteoclastogenesis in RA patients.</p><p>Up to now, it is not easy to collect mature osteoclasts from animal or human tissues. The osteoclasts required were usually obtained from differentiation of osteoclastic progenitor. Recently, methods of inducing neoblast to differentiate into osteoclast <italic>in vitro</italic> is well established, for example, co-culturing marrow stroma cell with myelomoncyte, stimulating myelomoncyte with culture medium of marrow stroma cell, and inducing myelomoncyte and mice RAW264.7 cell with mice recombination RANKL. Among them, the osteoclasts induced by RANKL were larger in both volume and number. This method was easier to operate compared with other methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. RAW264.7 is mice mononuclear macrophage cell line, and can differentiate into osteoclast-like cells in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF. During our research we obtained osteoclasts easily and steadily by using this method. Our results showed that RAW264.7 cells differentiated into TRAP-positive osteoclast-like cells in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF, and LLDT-8 decreased the osteoclastogenesis. To reveal its mechanism of action, we further examined the signaling pathway involved in RANK/RANKL/OPG system under LLDT-8 treatment. NF-&#x003ba;B plays an essential role in the process of osteoclasts differentiation and anti-apoptosis. NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and p52 expression is essential for RANK-expressing osteoclast precursors to differentiate into TRAP-positive osteoclasts in response to RANKL and other osteoclastogenic cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that LLDT-8 inhibits the expression of p-I&#x003ba;B which could be induced by RANKL. This indicates LLDT-8 probably decreases RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by suppressing NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway.</p><p>Several signaling molecules that promote the differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts participate in RANKL signaling pathway. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is one of the serine/threonine phosphorylating kinases. There are many forms of MAPK, including extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) p38 MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and etc. These kinases are activated in RANKL downstream, and promote osteoclasts differentiation. M-CSF facilitates RANKL-induced activation of c-fos and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, in turn increases the activity of osteoclasts. Studies showed that the function of M-CSF could be blocked by MEK inhibitor PD98059 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As c-Jun is an essential transcription factor for osteoclast differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>, blockade of the JNK and c-Jun pathway by SP600125 suppresses osteoclast differentiation. In addition, RANKL-induced osteoclasts differentiation is markedly inhibited by over-expression of dominant-negative JNK1 or dominant-negative c-Jun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Bone resorption area and number of osteoclasts <italic>in vivo</italic> were significantly decreased by the treatment of FR167653, a P38 MAPK inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) plays an important role in multiple biological processes such as proliferation, survival, migration, secretion and etc. The activity of PI3K is regulated by RANK through upstream Src, which is an intracytoplasm protein kinase. Then Akt is activated, which further facilitates osteoclasts differentiation. When RAW264.7 and macrophage precursor cells (BMMs) were treated with RANKL, a higher steady-state level of IP3 was observed in RAW264.7 cells. In BMMs, the inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122, a specific inhibitor of PLC and IP3Rs, suppressed the generation of RANKL-induced multinucleated cells and decreased the bone-resorption rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In our study, significant effect of LLDT-8 on the expression of p-P38, p-JNK, p-ERK and p-Akt induced by RANKL were not observed. Real-time PCR should be used to further reveal the role of LLDT-8 on the downstream signaling pathways of RANKL, including NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. Moreover, how LLDT-8 affects NF-&#x003ba;B pathway is still not clear. Thus, further research needs to be done, in order to clarify the effect of LLDT-8 on the downstream signaling pathways of RANKL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our results showed that LLDT-8 plays an important role on anti-osteoclastogenesis effect in RA probably through regulating RANKL/RANK/OPG system and its downstream signaling pathway as well as cytokine productions.
