The effect of PIK-75 on the level and activity of NRF2 was characterized using various assays including reporter gene, quantitative PCR, DNA-binding and western blot analyses. Additionally, the combinatorial effect of PIK-75 and gemcitabine was evaluated in human pancreatic cancer cell lines and a xenograft model. PIK-75 reduced NRF2 protein levels and activity to regulate its target gene expression through proteasome-mediated degradation of NRF2 in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. PIK-75 also reduced the gemcitabine-induced NRF2 levels and the expression of its downstream target MRP5. Co-treatment of PIK-75 augmented the antitumor effect of gemcitabine both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our present study provides a strong mechanistic rationale to evaluate NRF2 targeting agents in combination with gemcitabine to treat pancreatic cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PIK-75</kwd><kwd>gemcitabine</kwd><kwd>NRF2</kwd><kwd>MRP5</kwd><kwd>synergism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest human cancer types with an estimated 45,220 new cases and 38,460 deaths in 2013 in US (<xref rid="b1-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Although pancreatic cancer accounts for &#x0223c;7% of all cancer deaths and ranks 4th as a cause of cancer death, the incidence and mortality rates increased for the overall US during 2000&#x02013;2009 (<xref rid="b1-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In addition, the five-year survival rate is estimated as &#x0003c;5&#x02013;6% (<xref rid="b2-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Around 90% of all pancreatic cancers are adenocarcinomas that originate in the epithelial cells of the pancreatic duct (<xref rid="b3-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Since the early stage pancreatic cancer usually has no detectable symptoms, only &#x0223c;15 to 20% of pancreatic cancer cases are diagnosed early enough to be eligible for surgery that provides the only chance of cure for pancreatic cancer patients (<xref rid="b1-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Gemcitabine, the recommended first-line chemotherapeutics, can be given alone or in combination with other drugs (<xref rid="b1-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); however chemotherapy of pancreatic cancers is limited by innate or acquired resistance (<xref rid="b8-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a master regulator of genes involved in oxidative stress response, detoxification and drug resistance (<xref rid="b9-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). As a member of basic region leucine zipper transcription factors, NRF2 binds to a DNA sequence called antioxidant response element (ARE) and induces transcription of target genes (<xref rid="b9-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Under normal reducing conditions, NRF2 is repressed by Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)-dependent ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation (<xref rid="b9-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In addition, NRF2 is also downregulated by CR6-interacting factor 1 (CRIF1) under both reducing and oxidative stress conditions (<xref rid="b13-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). While NRF2 decreases tumor susceptibility in most carcinogenesis models, constitutive activation of NRF2 may enhance tumor cell proliferation and/or protection against chemotherapy (<xref rid="b10-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b14-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In fact, NRF2 is upregulated in many types of tumors through somatic mutations that disrupt NRF2-KEAP1 regulation (<xref rid="b10-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).

The reduction of GCLC protein (<xref rid="f1-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) was well correlated with the reduction of its mRNA in NRF2-KD cells (<xref rid="f1-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of PIK-75 as an inhibitor of NRF2-dependent transcription</title><p>NRF2 is tightly regulated by proteasomal degradation that mediated by KEAP1 (<xref rid="b9-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) or CRIF1 (<xref rid="b13-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Since NRF2 can be activated by post-translational modification such as phosphorylation by various protein kinases (<xref rid="b11-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), it is plausible that activation of NRF2 is mediated by oncogenic activation of upstream signaling pathway in cancer cells. We postulated that NRF2 could be downregulated by small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting the proper signaling pathway. To identify the NRF2 downregulating inhibitor, AsPC-1 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene construct containing the ARE from NQO1 gene (ARE-Luc) and treated with various kinase inhibitors (0.1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) for 24 h. Interestingly, PIK-75, known as a PI3K/DNA-PK inhibitor (<xref rid="b26-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), significantly reduced the ARE-Luc activity in AsPC-1 cells (<xref rid="f2-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We further compared a series of inhibitors (0.1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in the AsPC-1 cells transfected with FLAG-NRF2 and ARE-Luc. Kinase inhibitors targeting this pathway reduced the ARE-Luc reporter activity in the presence of FLAG-NRF2 to certain degree, but PIK-75 was the most potent inhibitor that reduced the ARE-Luc reporter expression upto &#x0223c;50% either in the absence or presence of exogenous FLAG-NRF2 (<xref rid="f2-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The PIK-75-mediated suppression of NRF2 transactivation was further confirmed in another pancreatic cancer cell, MIA PaCa-2. The suppression of NRF2-mediated ARE-Luc activation by PIK-75 was as rapid as 8 h post-treatment in MIA PaCa-2 cells (<xref rid="f2-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PIK-75 inhibits NRF2-target gene expression by reducing NRF2 protein level</title><p>The effect of PIK-75 on the mRNA expression of NRF2 and its target gene was assessed by qRT-PCR in the cDNAs from AsPC-1 cells transfected with FLAG-NRF2 and treated with PIK-75.

In cancer cells, NRF2 induces resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs by upregulating transcription of various drug resistant genes such as anti-apoptotic proteins and drug transporters (<xref rid="b12-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b31-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). While various activators of the NRF2 pathway have been reported to increase the level of NRF2 (<xref rid="b33-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), small molecules that inhibit NRF2 activity are less defined. Since proteins that negatively regulate the NRF2 level also regulate various signaling pathways (<xref rid="b32-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), it is possible that small molecule kinase inhibitors affect the level of NRF2. As an example, the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 decreased K-Ras<sup>G12D</sup>-induced expression of Nrf2 gene and its target genes in primary murine cells (<xref rid="b16-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). As described in the present study, our initial attempt identified PIK-75 as an inhibitor of NRF2 from a small set of kinase inhibitors. Since the stability of NRF2 is regulated by PI3K/AKT/GSK3&#x003b2; pathway, reducing NRF2 by a PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor can be predictable as an educated guess, in some respect. The distinct potency of PIK-75 in downregulation of NRF2, however, was unpredictable as compared to other PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors such as PI-103. Both PIK-75 and PI-103 was reported to commonly inhibit PI3K p110&#x003b1;, p110&#x003b4; and DNA-PK with similar degree (<xref rid="b26-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Downregulation of NRF2 by 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M of PIK-75 was rapid at 8 h post-treatment, whereas other inhibitors required prolonged incubation time (data not shown). Further investigation will be needed to address the pathway and target responsible to this unique feature of PIK-75.</p><p>Our present study raises additional questions as to how gemcitabine induces NRF2 level in pancreatic cancer cells. Gemcitabine is known to activate various protein kinases such as ERK (<xref rid="b34-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), AKT (<xref rid="b25-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b34-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), EGFR and HER3 (<xref rid="b34-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) in pancreatic cancer cells, and PKC (<xref rid="b35-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) in ovarian cancer cells. Interestingly, all these kinases have implications in the regulation of NRF2 stability and/or induction: i) the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, that inhibits MEK-ERK pathway (<xref rid="b36-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), reduced the K-Ras<sup>G12D</sup>-mediated Nrf2 induction in primary murine cells (<xref rid="b16-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); ii) AKT phosphorylates GSK3&#x003b2; (S9) (<xref rid="b37-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) to inhibit its kinase activity that phosphorylates NRF2 and induces its degradation by &#x003b2;-TrCP-dependent ubiquitination (<xref rid="b39-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). GSK3&#x003b2; is also known to be activated by phosphorylation of Y216 by unknown upstream tyrosine kinase. Active GSK3&#x003b2; (Y216) phosphorylates and activates SRC family kinases that induce nuclear exclusion and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of NRF2 through its phosphorylation of Y568 (<xref rid="b40-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>); iii) activation of EGFR by EGF lead to induction of NRF2 in non-small cell lung cancer cells (<xref rid="b18-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>); and iv) phosphorylation of NRF2 serine 40 by PKC&#x003b4; is required for stabilization and nuclear localization of NRF2 (<xref rid="b42-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Alternatively, gemcitabine induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pancreatic cancer cells (<xref rid="b43-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="b44-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).

It has been reported that MRP5 is a target gene of NRF2 in mouse liver by micro-array analysis (<xref rid="b31-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and knockdown of NRF2 reduced the MRP5 mRNA in pancreatic cancer cells (<xref rid="b20-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). MRP5 is a member of MRP-related ABCC family (<xref rid="b45-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). MRP5 contains two membrane-spanning domains and is known to confer resistance to cyclic nucleotides, acyclic nucleoside phosphates and monophosphorylated nucleoside analogs (<xref rid="b46-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Notably, high dose (20 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) of gemcitabine has been reported to induce expression of MRP5 mRNA and MRP5-overexpression contributed to gemcitabine resistance in HEK293 and PANC-1 cells (<xref rid="b47-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In addition, silencing MRP5 by shRNA potentiated the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells (<xref rid="b47-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). MRP5 was also reported to confer gemcitabine resistance in non-small cell lung cancer cells (<xref rid="b48-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Consistently, we found that inhibiting NRF2 by PIK-75 resulted in the reduction of MRP5 expression and potentiation of gemcitabine toxicity in pancreatic cancer cells. Importantly, this synergism showed marked reduction of <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model.</p><p>In conclusion, our data suggest that blocking the NRF2 pathway by small molecule inhibitors is a promising therapeutic approach to treat pancreatic cancers. While several studies suggest the potential benefit of genetic silencing of NRF2 by RNA interference to reduce proliferation and/or resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics, its immediate application is hampered by inefficient delivery of nucleic acids into cells. In this aspect, small molecules are preferable for clinical applications. Notably a recent study on urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis in Nrf2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mouse model has also suggested NRF2 inhibitors as rational tools to prevent malignant progression of lung cancer (<xref rid="b49-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). In addition, recently it has been reported that the natural compound trigonelline inhibiting NRF2 activity with unknown mechanism, enhanced antitumor effect of etoposide in mouse xenograft models of pancreatic cancers (<xref rid="b50-ijo-44-03-0959" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Further investigations addressing more detailed mechanisms of PIK-75 in NRF2 downregulation could increase the specificity and avoid the potential side-effects of NRF2-targeting
