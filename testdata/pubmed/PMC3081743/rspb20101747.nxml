The implant contains an array of 1500 active microphotodiodes (&#x02018;chip&#x02019;), each with its own amplifier and local stimulation electrode. At the implant's tip, another array of 16 wire-connected electrodes allows light-independent direct stimulation and testing of the neuron&#x02013;electrode interface. Visual scenes are projected naturally through the eye's lens onto the chip under the transparent retina. The chip generates a corresponding pattern of 38 &#x000d7; 40 pixels, each releasing light-intensity-dependent electric stimulation pulses. Subsequently, three previously blind persons could locate bright objects on a dark table, two of whom could discern grating patterns. One of these patients was able to correctly describe and name objects like a fork or knife on a table, geometric patterns, different kinds of fruit and discern shades of grey with only 15 per cent contrast. Without a training period, the regained visual functions enabled him to localize and approach persons in a room freely and to read large letters as complete words after several years of blindness. These results demonstrate for the first time that subretinal micro-electrode arrays with 1500 photodiodes can create detailed meaningful visual perception in previously blind individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>subretinal neuro-prosthetics</kwd><kwd>retinal implant</kwd><kwd>retinitis pigmentosa</kwd><kwd>blindness</kwd><kwd>artificial vision</kwd><kwd>bionic vision</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration are diseases that predominantly affect photoreceptors of the retina and cause progressive vision loss&#x02014;leading eventually to blindness in over 15 million people worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C1">1</xref>]. Although blindness owing to photoreceptor degeneration presently remains incurable, inner retinal nerve cells may continue to function for many years despite neuronal remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C2">2</xref>]. While gene therapy and application of neuro-protective factors may help maintain vision in the early stages of degeneration, survival of the inner retina encouraged us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C3">3</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C11">11</xref>] to attempt a partial restoration of visual function using electric stimulation of the remaining retinal network.</p><p>Two fundamentally different approaches have been taken in this area: (i) implantation of electrode arrays which interface epiretinally with retinal ganglion cells that form the retinal output pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C13">13</xref>], and (ii) implantation of microchips under the transparent retina to substitute the degenerated photoreceptors. The latter type of microchip senses light and generates stimulation signals simultaneously at many pixel locations, using microphotodiode arrays (MPDAs; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C14">14</xref>]). While the first approach typically requires external image and data processing due to bypassing retinal image analysis, the second seeks to replace the function of degenerated photoreceptors directly by translating the light of the image falling onto the retina point by point into small currents that are proportional to the light stimulus. Ours is the only approach where the photodiode&#x02013;amplifier&#x02013;electrode set is contained within a single pixel of the MPDA such that each electrode provides an electrical stimulus to the remaining neurons nearby, thereby reflecting the visual signal that would normally be received via the corresponding, degenerated photoreceptor.</p><p>On the basis of <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C15">15</xref>] and animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C16">16</xref>] our consortium developed a subretinal electronic implant that carefully accounts for biocompatibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C17">17</xref>], biostability, surgical feasibility by means of a transchoroidal surgical technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C18">18</xref>], safe threshold stimulation and dynamic range of stimulation and the limits of spatial resolution <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C19">19</xref>]. This report describes the results of a clinical pilot study, illustrating that subretinally implanted multi-electrode arrays restore sufficient visual function for object recognition and localization and for the performance of visual tasks essential in the daily lives of blind patients. The results of this pilot study provide strong evidence that the visual functions of patients blinded by a hereditary retinal dystrophy can, in principle, be restored to a degree sufficient for use in daily life.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>The subretinal implant</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20101747F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>a</italic>, the tip of the implant consists of an MPDA with 1500 individual light-sensitive elements and a test field for direct stimulation (DS) with 4 &#x000d7; 4 electrodes for electrical, light-independent stimulation.

Essentially, an image is captured several times per second simultaneously by all photodiodes. Each element (&#x02018;pixel&#x02019;) generates monophasic anodic voltage pulses at its electrode. Thus, pixelized repetitive stimulation is delivered simultaneously by all electrodes to adjacent groups of bipolar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C19">19</xref>], the amount of current provided by each electrode being dependent on the brightness at each photodiode. Light levels ranging across approximately 2 log units are converted to charge pulses by each pixel with a sigmoidal relationship and the sensitivity can be shifted manually by several log units (see electronic supplementary material, chapter 1, figure S1). The chip is estimated to cover a visual angle of approximately 11&#x000b0; by 11&#x000b0; (1&#x000b0; approx. 288 &#x000b5;m on the retina).

The maximum charge density at the electrodes in the DS field was 600 &#x000b5;C cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.

The polyimide foil was then protected by a silicone tube and guided from the lateral orbital rim, where it was fixed, to the equator of the eye. Subsequently pars plana vitrectomy was performed. A localized retinal detachment was created by saline injection in the upper temporal quadrant above the planned scleral and choroidal incision area. After preparation of a scleral flap, the implant was advanced <italic>ab externo</italic> transchoroidally along a guiding foil into the subretinal space until it reached the preoperatively defined position ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C22">22</xref>]; see electronic supplementary material, chapter 2<italic>d</italic>). Although putting a chip directly under the fovea has not turned out to be a surgical problem we had abstained in initial patients from placing the chip under the macula, but asked to place the chip closer and closer to the foveola as the surgical learning curve improved. Silicone oil was then injected into the vitreous cavity to support retinal reattachment. No serious adverse events were noted during the course of the study.

Chow <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C27">27</xref>] were the first to subretinally implant well-tolerated multiphotodiode arrays, intending to use the energy created by incident light for neuronal stimulation directly without amplification. However, owing to insufficient energy from the small light sensors these failed to restore vision. Second Sight (Medical Products Inc., Sylmar, CA) has a multicentre study running with the epiretinal ARGUS II device with 60 electrodes; some patients were reported to recognize large single letters by scanning them with rapid head movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C28">28</xref>]. Clinical studies with epiretinal electrode arrays were also performed by Koch <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C29">29</xref>] and Richard <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C30">30</xref>]. Other groups developed approaches with electrodes placed between sclera and choroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C10">10</xref>]. These groups argue that this &#x02018;suprachoroidal&#x02019; approach may have the benefit of being less invasive, therefore bearing fewer risks in terms of surgical procedures. At this time, as only limited peer-reviewed information is available from ongoing clinical trials using subretinal, epiretinal and suprachoroidal approaches, it is too early to compare the final long-term outcome of the various designs. All have inherent theoretical advantages and disadvantages; basic differences and their consequences are pointed out in the following.</p><p><italic>Epiretinal implants</italic> seek to interact directly with the retinal output neurons; the image processing of the complex inner retinal network must be performed externally. The processing of camera-captured images can be more easily adjusted to account for individual electrode thresholds. However, the number of simultaneously addressed electrodes is limited by present technology. Several groups have developed externally powered, fully implantable epiretinal systems with arrays of up to 60 microelectrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C32">32</xref>]. Although they have reported promising results, even for long term use, the low number of electrodes limit visual performance to object localization and shape perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C33">33</xref>]. Yanai <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C6">6</xref>] reported no difference in patient performance when a single pixel or multiple pixels were activated using a prototype of the ARGUS I implant. In <italic>epiretinal</italic> implants that use head mounted cameras, eye movements are not correlated to the visually perceived scene. Such a mismatch of visual and proprioceptive information must render object localization difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C34">34</xref>].</p><p><italic>Subretinal approaches</italic>, in contrast, replace in principle only the lost function of diseased photoreceptors; thus, the remaining network of the inner retina can be used for more natural processing of the image as it is forwarded, point&#x02013;by-point, several times per second to inner retinal neurons. Although the surgical procedure may be more demanding, the number of pixels can be much higher, presently limited only by the size of an implant and the spatial spread of electrical stimulation. Fixation of the chip in the subretinal space is easier and, once positioned, the chip remains in place, tightly connected to the inner retina without the need for scleral tacks as used in epiretinal approaches. Moreover, our subretinal implant (Retina Implant AG, Reutlingen, Germany) is the only one so far, where the image receiver array moves exactly with the eye. This has practical implications, outlined below, as natural eye movements can be used to find and fixate a target. On the other hand, the duration of our study was limited owing to time constraints of a transdermal cable; other studies have reported longer implantation times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C33">33</xref>]. Moreover, the range of variations in online image processing is small in devices that work quasi-autonomously under the retina.</p><p><italic>Suprachoroidal implants</italic>, although bearing lower surgical risks, are located further away from target cells. This may result in high stimulation thresholds, increased power consumption, and certainly loss of spatial resolution. While the surgery is easier and less invasive, the location between highly light absorbing sclera and choroid does not allow the implantation of a light sensitive array that moves with the eye.</p><p>In the following sections, the results obtained in our subretinal study are discussed in more detail.</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><label>(b)</label><title>The spatial domain</title><p>Using simulated prosthetic vision Perez <italic>et al</italic>.

Thus, at least several hundred electrodes should be employed to provide significant vision&#x02014;a daunting technical barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C35">35</xref>]. The present study&#x02014;the first to successfully employ electronic arrays with such a large number of electrodes&#x02014;presents proof-of-concept that such devices can restore useful vision in blind human subjects, even though the ultimate goal of broad clinical application will take time to develop.</p><p>The size of the visual field (11&#x000b0; &#x000d7; 11&#x000b0;) in our patients, although small, is sufficient for orientation and object localization, as is well established in patients with peripheral retinal dystrophies.

Clearly spatial reorganization of the retina takes place; however, it is very slow, taking decades. As the inner retina is not dependent on choroidal perfusion, it also survives the complete loss of the choroid&#x02014;as seen in our patient with choroideraemia. This also explains why blockage of choroido-retinal transport by our implant does not affect survival of the inner retina.</p><p>In our study, precise localization of the microelectrode array under the fovea appeared important for the restoration of useful percepts via spatially ordered electrical stimulation. High spatial resolution and the ability to read are restricted in normal observers to the central retina (5&#x000b0; &#x000d7; 3&#x000b0;), which is significantly over-represented in the visual cortex relative to more peripheral areas of the retina.</p></sec><sec id="s6c"><label>(c)</label><title>The temporal domain and the problem of image fading</title><p>Temporal resolution was investigated over a range from 1 to 20 Hz. When applying continuous electrical stimuli via the <italic>DS-array</italic> at a fixed retinal location with PD of 1&#x02013;4 ms, patient percepts faded after approximately 15 s when presented at a 0.3 Hz repetition rate; after approx. 2 s at 2 Hz; and after approx. 0.5 s at 10 Hz. This is in close accordance with the observations of Perez <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C37">37</xref>] with <italic>epiretinal</italic> ARGUS II devices that an image stabilized on the retina quickly disappears; to restore the image required a movement of the image across the retina, by means of rapid head shaking. Similarly, Jensen &#x00026; Rizzo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C38">38</xref>] observed in rabbit retina that the retinal response to a second or third electrical pulse rapidly decreases as compared to the first pulse with increasing repetition rates; apparently inner retina neurons suffer from a prolonged inhibition if stimulated electrically under conditions where the surrounding network under the electrode is being activated as a whole. By contrast, objects like grating patterns or letters can be perceived continuously with our light sensitive <italic>subretinal MPDA</italic>. Patients see the image constantly as a complete entity without head movements&#x02014;even on the first day of stimulation. The source of this difference can be found in involuntary eye movements controlled by the superior colliculus. Even during fixation, our eyes continuously make slight movements (slow drifts and microsaccades up to 50 min of arc and 1 to 3 Hz) that refresh the image by constantly changing the activated photoreceptor population&#x02014;even during strict fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="RSPB20101747C39">39</xref>]. Objects viewed by our patients&#x02014;with the chip moving in synchronization with natural eye movement&#x02014;dynamically activate a range of adjacent pixels on the chip, as eye movements and microsaccades continuously shift the &#x02018;electrical image&#x02019; on the retina for about 1&#x02013;3 pixels, thus preventing mechanisms of local adaptation and image fading.

This may be one reason for the correct retinotopic perceptions reported in this study, since local excitation of small groups of bipolar cells is recognized in the brain at the correct position in the visual field. By contrast, epiretinal stimulation of ganglion cell fibres may result in disparities between stimulation location and perceived visual field location because the axons of RGCs course across the retina on their way into the brain via the optic nerve.

Practising with the MPDA between 4 to 6 h daily, they had to learn to control their eye position because each object was presented within a relatively small field of vision (11&#x000b0; &#x000d7; 11&#x000b0;). Patient 2 reported that the two lines of the letter L were initially moving slightly independently of each other, but that they appeared connected at the corner after approximately one week.

We also anticipate that lateral processing in terms of mutual inhibition of pixels, as performed in centre-surround receptive field processing will improve contrast vision and spatial resolution.

Despite all remaining biological and technical challenges, our results offer hope that restoration of vision in the blind with electronic retinal prostheses is a feasible way to help those who cannot profit from emerging gene therapy and/or the application of neuroprotective agents. The advantage of our approach is that all parts of the device can be implanted invisibly in the body, that inner retina processing can be used and that a continuous, stable image with unmatched spatial resolution is perceived. Still further development is necessary to provide long term stability, improved contrast, spatial resolution and increased field size through multiple chip implantation. Nevertheless, the present study provides proof-of-concept that electronic subretinal devices have the potential to improve visual function from a state of complete blindness to one of low vision that allows localization and recognition of objects up to reading capability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to all who contributed to the &#x02018;SUBRET&#x02019; project; for names of contributors, funding organizations and disclosure of interest we refer to electronic supplementary material.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="RSPB20101747C1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Congdon</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Colmain</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Klaver</surname><given-names>C.
