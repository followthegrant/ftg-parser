Human foetal femur derived skeletal stem cells (SSCs) display enhanced proliferation and multipotential capacity indicating excellent potential as candidates for tissue engineering applications. This study has examined the expression and role of miRs in human foetal femur derived SSC differentiation along chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages. Cells isolated from the epiphyseal region of the foetal femur expressed higher levels of genes associated with chondrogenesis while cells from the foetal femur diaphyseal region expressed higher levels of genes associated with osteogenic differentiation. In addition to the difference in osteogenic and chondrogenic gene expression, epiphyseal and diaphyseal cells displayed distinct miRs expression profiles. miR-146a was found to be expressed by human foetal femur diaphyseal cells at a significantly enhanced level compared to epiphyseal populations and was predicted to target various components of the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway. Examination of miR-146a function in foetal femur cells confirmed regulation of protein translation of SMAD2 and SMAD3, important TGF-&#x003b2; and activin ligands signal transducers following transient overexpression in epiphyseal cells. The down-regulation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 following overexpression of miR-146a resulted in an up-regulation of the osteogenesis related gene RUNX2 and down-regulation of the chondrogenesis related gene SOX9. The current findings indicate miR-146a plays an important role in skeletogenesis through attenuation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 function and provide further insight into the role of miRs in human skeletal stem cell differentiation modulation with implications therein for bone reparation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work carried out in this manuscript was supported by a strategic longer and larger grant (sLOLA) from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council UK (BB/G010579/1).

The process of skeletogensis is orchestrated by various factors including transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0098063-Pratap1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, micro environmental signals and epigenetic cues <xref rid="pone.0098063-Zimmermann1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098063-Suomi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Defects in the regulators of skeletogensis results in skeletal dysplasias, growth failure <xref rid="pone.0098063-Michigami1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A clearer understanding of skeletal stem and bone cell formation and function is critical to inform bone formation strategies and subsequently restore the function of the skeletal system. The cell responsible for bone formation, the osteoblast, is derived from a multipotential marrow stromal stem cell termed the mesenchymal stem cell (undifferentiated multipotent cells of the mesenchyme) which has gained wide acceptance, however this term is non-specific and the term skeletal stem cell (SSC) will be applied to restrict description to stem cells from bone able to generate all skeletal tissues.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of non-protein coding small RNA molecules of 21&#x02013;25 nucleotides in length. Along with the RNA-induce-silencing complex (RICS), they possess the ability to regulate protein translation by inhibiting their target mRNAs function <xref rid="pone.0098063-Pillai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. There are cumulative evidences to suggest miRs plays an important role in many cellular processes including cell cycle and stem cell differentiation <xref rid="pone.0098063-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098063-Ivanovska1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Various miRs have already been identified to play a role in SSC differentiation, a recent review by Lian <italic>et al</italic> have summarized the effects of 42 miRs on osteoblast differentiation through targeting various cells signaling pathways such as Wnt and TGF-&#x003b2;, transcription factors such as RUNX2 and Osterix and epigenetic machineries such as histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) <xref rid="pone.0098063-Lian1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Data gathered through proteomic approach have demonstrated that a single miR can repress the production of hundreds of proteins, however, the effect of a single miR on protein translation is surprisingly small <xref rid="pone.0098063-Baek1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, therefore it can be difficult to determine how a single miR is able to provoke a detectable functional change.</p><p>Human foetal femur derived SSC have been shown to contain stromal antigens positive cells with the potential to differentiate down osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages when treated with appropriate culture conditions <xref rid="pone.0098063-MirmalekSani1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, foetal femur cell populations have been shown to possess enhanced renewing, differentiation and immunoprivilege potentials, indicating their potential as a cell source for tissue engineering applications <xref rid="pone.0098063-MirmalekSani1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098063-Tuch1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, cells isolated from the foetal femur comprise a heterogeneous population of cells with differing affinity and capacity for chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation <xref rid="pone.0098063-Developmental1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> all of which has served to limit their clinical translation.</p><p>A number of growth factors, signaling molecules and transcription factors have been shown to affect skeletal stem cell and osteoprogenitor cell activity including members of the Wnt and TGF-&#x003b2; families <xref rid="pone.0098063-Baek2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098063-DAY1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, a number of miRs have been reported to be involved in the regulation of osteogenesis and chondrogenesis through their ability to regulate transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0098063-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Thus, miR-140 has been identified as a cartilage specific miR capable of promoting chondrogenic differentiation by increasing the expression of RUNX2, a gene important in chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation, through down-regulating HDAC4 <xref rid="pone.0098063-Swingler1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098063-Tuddenham1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. More recently, miR-138 was reported by Eskilden and coworkers to be a negative regulator of osteogenic differentiation through inhibition of the expression of Osterix (OSX) via targeting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) <xref rid="pone.0098063-Eskildsen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Thus an understanding of the interactions of specific miRs with signaling pathways and growth factors that modulate bone cell function offers new strategies to manipulate and modulate SSC differentiation enhancing our understanding of bone physiology and function critical in any reparative approach.</p><p>The current study has examined the expression of miRs within human foetal femur derived diaphyseal and epiphyseal populations. Following identification of select miRs, function was examined using transient overexpression analysis for chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation. We demonstrate that cells isolated from the epiphyseal regions of the developing foetal femur expressed higher levels of chondrogenic related genes while cells from the diaphyseal region expressed genes associated with osteogenesis. Using RT-qPCR methods, we have confirmed the expression of stromal antigens CD63, ALCAM and putative stem cell marker Nucleostemin by both epiphyseal and diaphyseal cells. MicroRNA microarray analysis confirmed differential miR expression in epiphyseal and diaphyseal populations. Furthermore, putative target and functional analysis demonstrated that miR-146a affected skeletal cell differentiation by down-regulation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 protein translation, genes known to be involved in the activation of chondrogenesis <xref rid="pone.0098063-Furumatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The current findings indicate an important role of miR-146a, in conjunction with other miRs already described in literature during skeletogenesis and will inform our understanding of bone development and reparation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Human foetal tissue was obtained with informed and written consent from women undergoing termination of pregnancy procedure according to guidelines issued by the Polkinghorne Report.

Using Targetscan release 6, potential mRNA targets of miR-146a were identified <xref rid="pone.0098063-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Various components of the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway; namely SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4, TGFB-induced factor homeobox 1 (TGIF1), BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor homolog (BAMBI) and activin A receptor type IC/I/Type II-like 1 (ACVR1C/ACVR1B/ACVRL1) were highlighted as potential targets of miR-146a, advocating the function of this miR in diaphyseal cells maybe mediated via attenuation of the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway <xref rid="pone.0098063-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. miR-146 has previously been identified to modulate myofibroblast trans-differentiation during TGF-&#x003b2;1 induction by targeting SMAD4 <xref rid="pone.0098063-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098063-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and miR-146 may also be an important regulator during the inflammatory state of osteoarthritis, as IL-1&#x003b2; induced production of TNF-&#x003b1;, a pro-inflammatory cytokine known to play a role in osteoarthritis, was significantly reduced by miR-146 overexpression <xref rid="pone.0098063-Swingler1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098063-Tuddenham1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098063-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-146a has been shown to protect the human bronchial epithelial from apoptosis and to promote cell proliferation through up-regulation of Bcl-XL and STAT3 phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0098063-Eskildsen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098063-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>miR-146a transient overexpression in epiphyseal cells (low level expression of miR-146a compared to diaphyseal cells under normal culture conditions) for 48 hours resulted in a significant down-regulation of SMAD3 at the mRNA level with reduction of SMAD2 and SMAD3 protein level at 72 hours, evidenced by western bolt analysis. Concomitant with the reduced SMAD2 and SMAD3 levels observed, reduced expression of the chondrogenesis related gene SOX9 and up-regulation of the osteogenesis related gene RUNX2 was observed. These data suggest miR-146a is a negative regulator of chondrogenesis through down-regulation of SMAD2/SMAD3 and may indirectly promote osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, as over-expression of miR-146a resulted in a significant negative effect on chondrogenesis in culture over a 48&#x02013;72-hour period, the effect of miR-146a under normal physiological conditions would appear to be significant. To optimize our transfection protocol, miR mimics against GAPDH were used and shown to reduce GAPDH expression by over 80% after 48 hours post transfection. However, miR inhibitors were found to have display a much lower efficacy. Coupled with the high expression of miR-146a in diaphyseal cells, it proved difficult to reproducibly demonstrate the effects of miR-146a inhibitor on human foetal diaphyseal cells.</p><p>In the current study, we observed that cells extracted from the epiphyseal and diaphyseal regions of a developing human foetal femur retain their progenitor cell characteristics, evidenced by the expression of CD63, ALCAM and Nucleostemin mRNA, but exhibit different and distinct phenotypes and display discrete affinities in differentiation along the osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages.

These data suggests the chondrogenic epiphyseal cell population expressed increased levels of miRs associated with chondrogenesis while the osteogenic diaphyseal cells expressed miRs associated with osteogenesis.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is important for skeletogenesis. It is generally accepted that the bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and their receptors induce early cartilage formation and stimulate mesenchymal cells to differentiate into osteoblasts whilst TGF-&#x003b2; ligands and their receptors regulate chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation <xref rid="pone.0098063-MirmalekSani1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098063-Yang3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In the current study, the effect of TGF-&#x003b2;3 stimulation in monolayer culture model were consistent with current literature with TGF-&#x003b2;3 stimulated cells differentiating to give hypertrophic chondrocytes coupled with a significant up-regulation of Type X collagen mRNA expression <xref rid="pone.0098063-Eskildsen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098063-Miyaki1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098063-Yang3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. TGF-&#x003b2;s signals are known to be transduced to the nuclei by the intracellular mediators, SMADs <xref rid="pone.0098063-Moustakas1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. To date, eight different SMAD proteins have been identified, classified into three categories based on their functions; the receptor-activated SMADs (SMAD- 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8), common mediator SMAD (SMAD4) and the inhibitory SMADs (SMAD6 and 7) <xref rid="pone.0098063-Moustakas1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The receptor-activated SMADs are further divided into two groups based on their attachment to ligand specific receptors; SMAD2 and 3 transduce signal by TGF-&#x003b2;s and activin ligands while SMAD1, 5 and 8 respond to BMPs stimulation <xref rid="pone.0098063-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. As SMAD2 and SMAD3 are known to transduce TGF-&#x003b2; ligand signals <xref rid="pone.0098063-Hellingman1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, the effect of miR-146a on the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway was examined through analysis of the effects of miR-146a transient overexpression on cells stimulated by TGF-&#x003b2;3. In the absence of miR-146a overexpression, TGF-&#x003b2;3 was observed to up-regulate the expression of Type X collagen 2000-fold. However, following transfection with miR-146a mimic, TGF-&#x003b2;3 induced up-regulation of collagen X was reduced by over 60%. These results suggest miR-146a attenuates the TGF-&#x003b2;3 ligand signal, and possibly activin signals, through down-regulation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 protein. Interestingly, when cells were stimulated with TGF-&#x003b2;3, a reduction of miR-146a expression was observed. The current data indicate the presence of a negative feedback mechanism between TGF-&#x003b2;3 stimulation and miR-146a expression advocating the presence of an auto-regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098063-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Thus miR-146a may reduce TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and in turn TGF-&#x003b2;3 stimulation may suppress miR-146a expression. A similar auto-regulatory feedback mechanism has also been described for the regulation of miR-93 and downstream Osterix expression during osteoblast mineralization <xref rid="pone.0098063-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> as well as for miR-140 on TGF-&#x003b2; signaling through SMAD3 suppression <xref rid="pone.0098063-Pais1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0098063-g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0098063.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Modulation of skeletal cell differentiation by miR-146a.</title><p>miR-146a down-regulated SMAD2 and SMAD3 protein levels, resulting in an attenuation of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling following TGF-&#x003b2;3 stimulation.

Overexpression of miR-146a under basal condition revealed a modest, but positive effect on osteogenesis related gene expression and is likely part of a miR network involved in promoting osteogenesis.

These studies demonstrate various miRs may work in concert to regulate the complex mechanisms underlying SSC differentiation. Together with the distinct expression patterns observed in epiphyseal and diaphyseal cell populations, the data in this study suggests, by extracting cells from distinct regions of the human foetal femur, a more homogenous skeletal stem cell population can be isolated, providing an innovative approach for identification of novo miRs involved in skeletal stem cell differentiation and skeletogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This report has further characterized foetal derived SSC found in foetal femur by assessing differentiation related gene expression and miR expression profile in epiphyseal and diaphyseal cells.

Further functional analysis to define the precise role of miR-146a and other miR targets identified in the epiphyseal and diaphyseal cell populations could provide a novel strategy to manipulate SCC differentiation in regenerative medicine applications.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0098063-Karsenty1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
