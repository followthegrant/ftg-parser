This study aims to determine whether the combined results of the vaccine trials published to date provide evidence of efficacy compared with control (hepatitis A vaccine/placebo).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and references of identified studies. The bivalent vaccine containing HPV-16 and 18 VLPs from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (Rixenstart, Belgium), the quadrivalent vaccine containing HPV-6, 11, 16, and 18 VLPs from Merck &#x00026; Co., Inc., (Whitehouse Station, NJ USA), and the HPV-16 monovalent vaccine from Merck Research Laboratories (West Point, PA USA) were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Three RCT reports and two post-trial cohort studies were eligible, comprising data from 13,482 women who were included in the vaccine studies but had evidence of HPV infection at study entry. Data on efficacy was synthesized using the Mantel-Haenszel weighted fixed-effect approach, or where there was heterogeneity between studies, the DerSimonian and Laird weighted random-effect approach. The mean odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between <italic>Cervarix</italic>, <italic>Gardasil</italic> and HPV-16 monovalent vaccine and HPV-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse was 0&#x000b7;90 (95% CI: 0&#x000b7;56, 1&#x000b7;44). For the association between <italic>Gardasil</italic> and HPV-associated vulval/vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2&#x02013;3, the overall OR and 95% CI was 2.25 (95% CI: 0&#x000b7;78, 6.50). Sample size and follow-up were limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>There was no evidence that HPV vaccines are effective in preventing vaccine-type HPV associated pre-cancer in women with evidence of prior HPV exposure.

The present study aims to determine whether the combined results of the L1-VLP-based HPV vaccine efficacy trials published to date provide evidence that anogenital pre-cancer incidence rates are also reduced in women with evidence of prior vaccine-type HPV exposure. In order to do so, we conducted a systematic review and performed a meta-analysis of published data relating to HPV-exposed women participants. This review was planned to look at vaccine efficacy specifically against HPV-16/18 associated anogenital pre-cancer in women with evidence of prior exposure to types 16 and/or 18. However, it was only possible to analyse vaccine efficacy against vaccine-type HPV-associated anogenital pre-cancer in women with evidence of prior exposure to vaccine and non-vaccine (high-risk) HPV types combined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of relevant studies</title><p>A systematic search was undertaken of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify RCTs of prophylactic HPV vaccination published up to 30 August 2013.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria; overlap in patient populations across studies</title><p>RCT reports and post-RCT follow-on cohort studies published in English that investigated L1-VLP-based vaccine efficacy against vaccine-type HPV-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) or vulval/vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2-3 (VIN2-3/VaIN2-3) were reviewed. Studies providing data on the sub-group of women with evidence of prior vaccine-type HPV exposure, in the total vaccinated cohort (TVC) and the total vaccinated cohort-na&#x000ef;ve (TVC-na&#x000ef;ve), were eligible for inclusion.

It is difficult to distinguish a re-infection in DNA-negative women, regardless of serostatus, from a &#x02018;reactivation&#x02019; of previously undetectable, low-level viral persistence in basal cells. In addition, if seroconversion is detected in vaccinated women, who were DNA-positive but seronegative at baseline, the presence of antibodies could be due to a re-infection, delayed seroconversion to the original infection or response to vaccine.

Among women evaluated for vaccine efficacy against HPV-16/18 associated anogenital pre-cancer, it was possible to derive a sub-group of women with evidence of prior exposure (according to our criteria) to high-risk HPV types 16 and/or 18.

Therefore, vaccine efficacy against vaccine-type HPV-associated anogenital pre-cancer in women with evidence of prior exposure to a range of low- to high-risk HPV types was analysed.</p><p>Women from three trials, who were seropositive for one or more of HPV-6/11/16/18 but DNA-negative at baseline, contributed data twice to the CIN3+ and the VIN2-3/VaIN2-3 analysis. <xref rid="pone.0090348-FUTURE2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090348-Villa2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090348-Garland1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> In both analyses, the combined analysis that included women who were DNA-positive at baseline reported no information on the number of evaluable women in the TVC who were seropositive and DNA-negative at baseline and their corresponding outcome data.<xref rid="pone.0090348-FUTURE1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090348-Joura2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

However, there are several limitations to this review. The trials included were not designed or powered to evaluate the effect of vaccination in women with evidence of prior vaccine-type HPV exposure. There have been no RCTs to date that have been designed to investigate the effect of vaccination in previously exposed women. For example, the PATRICIA trial was designed to assess vaccine efficacy in women who were HPV-DNA-negative and seronegative at baseline.<xref rid="pone.0090348-Paavonen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> However, previously exposed women (DNA and/or seropositive) were not excluded at enrolment, and an analysis of this group has suggested that there is protection against re-infection. Castellsagu&#x000e9; et al. reported a 66.9% (95% CI: 4.3, 90.6) quadrivalent vaccine efficacy against vaccine-type persistent infection (there were no cases of CIN or external genital lesions) in women seropositive and DNA-negative for HPV-6/11/16/18.<xref rid="pone.0090348-Castellsague1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> Among women who were DNA-negative and seropositive for HPV-16/18, bivalent vaccine efficacy against vaccine-type infection that was persistent for at least 6-months, was 72.3% (95% CI: 53.0, 84.5).<xref rid="pone.0090348-Szarewski1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> However, the statistical power of these sub-group analyses is low. In the PATRICIA trial, less than 20% of women in the TVC were eligible for inclusion in this analysis.</p><p>The endpoints investigated in this review were rare. The annual event rate is 0&#x000b7;19% for HPV-16 related and 0&#x000b7;038% for HPV-18 related cervical pre-cancer. VIN2-3/VaIN2-3 lesions were even less frequent.<xref rid="pone.0090348-Einstein1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090348-Paavonen2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> Even combining sub-groups of women (with all sub-categories of exposure i.e. DNA and/or seropositive) in this meta-analysis did not provide sufficient events to be sure of identifying a modest difference between the vaccine and control/placebo group arms over 3&#x02013;4 years.</p><p>This meta-analysis was not able to look at the efficacy of vaccination on virological endpoints in previously exposed women. The efficacy of vaccine to prevent re-infection in seropositive and DNA-negative women, or following transient infection in DNA-positive women over 3&#x02013;4 years is an important question. However, the absence of a reliable method to distinguish vaccine from natural antibody precluded us from investigating it in this meta-analysis.</p><p>Due to the design of the studies included, it was also possible to analyse CIN grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) as the endpoint, which would increase the number of events over 3&#x02013;4 years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090348.s002">Table S2</xref>). However CIN2+ is not as strongly associated with high-risk HPV types.<xref rid="pone.0090348-FUTURE1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090348-Lehtinen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> The analysis showed no statistically significant reduction in CIN2+ incidence in vaccine recipients compared with control/placebo recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090348-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0090348-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0090348.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Odds of new diagnosis of CIN2+.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0090348.g007"/></fig><p>An analysis of women with HPV-associated anogenital disease in the TVC has suggested that vaccine provides protection against recurrent disease. Among all women who underwent definitive cervical therapy in the FUTURE I and II studies, quadrivalent vaccination was associated with a 64.9% (95% CI: 20.1%, 86.3%) reduction in the rate of any subsequent CIN2+.<xref rid="pone.0090348-Joura1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> A recent study investigated whether quadrivalent vaccination after treatment with loop electrosurgical excision for CIN2-3 is effective in preventing recurrent disease. Among patients who had CIN2-3 associated with vaccine HPV types, the control group had a significantly higher recurrence rate than the vaccination group (8.5% and 2.5% respectively); p&#x0003c;0.05).<xref rid="pone.0090348-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Although HPV vaccination trials did not include HPV testing (DNA or serology) or clinical examination before randomization, women with a prior history of HPV-related disease were excluded from enrolment. Therefore, trials conducted to date cannot measure the efficacy of the vaccine in women who have undergone treatment before vaccination to investigate a potential reduction in the risk of any subsequent high-grade disease. There is a need to design trials to answer this question.</p><p>Furthermore, pre-cancer typically takes 5&#x02013;10 years to develop from incident infection,<xref rid="pone.0090348-Munoz1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090348-Paavonen2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> whereas the follow-up available in the combined analyses and post-RCT follow-on cohort studies was 3-4 years. If a second incident infection with the same HPV type as the women had been exposed to at baseline did occur it could still take many years before women experienced precancerous lesions. This would suggest that the duration of follow-up available in the combined analyses and post-RCT follow-on cohort studies in this meta-analysis is too short to detect an effect of HPV vaccination on disease from re-infection in HPV-exposed women. Whether vaccination will provide long-term benefit in this sub-group by protecting against re-infections and subsequent disease will require further investigations with longer follow-up.</p><p>Finally, not all women in the VIN2-3/VaIN2-3 analysis were evaluated for vaccine efficacy against VIN2-3/VaIN2-3 associated with one or more of the types to which they were exposed (HPV-6/11/16/18). Women from one combined analysis who had evidence of HPV-6/11 exposure prior to vaccination would not have been at risk for HPV-16/18 associated VIN2-3/VaIN2-3.<xref rid="pone.0090348-Joura2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> In the CIN3+ analysis women in two combined analyses who had evidence of HPV-6/11 exposure prior to vaccination were included.<xref rid="pone.0090348-FUTURE1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090348-Olsson3" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> Women from one of the combined analyses were evaluated for vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ associated with HPV-6/11/16/18.

</p><p>Therefore, this review was a refinement of the TVC in terms of exposed women, but it did not conclusively assess the effect of L1-VLP-based vaccination against vaccine-type HPV-associated anogenital pre-cancer in women who had been at risk for the endpoint prior to vaccination. Moreover, some patients (though proportionately not many) were double counted in the meta-analysis. Finally, the estimation of variance can be imprecise in a DerSimonian and Laird model with very small numbers of included publications. Findings should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was no evidence from this analysis that HPV vaccines given to women with evidence of prior vaccine-type HPV exposure can prevent premalignant lesions related to these HPV types over a 3&#x02013;4 year time frame. Given the number of events, a small effect of vaccination however cannot be excluded and this review could not address the issue of efficacy against recurrent infection. Further studies are warranted to investigate these issues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0090348.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
