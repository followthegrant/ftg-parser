We therefore speculated that inhibition of hypoxia-induced microglial activation may alleviate neuronal damage. To test this hypothesis, we co-cultured ginsenoside Rb1, an active component of ginseng, and cortical neurons. Ginsenoside Rb1 protected neuronal morphology and structure in a single hypoxic culture system and in a hypoxic co-culture system with microglia, and reduced neuronal apoptosis and caspase-3 production. The protective effect was observable prior to placing in co-culture. Additionally, ginsenoside Rb1 inhibited levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; in a co-culture system containing activated N9 microglial cells. Ginsenoside Rb1 also significantly decreased nitric oxide and superoxide production induced by N9 microglia. Our findings indicate that ginsenoside Rb1 attenuates damage to cerebral cortex neurons by downregulation of nitric oxide, superoxide, and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; expression in hypoxia-activated microglia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>nerve regeneration</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>traditional Chinese medicine</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>ischemia/hypoxia</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>microglia</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>neurons</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>apoptosis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>ginsenoside Rb1</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>nerve inflammation factor</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>NSFC grant</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>neural regeneration</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rat brain neurons are highly sensitive to ischemia; neuronal apoptosis occurs in the early stages of cerebral ischemia, with the reduction in neuronal number and neurotransmitter levels affecting learning and memory[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Microglia account for 5&#x02013;20% of total glial cells and play an important role in the regulation of neuronal function and in the maintenance of the microenvironment. Microglia are the first cells to be injured following a central nervous system insult. Cerebral ischemia induces excess activation of microglia, a complex reaction involving intracellular and extracellular ion imbalance, neurotransmitter disorders, and expression of a variety of soluble inflammatory cytokines[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These manifestations have a unique temporal and spatial pattern, accompanied by changes at the molecular level[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Early hypoxia can induce microglial proliferation and the activated microglia release free radicals, inflammatory cytokines, superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and proinflammatory substances such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) and inducible nitric oxide synthase. These factors promote neuronal injury and apoptosis, and aggravate ischemic stroke; in addition, hypoxia leads to changes in microglial mitochondrial structure and function[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Liu et al.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found that neurons in different brain regions exhibited different responses to hypoxia-ischemia, and microglial cell morphology varied significantly. We propose that the extent of microglial activation correlates with neuronal damage, and that activated microglia and apoptotic neurons are mainly localized to the peri-infarct zone. Indeed, similar responses are seen in cerebral ischemia-induced microglial activation that occurs before neuronal apoptosis[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The involvement of microglia in ischemic neuronal apoptosis can be observed through changes in expression time and distribution. Activated microglia-mediated inflammation promotes neuronal damage under cerebral hypoxic-ischemic conditions, so it is likely that inhibiting hypoxia-induced activation of microglia will alleviate neuronal damage.</p><p>Ginsenoside Rb1 has anti-aging, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties in neurons, and restores and promotes neuronal regeneration[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

(2) After 12 hours of hypoxia, microglial medium alone can inhibit the growth and proliferation of normally cultured cortical neurons in Sprague-Dawley rats, and trigger neuronal apoptosis, while the co-culture with hypoxia medium aggravates the decline of neuronal viability and apoptosis. (3) In a co-culture system containing hypoxic microglia, the production of NO, O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and TNF-&#x003b1; was higher than that in normal microglial single- or co-culture, and normal hypoxic neuronal culture systems.

From these preliminary results, we hypothesized that neuronal damage can be alleviated by regulating hypoxia-activated microglia. Therefore, in the present study, we added ginsenoside Rb1 to microglia and cortical neurons in a co-culture system in an effort to explore the role of, and mechanism underlying, cerebral cortical neuronal injury mediated by hypoxia-activated microglia.</p><p>Ginsenoside Rb1 is a class of ginseng monomer[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Previous studies have found that ginsenoside Rb1/Rg1 can alleviate impairments in learning and memory, and regulate the cholinergic system in a variety of experimental animal models. In addition, ginsenoside Rb1/Rg1 exerts a protective effect on dopamine neurons by reducing the stress response induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl 2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridine, and also alleviates tau hyperphosphorylation through regulation of the activities of glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x003b2; and protein phosphatase 2A[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The present study demonstrates the protective effect of ginsenoside Rb1 on the damage to cerebral cortical neurons in rats mediated by hypoxia-activated microglia. The main findings are summarized as follows: (1) Ginsenoside Rb1 protects against neuronal morphology damage and structure in single- and co-culture hypoxic systems. (2) Ginsenoside Rb1 alleviates neuronal apoptosis in alone hypoxia system and hypoxia co-culture system, and its protective effect appears before the neurons are placed in co-culture. (3) Ginsenoside Rb1 enhances the stability of the neuronal cell cycle and alleviates hypoxic injury. (4) Ginsenoside Rb1 reduces caspase-3 production of neurons in single- and co-culture hypoxic systems, and its inhibition effect appears before the co-culture. (5) Ginsenoside Rb1 inhibits the production of TNF-&#x003b1;, NO, and O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> in a hypoxia-activated N9 microglial co-culture system. Together, these results indicate that by downregulating the expression of TNF-&#x003b1;, NO, O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> and other inflammatory mediators in hypoxia-activated microglia, ginsenoside Rb1 regulates inflammation and attenuates neuronal injury.</p><p>In summary, the present study is the first to demonstrate that ginsenoside Rb1 protects rat cerebral cortical neurons against hypoxia-activated microglia-mediated injury, and that the associated mechanism is mediated by the downregulation of NO, O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and TNF-&#x003b1; in hypoxia-activated microglia.
