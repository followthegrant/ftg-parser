For example, the 2011 European Union directive on patients' rights to cross-border health care places a requirement on all member states to provide patients with comparable information on health-care quality, so that they can make an informed choice. Here, we report on the feasibility of using common process and outcome indicators to compare hospitals for quality and safety in five countries (England, Portugal, The Netherlands, Sweden and Norway).</p></sec><sec><title>Main Challenges Identified</title><p>The cross-country comparison identified the following seven challenges with respect to comparing the quality of hospitals across Europe: different indicators are collected in each country; different definitions of the same indicators are used; different mandatory versus voluntary data collection requirements are in place; different types of organizations oversee data collection; different levels of aggregation of data exist (country, region and hospital); different levels of public access to data exist; and finally, hospital accreditation and licensing systems differ in each country.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings indicate that if patients and policymakers are to compare the quality and safety of hospitals across Europe, then further work is urgently needed to agree the way forward. Until then, patients will not be able to make informed choices about where they receive their health care in different countries, and some governments will remain in the dark about the quality and safety of care available to their citizens as compared to that available in neighbouring countries.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>measurement of quality</kwd><kwd>external quality assessment</kwd><kwd>health-care system</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are many reasons why it is important to be able to assess and compare hospitals in terms of quality and safety both within and between countries, for example to help hospitals improve their services and for governments to understand the impact of their policies. As it becomes more common for patients to seek health care in different countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C1">1</xref>], the need for comparative information to enable choice is becoming more important. This has been recognized by the recent European Union (EU) directive on cross-border care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C2">2</xref>], placing responsibility on countries to provide relevant information about the health care they provide to help patients make a choice based on the availability, safety and quality.</p><p>Here, we report on the challenges identified in developing a framework of available indicators and information that could be used to assess hospitals based on the quality and safety in five European countries, considering the issue involved and making recommendations for the future. The countries are England, Portugal, The Netherlands, Sweden and Norway; countries representing variation in important aspects of health care, for example, funding arrangements and health-care quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C3">3</xref>]. Health services research teams working in leading universities in these countries are participating in the EU-funded Quality and Safety in European Hospitals research study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C5">5</xref>], a study in 10 hospitals, 2 in each country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C6">6</xref>] exploring the organizational and contextual factors affecting how hospitals implement quality improvement. The purpose of the selection process for the study was to find hospitals at different stages of the quality journey, rather than only those seen to be doing well.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Indicators available in each country to assess and compare hospitals</title><p>Ten commonly used quality and safety process and outcome indicators were proposed to identify hospitals with different levels of performance in each country, indicators that are widely regarded in the medical field as good practice (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MZS079TB1">1</xref>), including operating on hip fractures within 48 h. The research teams were asked whether the indicators were available; who had access; were they available for every hospital; how robust were the data (including definitions); and what other indicators were available?

In general, these indicators were publicly available, but in Portugal, this was more complicated as described later in this paper, and in all cases, the researchers had to know where to look for the information from different organizations and websites.</p><p>The data for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia were not considered to be helpful in the Netherlands and Sweden, where the rates are very low as compared to the UK, where this indicator is considered very relevant and where until recently, the numbers have been much higher. It was apparent that although available in all countries, these indicators were not directly comparable because of differences in definitions (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MZS079TB2">2</xref>). For example, the surgical site infection rates in some countries are based on 1 day prevalence surveys, whereas in others, surveillance systems operate, which include every patient, and in each country, different surgical procedures are included, some are mandatory, whereas others are voluntary. The indicator of hip fracture treatment ranged from operating within 18 h in Sweden to 48 h in England and was only available for people aged over 65 in Norway.

However, it is not possible to disaggregate the data into regions and hospitals, making individual hospital comparisons impossible. In the last decade, various reforms, such as the merger of hospitals into clusters and changes in the mix of public&#x02013;private ownership, have led to past performance data being lost in the merged groups, and some are only now producing group wide data. Furthermore, hospital organizations have autonomy to choose the processes and outcomes indicators that they use, and these are their exclusive property. In this context, access to good quality performance data was almost impossible in Portugal, and the indicators included in the Performance Evaluation Reports of Public Portuguese Hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C9">9</xref>] were used as a proxy. These reports of raw data have been published annually since 2005 by the National School of Public Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C10">10</xref>], but are not adjusted for age or case mix.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Netherlands</title><p>In the Netherlands, there was a wealth of publicly available data about quality in hospitals, predominantly derived from the information of the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C11">11</xref>] and listed by a newspaper in an annual top 100 hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C12">12</xref>].

In Sweden, the level of aggregation of the data is stronger at the county council level and in the disease-specific quality registries. In Portugal, the information that is collected at the national level is not easy to obtain by region or hospital. In all countries, data on specific procedures or conditions are collected by organizations, including medical societies, but not all make this available to the public.</p><p>The differences in the indicators collected by countries highlight the different policy concerns of those countries. In England, for example, data are available on MRSA infections for each hospital, whereas in Norway, no MRSA hospital level data are available, but data are available on the proportion of patients placed in a bed in a corridor or living room at 7 a.m. Each country also has a different approach to the assessment of hospitals in terms of accreditation or licensing with most having voluntary schemes. Only England has statutory licensing and an &#x02018;annual health check&#x02019; of hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Discussion/conclusions</title><p>The increasing movement of people across borders for health care, whether by choice or circumstance, is driving the need for more transparency about the quality and safety of health care in European hospitals. The new EU directive on patients' rights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C2">2</xref>] places a responsibility on member states to &#x02018;provide relevant information to help individual patients to make an informed choice, including on treatment options, on the availability, quality and safety of the health care they provide&#x02019;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C21">21</xref>].</p><p>In recognition of the requirement for all citizens to have access to high-quality, safe health care, the EU has been engaged in a number of projects to support hospitals in this quest and to find ways of monitoring and measuring this. These include the SIMPATIE project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C22">22</xref>] that reported in 2007 on the development of indicators and outcome measures and a vocabulary for patient safety across Europe. The OECD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C23">23</xref>] and WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C24">24</xref>] have also funded projects to develop indicators for hospital quality and safety. However, the findings here show that despite all this important work, there are very little data available on the quality and safety of hospital care that is comparable between these five countries in Europe, and we anticipate that this is likely to be the case across the EU and in countries outside Europe, where citizens also travel for health care.</p><p>In 2008, the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C25">25</xref>] reported that the EU needs to answer the question of how citizens of Europe can be assured that they will receive high-quality care if they need health care beyond their national frontiers. Both OECD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C26">26</xref>] and the SIMPATIE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZS079C22">22</xref>] project have recommended that the quality of administrative data for health services in the EU needed to improve. Our study indicates that to date these issues have not been addressed and that further work is urgently needed to find a way forward if patients are to have any information to make choices between health-care providers when they travel for treatment in Europe. Clearly, the solution will need to be of low cost with the information easily kept up-to-date. The first step may be for those countries without comparative data about the safety and quality of their hospitals to be required to assemble available information from hospitals within their borders, to analyse this information and place it in the public domain. In the longer term to provide information for comparison between countries, the solution may be to agree to a small set of well-defined indicators to be collected by each hospital organization in Europe with some common standards and methods for assessing these. Alternatively, the solution may be a patient-led hospital equivalent of an internet hotel comparison website such as &#x02018;Trip Advisor&#x02019; (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.tripadvisor.com">www.tripadvisor.com</uri>). In the meantime, patients travelling across the borders for their health care in Europe will not be able to make informed choices about where they receive their health care on any other basis than access, and many governments in Europe will remain in the dark about the quality and safety of care currently available to their citizens in their hospitals as compared to that available elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>The research leading to this paper received funding from <funding-source>the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme</funding-source> (<award-id>FP7/2007&#x02013;2013</award-id>) under grant agreement <award-id>no. 241724</award-id>.
