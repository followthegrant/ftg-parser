Introduction</title><p>There is a long history of using traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of various diseases. It has been recorded that 943 species of toxic plants exist in China, of which more than 500 species are medicinal plants. Moreover, 83 toxic traditional Chinese medicines are included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015 version). However, only 13 of them have been established using analytical methods [<xref rid="B1-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, the severe side effects of toxic constituents from herbs, such as aristolochic acid [<xref rid="B2-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], have aroused people&#x02019;s widespread attention. It is urgent to evaluate toxicities, allowing for a more rational assessment of risks in the clinic application of these medicines. As the main organ of drug metabolism in the body, the liver is more likely to be a target organ damaged by drugs. Studies have shown that herbs were the second cause of drug-induced liver injury in the United States [<xref rid="B3-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, the inappropriate use of herbs may easily induce liver injury, especially in those patients with existing liver diseases [<xref rid="B4-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p><italic>Pterocephalus hookeri</italic> (C. B. Clarke) H&#x000f6;eck was a widely used Tibetan medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the medicinal part being the entire leaves. It has been recorded to have an anti-inflammatory activity for ethanol and aqueous extracts [<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a typical chronic disease, RA needs long-term medication to relieve inflammation and pain, requiring a better understanding of medication guidance and drug safety. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the liver toxicity of extracts from <italic>P. hookeri</italic> (PH) in vivo and in vitro in this study, and further explore the possible toxicological mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-toxins-11-00142"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-toxins-11-00142"><title>2.1. Toxic Effects of PH in Mice</title><p>Body weight is the most intuitive index to reflect health and is used in many research studies [<xref rid="B6-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To evaluate the preliminary toxicity of PH toward mice, body weight was monitored every three days until the 16th day. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f001">Figure 1</xref>, compared with the control group, there was a progressive decrease in weight in the PH group, indicating treatment of 5 g/kg of PH might cause discomfort for mice. Then, the main splanchnic tissues of heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney were evaluated for histological examination by hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The result suggested that the liver section clearly showed inflammation and necrosis in the PH group, compared with the control group. At the same time, less uncertain damage was found in the kidney and lung tissues.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-toxins-11-00142"><title>2.2. Liver Toxicity of EAE and BUE on Carrageenan-Induced Paw Edema in Mice</title><p>Petroleum ether extract (PEE), ethyl acetate extract (EAE), and n-butanol extract (BUE) for <italic>P. hookeri</italic> were applied for anti-inflammatory evaluation in mice. The low (L), middle (M) and high (H) dose of PEE, EAE and BUE were set as 200, 400, 800 mg/kg. The result showed that both EAE and BUE significantly reduced the carrageenan-induced paw edema. However, PEE did not exhibit obvious anti-inflammatory results in this research (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-toxins-11-00142">Table S1</xref>). For liver biochemical indicator detection, the BUE-H group significantly increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), direct bilirubin (DBIL), and total bilirubin (TBIL) in mice, all of which indicated liver injury. However, the EAE groups showed no obvious influences for these compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Liver sections were stained with H&#x00026;E to intuitively evaluate histological changes in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Inflammatory cell infiltration and vascular congestion were observed in the BUE-H group, suggesting necrosis occurred. EAE groups showed no liver toxicity, exhibiting normal cellular structure.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxins-11-00142"><title>2.3. Effects of EAE and BUE on the Expression of NF-&#x003ba;B Signaling Pathway In Vivo</title><p>Protein expression in classic inflammatory nuclear factor-kappa-gene binding (NF-&#x003ba;B) signaling pathway in liver was detected. Phospho-NF-&#x003ba;B (P-NF-&#x003ba;B), NF-&#x003ba;B, and inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B kinase &#x003b1; (IKK&#x003b1;) were significantly increased in BUE groups in comparison with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B) level decreased in BUE groups compared with the control group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). However, there was no significant change in EAE groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-toxins-11-00142"><title>2.4. Effects of EAE and BUE on the Expression of Necrosis-Related Proteins In Vivo</title><p>Cell necrosis caused by exogenous drugs is one of the important causes of liver injury. Thus, we also examined the expression of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) [<xref rid="B7-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3) [<xref rid="B8-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which were the two key proteins that induced activation of necrosis signal. The treatment of BUE induced the stimulatory effects of necrosis on RIP1 and RIP3 levels (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). EAE groups showed no significant regulation of the expression of RIP1 and RIP3. This result was analogous to morphological observation in the liver section.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-toxins-11-00142"><title>2.5. Effect of EAE and BUE on L-02, RAW264.7, and HUVECs</title><p>L-02, RAW264.7, and HUVECs were selected for in vitro toxicity research. As a result, even with the treatment of EAE at the highest dosage (160 &#x003bc;g/mL), these three cells exhibited a slight proliferation inhibitory effect with the IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003e; 160 &#x003bc;g/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f005">Figure 5</xref>A&#x02013;C). However, cell viabilities in BUE groups were decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner, especially at 160 &#x003bc;g/mL, with the IC<sub>50</sub> at 65.63 &#x000b1; 9.18, 66.50 &#x000b1; 11.55, and 94.67 &#x000b1; 11.93 &#x003bc;g/mL, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f005">Figure 5</xref>D&#x02013;F).</p><p>In order to further explore the main cause affecting of cell viability, Z-VAD-FMK [<xref rid="B9-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], 3-methyladenine (3-MA) [<xref rid="B10-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]<styled-content style="color:#080000">,</styled-content> and necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) [<xref rid="B11-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] were used to interfere with cell apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis, respectively. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f006">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;C) showed that in EAE (80 &#x003bc;g/mL) groups, there was no significant influence on the viability of the three cells with the various added inhibitors. Furthermore, the treatment of Z-VAD-FMK and 3-MA exhibited weak changes in the viability of these three cells in BUE (80 &#x003bc;g/mL) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f006">Figure 6</xref>D,E). However, the treatment of Nec-1 could reverse significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) the reduction of cell viability induced by BUE, indicating that the toxicity of BUE was closely related to cell necrosis.</p><p>Propidium iodide (PI) staining was commonly applied to identify necrotic cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f007">Figure 7</xref>, EAE groups presented weak red fluorescence in 80 and 160 &#x003bc;g/mL. In contrast, red fluorescence in BUE groups at 80 and 160 &#x003bc;g/mL was significantly enhanced compared with the control group, especially in the BUE-H group. Therefore, the necrosis was intuitively confirmed by obvious red fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-toxins-11-00142"><title>2.6. Effects of EAE and BUE on NF-&#x003ba;B Signaling Pathway In Vitro</title><p>Western blot results in L-02 cells were similar with those in mice liver tissues. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f008">Figure 8</xref>A, the protein level of P-NF-&#x003ba;B, NF-&#x003ba;B, and IKK&#x003b1; increased significantly in BUE groups, whereas the level of I&#x003ba;B significantly decreased, in comparison with the control group (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).

The Effect of EAE and BUE on L-02 Cell Membrane</title><p>Necrosis in cells can lead to membrane damage. Thus, the effects of EAE and BUE on L-02 cell membrane were evaluated. The level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release is commonly considered as an indicator of cell membrane damage [<xref rid="B12-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f009">Figure 9</xref>A, the treatment of EAE did not induce the release of LDH. Nevertheless, the content of LDH was significantly increased in BUE groups, especially in the BUE-H group (at 67%).</p><p>Cell membrane fluidity can be detected by fluorescence polarization, by measuring the strength of the fluorescence [<xref rid="B13-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The increase in fluorescence polarization represented the decrease in membrane fluidity. The result suggested that after 2 h treatment, a high dose of BUE could reduce membrane fluidity (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas EAE groups exhibited no significant effect on membrane fluidity in L-02 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f009">Figure 9</xref>B).</p><p>Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and PI staining represent a classic method to detect cell membrane permeability and discriminate living cells, dead cells, and cells with membrane injury [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00142-f010">Figure 10</xref>, after 12 h treatment, only green fluorescence (FDA<sup>+</sup>) can be observed in the control and EAE groups, suggesting there was no obvious change in cell membrane permeability. However, in BUE groups, the red fluorescence (PI<sup>+</sup>) increased significantly, indicating that cell membrane injury had occurred. In the BUE-L group, both red and green fluorescence were observed with integrated cell structure, indicating cell membrane injury but that the cell was alive. In the BUE-H group, only red fluorescence was observed, indicating that the cell structure was dilapidated. The above results further confirmed that the toxicity induced by BUE was related to cell necrosis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-toxins-11-00142"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Necrosis, as one process of cell death that is different from apoptosis, has attracted much attention from scholars. Necrosis exhibits morphological characteristics such as cellular organelle swelling, cell membrane rupture, intracellular content spillover, slow nuclear change, and inadequate DNA degradation [<xref rid="B15-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The necrotic process of cell death is mainly induced by strong physical, chemical, or biological factors [<xref rid="B16-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The irrational use of drugs can possibly induce necrosis [<xref rid="B7-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and studies have revealed that necrosis plays an important role in drug-induced liver injury [<xref rid="B17-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The toxicity of drugs is often accompanied by weight loss [<xref rid="B18-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. After the administration of PH (5 g/kg), loss of weight and darkness of fur were clearly observed in the PH group. This dose of PH did not result in death, demonstrating that the LD<sub>50</sub> of PH was greater than 5 g/kg. Histopathological evaluations were used to investigate visceral injury directly. In this research, the results exhibited prominent morphologically pathological characterizations of toxicity, especially in liver tissues. Therefore, the liver was selected as the target organ for further toxicological research.</p><p>Anti-inflammation was the traditional efficacy of <italic>P. hookeri</italic> and carrageenan-induced mice paw edema was the classical model for an anti-inflammatory study. The present research showed that EAE and BUE were the active fractions for anti-inflammation, which were applied for further evaluation of the liver toxicities in vivo and in vitro. Drug-induced liver injury causes abnormalities in biomarkers in serum and the morphology of tissues. ALT, AST, ALP, TBIL, and DBIL are all important biochemical indicators for the diagnosis of liver injury in clinical trials [<xref rid="B19-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the present study, BUE significantly increased the serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP TBIL, and DBIL, indicating that liver injury was induced by BUE. Furthermore, the hepatic histological changes substantiated the biomarker analysis.</p><p>Inflammation is often accompanied by the process of liver injury, which contains necrosis with cellular constituents being released [<xref rid="B20-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B is a classic inflammatory signaling pathway. Normally, the NF-&#x003ba;B activity is regulated by binding with inhibitory units of I&#x003ba;B. Once stimulated, the IKK is activated and phosphorylated to degrade the I&#x003ba;B. NF-&#x003ba;B can then translocate to the nucleus and initiate gene transcription, such as some inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="B21-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Necrosis is considered to be un-programmed. However, a growing number of research studies have demonstrated that some types of necrosis could also be regulated by signaling molecules and that these types of necrosis could be defined as programmed necrosis. Programmed necrosis was regulated by a necrotic complex, in which RIP1 was the first identified signal molecule [<xref rid="B22-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Successive reports showed that RIP3 was the core protein that controlled the necrosis-related signals. RIP1 and RIP3, belonging to the RIP family, owned the RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), which promoted them to form necrosome [<xref rid="B23-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Subsequently, RIP3 collected mixed lineage kinase domain-like proteins (MLKLs) to execute necrosis. Our results showed that treatment with BUE upregulated the expression of NF-&#x003ba;B, RIP1, and RIP3, confirming that the liver injury induced by BUE was mainly caused by necrosis.</p><p>Experiments in vitro were carried out for further evaluation of the toxicity of BUE. The main cells of the liver are hepatocytes; in addition, macrophages and endothelial cells are also distributed in the liver. Therefore, L-02, RAW264.7, and HUVEC were selected as tools to evaluate the toxicity. Cell viability results indicated that BUE was the toxic fraction, similar to the results obtained in vivo. Moreover, necrosis was further confirmed as the major factor inducing BUE toxicity by the treatment of Nec-1, the inhibitor of RIP1, which could significantly reverse the decrease in the cell viability of BUE. PI staining, a classical method to identify necrotic cells, also verified the above result. Western blot results in L-02 showed a similarity with those in liver tissue in mice. Both NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway and necrosis-related proteins RIP1 and RIP3 were upregulated by the BUE treatment.</p><p>Cell death induced by necrosis is morphologically characterized by cell and organelle swelling, which ultimately culminates in the loss of cell membrane integrity [<xref rid="B24-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, the next research step was focused on the change of cell membrane structure. As the boundary membrane of cells, cell membrane integrity is important to maintain the normal activities of cells [<xref rid="B25-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]<styled-content style="color:#080000">,</styled-content> such as material transport [<xref rid="B26-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], energy conversion [<xref rid="B27-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]<styled-content style="color:#080000">,</styled-content> and cell recognition [<xref rid="B28-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. When the membrane was damaged, LDH, a relatively stable cytoplasmic enzyme, was released to the outside. Its release was an important indicator reflecting the integrity of the cell membrane. Appropriate fluidity was necessary for maintaining the normal physiological function of cells. 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), a non-polar molecule, could bind to the cell membrane and emit fluorescence [<xref rid="B29-toxins-11-00142" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The increase in the fluorescence polarization indicated the decrease in the membrane fluidity. Maintaining the normal permeability of the cell membrane was crucial for the cells. FDA was transported into living cells and transformed into metabolites with green fluorescence. PI stain was embedded with DNA to emit red fluorescence. However, it could only reach the nucleus through the damaged membrane in necrotic cells since it was rejected by cells with a complete membrane. In our research, it was revealed that BUE-induced necrosis increased the release of LDH and permeability, but decreased the fluidity of the cell membrane.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-toxins-11-00142"><title>4.
