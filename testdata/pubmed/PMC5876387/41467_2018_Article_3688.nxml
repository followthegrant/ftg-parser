Although initially deemed &#x0201c;junk DNA,&#x0201d; they have since been found to be integral components of genome evolution, organization, and stability. Major evolutionary innovations, such as the vertebrate adaptive immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and placenta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, as well as novel transcription factors and regulatory networks (reviewed in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>), have their origin in transposition, and active mobile elements continue to reshape genomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike. This genome-transforming property can impact both the evolutionary trajectory of a transposon host (reviewed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>) and its well-being, through the potential of TEs to induce mutations leading to disease or oncogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">DNA transposons have been turned into valuable genetic tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and possibilities for their application range from functional genomics, genome editing, and transgenesis to gene therapy (reviewed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>). Remarkably, most eukaryotic DNA transposons and all those that have found applications to date are the so-called &#x0201c;cut-and-paste&#x0201d; type DNA transposons. These precisely cut themselves out of the donor DNA site by introducing double-strand breaks, and integrate the mobilized DNA segment to a target site, often with little or no sequence preference. The original copy of the transposon is lost at the donor site. The needed endonucleolytic and transesterification activities are always catalyzed by a variant of a RNase H-like catalytic domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5"><italic>Helitrons</italic>, a unique group of eukaryotic DNA transposons that have generated unusually extensive genome variation, were discovered in 2001<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Still, it is clear that they are distinct from any of the other characterized eukaryotic DNA transposons (reviewed in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>). Unlike &#x0201c;cut-and-paste&#x0201d; transposons, they do not contain similar DNA sequences in an inverted configuration at their terminals. Rather, each end contains a distinct ~150 base pairs (bp) long sequence with an absolutely conserved dinucleotide at the end of left terminal sequence (LTS), and a tetranucleotide at the end of right terminal sequence (RTS) which is preceded by a palindromic sequence that can form a hairpin structure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). <italic>Helitrons</italic> integrate precisely between 5&#x02032;-A and T-3&#x02032; nucleotides into host AT target sites, but do not generate target site duplications.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Features of <italic>Helraiser</italic> transposon and overview of transposition pathway. <bold>a</bold> Schematic representation of <italic>Helraiser</italic> transposon.

HUH nuclease domains (reviewed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>) have one or two active site tyrosine residues that form a covalent 5&#x02032;-phosphotyrosine linkage with DNA upon cleavage, while liberating the adjacent 3&#x02032;-OH group. HUH nucleases are widely employed to carry out DNA transactions, such as rolling circle replication, viral replication initiation, conjugation, and DNA transposition, always acting on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and always with conserved strand polarity.</p><p id="Par8">In prokaryotes, insertion sequence families, such as IS<italic>91</italic> and the IS<italic>605</italic>/IS<italic>200</italic> family, also rely on an HUH domain for the catalytic steps of transposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Experiments with IS<italic>91</italic> have led to a &#x0201c;rolling circle&#x0201d; transposition model involving the excision and reintegration of only one transposon strand, followed by DNA synthesis at the donor site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

This study demonstrated that <italic>Helraiser</italic> transposition generates covalently closed transposon circles containing a precise junction of the transposon ends in which the 5&#x02032;-TC dinucleotide of the LTS is directly joined to the CTAG-3&#x02032; tetranucleotide of the RTS. Furthermore, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) <italic>Helraiser</italic> circles propagated in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and transfected into HeLa cells were donors for integration, suggesting that transposon circles are transposition intermediates. Using active site point mutations of the HUH motif and the two tyrosines in the Rep domain (Y727 and Y731), as well as mutations in the Walker A and arginine finger motifs in the helicase domain, it was established that both the nuclease and helicase activities were needed for transposition in HeLa cells. In vitro, the HUH motif and Y731 were required for cleavage of the ssDNA oligonucleotides representing transposon ends. Results using transposon-end deletion mutants demonstrated that an intact LTS was crucial for transposition, whereas the RTS was not strictly required (although deletion of either RTS hairpin sequence or the entire RTS decreased the transposition efficiency). This study also provided insight into the mobilization of genes adjacent to the RTS, indicating that the hairpin structure serves as the transposition terminator and, as such, plays an important role in regulating gene capture. Collectively, these results provided a basis for experimental work on <italic>Helitron</italic> transposition, but many features of the transposition mechanism remained unclear.</p><p id="Par12">As <italic>Helitron</italic> transposition is fundamentally different from cut-and-paste transposition, many questions arise, some of which are outlined in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>.

Are these present in ssDNA or dsDNA form?</p><p id="Par13">Here, we demonstrate that the <italic>Helraiser</italic> donor site must be in dsDNA form and that ssDNA donors do not support transposition.

To address these questions, we used our previously described bicomponent transposon system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> consisting of two plasmids: a donor plasmid encoding the transposon LTS and RTS and another expressing the <italic>Helraiser</italic> transposase.

To compare the ability of <italic>Helraiser</italic> to use ssDNA or dsDNA donors, we started from the dsDNA transposon donor, pHelR-CMV-Puro, and generated the two ssDNA donor versions by specifically nicking either the plus or the minus strand and then removing the nicked strand by exonuclease III digestion. We used the same procedure to generate ssDNA forms of the pHelRC-Puro transposon circle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> which is, in essence, a circular transposon that contains a precise head-to-tail junction of the <italic>Helraiser</italic> ends (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, bottom).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><italic>Helraiser</italic> transposition from single- and double-stranded donors in human HEK cells. <bold>a</bold> Top: <italic>Helraiser</italic> transposition efficiency from double-stranded (ds) and single-stranded (ss) transposon donors, measured by <italic>Puro</italic>-resistant colony formation in HEK293T cells.

In contrast, when the ssDNA donors were used, only the minus strand could be detected with the minus-strand donor (lanes 11 vs. 15) and, conversely, only the plus strand was detected with the plus-strand donor (lanes 12 vs. 16). Thus, within the time frame of the transfection experiment, we saw no detectable conversion of the ssDNA donors to dsDNA form. This is consistent with our earlier results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) that ssDNA donors did not lead to transposon integration, as would have been expected had they been converted to the transposition-competent dsDNA form.</p><p id="Par22">Collectively, these results suggest that <italic>Helraiser</italic> donor DNA must be in the dsDNA form to achieve transposition and for efficient transposon circle formation containing precise RTS-to-LTS junctions.

The experimental rationale was that any <italic>Helraiser</italic> circles formed during the transposition reaction that survive <italic>Dpn</italic>I digestion will contain only unmethylated DNA; hence, both strands must have been synthesized in HEK293T cells. As a test of our approach, we first used synthetic oligonucleotides to establish that <italic>Dpn</italic>I treatment indeed digested both <italic>dam</italic> hemimethylated and methylated dsDNA (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>), and also ssDNA and dsDNA forms of <italic>Helraiser</italic> circles.

Sequencing white <italic>Cam</italic><sup>+</sup> bacterial colonies obtained after electroporation of the <italic>Dpn</italic>I digestion product showed, consistent with what we observed without digestion, that both C-G and A-T bp were present at the mismatch position in <italic>Helraiser</italic> circles.

The direction of the change in the ratio at the mismatch position of C-G to A-T bp after <italic>DpnI</italic> digestion is a strong indicator of which strand was used to generate transposon circles. This is because if the plus strand of the donor molecule was used for transposon circle formation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, group I and II), <italic>Dpn</italic>I digestion would remove those circles that had the original, methylated strand with the C base and, regardless of the distribution of the products, the proportion of circles containing C-G will decrease.

This is the expected behavior of an HUH nuclease as one of the products stays covalently bound to the transposase through a 5&#x02032; phosphotyrosine linkage that can be resolved and the substrate state re-established by the free 3&#x02032;OH end of the other product<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par41"><italic>Helitrons</italic> are a unique group of DNA transposons that have profoundly impacted eukaryotic genomes and that transpose using a mechanism that differs from all other characterized eukaryotic DNA transposons. One key feature is the presence of covalently closed circular molecules containing precise RTS-to-LTS junctions. While such circular intermediates occur in a number of different prokaryotic transposition processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, they have not been seen before in any other eukaryotic system. Here we have addressed a number of fundamental mechanistic questions using <italic>Helraiser</italic>, an active <italic>Helitron</italic> transposon reconstituted from the genome of the bat <italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par42">In order to examine the mechanism of <italic>Helitron</italic> transposition we developed novel methodologies to study eukaryotic replicative transposition. Combining strand-specific reporter assays, such as heteroduplex donors, with various prokaryotic and eukaryotic reporters (e.g., <italic>LacZ</italic>, <italic>GFP</italic>) allowed us to differentiate between the two transposon strands and to follow their fate during the transposition process. In addition, assays we adapted from viral systems, such as a <italic>Dpn</italic>I replication assay and strand-specific PCR, allowed us to address the questions involving DNA synthesis, such as transposon donor repair and the DNA form of transposon circles.</p><p id="Par43">Despite the overwhelming body of evidence that HUH nuclease-containing enzymes perform cleavage and strand transfer exclusively on ssDNA substrates, we show here that for integration to occur in HEK293T cells, the transposon donor site must be in dsDNA form and that ssDNA donors will not suffice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). We have previously shown that <italic>Helraiser</italic> circles are formed in HeLa cells from dsDNA donors and that transfected dsDNA <italic>Helraiser</italic> circles propagated in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> served as transposon donors for integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, it was not clear whether the transposon circles generated during transposition in HeLa cells were in ssDNA or dsDNA form, nor if those transposon circles were actively involved in transposition process. Here we extend our previous findings to show that circular transposons must also be in the dsDNA form to act as intermediates for chromosomal integration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Furthermore, plus-strand ssDNA donors do not yield detectable junctions, whereas minus-strand ssDNA donors can lead to junction formation although most of them were aberrant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). These results suggest a critical role for dsDNA in <italic>Helitron</italic> transposition, perhaps because the <italic>Helraiser</italic> transposase can initiate transposition only in the context of dsDNA or at a dsDNA/ssDNA junction. Interestingly, circular ssDNA viruses (gemini-, nano, circo-) that use rolling circle replication show a similar requirement as their ssDNA genomes first have to be converted into the dsDNA form for replication to start (reviewed in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>). In these systems, the viral initiator recognizes the viral origin only in the dsDNA form, followed by rolling circle replication to generate multiple viral genomes (reviewed in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>). Perhaps, it is not a coincidence that these viral replication initiators also consist of an HUH nuclease Rep domain followed by a helicase domain.</p><p id="Par44">The rolling circle model of transposition proposes that only one strand of the transposon is excised and reintegrated, yet this had not been previously experimentally demonstrated. Our data here suggest that it is the plus strand of <italic>Helraiser</italic> that is active. We conclude this from the data obtained in HEK293T cells with heteroduplex substrates, and also from the in vitro experiments with purified <italic>Helraiser</italic> transposase, which indicated that only plus-strand junctions could be detected when the transposase was incubated with a linear dsDNA plasmid donor, and that ~85% of the precise product junctions arose from the plus strand when the dsDNA donor contained a mismatch (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Furthermore, recapitulating junction cleavage in vitro on ssDNA oligonucleotide substrates revealed that only the plus strand can be cleaved and that it is cleaved precisely at the junction point; this is a key step in the rolling circle model for the generation of a cleaved transposon end from circular intermediates for subsequent integration. The apparent discordance between efficient ssDNA cleavage in vitro (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>) and the apparent need in cells for dsDNA circular transposon intermediates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) may hint at the role of the <italic>Helraiser</italic> helicase domain, which may be needed to locally provide limited regions of ssDNA that can serve as the substrate for the endonucleotic reaction by the HUH domain to generate the 3&#x02032;OH replication start point.</p><p id="Par45">A key finding in our experimental system is the observed reuse of the original donor site, which in principle provides a constant source of donor DNA supporting multiple rounds of transposition. Our <italic>Dpn</italic>I data also suggest an enrichment of the precise transposon junctions when looking at only newly synthesized DNA. This result is consistent with a model in which the precisely joined circles themselves act as an additional sources of new circular intermediates, or as transposon donors for integration. These data confirm that <italic>Helraiser</italic> circles generated during the transposition are actively involved in this process and are bona fide transposition intermediates, a result that had been previously only inferred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, our findings reveal the potential of <italic>Helraiser</italic> circles to act as transposon donors for further rounds of circle formation in the presence of the transposase. In fact, a parallel can be drawn with certain ssDNA viruses, whereby repeated transposon donor reuse and resynthesis, as well as the multiple rounds of DNA synthesis on transposon circles could be equated to the replication process. In addition, the possibility that the episomal forms of <italic>Helraiser</italic> transposon could replicate and persist in the cells in the presence of transposase points to the potential of this transposon system.</p><p id="Par46">Our data demonstrated that only the plus strand of the transposon donor molecule is transposed. This would lead to formation of ssDNA transposon circles of the plus-strand polarity. However, neither transfection of the plus strand ssDNA donors nor ssDNA <italic>Helraiser</italic> circles resulted in transposon integration in HEK293T cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). This indicated a previously unsuspected feature of the mechanism that transposon donors and circles have to be in dsDNA form to serve as integration substrates, yet we did not detect any ssDNA to dsDNA conversion when ssDNA donors or circles were transfected, another curious facet of <italic>Helitron</italic> transposition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, e). In contrast, our data demonstrated that at least a portion of <italic>Helraiser</italic> circles generated in HEK293T cells were in dsDNA form (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). This discrepancy can be explained if a replication fork is formed at the donor site after 5&#x02032;-end cleavage of the top strand as illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. In this manner, leading strand synthesis would reconstitute the donor site (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i, ii</xref>), while lagging strand synthesis would take place on the peeled-off transposon strand (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i</xref>), as demonstrated in the rolling circle replication of certain dsDNA viruses and phages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Since the peeled-off strand is used to generate transposon circles, through this process they would become double stranded without ever forming a free ssDNA circle (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a&#x02032;</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Proposed pathways of transposon circle formation together with replication and integration during <italic>Helraiser</italic> transposition. Transposon circle formation using the original donor site is shown on the left (I). Following the nicking of transposon plus strand at the LTS, a replication fork is established at the nick site (i). Leading strand synthesis reconstitutes the transposon donor site (ii), while lagging strand synthesis takes place on the displaced transposon strand. This results in a formation of dsDNA transposon circle (a&#x02032;) after the second cleavage reaction takes place at the RTS of the displaced transposon strand. Generated dsDNA transposon circle potentially serves as a transposon donor (b&#x02032;). Following the transposon plus-strand cleavage at the LTS-to-RTS junction site on a dsDNA transposon circle, a replication fork is established at the nick site (b&#x02032;). Leading strand synthesis regenerates the transposon donor site on the transposon circle, while the lagging strand synthesis results in a dsDNA transposon copy that can be integrated in the host genome (c&#x02032;) or form a new dsDNA transposon circle (d&#x02032;). After resynthesis of the original transposon donor site (shown on the right (II)), transposon circle formation and replication include the same steps illustrated for the pathway (I).

During the replication process of these circular ssDNA viruses, a short minus-strand primer is made on the replicated plus-strand viral genome and thus primed viral genomes are packaged into virions. Upon virus infection, the minus-strand primer is used for minus-strand synthesis that leads to formation of dsDNA replicative intermediates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. If <italic>Helitrons</italic> use a similar mechanism for minus-strand synthesis and conversion of the plus-strand ssDNA into dsDNA transposon circles, the unprimed ssDNA circles transfected in our experiments would not be converted to the dsDNA form, and would thus remain transpositionally inactive.</p><p id="Par48">Our current in silico reconstructed transposase, while active both in vivo and in vitro, has low activity in vitro and is likely to represent a suboptimized version.
