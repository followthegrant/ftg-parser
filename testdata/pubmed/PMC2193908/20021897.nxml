These multiple activities are apparently mediated by a unique G protein&#x02013;coupled receptor, termed CXCR3. The chemokine CXCL4/PF4 shares several activities with CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, including a powerful angiostatic effect, but its specific receptor is still unknown. Here, we describe a distinct, previously unrecognized receptor named CXCR3-B, derived from an alternative splicing of the CXCR3 gene that mediates the angiostatic activity of CXCR3 ligands and also acts as functional receptor for CXCL4.</p><p>Human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1), transfected with either the known CXCR3 (renamed CXCR3-A) or CXCR3-B, bound CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, whereas CXCL4 showed high affinity only for CXCR3-B. Overexpression of CXCR3-A induced an increase of survival, whereas overexpression of CXCR3-B dramatically reduced DNA synthesis and up-regulated apoptotic HMEC-1 death through activation of distinct signal transduction pathways. Remarkably, primary cultures of human microvascular endothelial cells, whose growth is inhibited by CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL4, expressed CXCR3-B, but not CXCR3-A. Finally, monoclonal antibodies raised to selectively recognize CXCR3-B reacted with endothelial cells from neoplastic tissues, providing evidence that CXCR3-B is also expressed in vivo and may account for the angiostatic effects of CXC chemokines.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CXCR3-B</kwd><kwd>CXCR3-A</kwd><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>chemokines</kwd><kwd>chemokines receptor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemokines are a family of small, structurally related molecules that regulate cell trafficking of various subsets of leukocytes (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Moreover, chemokines regulate embryonic development, pathophysiology of the central nervous system, wound healing repair, control angiogenesis, and tumor growth and spread (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The nomenclature for chemokines is based on the configuration of a conserved amino-proximal cysteine-containing motif. Based on this system, there are currently four branches of the chemokine family: CXC, CC, CX<sub>3</sub>C, and C (where X is any amino acid). CXC chemokines are characteristically heparin-binding proteins and exhibit the selective property to promote or inhibit angiogenesis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The angiostatic members of the CXC chemokine family include IP-10/CXCL10, MIG/CXCL9, I-TAC/CXCL11, and platelet factor 4/CXCL4 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These chemokines induce injury to established tumor-associated vasculature and promote extensive tumor necrosis (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and thus have been proposed as useful therapeutic agents in cancer (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>The angiostatic effects of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 on human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> are mediated by the CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3; 4&#x02013;6, 11&#x02013;13), whereas the receptor for CXCL4 has not yet been identified (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Several studies have pointed out that CXCL10 and CXCL4 share a great number of activities, such as inhibition of chemotaxis and proliferation of endothelial cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), or inhibition of hematopoiesis (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, the interaction of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 with CXCR3 also results in the chemotaxis of activated Th1 cells (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), NK cells (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), macrophages (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and dendritic cells (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), whereas CXCL4 does not exert chemotactic activity on the same cell types. Furthermore, CXCL9 and CXCL10 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of proliferative glomerulonephritis, a common renal disease characterized by glomerular hypercellularity, because they induce increased survival and growth of human mesangial cells (HMC) through their receptor CXCR3 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Recently, we and others found that CXCL9 and CXCL10 induce chemotaxis and proliferation (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) of HMC through pertussis toxin&#x02013;sensitive mechanisms (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Thus, the apparently opposite effects of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 on HMVEC and on HMC allow the hypothesis of the existence of cell-specific signal transduction pathways and/or distinct CXCR3 receptor variants.</p><p>In this study, we have identified a novel mRNA generated by an alternative splice site within the intron of the CXCR3 gene by using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and Northern blot analysis. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and transfection of the human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1) provided evidence for the existence of a previously unrecognized receptor, named CXCR3-B, which mediated the inhibitory activity of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 on the growth of HMVEC. Binding assay and signal transduction analysis demonstrated that CXCR3-B also acts as a functional receptor for CXCL4, thus explaining the large overlap between the biological activities of CXCL10 and CXCL4. By contrast, the classic CXCR3 receptor, renamed as CXCR3-A, mediated the proliferation of HMC in response to CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, and was responsible for both increased survival and angiogenic properties of transfected HMEC-1 cells, but did not react with CXCL4. Finally, mAbs selectively developed against CXCR3-B, reacted with endothelial cells of different human tumor tissues, but poorly or not with those of their normal counterparts, consistently with the previously described selective activity of both CXCL4 and CXCL10 on the proliferation of endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents.</title><p>Recombinant human chemokines were obtained from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

The predicted 1,248-bp open reading frame of this mRNA was initiated from an alternate in-frame ATG start codon found within the intron sequence and 151-bp upstream of the known AG acceptor site used for intron splicing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a). Translation of CXCR3-B mRNA generated a 416&#x02013;amino acid receptor containing a longer NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal extracellular domain different from the CXCR3-A sequence in the first 52 amino acid residues, whereas the remaining protein was identical (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a). To provide evidence for the existence of, and to better characterize, this new mRNA, a rapid amplification of complementary cDNA 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends (RACE) on total mRNA obtained from either primary cultures of HMVEC or human thymus was performed by using primers selectively hybridizing the final portion of the intron (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, a and b). This new mRNA, named CXCR3-B, showed a large overlap with the known CXCR3 sequence, but a novel 5&#x02032; end resulting from an alternative splicing between the same donor site used by the known CXCR3 sequence (renamed CXCR3-A) and a novel acceptor site localized 233 bp upstream of the known AG acceptor site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, a&#x02013;c). The size of CXCR3-B, including the 5&#x02032; UTR region, was 1,860 bp (sequence data are available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF469635">AF469635</ext-link>). Furthermore, screening of the ResGene Clone Collection database identified a clone (ID 19600412004045), obtained from a cDNA leukocyte library (NFLHAL1), showing complete homology with the first 567 bp of the CXCR3-B sequence, the last 269 bp of this clone overlapping the sequence common to both receptors. The expression of this new putative mRNA was assessed in different tissues by using Northern blot analysis. To this end, a 182-bp probe (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a, yellow) selectively hybridizing with the CXCR3-B mRNA was used, which recognized an mRNA of &#x0223c;1.8 kb, mainly expressed in the heart, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> d, top). By using a 401-bp cDNA probe (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a, light green) encompassing a region shared by both receptors, two distinct mRNAs of &#x0223c;1.8 (CXCR3-B) and 1.6 kb (CXCR3-A) were detected in the heart, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle, with CXCR3-A being consistently prevalent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> d, bottom).

All CXCR3 ligands displaced binding of <sup>125</sup>I-CXCL10 from CXCR3-A with a higher affinity than from CXCR3-B.

However, CXCL4, which shares with CXCL10, CXCL9, and CXCL11 several activities including a powerful angiostatic effect, displaced the binding of <sup>125</sup>I-CXCL10 to CXCR3-B transfectants under the same conditions with an IC50 of 7.46 &#x000b1; 3.05 nM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> f).

All clones expressing high CXCR3-B levels on their surface rapidly died within two or three passages. Only six clones expressing low CXCR3-B levels survived for 8&#x02013;10 passages. However, all exhibited a lower proliferation rate than the respective mock transfectants, as demonstrated by either assessing [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation on day 3 (2,623 &#x000b1; 234 vs. 10,748 &#x000b1; 1,820 cpm/well; P &#x0003c; 0.001) or counting the numbers of viable cells in 60-mm wells on day 7 (370,000 &#x000b1; 20,000 vs. 1,570,000 &#x000b1; 250,000; P &#x0003c; 0.001).

Of note, however, CXCR3-B transfection of HEK293-EBNA cells resulted in little, if any, inhibitory effect on their proliferation (unpublished data), suggesting that CXCR3-B expression does not have the same effects on any cell type.

The results of this study provide evidence that these opposite functions can be explained by the interaction of these chemokines with two distinct receptors. In addition to the classic form of CXCR3 receptor, here renamed CXCR3-A, a novel CXCR3 receptor variant, named CXCR3-B, derived from an alternative splicing between the same donor site used for CXCR3-A and a novel acceptor site localized within the intron of the CXCR3 gene, was identified. Transfection of the two receptors in an HMEC-1 resulted in differences in cell morphology, viability, proliferative activity, apoptosis, and angiogenic capability. CXCR3-A overexpression enhanced cell viability and proliferation, induced rescue from apoptotic cell death, and increased ability of vessel formation in vitro. By contrast, overexpression of CXCR3-B resulted in altered growth properties and massive apoptotic cell death. These opposite effects were related to constitutive expression of CXCL11 on the surface of all transfectants, as demonstrated by the fact that the addition of an anti-CXCL11 mAb reduced the spontaneous proliferation of CXCR3-A&#x02013;transfected cells and enhanced the proliferation of CXCR3-B&#x02013;transfected cells. However, despite the high constitutive expression of CXCL11 on their surface, CXCR3-A&#x02013; and CXCR3-B&#x02013;transfected cells still responded to high concentrations of CXCL10 with further increase or decrease of their proliferation, respectively. These findings provide a convincing explanation for both the proliferation induced by CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 on HMC, which selectively express CXCR3-A (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and the inhibitory activity exerted by the same chemokines on the proliferation of HMVEC (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), which selectively express CXCR3-B. CXCR3-A showed higher affinity than CXCR3-B for all three chemokines, thus explaining why, in the case of coexpression of the two receptors on the same cell type, CXCR3-A&#x02013;mediated effects become prevalent. These data, together with the demonstration that presently available anti-CXCR3 Abs react with both receptors (unpublished data), account for why the existence of the second receptor had not previously been recognized.</p><p>An additional and unexpected finding emerging from this study is the demonstration that CXCR3-B acts as a functional receptor for CXCL4. CXCL4 is also a member of CXC chemokines released in high concentrations from activated platelets (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), which is involved in the control of proliferation of different cell types, such as endothelial cells or hematopoietic progenitors (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Because of their heparin-binding motifs, CXCL4 and CXCL10 have been shown to interfere with the binding of FGF-2 or VEGF165 to their receptors by impairing the growth factor's ability to form homodimers, competing with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface, or by directly binding to these growth factors (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Yet, a large body of evidence indicates that another, still unidentified, receptor-mediated mechanism exists. CXCL4 can antagonize EGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation by inducing an impairment of p21CIP1/WAF1 down-regulation and this effect occurred in a model system in which the stimulation is glycosaminoglycan independent (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Furthermore, the interference by CXCL10 and CXCL4 with EGF-mediated calpain activation led to down-modulation of EGF-mediated migration of fibroblasts without affecting early postreceptor events, but up-regulating cAMP levels (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). More importantly, the endothelial cell stimulatory activity of VEGF121, an endothelial cell mitogen that lacks both heparin affinity and the property to bind CXCL4, was susceptible to CXCL4 inhibition (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). CXCL4 can act even on cells lacking heparan sulphates on their surface membranes (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and CXCL4 peptides made unable to bind heparan sulphates still inhibited endothelial (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and hematopoietic cell growth (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), whereas CXCL4 peptides showing heparin-binding properties did not consistently exhibit inhibitory activity (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Finally, at concentrations inhibiting cell proliferation, CXCL4 significantly reduced FGF2-induced ERK activation, whereas the PI3K pathway was not affected, thus excluding a simply competitive mechanism (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that CXCL4 delivers its specific inhibitory signals through a not yet identified receptor. It has also been reported that like CXCR3 (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), the putative CXCL4 receptor is expressed by microvascular endothelial cells only when they proliferate (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The results of this study provide evidence that CXCR3-B may represent the not yet identified functional receptor for CXCL4. By contrast, CXCR3-B did not react with any of the other 17 chemokines tested, including CCL21, which reacts with both CCR7 and CXCR3 in the mouse (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), as also shown by its activity on microglial cells in CCR7 knockouts (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). However, differently from its murine equivalent, human CCL21 was found to be unable to bind CXCR3 and exert any angiostatic activity (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Our results are consistent with these findings and support the concept that CCL21 binding to CXCR3 is a mouse-restricted phenomenon. Thus, at least in humans, CXCR3-B seems to act as the functional receptor for the four angiostatic chemokines, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL4.</p><p>The opposite biological activities mediated by CXCR3-A and CXCR3-B suggest that the two receptors may trigger different signal transduction pathways. Chemokine receptors are G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate chemotactic activity and Ca<sup>++</sup> flux induction through the activation of PTX-sensitive Gi proteins (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Accordingly, increased proliferative activity in CXCR3-A transfectants could be reduced by PTX treatment. However, PTX had no effect on the proliferation and survival of CXCR3-B transfectants. Furthermore, only CXCR3-A transfectants exhibited calcium influx in response to CXCR3 ligands. This finding is consistent with the results of previous reports showing that both activated lymphocytes and HMC respond with calcium influx to CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), whereas endothelial cells do not (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Multifunctional coupling is common to many GPCRs and has been previously described for the putative CXCL10 receptor (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Together, the lack of calcium influx in response to ligands and PTX insensitivity suggests the coupling of CXCR3-B to other types of G proteins. This hypothesis was further supported by the selective activation of adenylyl cyclase and consequent increase of intracellular cAMP levels in response to CXCL10, CXCL9, CXCL11, and CXCL4 in CXCR3-B, but not in CXCR3-A, transfectants, a property usually related to linkage of GPCR to Gs proteins (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Of note, the increase of cAMP levels in response to CXCL10 and CXCL4 interaction with an unidentified receptor had previously been found to be associated with the inhibition of cellular proliferation and chemotaxis in hematopoietic progenitors and fibroblasts (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). More recent data configure the adenylate cyclase pathway as an important pharmacological target for the inhibition of angiogenesis, because cAMP up-regulation in endothelial cells suppresses their migration and proliferation through the enhancement of apoptosis (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Accordingly, CXCL10 increases intracellular cAMP levels and inhibits the angiogenic activity of the GPCR-Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus, a property which is related to a specific sequence of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of the viral receptor (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). CXCR3-A and CXCR3-B differ for 52 amino acids at the NH<sub>2</sub> end, leading to a change of extracellular conformation that can account for the coupling of CXCR3-B to different type(s) of G proteins (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Indeed, the active conformation of GPCR likely consists of multiple subspecies that may favor different signaling pathways or regulatory events (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Finally, CXCR3-B, but not CXCR3-A, transfectants responded to CXCL10 and CXCL4 with increased transcription of the cell cycle inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF-1. This is of importance because a p53-independent up-regulation of p21 levels is responsible for the antiangiogenic property of CXCL4 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) as well as the growth inhibitory effects of IFNs on different cell types (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Interestingly, the induction of p21 transcription is one of the mechanisms involved in the antiproliferative effect induced by Gs-mediated intracellular cAMP increase (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).</p><p>The results of this study also provide evidence for the in vivo expression of CXCR3-B and thus for its possible physiological relevance in angiogenesis. Indeed, two mAbs selectively recognizing CXCR3-B were able to react with endothelial cells from neoplastic tissues, but not with those from their normal tissue counterparts. In conclusion, our findings not only describe a novel chemokine receptor, but also demonstrate that it is the previously unidentified functional receptor of CXCL4 and a common mediator of the effects of the four angiostatic CXC chemokines. Further characterization of the CXCR3 gene regulation may refine the ability to inhibit or promote blood vessel growth and allow the development of new effective therapeutic strategies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Francisco J.
