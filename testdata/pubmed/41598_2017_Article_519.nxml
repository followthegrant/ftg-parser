One candidate gene implicated in influencing learning is the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype 2B glutamate receptor (<italic>NR2B)</italic>. Consistent with this idea, <italic>NR2B</italic> levels are high in the song learning nucleus LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium) during juvenile vocal learning, and decreases to low levels in adults after learning is complete and the song becomes more stereotyped. To test for the role of <italic>NR2B</italic> in generating song plasticity, we manipulated <italic>NR2B</italic> expression in LMAN of adult male zebra finches by increasing its protein levels to those found in juvenile birds, using a lentivirus containing the full-length coding sequence of the human <italic>NR2B</italic> subunit. We found that increased <italic>NR2B</italic> expression in adult LMAN induced increases in song sequence diversity and slower song tempo more similar to juvenile songs, but also increased syllable repetitions similar to stuttering. We did not observe these effects in control birds with overexpression of <italic>NR2B</italic> outside of LMAN or with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in LMAN. Our results suggest that low <italic>NR2B</italic> subunit expression in adult LMAN is important in conserving features of stereotyped adult courtship song.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Similar to speech in humans, song learning in vocal learning birds occurs most predominantly within a critical period during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Among avian species, zebra finches are &#x0201c;closed-ended&#x0201d; vocal learners and display little ability to further modify their vocalizations beyond the critical period as adults, when their songs become highly stereotyped<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

All vocal learning birds have seven forebrain song nuclei necessary for learning and producing learned vocalizations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These forebrain song nuclei are distributed in two pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>): (1) an anterior song pathway that includes a cortical-striatal-thalamic loop connecting MAN (magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium) in the cortical analog, to Area X in the striatum, to DLM (dorsal lateral nucleus of the medial thalamus) in the thalamus, and back to MAN, which is necessary for vocal learning and modifying vocalizations in different social contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>; and (2) a posterior vocal pathway that projects from the pallial-cortical song nucleus HVC (a vocal nucleus, no abbreviation) to RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium), to the midbrain vocal center DM (dorsal medial nucleus of the midbrain) and brainstem (nXIIts) vocal motor neurons that control the muscles of the syrinx, necessary for producing learned vocalizations. The song nuclei are adjacent to non-vocal movement activated regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and are proposed to have arisen by duplication of these preexisting motor areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, suggesting that discoveries in the song learning systems could be relevant to understanding sensorimotor learning broadly.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic of brain pathways controlling song in songbirds.

</p><p>The lateral part of MAN (LMAN) is a critical output node of the vocal cortical-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit onto RA. Although LMAN is not necessary for singing, neurons in LMAN show strong singing-related immediate early gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and neural activity that is correlated with song structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Artificial manipulation of LMAN by microstimulation while the bird sings induces real time changes in spectral features (e.g. fundamental frequency and amplitude) of individual song syllables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The dependence on LMAN for song modification is stronger during the juvenile critical period of song learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, LMAN lesions in adult male zebra finches also prevent song degradation caused by deafening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, inactivation of LMAN reduces some song acoustic variability seen in adult songs, and also in juvenile songs that are engaged in sensorimotor song learning from tutors, indicating that behavioral variability actively requires LMAN and cortical-striatal-thalamic integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. A similar role has been proposed for Broca&#x02019;s area in the anterior cortex and the connected striatal regions in human speech, based on lesions, physiology/imaging, connectivity, and gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> (but see Long <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> for an alternative interpretation of HVC playing a similar role as Broca&#x02019;s area based on cooling experiments, instead of HVC being similar to the laryngeal motor cortex as proposed in refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>).</p><p>These developmental changes in LMAN are correlated with developmental changes in the <italic>NMDAR</italic> (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) subunits involved in neural plasticity, <italic>NR2A</italic> (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2A) and <italic>NR2B</italic> (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. During the critical period for song development, <italic>NR2B</italic> mRNA levels in LMAN are higher than <italic>NR2A</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Then as the song becomes crystallized, <italic>NR2B</italic> expression and currents decreases, and <italic>NR2A</italic> increases in LMAN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, causing <italic>NMDAR</italic>-mediated synaptic currents to shorten (presumably with NR2B or NR2A dimerizing with the ubiquitous NR1 subunit)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. By the time the animals become adults, <italic>NR2B</italic> mRNA is lower, whereas <italic>NR2A</italic> mRNA is higher in LMAN compared to the surrounding nidopallium region (adult patterns also seen in the two other vocal learning lineages, parrots and hummingbirds)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Importantly, <italic>NDMARs</italic> are necessary for normal song development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, and LMAN input to RA is regulated primarily by <italic>NMDAR</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the <italic>NR2B</italic> gene confers increased plasticity to neural circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, and that its downregulation in adult LMAN may contribute to the molecular mechanisms of increased song stereotypy in adults.</p><p>Here, we tested this hypothesis by performing lentivirus-mediated overexpression of the human <italic>NR2B</italic> in LMAN. We found that this manipulation induced a number of changes to song, including stuttering, slower song tempo, reduced song matches to their original song, higher acoustic pitch, and altered song sequencing, approaching some characteristics found in juvenile song.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To test the hypothesis that <italic>NR2B</italic> levels in adult LMAN influence song stereotypy, we developed a lentiviral construct eGFPhNR2B (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) containing the human <italic>NR2B</italic> tagged with enhanced GFP (green fluorescent protein), overexpressed it in LMAN of male zebra finches (NR2B group), and examined singing behavior.

We decided to test the human gene, because the zebra finch homolog was not completely assembled in the zebra finch genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and the <italic>NR2B</italic> subunit gene is highly conserved, sharing more than 90% amino acid sequence identity between the human and zebra finch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. We generated two control groups: (1) Birds injected with the eGFPhNR2B lentivirus in the motor nidopallium area laterally adjacent to LMAN; and (2) a lentiviral construct expressing eGFP without human <italic>NR2B</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) injected into LMAN. When we found no statistical differences between these two control groups, we grouped the data together as one large control group.

Consistent with these past constructs, compared to control cells without transfection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Lane 1), cells transfected with our eGFPhNR2B lentiviral plasmid expressed high levels of the human NR2B protein of the expected ~180&#x02009;kD size, as measured by Western blots using a NR2B antibody (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Lane 2).

As found <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>in vivo</italic> expression was localized to the cell membrane.</p><p>To quantify the amount of NR2B overexpression and determine if the known developmental changes in mRNA expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> are translated to protein expression, we measured NR2B protein levels by Western blots on microdissected LMAN song nuclei and a comparable sized region of the adjacent lateral nidopallium of juvenile and adult birds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2l</xref>) following a protocol used previously in our laboratory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. We calculated the normalized NR2B protein levels to the actin levels of each sample. In all animals without viral injections, we detected the endogenous ~180&#x02009;kD NR2B protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2m</xref>). Relative to 30-day old juveniles, NR2B showed decreased protein expression in both LMAN and the adjacent nidopallium in adults (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2m,o</xref>). Also in both juveniles and adults, expression in LMAN was lower than the adjacent nidopallium, but the developmental decrease in LMAN was larger (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2m,o</xref>), consistent with what is seen anatomically at the mRNA level using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridizations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Importantly, injections of the eGFPhNR2B lentivirus in LMAN in adults brought back NR2B protein levels to the same as those seen in juveniles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2n,o</xref>). Because the predicted size of the GFP-tagged NR2B protein is only 6&#x02009;kD larger than the endogenous NR2B protein, the ~180&#x02009;kD band that we detected likely reflects both endogenous and overexpressed human NR2B. In the transfected brain regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2n</xref>), as well as in the transfected cultured cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), there is an additional lower molecular weight band, which we interpret to be possibly a processed alternative isoform of NR2B generated from our vector, or a degraded or unfinished protein product of NR2B. There was no detectable change in actin expression levels in the control and injected LMAN samples, indicating that the increased NR2B levels detected is not due to a general increase in protein expression or overloading of the Western blots for the experimental condition.</p><p>We performed immunohistochemistry using the NR2B antibody on frozen serial brain sections of animals that were injected and recorded for song behavior for up to 2.5 months.

The most auditorily and visually apparent result on sonograms, not often seen in adult or juvenile birds, was stuttering (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a&#x02013;c</xref>). Assessed quantitatively, before surgery, the mean number of syllables produced across motifs did not differ between birds selected for control (7.58&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.98) and NR2B overexpression (9.62&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.83) injections prior to surgery (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.14; two sample Wilcoxon test). The mean number of syllables in the motifs of the control birds also did not change post-surgery (7.56&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.99; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). In contrast, birds with NR2B overexpression in LMAN showed increased number of syllables per motif (13.58&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.19; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). This increase was in part due to increased end syllable repetition, characteristic of stuttering (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c&#x02013;e</xref>). All the birds that repeated syllables, particularly at the end of the motifs, started to do so by 4 weeks after surgery (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>), and continued to stutter at the time we sacrificed them 3 months after surgery to collect their brains. This timing indicates that it was the NR2B overexpression that caused the stuttering, and not possible mechanical injury to LMAN from the surgery, which would have been immediate. The total number of introductory notes at the beginning of the first motif of a song bout, which can be several per motif and more with directed singing, also increased in some of the NR2B overexpression birds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The percentage of motifs showing stuttering was high, which went from an average of ~10% and ~72% for end syllable and introductory notes respectively, to ~87% and ~85% after NR2B overexpression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). No such changes were seen in control birds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>, controls combined). Since stuttering is not normally found in juvenile birds, these findings indicate that NR2B overexpression in adults result in aberrant stuttering.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Representative sonograms of songs and mean end syllable repetitions before (presurgery) and after (postsurgery) injections.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Song tempo</title><p>Because there is a dramatic increase in song tempo (produced faster) from juvenile development to adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, and because song tempo is also known to change throughout the day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, we measured the songs consistently at the same time of day for all animals throughout the course of the recordings. Whereas control birds (both groups combined) showed no change before and after surgery, the NR2B LMAN overexpression group showed an average 1.7-fold increase in song motif duration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). This increase was due more to the increased number of syllables (i.e. stuttering), as we found that the mean intersyllable gaps between all syllables increased in both control and NR2B LMAN overexpression birds (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). However, in controls, this was associated with a concomitant decrease in the total average syllable duration, which presumably compensated for the silent gap increases, resulting in no overall change in total motif duration of the control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). The NR2B group did not show this concomitant decrease in average syllable duration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). This suggests a natural continued age-dependent decrease in syllable duration (independent of silent gap increases) past the critical period, which was blocked with <italic>NR2B</italic> overexpression. Taken together, we infer that NR2B overexpression in LMAN partially reversed and further prevented the age-dependent tempo increases in adult birds, where they become more like juvenile birds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Song sequence</title><p>To quantify syllable sequencing, we used commonly studied measures of sequence linearity, sequence consistency, and sequence stereotypy of zebra finch songs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.

Here we tested the hypothesis that the developmentally down-regulated levels of <italic>NR2B</italic> may be important in conferring song stereotypy in adult males. We discovered that overexpression of <italic>NR2B</italic> bilaterally in LMAN causes aberrant repetition of beginning (introductory notes) and end-syllables similar to stuttering, and reversion back to more of a juvenile state to the lengthening of the song motif duration and increased variability of song sequencing and global acoustic structure. Considering that in adult zebra finches lesions of LMAN do not result in robust changes in the overall structure of the song<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, or in variability in syllable sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, these findings indicate that overexpression of <italic>NR2B</italic> to a more juvenile state reactivates a more dominant role of LMAN in influencing song plasticity. Below we discuss the implications of our findings within the context of utilizing zebra finches as a model to explore cortical-basal-ganglia circuit function and dysfunction.</p><p>The syllable repetition findings have important parallels to human dysfluencies, namely stuttering and verbal apraxia. The increased syllable repetitions we observed shares many features of developmental and neurogenic stuttering observed in humans who have suffered damage to the cortical-basal ganglia circuit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> or increased activation in this circuit; the more a person stutters, the more neurons of this network are activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Developmental stuttering refers to speech repetitions or prolongations that affect mostly children at a young age, whereas the rare neurogenic stuttering or acquired stuttering is due to adult brain lesions and have been described to be a core aspect of some aphasias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. In humans, individuals with neurogenic stuttering are more predisposed to stutter at the beginning of a sentence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>, although other dysfluencies have been reported where stuttering occurs at the end of the final sounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. The repetitions at the end of the motifs we observed usually occurred after the first motif of a bout, suggesting that the birds become stuck in sequencing from one motif to the next. In humans, motor-speech disorders such as verbal apraxia are often associated with repetitions of phonemes similar to stuttering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Theories posit that an important mechanism causal to stuttering is impairment of the basal ganglia circuits that produce timing cues for the initiation of motor movement in speech<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Our findings in zebra finches support this view.</p><p>We do not believe that this induced stuttering from <italic>NR2B</italic> overexpression in LMAN is a reversion to the juvenile state. Only a small percentage of a population (up to ~7%) of laboratory-raised male zebra finches are naturally known to stutter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Although stuttering can be learned from adult tutors in juvenile zebra finches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>, it is not known to be part of the normal song learning process. Rather, we believe that this is aberrant behavior due to <italic>NR2B</italic> overexpression in adult LMAN. Previous studies have reported that adult LMAN lesions do not affect introductory notes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> nor cause stuttering for other syllables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Kubikova <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> found a high incidence of stuttering at the end of the song motifs with Area X neurotoxic lesions, but only in birds that already had a predisposition for a small number of repeats before the lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. We suggest that while lesion inactivation of LMAN does not induce stuttering, activation or enhancement of its function through <italic>NR2B</italic> overexpression causes the birds to have difficulty sequencing between motifs, by getting stuck at the beginning and end syllables when switching from one motif to another. Syllables produced in between or at the end of motifs are more variable and less stereotyped than those within the motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, possibly making them more sensitive to perturbations.</p><p>Consistent with the stuttering findings, our findings of increased song motif tempo in the <italic>NR2B</italic> overexpression (i.e. LMAN activation) group is the opposite to that found with lesion inactivation of LMAN in zebra finches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, indicating the change we observed is a gain in LMAN function with <italic>NR2B</italic> overexpression. The normal tempo changes of zebra finch song over juvenile to adult development, could be due to stretching and compressing proportionally syllables and silent gaps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Consistent with our findings in control birds, gaps, but not syllables are known to shorten over the first year of life of an adult bird<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, and recently it has been shown to be more genetically controlled than learning syllable imitation in zebra finches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Other studies have reported no decreases in intersyllable gaps, but a decline in syllable durations over 1.5 years of the adult life of a male<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>, whereas studies in Bengalese finches report that songs slow down later as the bird ages, primarily due to increase in intersyllable gaps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. It is unclear why the findings from these studies are equivocal, but they may be attributed to methodological differences. We speculate that <italic>NR2B</italic> in LMAN is likely important in modulating the variability in syllable duration, and not intersyllable gaps, since gaps appeared to increase in both control and NR2B groups. We also speculate that the higher levels of <italic>NR2B</italic> in manipulated adults induced a partial juvenile-like state, by preventing syllable durations to shorten over time, while simultaneously allowing the intersyllable gaps to increase.</p><p>We were surprised to find that <italic>NR2B</italic> overexpression in LMAN had a larger impact on song sequencing relative to syllable acoustic features, since variability in such syllable acoustic features is reduced after LMAN lesions before they impact sequencing, consistent with the idea that its target nucleus RA is involved more in controlling syllable acoustic structure than sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Instead, our results are consistent with those reported for Area X lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, where the authors noted more apparent sequencing changes in adult animals. This is perhaps due to our manipulation enhancing LMAN function with an intact Area X. Nevertheless, we still found some syllable acoustic changes, such as decreases in stereotypy and increases in pitch after <italic>NR2B</italic> overexpression, indicating that <italic>NR2B</italic> levels in LMAN impact acoustic features to some extent. In adult zebra finches, microstimulation of LMAN induces variability in pitch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, whereas lesions or ablation of LMAN results in prolonged reduction in the variability of syllable pitch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. We speculate that <italic>NR2B</italic> function in LMAN may have a more dominant role in controlling sequencing behavior either through intrinsic actions or its action on the downstream nucleus AreaX, and have a less dominant role in acoustic behavior through its action on RA.</p><p>To explain our findings at a molecular level, we propose the following hypothesis: Since <italic>NR2B</italic> relative to <italic>NR2A</italic> causes the NMDA receptor channel complex with NR1 to stay open longer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>, increased <italic>NR2B</italic> expression could slow down songs by increasing channel opening time, preventing the syllables from compressing in length as the bird ages, among other effects. The increased channel opening time with NR2B has been proposed to allow LMAN to integrate multiple synaptic inputs during juvenile development for vocal learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>; however, song learning does not require slow NMDA-EPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>, even though blocking NMDA receptor activity during tutoring decreases the number of syllables that are learned by the juveniles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. In light of our findings, we hypothesize that the naturally decreasing <italic>NR2B</italic> during development may be also critical in ensuring the characteristic faster song tempo of courtship songs that females prefer over the slower and more variable undirected songs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis is that introducing the exogenous human <italic>NR2B</italic> in LMAN may disrupt or alter the function of the endogenous <italic>NR2B</italic> receptor or the overexpressed <italic>NR2B</italic> may not be expressed in the appropriate cell type and cause a change as a result. Since we are unaware of any other studies in songbirds that have manipulated <italic>NR2B</italic> or its interacting receptor levels in LMAN, we can only speculate on such a possibility from similar studies of genetic enhancement in mammals. Previous studies in mammals that have overexpressed <italic>NR2B</italic> in the forebrain, using a similar construct as ours, have reported enhancement of prefrontal cortical long-term potentiation (LTP) and working memory, which was abolished by blocking with an <italic>NR2B</italic> subunit antagonist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. <italic>NR2B</italic> subunit overexpression also enhances NMDA receptor activation and channel opening, and learning and memory in transgenic mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. <italic>NR2B</italic> endogenous expression in our experiments also appeared in the larger cells (i.e. projection neurons) of LMAN that normally express <italic>NR2B</italic>. If <italic>NR2B</italic> were overexpressed in other cells that do not normally express <italic>NR2B</italic>, the protein would not be expected to function or compete with endogenous function since there would not be an NR1 subunit to bind with and no endogenous <italic>NR2B</italic> to compete with. Further studies will be required to adequately address the effects of <italic>NR2B</italic> overexpression in songbirds and other models to better understand how it affects endogenous <italic>NR2B</italic> function. Nevertheless, the combined findings and studies indicate that overexpression of <italic>NR2B</italic> in songbird LMAN and other brain regions in mammals is able to at least partially recapitulate some plastic states.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that changing the expression of one gene in adult LMAN to mimic juvenile levels is sufficient to recapitulate a partial juvenile song behavior state. This includes decreased song tempo, and increased sequence and overall acoustic variability. These findings support the hypothesis that low <italic>NR2B</italic> levels are important in allowing stereotypy of adult courtship songs in male zebra finches. These changes were also accompanied by an unintended side effect of stuttering, which could be also potentially explained as a sequencing change. This neurogenic stuttering in zebra finches shares some common features to human stuttering, and therefore the zebra finch model may represent a potential tractable and translational model to test hypotheses on cortical-basal ganglia circuitry dysfunctions that could lead to new therapeutic insights.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Lentiviral vector constructs and production</title><p>Since the zebra finch <italic>NR2B</italic> gene sequence was not completely assembled from the zebra finch genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, we designed a custom lentiviral construct with the full-length sequence of the human <italic>NR2B</italic> cDNA (Open Biosystem clone ID 8322672; GenBank Accession #BC113620.1). We followed cloning techniques described in Luo <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> to optimize overexpression of the human <italic>NR2B</italic> gene, in this case in zebra finches, with an enhanced GFP protein tagged as a reporter gene driven by the RSV promoter (eGFPhNR2B; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). This construct design was made based off of the pEGFP-NR2B plasmid containing the rat NR2B sequence that is commercially available from Addgene (Addgene plasmid #17925). The signal peptide of the human NR2B differs from the rat (or mouse) NR2B by only two amino acids, where the arginine (R) in human is replaced with a serine (S) in rat where serine is the 5<sup>th</sup> amino acid located past the signal sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). We constructed the expression vector for eGFPhNR2B by inserting the eGFP cDNA sequence in frame with the NR2B subunit between the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> codons after the predicted sequence for signal peptide where the eGFP is in place of the serine. This signal peptide is cleaved off leaving a fused amino terminal GFP and carboxy terminal NR2B protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

At ~35&#x02013;40 days post-lentiviral injections, we removed birds housed in recording chambers and immediately decapitated them. We quickly dissected and rinsed the brains in chilled PBS, and then mounted them in a tissue slicer (Stoelting Tissue Slicer, Cat. #51415, Wood Dale, IL, USA). Following the protocol described by Whitney <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, we first used a razor to cut off part of the brainstem to create a flat surface with the forebrain on a tissue block cutting surface.

We were easily able to localize the song nuclei due to their denser neural fibers (white) observed in the darkfield setting.

We focused on directed songs which are more stereotyped (less variable) and which males sing more intensely as opposed to undirected songs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup>. We inadvertently did not record sufficient amounts of undirected songs before surgery (due to too few minutes of recordings). However, we don&#x02019;t expect results to be dramatically different with undirected songs, in that they tend to be more variable than directed songs, and our hypothesis was to specifically test for inducing song variability with <italic>NR2B</italic> overexpression. We recorded songs from each male for three weeks before surgical manipulations to capture the within-individual variation in their songs since males can vary their songs from one rendition to another rapidly. We define songs as a sequence of syllables that start with one or more introductory notes, continued with at least one or more motifs, and are surrounded by more than 2&#x02009;seconds of silence. We stimulated directed songs by frequent switching every 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;minutes of presenting two female birds in the male cages in the morning for up to 1&#x02009;hour, in which it is shown that the males almost exclusively produce directed songs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup>. We used animals that sang more than 30 bouts of song per hour and produced short bursts of intense singing behavior that indicate courtship singing behavior. We recorded the songs with microphones (model SR0, Earthworks, Milford, NH, USA) that had a flat frequency response up to 20&#x02009;kHz, connected to a computer with Avisoft RECORDER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.avisoft.com">www.avisoft.com</ext-link>) software at 16 bits and 44-kHz sampling rate. After we had collected enough presurgery directed song recordings, to characterize their song syllables within song motifs we assigned birds randomly to each of three surgery groups for lentiviral gene manipulations: (1) Birds that received injections of the eGFP lentivirus in LMAN (control group); (2) Birds that received injections of the eGFPhNR2B lentivirus in nidopallium (control group); and (3) Birds that received injections of the eGFPhNR2B lentivirus in LMAN (NR2B group). After surgery, we allowed the birds to recover for 2&#x02013;3 days before recording their songs again for up to 2.5 months postsurgery. Birds were housed in groups of the same four individuals they were housed with before surgery, and their songs recorded one day every other week. We also ensured that the songs were selected and processed blind to the treatment group.</p><p>We analyzed the song syllable sequencing and acoustic features using Luscinia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>, Sound Analysis Pro (SA+)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup>, or a custom designed MATLAB software (MathWorks) developed by Dr. Masashi Tanaka<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> based on the SVM algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref></sup> generated by Dr. Kosuke Hamaguchi. For all acoustic analyses, we used 60 song bouts randomly chosen from each of both the presurgery, and postsurgery recordings of all individual males for a total of 120 songs for each bird. For each bird, we manually calculated the total syllable numbers within each motif, and number of introductory notes per motif, both before and after manipulations using Luscinia, and then averaged the scores for presurgery and postsurgery conditions. Using Sound Analysis Pro we computed the means of syllable or sequence similarity scores, and their associated song syllable acoustic features, including entropy, mean change in fundamental frequency, pitch, goodness of pitch, amplitude modulation, and their variances. These scores were averaged across all 60 song motifs for each of the presurgery and postsurgery songs. The three song similarity measurements included: (1) percentage similarity, that computes the threshold level of similarity between songs; (2) percentage of song syllable accuracy, that indicates the average local similarity score; and (3) sequential match, which computes the extent to which similar syllables across songs correspond in temporal order. Using the MathWorks program, we computed the means of intersyllable gaps of all syllables, syllable duration of all syllables, and song bout duration of song motifs. To compare the sequencing features before and after lentiviral injections in the control and NR2B groups, we calculated mean syllable sequence linearity, consistency, and stereotypy scores from the 120 song motifs using MathWorks as described in Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. We calculated linearity as internal linearity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> (number of syllable types &#x02212;1/number of transition types) with syllables including the introductory notes, but where repetition of introductory notes (such as iiiii) was excluded so that the syllable sequence &#x0201c;iiiiiabcd&#x0201d; produces the linearity score of 1. We calculated the consistency score as (number of typical transitions/number of transitions), where typical transitions were determined for each preceding syllable as the most frequently observed syllable transitions in the song. The stereotypy score was the average of linearity and consistency scores.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Tissue collection, sectioning, and immunocytochemical detection of NR2B protein levels in LMAN</title><p>After their last recording session around 2.5 months after surgery, we removed the birds from the recording boxes, decapitated them, dissected and rinsed the brains in 0.1&#x02009;M PBS within minutes, embedded the brain tissue in Tissue-Tek OCT Compound (Sakura, Finetek, Torrance, CA) in a plastic block mold and quickly froze the Tissue Tek around the brain on a dry ice-ethanol bath.
