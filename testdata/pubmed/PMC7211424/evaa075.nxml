Despite increased interest in insect antiparasitoid immunity, there is sparse information on the evolutionary dynamics of biological pathways and gene regulation involved in host immune defense outside <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. We de novo assembled transcriptomes from two beetle species and used time-course differential expression analysis to investigate gene expression differences in closely related species <italic>Galerucella pusilla</italic> and <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> that are, respectively, resistant and susceptible against parasitoid infection by <italic>Asecodes parviclava</italic> parasitoids. Approximately 271 million and 224 million paired-ended reads were assembled and filtered to form 52,563 and 59,781 transcripts for <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> and <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic>, respectively. In the whole-transcriptome level, an enrichment of functional categories related to energy production, biosynthetic process, and metabolic process was exhibited in both species. The main difference between species appears to be immune response and wound healing process mounted by <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> larvae. Using reciprocal BLAST against the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> proteome, 120 and 121 immune-related genes were identified in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> and <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic>, respectively. More immune genes were differentially expressed in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> than in <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic>, in particular genes involved in signaling, hematopoiesis, and melanization. In contrast, only one gene was differentially expressed in <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic>. Our study characterizes important genes and pathways involved in different immune functions after parasitoid infection and supports the role of signaling and hematopoiesis genes as key players in host immunity in <italic>Galerucella</italic> against parasitoid wasps.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>parasitoid wasp</kwd><kwd><italic>Galerucella</italic></kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>insect immunity</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parasitoid attack is a major cause of mortality in many insect species (<xref rid="evaa075-B15" ref-type="bibr">Godfray and Shimada 1999</xref>; <xref rid="evaa075-B2" ref-type="bibr">Asgari and Rivers 2011</xref>), exerting strong selection on traits that affect the likelihood or the outcome of an attack. Defense mechanisms against endoparasitoids that complete their development inside the host often involve the host immune system, which evolves quickly in response to the changing virulence of endoparasitoids and shows large variation among species (<xref rid="evaa075-B7" ref-type="bibr">Carton et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>). For instance, <italic>Drosophila</italic> species show great variation in immunocompetence against the parasitoid <italic>Asobara tabida</italic>, where most species in the <italic>Drosophila obscura</italic> group show immune deficiency and no egg encapsulation, whereas other taxa show very strong immune responses (<xref rid="evaa075-B10" ref-type="bibr">Eslin and Doury 2006</xref>; <xref rid="evaa075-B20" ref-type="bibr">Havard et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evaa075-B38" ref-type="bibr">Singh et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="evaa075-B34" ref-type="bibr">Salazar-Jaramillo et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Similar patterns have recently been documented in the leaf beetle genus <italic>Galerucella</italic>, where three closely related species sharing a common parasitoid wasp enemy differ regarding parasitism rate, encapsulation success, and hemocyte production (<xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="evaa075-B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>The cellular basis underlying variation in immunocompetence against endoparasitoids in nonmodel insects such as <italic>Galerucella</italic> is largely similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). In general, the immune response following a parasitoid attack starts with the recognition of the parasitoid egg. Immune signals subsequently induce a rapid increase and differentiation of hemocytes that attach to the egg surface, leading to the formation of a capsule around the egg with multiple layers of hemocytes (<xref rid="evaa075-B7" ref-type="bibr">Carton et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this encapsulation process involves three major hemocyte types: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are mainly responsible for phagocytosis and make up the majority of circulating hemocytes (&#x0003e;95%). The latter also consists of a small proportion of crystal cells (&#x0003c;5%), which contain crystalline enzymes that are required for humoral melanization (<xref rid="evaa075-B36" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et&#x000a0;al. 2019</xref>). Finally, lamellocytes are specifically produced after attack by parasitoids and participate in capsule formation (<xref rid="evaa075-B24" ref-type="bibr">Lavine and Strand 2002</xref>; <xref rid="evaa075-B27" ref-type="bibr">Meister and Lagueux 2003</xref>). Encapsulation often ends with melanization, which is the release and activation of phenoloxidase, leading to blackening at the wound site or around the encapsulated egg (<xref rid="evaa075-B21" ref-type="bibr">Honti et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Parasitoid eggs inside the capsule normally die from asphyxiation within 48&#x02009;h, under the joint effect of encapsulation and melanization (<xref rid="evaa075-B42" ref-type="bibr">Wertheim et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Galerucella</italic>, six types of hemocytes have been discovered based on their morphologies, and three (lamellocytes, phagocytes, and granulocytes) were specifically involved in the encapsulation process (<xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Lamellocytes, which serve the same function as in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, are essential for capsule formation to be completed. Phagocytes, although not the major factor, also contribute to the encapsulation process in <italic>Galerucella</italic> (<xref rid="evaa075-B7" ref-type="bibr">Carton et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Finally, granulocytes in <italic>Galerucella</italic> share their mode of secretion with crystal cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>), which are involved in wound and capsule melanization.</p><p>Although the hemocytes underlying insect immune responses are largely characterized, their regulation is only partly understood and primarily characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The genes involved in immune responses can be classified in seven functional categories, as proposed by <xref rid="evaa075-B34" ref-type="bibr">Salazar-Jaramillo et&#x000a0;al. (2014)</xref>. The first class of genes involves recognition genes, for instance, peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) and Gram-negative bacteria-binding proteins that are involved in the recognition of foreign objects, such as parasitoid eggs. The second class of genes involves signaling genes for transduction pathways (Toll, JAK-STAT, JNK, and IMD) that initiate the proliferation of hemocytes needed to encapsulate the foreign object. The third class involves effector genes coding for antimicrobial peptides that target bacterial or fungal membranes, leading to damage of the membrane and death of the cell (<xref rid="evaa075-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bulet et&#x000a0;al. 1999</xref>). The fourth class of genes involves modulating genes coding for serpins and serine proteases with mostly unknown immune function (e.g., <italic>Spn88Eb</italic>). The fifth class comprises hematopoiesis genes that are specifically involved in parasitoid-related immunity (hemocyte differentiation, proliferation, and regulation of hematopoiesis process, e.g., <italic>gcm</italic>, <italic>wg</italic>, and <italic>yantar</italic>). The sixth category includes genes coding for prophenoloxidases and their regulators (e.g., <italic>PPO3</italic>, <italic>yellow</italic>), which produce cytotoxic as well as crosslinking intermediates and ultimately melanin needed to complete the capsule around the parasitoid egg. The final class of genes is mainly those coding for chitinases responsible for the healing of wounds after parasitoid oviposition. The elucidation of these genes and pathways has significantly facilitated our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics acting upon genes involved in antiparasitoid immunity, but their occurrence and relevance outside <italic>Drosophila</italic> species have received little attention.</p><p>A powerful approach for understanding differences in immune responses is to compare gene expression patterns between closely related species that differ in their immunocompetence. Here, we examined differences in gene expression following parasitoid attack in the closely related beetles <italic>Galerucella pusilla</italic> and <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). They share the same host plant, <italic>Lythrum salicaria</italic> (Lythraceae) and are attacked by the same koinobiont larval parasitoid, <italic>Asecodes parviclava</italic> (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) (<xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). These species were selected for study as they exhibit large differences in their capacity to encapsulate parasitoid eggs, despite having only recently diverged from a common ancestor (<xref rid="evaa075-B18" ref-type="bibr">Hamb&#x000e4;ck et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). The parasitism rate on the two host species varies between localities but in general, <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> experiences a lower parasitism rate than <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> if they co-occur (<xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Both encapsulation and melanization events are very common in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> larvae infected by wasps, whereas in <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic>, capsule formation and melanization of wasp eggs are rarely observed. If encapsulation takes place successfully upon parasitism, the capsule formation usually starts within 4&#x02013;6&#x02009;h and is completed after &#x0223c;48&#x02009;h (<xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). During encapsulation process, the capsule is often melanized and melanized parasitoid eggs can be clearly observed upon digestion after 48&#x02009;h. Wound healing usually occurs quickly on the wound sites within the first few hours upon parasitism, where melanization also plays a role in the blackening of wound. In general, <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> exerts a more potent immune response against <italic>A.&#x000a0;parviclava</italic> than <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic>, with cellular level investigations documenting that two classes of hemocytes involved in encapsulation, phagocytes and lamellocytes, increased their production upon infection in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> (<xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). In order to move beyond cellular phenotype level study, here we examined differences in the gene expression between these two species, using a time-course sampling design following parasitoid attack. Beyond whole-transcriptome level analyses, we also focused upon annotated immune genes based on previous knowledge from <italic>D.&#x000a0;melanogaster</italic> and other arthropod species (<xref rid="evaa075-B42" ref-type="bibr">Wertheim et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="evaa075-B40" ref-type="bibr">Tribolium Genome Sequencing Consortium 2008</xref>). Based on the previous work, we expected more immune genes, especially hematopoiesis genes, to be differentially expressed following parasitoid attack in the species with the strong immune response, <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study Species</title><p>
<italic>Galerucella pusilla</italic> and <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> have similar life cycles. They overwinter as adults and appear in May in the study area, and soon start to lay eggs on the leaves or stem of the <italic>L.&#x000a0;salicaria</italic> host plants. It takes a few weeks for the eggs to hatch, 2&#x02013;3 weeks for the larvae to pupate, and another 2&#x02013;3 weeks for the adults to emerge from the pupae. In Sweden, <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> occurs only in the south and up to central Sweden until Sundsvall (N62&#x000b0;, E17&#x000b0;), whereas <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> is also distributed further north (<xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Despite the morphological similarity between the species, they can be distinguished based on several traits. The larvae of <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> usually have a bright yellow color, whereas the larvae of <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> tend to have a lighter yellow tone (<xref rid="evaa075-B17" ref-type="bibr">Hamb&#x000e4;ck 2004</xref>), and adult males can be distinguished by the presence of spurs on the meso- and metatibiae (<xref rid="evaa075-B9" ref-type="bibr">Coss&#x000e9; 2004</xref>).</p><p>
<italic>Asecodes parviclava</italic> is a small (&#x0003c;1&#x02009;mm) endoparasitoid wasp that lays eggs in the larvae of <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> and <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic>, as well as in an additional species, <italic>G.&#x000a0;tenella</italic>. Once successfully parasitized, parasitoid larvae consume the interior of the host larvae and hinder pupation. During the following summer, the adult parasitoids hatch and subsequently emerge from the host mummy (<xref rid="evaa075-B19" ref-type="bibr">Hansson and Hamb&#x000e4;ck 2013</xref>). The parasitism rate on the two host species varies between localities but in general, <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> experiences a lower parasitism rate than <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> if they co-occur (<xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). Both encapsulation and melanization events are very common in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> larvae infected by wasps, whereas in <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic>, capsule formation and melanization of wasp eggs are rarely observed.

During encapsulation process, the capsule is often melanized and melanized parasitoid eggs can be clearly observed upon digestion after 48&#x02009;h. Wound healing usually occurs quickly on the wound sites within the first few hours upon parasitism, where melanization also plays a role in the blackening of wound.</p><p>For our experiments, adult beetles were collected in the field at Igg&#x000f6;n (60&#x000b0;52&#x02032;18&#x02033;N, 17&#x000b0;19&#x02032;29&#x02033;E), where both species co-occur in mid-May, and were reared in the laboratory at room temperature. For each beetle species, six adults of both sexes were placed on a <italic>L.&#x000a0;salicaria</italic> plant in a transparent plastic cage. Beetles mated randomly and laid eggs on the plant leaves. Newly hatched larvae of approximately the same size were removed from the cages for use in the parasitism experiment when they had reached the second instar. The female parasitoids for parasitism experiments were sampled from previous season&#x02019;s parasitized pupae. Parasitoids were collected from <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> in a different area with very high parasitism rates: &#x000c4;ll&#x000f6;n (63&#x000b0;13&#x02032;46&#x02033;N, 19&#x000b0;4&#x02032;59&#x02033;E).</p></sec><sec><title>Parasitism Experiment</title><p>To investigate the time course of the immune response of the two species, we performed an infection experiment in 2013 and 2014. All samples were prepared in 2014 except for the 12-h posttreatment groups (control and infection), which were performed in 2013. For the infection treatment, eight laboratory-reared second-instar beetle larvae of the same species were placed in a 200-ml transparent plastic container together with four <italic>A.&#x000a0;parviclava</italic> females for 4&#x02009;h to ensure sufficient time for parasitism. We visually confirmed that all the wasps mounted multiple attacks within the first 10&#x02009;min and became much less active after 1&#x02009;h. Parasitized larvae were subsequently transferred to new petri dishes for 1, 4, and 12&#x02009;h to allow host immune responses. The control groups were treated in the same way, except that no parasitoids were introduced. Three biological replicates, each consisting of eight individual larvae, were generated in each treatment group in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic>, whereas the number of biological replicates varied between two to four in <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). In total, across all treatments, 18 samples for each <italic>Galerucella</italic> species were prepared for extraction and sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Extraction and Sequencing</title><p>The eight larvae for each replicate were pooled in one Eppendorf tube, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;. All samples were homogenized and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. A quality check was performed with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and a 2100 Bioanalyzer. Only samples with a 260/280 and 260/230 close to or above two and with no severe degradation visible on the Aligent RNA 600 Nano Assay electropherogram were processed to library preparation. All 36 samples (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online) were sent to SciLifeLab Stockholm for library preparation and sequencing. Specifically, 26 libraries from 1- and 4-h posttreatment groups in both species were prepared once and sequenced in two lanes on the same flowcell, whereas ten libraries from 12-h treatment groups were sequenced in one lane. Poly-A-enriched RNA libraries were constructed and only libraries with a concentration &#x0003e;10&#x02009;nM were paired-end 2&#x000d7; 125-bp sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) platform.</p><p>Variation in gene expression between replicates may have occurred for reasons that we were unable to control. For instance, we were unable to control the number of eggs laid by female parasitoids in the experiment, which may have led to variation in both the strength and timing of infection at the individual level and thus to variations in the immune gene expression. Moreover, the expression levels of significant immune-related genes could have been diluted by pooling eight individuals in each sample, or by our use of the whole larvae rather than specific gland tissues for RNA sampling.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome Assembly and Filtering</title><p>In total, 337 million <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> and 310 million <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> pair-ended raw reads from all libraries were first processed to Stacks 2.0b through clonefilter to remove polymerase chain reaction duplicates (<xref rid="evaa075-B8" ref-type="bibr">Catchen et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>).

BUSCO assembly assessment first identifies candidate regions from the genome/transcriptome to be assessed with TBlastN searches using BUSCO consensus sequences. Gene structures are then predicted and assessed using HMMER and lineage-specific BUSCO profiles (in our case, arthropods BUSCO profiles as the database) to classify matches as complete, duplicated, fragmented, or missing.

Two biological function categories, cuticle development and chitin metabolic, which are considered to play important roles in wound healing responses, were highly enriched due to the upregulated DEGs in that time point when comparing 1-h versus 4-h postinfection and when comparing 4-h postinfection versus 4-h control in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic>. The large set of downregulated genes at 4&#x02009;h have broad and vague function (e.g., RNA processing, water transport, renal system process, and mRNA metabolic process), and it is hard to link this subset of genes to any informative biological events.

In general, immune-related genes showed much less differential expression in all gene categories for <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> than for <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic>. There was a drastic contrast in the genes involved in encapsulation processes between 4- and 12-h postparasitism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We assembled de novo transcriptomes of two closely related chrysomelid beetles with contrasting immunocompetence: <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> and <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic>, which provide new genetic resources for future analysis of Coleoptera species. Previous studies investigated the cellular immune competence between these two species, identifying a better performance of <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> than <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> in encapsulation and hematopoiesis processes (<xref rid="evaa075-B18" ref-type="bibr">Hamb&#x000e4;ck et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="evaa075-B13" ref-type="bibr">Fors et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>). To understand the role of gene regulatory differences for such contrasting immunocompetence, we compared gene expression patterns of the two <italic>Galerucella</italic> species at three time points after infection by <italic>A.&#x000a0;parviclava</italic>, identifying important biological processes that are overrepresented upon parasitism. We then focused on immune candidate genes, finding similar numbers of immune-related genes in both beetle transcriptomes, with significantly more of these genes induced in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> than in <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic>, especially in genes involved in immune signaling, hematopoiesis, and melanization.</p><p>Our data show that <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> mount a strong host immune transcriptional reaction incorporating both humoral and cellular responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Functional categories related to energy allocation (the regulation of ATPase activity and mitochondrial ATP synthesis) also appear to be enriched at an early stage upon parasitism, which play a role in energy generation to help the larvae to pay the cost of follow-up immune responses. In contrast to <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic>, <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> appears to completely fail to defend themselves against wasp attack, as if these parasitoid intruders were never recognized. Another possibility could be the suppression of the immune system by the parasitoid, as they inject virulent substances such as ovarian protein venoms or virus-like particles into the host along with the wasp eggs at the time of oviposition. Consistent with this suggestion, we find an enrichment of GO term &#x0201c;negative regulation of immune system&#x0201d; in upregulated DEGs at 12-h postparasitism in <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic>.</p><p>The time point where most hematopoiesis genes showed the strongest induction in the larvae was 4 h after parasitism. This observation is in line with previous findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where the proliferation and differentiation of hemocytes peaked at the same time point (<xref rid="evaa075-B42" ref-type="bibr">Wertheim et&#x000a0;al. 2005</xref>). The genes that were differentially expressed at 4 h in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> include a broad range of functions, such as hemocyte proliferation, lamellocyte differentiation, and plasmatocyte differentiation. In particular, we found an upregulation of <italic>Cyt-b5</italic> which encodes a conserved hemoprotein that promotes the differentiation of precursor hemocytes (<xref rid="evaa075-B14" ref-type="bibr">Frandsen et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>). Other DEGs found in the <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> expression profile are responsible for lamellocyte differentiation. For instance, <italic>zfh1</italic> and <italic>srp</italic> are elements in a transcription factor cascade that play a role as the switch between plasmatocyte and lamellocyte fate (<xref rid="evaa075-B14" ref-type="bibr">Frandsen et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>). In addition, some genes such as <italic>wts</italic> in the hippo pathway are known as key regulators of the differentiation of lamellocytes and crystal cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="evaa075-B28" ref-type="bibr">Milton et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>), where their upregulation results in the differentiation of lamellocytes and downregulation promotes crystal cell differentiation. The upregulation of the <italic>pnt</italic> gene in our expression profile is expected to regulate prohemocyte differentiation and the production of plasmatocytes. Several genes involved in melanization (i.e., Serine proteases, Prophenoloxidases, and yellow gene family) were only highly activated at 4-h postparasitism. As is reported in a conservative genome-wide gene expression profiling in response to parasitoid attack in by <xref rid="evaa075-B42" ref-type="bibr">Wertheim et&#x000a0;al. (2005)</xref>, capsule melanization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> usually takes place 24&#x02013;72&#x02009;h after parasitism. This late response suggests that the massive overexpression of melanization genes after 4&#x02009;h in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> may only be a healing response to the wound sites caused by the wasp ovipositor, and not an immune response against parasitoid eggs. This interpretation is further supported by the fact that the biological functions of cuticle development and chitin metabolism are highly enriched at 4-h postinfection in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic>.</p><p>Although our results generally matched the differential expression profiles observed in previous studies on immune response of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae upon parasitoid attack, we also observed differences. For instance, the <italic>cactus</italic> gene which acts as a negative regulator of the Toll signaling pathway (<xref rid="evaa075-B11" ref-type="bibr">Evans et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>) was consistently upregulated in our time-course profile in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic>. A probable explanation for this pattern may be differences in the use of immune pathways in <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic> compared with <italic>Drosophila</italic>, away from Toll signaling and toward hemocyte proliferation. We also found downregulation of some genes that have been implicated in melanization (<italic>PPO2</italic>, <italic>yellow-c</italic>), which may be explained by experimental variation (in particular for early phases of the response, see Material and Methods) or by species-specific differences in immune regulation and allocation.</p><p>Although we identified <italic>Galerucella</italic> homologs for a wide array of <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune genes and provide molecular support for the previously reported difference in immune competence of <italic>G.&#x000a0;calmariensis</italic> and <italic>G.&#x000a0;pusilla</italic>, there are limitations. First, we were unable to annotate fast evolving genes, among which will be many immune genes such as antimicrobial peptides (<xref rid="evaa075-B33" ref-type="bibr">Sackton et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>). Also, previous work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has suggested that effector and protease proteins may rapidly diversify as a result of duplication events during host&#x02013;parasite coevolutionary process (<xref rid="evaa075-B33" ref-type="bibr">Sackton et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evaa075-B41" ref-type="bibr">Waterhouse et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="evaa075-B34" ref-type="bibr">Salazar-Jaramillo et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>), even between closely related species, and if this duplication is common also in our taxa, our ability to correctly annotate these genes could be limited. Second, identifying real orthologs of multigene families is difficult and even when possible may not reveal their true function. This may be the case for some of effectors, members of the hexamerin family, including phenoloxidases and for regulators of cellular immunity. Third, immune effectors would have been undetected if they were neither induced upon wasp infestation nor expressed constitutively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Through a combination of de novo assembly and differential expression analysis, we elucidate regulatory differences underlying the contrasting immunocompetence between two closely related <italic>Galerucella</italic> species.
