While it is known that specific crustose coralline algae (CCA) are important for settlement of some coral species, the role of algal chemical compounds versus surface microbial biofilms has long been ambiguous. Using a model system - a CCA of a genus that has been shown to induce high levels of settlement of <italic>Acropora</italic> corals (<italic>Titanoderma cf</italic>. <italic>tessellatum</italic>) and an abundant coral species (<italic>Acropora millepora</italic>)- we show that chemical effects of CCA are stronger than those from CCA surface microbial biofilms as drivers of coral settlement. Biofilms contributed to some extent to larval settlement via synergistic effects, where microbial cues were dependent on the CCA primary metabolism (production of dissolved organic carbon). We propose that optimal coral settlement is caused by complex biochemical communications among CCA, their epiphytic microbial community and coral larvae.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council (ARC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP120101778</award-id><award-id>DP160103071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz-Pulido</surname><given-names>Guillermo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Great Barrier Reef Foundation</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Recruitment of sessile organisms is a crucial ecological process that impacts the structure and maintenance of marine communities through the successful dispersal and settlement of mobile propagules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Larval settlement is a vital step in the life cycle of many invertebrates such as reef-building corals, as settlement defines the transition of motile larvae from the water column to the seafloor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

Thus, a key bottleneck to the recovery of decimated coral populations is the ability of larvae to successfully settle and recruit to optimal substrata<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. It is well documented that particular species of crustose coralline algae (CCA, a group of calcifying red algae) are the preferred settlement substrate for numerous coral species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, any disruption to CCA-coral settlement interactions is of particular concern to recruitment success. There is some evidence demonstrating that ocean acidification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, elevated sea temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, reduced grazing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and poor water quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> alter the ecological interactions required for optimal coral settlement onto CCA. Although important progress has been made in the field of coral settlement &#x02013; CCA interactions and in the nature of the chemical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and microbiological<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> cues for settlement, little is known about how these cues interact to facilitate larval settlement.</p><p id="Par3">Interspecific interactions between coral larvae and CCA can be mediated by mechanisms originated in the algal thallus or by mechanisms associated with microbial communities (including bacteria) living on the surface of the algal crust. Coral larvae actively explore the benthos and are capable of sensing these cues to find suitable settlement substrate at a very fine scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Not all species of CCA facilitate larval settlement and there are in fact several CCA species that are actively avoided by coral larvae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. For those CCA species that facilitate settlement, intrinsic factors in CCA driving coral settlement are mainly of chemical nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, although there is evidence suggesting that spectral cues (e.g. CCA colour) may also be important for settlement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Other unknown factors of the CCA such as the type of skeletal mineralogy, photosynthetic pigments, and/or changes in oxygen and pH of the boundary layer due to CCA metabolism, may influence the settlement behaviour of coral larvae as well. Multiple studies have shown that corals from Caribbean and Pacific reefs, that brood or spawn their offspring, are induced to settle by contact with non-polar compounds derived from the CCA thalli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, brooding and spawning corals have also been shown to settle in response to microbial biofilms living on the surface of CCA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Hence, despite the considerable advances in our understanding of the ecology of coral larvae and the role of CCA as inducers of coral larval settlement, it remains unclear whether coral settlement is mediated by intrinsic (i.e. compounds produced by CCA) or extrinsic (i.e. surface microbial community) or both properties of CCA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). Further, interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic factors may exacerbate or inhibit the strength of substrate preference by coral larvae (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), yet complex interactions between the intrinsic and extrinsic components of CCA have not been investigated previously.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanisms of coral larval settlement induction facilitated by crustose coralline algae (CCA).

(<bold>c</bold>) In this study we suggest that coral settlement is the result of a synergistic interaction between CCA-chemical compounds (i.e. morphogens) and the CCA-epiphytic microbial biofilms.

We specifically focused on the effect of, and interactions between, intrinsic factors such as (primary and secondary) metabolites synthesized by CCA, and extrinsic factors such as CCA epiphytic microbial biofilms on coral larval settlement. Primary metabolites include products from the basic algal metabolism (e.g. photosynthesis) that are directly released to the environment and are waterborne, for instance dissolved organic carbon (DOC, mainly carbohydrates); there are however some primary metabolites produced by the algae which are not released to the environment. Algal DOC may be an important energy source for microbial biofilms and/or coral larvae (e.g. as suggested for mussel larvae by Barnard <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>). Secondary metabolites, on the other hand, include hydrophobic compounds produced by the algae which can remain on the CCA surface and can have detrimental or beneficial effects on certain organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest a positive role of CCA-chemical compounds as drivers of coral larval settlement in a common reef coral, while the CCA epiphytic microbial communities play a complementary role in the induction of larval settlement, which is reliant on the DOC supplied by CCA. Understanding the ecological mechanisms driving early life history stages is fundamental to comprehend the processes that facilitate the replenishment of coral populations, which is particularly important in the context of the current degradation of coral reefs world-wide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">Experimental results revealed complex interactions among chemical extracts, DOC, and microbes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>: significant interactions among three factors: three-way ANOVA n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5, <italic>F</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.01, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008.

These contentions need not be mutually exclusive, but our experimental results suggest that the chemical stimulatory effects of the coralline alga <italic>Titanoderma cf</italic>. <italic>tessellatum</italic> (genus shown to induce high levels of coral settlement in the Pacific and Caribbean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>) are stronger than the effects of surface microbes as drivers of larval settlement of <italic>Acropora millepora</italic> corals. We also show, however, that surface microbial biofilms contribute to some extent to larval settlement and, importantly, induction is further stimulated by DOC exudates typical of red algae (i.e. DOC in the form of waterborne sugars). We suggest that settlement of a dominant coral species is predominantly driven by CCA-chemical compounds, but is also mediated by complex interactions and synergies between intrinsic and extrinsic (CCA-epiphytic bacteria) mechanisms of the coralline algae.</p><p id="Par9">The role of CCA- chemical compounds as inducers of coral settlement has been proposed for more than 30 years when it was discovered that CCA were a key group of benthic organisms that induce settlement of marine invertebrate larvae, including corals and abalones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

The study by Tebben <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> was the first to clearly indicate that coral settlement was triggered by CCA- morphogens, showing that algal chemical cues induced identical rates of larval settlement as live CCA. The authors also showed that the removal of bacterial communities did not alter coral settlement rates. Our results confirm a positive effect of cues originating from chemical mechanisms of the CCA on coral larval settlement. We also provide novel information by resolving the complexity of interactions between the cues from CCA- chemical compounds and surface microbial biofilms, suggesting that these two mechanisms act multiplicatively on coral settlement. Since the bioactive compound extracted in our experiment is hydrophobic (G&#x000f3;mez-Lemos <italic>et al</italic>. forthcoming), larvae must establish contact with the CCA surface (epithallus) to sense the cues and be induced to settle (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). This effect of CCA-compounds and biofilms, however is strongly dependent on CCA dissolved organic compounds (waterborne primary metabolites), suggesting an important synergy between the primary and secondary algal metabolism and epiphytic microbial biofilms as drivers of coral settlement induction. It is also possible that some of the effects of CCA on coral larval behaviour are related to other factors of the live CCA including colour (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>), or changes in pH in the boundary layer due to algal metabolism. Since we are unable to tease apart the effect of colour or metabolic activity of live CCA from that of chemical compounds, biofilms and DOC, the relative contribution of these factors to larval settlement warrants further study.</p><p id="Par10">Synergistic interactions between coral settlement cues produced by microbial biofilms and coralline algal DOC had not been documented in the literature, although the important role of bacteria (e.g. <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>) and their compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> on coral settlement is well known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

Thus, the effect of microbial biofilms on coral larval settlement interacts synergistically with the production of CCA waterborne metabolites (i.e. DOC). Primary producers such as CCA exudate variable amounts of photosynthetic products (photosynthates) in the form of DOC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, which are transported through water and are known to stimulate the activity and growth of microbial communities in reefs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. It has been demonstrated that four of the five carbohydrates used in our settlement assays as a proxy of red algal DOC (galactose, glucose, mannose and xylose, ranked from the highest to the lowest concentration within natural and artificial DOC), facilitate increased rates of bacterial growth on reef biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Johnson and Sutton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> found that bacteria require soluble compounds from the CCA <italic>Lithothamnium pseudosorum</italic> (likely <italic>Lithothamnion proliferum</italic>) to produce the settlement inducer for larvae of the crown-of-thorn starfish and suggested that bacteria are only inductive if they have access to algal-derivate substrates. The specific pathways by which DOC mediates the action of bacteria as inducer of coral larval settlement cannot be deduced from our experiment. However, it is likely that DOC exudates released by the CCA primary metabolism promote microbial communities that are beneficial for coral larval settlement, potentially providing the precursors required for the synthesis of bacterial morphogenic signalling substances. Barott <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> suggested complex interplays between DOC, CCA and adult corals as important mediators of space competition between corals and benthic algae. The reasons behind the lack of larval settlement induction by the CCA microbial biofilms in the absence of DOC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) are unclear, but may include differences in microbial communities between experimental treatments. Further, since CCA not only release dissolved organic matter but also harbour a bulk fraction of poorly soluble organic matter on their surfaces, the type of dissolved organic matter added (or the lack of some compounds) in the experiment may have altered the nature of the surface bacterial biofilms. Future microbiome analyses as well as detailed characterization of the dissolved and poorly soluble organic matter produced by CCA could shed light into the processes influencing the interactions between microbes, DOC and CCA. We conclude that the role of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>tessellatum</italic> microbial biofilms in the settlement of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>millepora</italic> corals is minor compared to the role of CCA- chemical compounds, and the settlement inductive effect of these microbes is mediated by primary metabolites exuded by the algae.</p><p id="Par11">An unexpected result in our study was the absence of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>millepora</italic> settlement when surface microbial biofilms (obtained from living <italic>T</italic>. <italic>tessellatum</italic>) were incubated on dead <italic>T</italic>. <italic>tessellatum</italic> crusts previously impregnated with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>tessellatum</italic> extracts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This result suggests that the exposure of microbial biofilms to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>tessellatum</italic> extracts may have promoted an atypical and adverse microbial community for larval settlement. It is likely that the CCA chemical extracts (which where dissolved in the methanol solvent) added to dead CCA fragments, contained both surficial (e.g. epithallial/perithallial tissue) as well as more internal chemical compounds (e.g. hypothallial tissue). Some of the extracted compounds may not be present on the surfaces of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>tessellatum</italic> in natural conditions. Consequently, microbes may have interacted with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>tessellatum</italic> internal compounds extracted with methanol, negating any positive inductive effects of CCA chemicals on larval settlement.

An important settlement induction pathway is mediated by chemical cues associated with the algal tissue. Microbial biofilms contributed to a lesser extent to coral settlement via a multiplicative effect. These interactions are, however, mediated via synergistic effects triggered by the release of dissolved organic compounds from the CCA thalli. Further studies are needed to examine the role of DOC production by CCA, as well as the contribution of poorly soluble organic matter on the CCA surfaces in regulating the CCA associated microbial community. Also, the effect of other factors of the CCA, such as colour and/or changes in pH due to CCA metabolism, should be discerned from those of chemical compounds on larval attachment and metamorphosis. Successful coral settlement seems to depend on the effective functioning of the coralline alga holobiont (CCA and associated microbial community).

Results of this experiment demonstrated that the antibiotic treatment used in the larval settlement assays significantly reduced the number of bacteria living on the thalli of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>tessellatum</italic> by one order of magnitude, from 2.61&#x02009;+&#x02009;E10 (SE&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.32&#x02009;+&#x02009;E09) to 5.52&#x02009;+&#x02009;E09 (SE&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.91&#x02009;+&#x02009;E08) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Mann-Whitney test, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7).

This model was created to be applied to experiments where factors are orthogonal to one another, but with only a single group of replicated controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. In our experiment, we only had one seawater control treatment (with five replicate containers) for logistical reasons, otherwise there would be a very large number of treatments and replicates to be handled at the same time while adding little information to the experiment. Likewise, there was only one group of replicated controls for the methanol addition. To use this model, first data from the treatment levels and the controls were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett <italic>post-hoc</italic> test for multiple comparisons. This first step was conducted to find specific differences between the negative control of filtered seawater and the experimental treatments. This procedure (i.e. one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett test) was also repeated to compare the experimental treatments against the methanol control (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Once those differences were stablished, larval settlement means were compared with a three-way ANOVA with CCA- chemical compounds (two levels: presence and absence of CCA- chemical compounds), CCA-associated bacteria (two levels: presence and reduction (absence) of CCA- associated bacteria), and CCA-DOC (two levels addition and no addition of synthetic CCA- DOC) as fixed factors and containers (wells) as replicates. Significant interactions occurred between treatments, therefore we conducted subsequent two-way and one-way ANOVAs within treatment combinations, followed by Tukey tests (see Supplementary Information, Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Data were checked for normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test and for homogeneity of variance using a Levene&#x02019;s test. Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were not attained; therefore, data were Arc-sin transformed. Data from the antibiotic efficacy test were not normally distributed following transformation; consequently, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.22.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
