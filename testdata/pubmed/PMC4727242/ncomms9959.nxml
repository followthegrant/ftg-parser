Here, we find that <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> transcription is intimately linked to the transcription of the proximal upstream gene <italic>PTPN6 (SHP1)</italic> in all physiological conditions tested. <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> are transcriptionally co-regulated by two complementary mechanisms. First, a bypass of the regular <italic>PTPN6</italic> polyadenylation signal allows the transcription of the downstream miR-200c/141. Second, the promoters of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> transcription units physically interact through a 3-dimensional DNA loop and exhibit similar epigenetic regulation. Our findings highlight that transcription of intergenic miRNAs is a novel outcome of transcriptional read-through and reveal a yet unexplored type of DNA loop associating two closely located promoters.

Finally, these miRNAs accumulate and play a key role in ovarian tumorigenesis and chemosensitivity, the oxidative stress response being one important feature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Given the important role of miR-200 family members in oxidative stress response and ovarian tumorigenesis, understanding their regulation in these conditions is of major interest. Here we focus on the regulation of the intergenic miR-200 genomic cluster comprising miR-200c and miR-141. Previous studies have identified ZEB1/ZEB2 and p53 transcription factors as regulators of the expression of these miRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Moreover, epigenetic marks such as DNA and histone methylation have also been linked to miR-200 expression, especially between epithelial and mesenchymal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. However, despite these efforts, the regulatory mechanisms involved in miR-200 expression are still far from being completely understood.</p><p>In contrast to intronic miRNAs that are frequently transcribed along with their host genes, it is widely assumed that the regulation of intergenic miRNAs, such as miR-200c and miR-141, relies on their own promoters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. We show here that transcription of intergenic miRNAs can also be modulated by their surrounding genes. Indeed, alternative polyadenylation (APA) and transcriptional read-through of an upstream gene can be new means of producing intergenic miRNAs. APA concerns about half of the human genes. APA shortens or lengthens the 3&#x02032;-extremity of messenger RNAs and subsequently affects mRNA stability or protein translation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Although it has not yet been described to date, a new outcome for APA could be the transcription of miRNAs located between two alternative polyA sites. Another yet unexplored mechanism that could also participate in the regulation of intergenic miRNA expression is a chromatin interaction between its promoter and another regulatory locus. Recent reports underline the functionality of both long-range and short-range chromatin contacts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Short-range DNA loops can bring together the promoter and terminator regions of the same gene. This type of DNA conformation, called &#x02018;gene-loop', plays a role in transcriptional memory and directionality and has been identified from yeast to mammals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. However, the role of such DNA interactions on intergenic miRNA regulation has not been established so far.</p><p>Here, we show evidence that the miR-200c/141 intergenic cluster is regulated through two original complementary mechanisms: the read-through of the transcription of a neighbouring gene and the three-dimensional (3D) chromatin interaction involving the miRNA promoter region. We demonstrate that the transcription of miR-200c/141 is tightly associated with that of <italic>PTPN6</italic> (also called <italic>SHP1</italic>), a gene whose 3&#x02032; extremity is located less than 3 kilobases upstream of the miRNAs. We show that the bypass of the usual <italic>PTPN6</italic> polyadenylation signal can lead to the transcription of miR-200c/141, and we reveal the existence of a 3D DNA conformation associating the promoters of these two genes. Together, our data indicate a physiological relevance of <italic>PTPN6</italic> expression in <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> regulation in all tested situations. We propose that the systematic correlation between these two genes in several different contexts is due to transcriptional read-through of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene and a previously unexplored type of DNA loop associating two closely located promoters.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>miR-200c and miR-141 are regulated at transcriptional level</title><p>Regulation of miR-200c and miR-141 (hereafter referred to as miR-200c/141) expression represents a crucial step in ovarian tumorigenesis and stress response. A better understanding of their regulation deserved further investigation in these two related pathophysiological conditions. As both miR-200c and miR-141 are transcribed from the same genomic locus, we first observed that the levels of the two mature miRNAs were directly proportional to their corresponding primary transcript (below referred to as <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic>) in the diverse conditions analysed, that is, following acute oxidative stress and in high-grade ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Indeed, the kinetics of miR-200c/141 accumulation after exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> followed the increase of <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> transcript in epithelial or fibroblast cell lines from both human or mouse origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). We detected oxidative stress-mediated miR-200c/141 upregulation in all cell lines tested, except those already expressing high basal concentrations of the miR-200c/141, such as IGROV-1 cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). Similarly, basal levels of mature and primary miR-200c/141 were found significantly correlated in different ovarian and breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) as well as in a cohort of 107 human primary HGSOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for description of the cohort). This suggested that the accumulation of miR-200c and miR-141 relies mainly on the regulation of their transcription, rather than on maturation steps. Accordingly, treatment with actinomycin D, an effective transcriptional inhibitor, abolished the increase of miR-200c and miR-141 upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that transcription is a major regulatory step controlling the accumulation of mature miR-200c/141.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>miR-200c/141 transcription is coupled to <italic>PTPN6</italic> expression</title><p>We first observed that neither ZEB nor TP53 protein was involved in the upregulation of miR-200c/141 by oxidative stress in ovarian cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism involved was complementary to those previously described. We thus analysed the genomic locus from which these miRNAs are transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We first tested whether transcription of the miR-200c/141 neighbouring genes could be affected by acute oxidative stress. We observed that the transcription of the immediate upstream gene, <italic>PTPN6</italic>, was significantly increased following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, whereas the downstream gene, <italic>PHB2</italic>, remained invariant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, the kinetics of <italic>PTPN6</italic> upregulation was strikingly similar to this one of the miR-200c/141 primary transcript, <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The coupling between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> primary transcripts upon stress was observed in 12 different cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>), suggesting a conserved mechanism of co-regulation in mammals. Moreover, this coupled transcription was also observed upon treatments increasing reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Furthermore, the remarkable association between <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> and <italic>pri-PTPN6</italic> transcription was not restricted to stress conditions but also observed at basal state in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). We further confirmed this result by validating the correlation between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and miR-200c/141 levels in publicly available data sets from two large cell line panels, the NCI60 panel and the Sanger Cell Line Project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that miR-200c/141 and <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcriptions are tightly associated in a variety of cell lines at basal state and upon oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Pri-miR-200/PTPN6</italic> transcripts are coupled in ovarian cancer</title><p>As miR-200c/141 have been repeatedly defined as key regulators of human ovarian tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, we next wondered whether the correlation of expression between miR-200c/141 and <italic>PTPN6</italic> was also observed in HGSOC. We first observed that the expression of the two miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and their corresponding primary transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) were correlated with <italic>PTPN6</italic> mRNA levels in a cohort of 107 HGSOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Correlation between miR-200c/141 and <italic>PTPN6</italic> expression was further validated in the publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> composed by 574 HGSOC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and details of the cohort are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Genomic amplifications have been previously described in HGSOC on the chromosome 12p13, including the genomic locus from which the <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> and <italic>PTPN6</italic> are transcribed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. We hypothesized that genomic amplification could contribute to the observed correlation between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> transcription levels in these tumours. We thus computed the Transcription Correlation Scores (TCS) of this genomic region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), TCS reflecting the degree of correlation of each gene with its neighbours, as defined previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. We observed a peak of correlation in the TCS map around the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene in both Institut Curie and TCGA cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). We analysed the copy number alterations of HGSOC samples and classified the patients, referred to as unchanged or amplified/deleted, according to their genomic status in this specific region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). When we restricted the analysis to patients of the unchanged subgroup, the TCS peak observed around the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene with all patients was lost in both cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c,d</xref>), revealing this peak was indeed because of genomic alterations. In contrast, the correlation between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> transcription was maintained in patients with no copy number alteration in this locus (unchanged subgroup; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Interestingly, in this subgroup, the correlation was restricted to <italic>PTPN6</italic>, and was not observed with <italic>PHB2</italic>, the downstream gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Accordingly, the same findings were obtained from the TCGA cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>), strengthening the validity of such data. In this cohort, mature miRNA levels were analysed, as <italic>pri-miRNA-200c-141</italic> levels were not available. It is noteworthy that <italic>PTPN6</italic> was ranked the 13th-most correlated gene with miR-200c among the 12,044 genes tested, in the TCGA cohort. Together, these results indicate that the transcriptional co-regulation between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and miR-200c/141 is a relevant process for the expression of the two miRNAs in HGSOC independently of genomic alterations.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Two complementary mechanisms drive miR-200c/141 expression</title><p>To explain the tight correlation between <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> and <italic>PTPN6</italic> primary transcripts, we considered two non-exclusive hypotheses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). In the first hypothesis, the <italic>PTPN6</italic> primary transcription bypasses its usual polyadenylation site, thereby promoting the downstream expression of miR-200c/141. In this case, <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> transcription results from either an APA of <italic>PTPN6</italic> mRNA or a late termination of <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcription. In the second hypothesis, <italic>pri-PTPN6</italic> and <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcripts are produced from two independent but co-regulated promoters. This co-regulation could be mediated by a spatial DNA conformation, favouring shared regulation by common transcription factors and/or epigenetic marks. The two mechanisms could work together, with PTPN6 bypass favouring the transcription initiation at the miRNA locus, for example. It is worth noting that the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene has two alternative promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Here, we were interested in the most 5&#x02032; one, also called P1, which is the one used in almost all cell types, except haematopoietic cells, in which P2 is active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. We will refer below to <italic>PTPN6</italic> P1 promoter as <italic>PTPN6</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The polyadenylation site of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene is bypassed</title><p>We first demonstrated the existence of a transcript, downstream of the polyadenylation site of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene and upstream of the miR-200c/141-coding region (schema <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This intermediate transcript (assessed with <italic>Set 1</italic> primers, compatible with quantitative reverse transcription&#x02013;PCR (qRT&#x02013;PCR) experiments) accumulated with the same kinetics as <italic>PTPN6</italic> primary transcript upon oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, left panel, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>, left panel). As expected according to the clear correlation between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic>, this intermediate transcript followed also the same kinetics as <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, right panel, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>, right panel). We thus speculated that this intermediate transcript was the result of a transcriptional read-through from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene. In agreement with the assumption that <italic>PTPN6</italic> read-through led to the transcription of the downstream miR-200c/141, this intermediate transcript was also correlated with the <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> in HGSOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, right). Moreover, we also detected a significant correlation between the expression levels of this intermediate transcript and <italic>PTPN6</italic> primary transcript in HGSOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, left). Importantly, a read-through from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene was also detected in RNA-seq data generated from a set of cell lines in the ENCODE project and visualized using the UCSC Genome Browser (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The levels of expression of the intermediate transcript, while being much lower than mature (exonic) <italic>PTPN6</italic> mRNA as expected, reached the same expression rate as the <italic>pri-PTPN6</italic> primary (intronic) transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). We next demonstrated that this intermediate transcript resulted from the bypass of the usual polyadenylation site of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d,e</xref>). Indeed, we detected both spliced and unspliced transcripts extending from <italic>PTPN6</italic>-coding sequence to the downstream region of its usual polyadenylation site, in both mouse and human cells at basal states and following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure (<italic>Set 2</italic> primers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). Importantly, the same type of transcript was also detected in human HGSOC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, bottom). Furthermore, we confirmed that these bypassed <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcripts reached the <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> sequence both in cell lines and in HGSOC (<italic>Set 3</italic> primers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>), thus showing that <italic>PTPN6</italic> read-through could indeed reach the miR-200c/141 locus and impact directly <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> expression. The products amplified using the <italic>Set 2</italic> and <italic>Set 3</italic> couples of primers were cloned and sequenced, in order to verify that they corresponded to the region located between <italic>PTPN6</italic> 3&#x02032;-end and <italic>miR-200c-141</italic> 5&#x02032;-end. It was noteworthy that this intermediate transcript was detected at the same levels by quantitative PCR (qPCR) by using either random hexamers or oligo dT in the reverse transcription reaction, suggesting it was polyadenylated. Consistently, using the 3&#x02032; Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) methodology, we identified APA sites reached by the <italic>pri-PTPN6/pri-miR-200c-141</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>). These observations thus demonstrate that the read-through transcription from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene can reach the <italic>miR-200c-141</italic> encoding unit and that the levels of these transcripts are comparable. According to these results, the transcriptional co-regulation between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c-141</italic> genes can result from late termination of transcription by RNA-polymerase II or APA (hypothesis 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>PTPN6</italic> read-through drives <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> transcription</title><p>We next wondered in which proportion the read-through from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene participates to <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> transcription. We quantified the expression rates of each RNA entity detected along <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c-141</italic> genomic locus, namely the <italic>pri-PTPN6</italic> primary transcript, the intermediate transcript (RNA detected downstream <italic>PTPN6</italic> polyadenylation signal and upstream <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoter) and the <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcript, whose synthesis could result from both <italic>PTPN6</italic> read-through and transcription from miR-specific promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Two experimental proceedings were adopted to quantify these weakly expressed molecules. First, nuclear RNA was used, in order to increase sensitivity of the assay. Second, <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> amount was evaluated using qPCR primers located outside of a previously described expressed sequence tag (EST) (grey boxes <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). This avoided bias related to different RNA stability (when comparing EST and intronic RNA) and allowed comparison with intronic <italic>pri-PTPN6</italic> and intermediate transcript in absolute quantities. Based on standard curves obtained on serial dilutions of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA corresponding to the same genomic locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>), we first observed that the quantity of the intermediate transcript was equivalent to the level of the <italic>pri-PTPN6</italic> and <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcripts in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells at basal state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Indeed, in these cells, although the expression rate was faint, data indicated that all molecules of <italic>pri-PTPN6</italic> primary transcript were able to bypass <italic>PTPN6</italic> polyadenylation signal (ratio <italic>Intermediate transcript/pri-PTPN6</italic>=1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Moreover, all intermediate transcripts gave rise to <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcripts (ratio <italic>pri-miR-200c-141/Intermediate transcript</italic>=1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c;</xref> see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref> for schematic representation of the data). Upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure, <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcription initiation (evaluated by the <italic>pri-PTPN6</italic> transcript quantity) increased fivefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>), whereas the levels of the intermediate transcript was only induced threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5d,e</xref>). Indeed, only 56&#x00025; of <italic>PTPN6</italic> primary transcripts were able to bypass <italic>PTPN6</italic> polyadenylation signal, suggesting that <italic>PTPN6</italic> read-through was reduced by oxidative stress. Still, the totality of the 56&#x00025; intermediate transcript contributed to <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcription (ratio <italic>pri-miR-200c-141/Intermediate transcript</italic>=1) in SKOV3 following oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we evaluated the role of <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcription and read-through in stress-induced <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> transcription by using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). In that aim, we deleted the genomic region containing the two promoters (P1 and P2) driving <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcription in epithelial and haematopoietic cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We decided to avoid the use of a selection gene, which would have required the insertion of an independent promoter with the risk of an ectopic transcriptional start in the <italic>PTPN6</italic> locus. We selected two stable cell lines from parental SKOV3 cells (SKOV3-&#x00394;1 and SKOV3-&#x00394;2) based on PCR and qPCR genotyping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b&#x02013;d</xref>). Genomic deletion of <italic>PTPN6</italic> promoters reduced significantly <italic>PTPN6</italic> upregulation by oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>, left), as expected for a transcriptional-dependent regulation. Importantly, depletion of <italic>PTPN6</italic> promoters also prevented the induction of both the intermediate transcript and the <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>, middle and right). These experiments demonstrate that <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcription is required for <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> upregulation upon stress. Taken as a whole, these results show that the transcriptional read-through from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene leads to the transcription of the <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> and explains, at least in part, how <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcription could regulate miR-200c/141 levels following oxidative stress in ovarian cancer cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoters share epigenetic marks</title><p>As described above, we observed a strict correlation between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>pri-miRNA-200c-141</italic> transcription. It has been previously shown that <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> transcription can be initiated downstream from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene and regulated by an independent promoter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In addition to the read-through of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene, we thus next checked whether the transcription of <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> could be initiated at its closest transcriptional start site (TSS). Indeed, <italic>PTPN6</italic> bypass could reach miR-200c/141 locus but also favour transcription initiation of poised RNA Polymerase II on miRNA TSS. Using 5&#x02032;RACE method, we were able to confirm the existence of a capped mRNA entity, whose 5&#x02032;-extremity was compatible with previously identified EST located upstream of miR-200c (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments confirmed RNA polymerase II recruitment at <italic>PTPN6</italic> P1 and <italic>miR 200c/141</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c,d</xref>). Thus, in addition to transcripts generated through the bypass of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> polyA site, <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> expression can also be initiated at their independent promoter. As we observed a striking correlation between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> transcription, we next wondered if the two promoters could share regulatory mechanisms. By performing methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments, we showed that <italic>PTPN6</italic>- and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic>-specific promoters were both methylated in cell lines with low expression of miR-200c/141 and demethylated in cells characterized by high-miR-200c/141 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>), confirming previous results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Accordingly, both <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>pri-miRNA-200c-141</italic> genes were upregulated upon treatment with a DNA demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). As expected, the <italic>PTPN6</italic> haematopoietic promoter P2 is highly methylated in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, the active histone methylation marks H3K9Ac and H3K4me3 enrichment were in complete agreement with DNA methylation status in all cell lines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoters could be under equivalent epigenetic regulation. We further extended this observation to 46 non-haematopoietic cell lines of the ENCODE project, in which the methylation states of <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoters were correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). Finally, in HGSOC from the TCGA cohort, although miR-200c/141 expression levels were globally high, the methylation status of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> promoter was significantly negatively correlated with the miR-200c/141 expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>), highlighting the relevance of our findings not only in cultured cell lines but also in human cancers. In conclusion, <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> regulatory regions exhibit similar epigenetic marks and might share epigenetic-regulatory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoters interact via a DNA loop</title><p>We finally wondered how their promoters of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> genes could be so finely co-regulated. We hypothesized that co-transcription of the two genes could result from a physical interaction between their promoters, thus facilitating regulation by common molecules, such as epigenetic regulators. To test this hypothesis, we performed chromosome conformation capture (3C) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>) that quantifies interaction frequency between genomic regions with high sensitivity for short-range chromatin interaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. We first performed 3C experiments on the IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cell line expressing high levels of <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c,d</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref> for comparative quantification of <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcripts in IGROV-1 and SKOV3 cell lines). Interestingly, we uncovered an interaction between <italic>PTPN6</italic>- and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic>-specific promoters, using a primer anchor (anchor 1) located at the <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>). The DNA loop detected using the anchor 1 brings together the 5&#x02032;-end sequences of <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> and the <italic>PTPN6</italic> promoter regions. This interaction was further validated by the use of a reciprocal primer (anchor 2) located in the <italic>PTPN6</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>). Using anchor 2, we observed that <italic>PTPN6</italic> promoter not only interacts with <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoter, but also with a large genomic locus of &#x0223c;10 kilobases in length. This locus includes the <italic>PTPN6</italic> 3&#x02032;-extremity, the <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoter region and a region downstream from the miRNAs that reaches the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>PHB2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>). Thus, <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene is organized in a 3D gene-loop-like structure, which includes the <italic>PTPN6</italic> promoter and its 3&#x02032;-extremity but also the <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> locus. In SKOV3 cells, characterized by low levels of <italic>pri-PTPN6</italic> and <italic>pri-miR-200c/141</italic> transcripts, the physical interaction between the two promoters was undetectable with the primer anchor 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8e</xref>). Similarly, using the primer anchor 2, the interaction frequency between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-141/200c</italic> promoters was close to background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8f</xref>). Although the <italic>PTPN6</italic> intragenic-loop (bringing together <italic>PTPN6</italic> 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends) was still detected, it did not include the large downstream region containing <italic>the miR-200c/141</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8f</xref>). Moreover, although detectable, the interaction between <italic>PTPN6</italic> 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends was lower in SKOV3 than in IGROV-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d,f</xref>). This was expected as intragenic DNA loops have already been associated with transcriptional activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Altogether, these observations suggest that high-level expression of both <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> genes is associated with the formation of a 3D DNA loop associating their respective promoters. Still, the upregulation of both <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> transcription by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in SKOV3 cells was not enough to induce a detectable change in the 3D conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8g,h</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DNA loop is associated with increased read-through</title><p>Finally, we investigated whether the DNA loop observed between the <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoters in IGROV-1 cells could favour the read-through from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene. To do so, we compared <italic>PTPN6</italic> primary transcript levels with that of the intermediate transcript in IGROV-1 and SKOV3 cells upon stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8i,j</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref> for RT-negative controls). The ratio between intermediate transcript and <italic>PTPN6</italic> primary transcript levels was of 1 in IGROV-1 cell line, whereas of 0.56 in SKOV3 upon stress, indicating that the DNA loop is associated with increased read-through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8j</xref>). In both SKOV3 and IGROV-1 cells, the levels of the different transcripts detected along the intermediate region and the <italic>pri</italic>-<italic>miR-200c-141</italic> genomic locus were equivalent among them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8i</xref>). This means that independently of <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcription initiation rate and percentage of bypass, each molecule of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> bypassed transcript corresponds to one molecule of <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcript, indicating a major role of the read-through. We also analysed the different quantities of the <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcript (intronic isoform) with this one of the exonic isoform, corresponding to previously described <italic>ESTs</italic> (referred to as <italic>pri-miR(EST),</italic> see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> for genomic localization). Globally, the quantity detected of <italic>pri-miR(EST)</italic> was at least tenfold higher than <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcript (intronic isoform), most probably because <italic>pri-miR(EST)</italic> is stabilized and/or submitted to additive regulation. Here again, we observed that the differential expression between the two cell lines was maintained and 2.4-times higher in IGROV-1 than in SKOV3&#x0002b;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8k</xref>). Taken as a whole, our work shows that the 3D DNA loop linking <italic>PTPN6-</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic>-specific promoters contributes, with the transcriptional bypass of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> polyadenylation site, to the fine co-regulation of these two transcript units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>We provide here evidence that intergenic miRNAs can be regulated through a transcriptional read-through and a 3D chromatin interaction between different promoters.

Understanding the mechanisms involved in their regulation is an important question to highlight new insights of their functions in these patho-physiological conditions, especially in the characterization of ovarian cancer molecular subgroups. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription rate of the <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> transcription unit is a crucial step in determining mature miRNAs levels within cells, both at basal state and upon stress. Moreover, we unravel two original and complementary mechanisms by which the transcription of <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> is regulated: a transcriptional read-through of an upstream gene, <italic>PTPN6,</italic> and a transcription co-regulation mediated through a 3D DNA loop linking the two closely located <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoters.</p><p>Data from the last decade demonstrated that chromatin conformation is not randomly determined and has important roles in gene regulation. Studies in yeast have shown that DNA loops linking promoter and terminator regions of the same gene are important for transcriptional memory and directionality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Examples of such 3D DNA conformation have also been described in humans and were associated with transcriptional repression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Our data uncover a new example of such short-range chromatin interaction in human cells that can participate in miRNA regulation. Indeed, we highlight here a chromatin interaction that brings close together the promoters of <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> genes. Importantly, the chromatin loop we discovered between these two transcription units (<italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic>) does not correspond to the gene-loops previously described between the promoter and terminator regions within the same gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. In contrast to these intragenic DNA loops, the chromatin loop we uncovered extends from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> promoter to a region far downstream of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> 3&#x02032;-end, reaching the miR-200c/141 promoter and spanning at least 10 kilobases. Interestingly, we also detected that the promoter region of the <italic>ATN1</italic>-encoding gene, located upstream <italic>PTPN6</italic> may also interact with <italic>PTPN6</italic> and be another partner in the fine regulation of this genomic locus. The interaction between 5&#x02032;-end of <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR</italic> promoter could facilitate the RNA polymerase II recycling from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> 3&#x02032;-end to its start site, as well as from the <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> 3&#x02032;-end to the <italic>PTPN6</italic> start site. Given the strict correlation of transcription between these two genes, we propose that the physical association of the two promoters plays a positive role in their co-regulation. Consistent with this idea, the formation of this 3D DNA loop is linked to the expression rates of the two genes and the proportion of read-through from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene. Although the 3D DNA structure is formed in cells with high basal levels of expression of the two genes, it remains undetected in cells with a low basal expression rate. Accordingly, the levels of DNA methylation and active histone marks, such as H3K9Ac and H3K4me3, are tightly equivalent between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and miR-200c/141 promoters. Some of the epigenetic silencing marks could be reversible and removed by oxidative stress. Our results are in agreement with previous studies showing that in breast, lung, colon, bladder and prostate cancer cells, miR-200c/141 levels are consistent with DNA methylation status and histone modifications detected in their promoter regions. We confirmed these results in ovarian cancer cells and extended them to the promoter of the upstream and co-regulated gene, <italic>PTPN6</italic>. Finally, we demonstrate here that the 3D DNA loop is associated with a 2.5-fold increase in transcription read-through from the upstream gene, <italic>PTPN6</italic>. It is important to note that given the physical interaction between the two promoters that we demonstrated here, the crosslink between the promoters could also contribute to the ChIP experiments results. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the fact that both genes could be under equivalent epigenetic regulation, which is in complete agreement with the coordinated epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of these genes.</p><p>In addition to the DNA loop, our data unravel the read-through from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene, as another original mechanism linking <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> genes. Indeed, we demonstrate the existence of an intermediate transcript extending from the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene to the <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> transcription unit. It is mediated through the transcriptional bypass of the usual <italic>PTPN6</italic> polyA site, allowing the RNA polymerase II to reach the downstream <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> transcription unit. We identified two downstream APA sites used for the termination of the <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcript. The first corresponds to the already established ESTs, located downstream of the miR-200c/141 genomic sequences. The second APA site, located very close to the <italic>PHB2</italic> polyadenylation signal, is conserved between human and mouse species and had not been reported previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). One should note, however, that the polyadenylation of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcripts at these APA sites is not necessarily required for the production of the miRNAs in the same round of <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcription. Indeed, miRNAs can be processed by Drosha co-transcriptionally and a late termination of RNA Pol II polymerization downstream from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> 3&#x02032;-end can be sufficient for the transcription of the downstream miR-200c/141, even when <italic>PTPN6</italic> mRNA is polyadenylated at its usual site. Such regulation of intergenic miRNAs through upstream transcription has been postulated by Proudfoot and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. We give here, for the first time, evidence of this type of miRNA transcription.</p><p>We have investigated to which extent each of these two mechanisms (DNA loop versus <italic>PTPN6</italic> read-through) contributes to <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> primary transcription. The <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> levels being the result of both <italic>PTPN6</italic> read-through and independent transcription initiation, we have carefully assessed the quantity of the different primary transcripts detected along <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> genomic locus. We observed that the read-through from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene is a dominant mechanism in ovarian cancer cells, each molecule of the <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcript corresponding to one molecule of bypassed <italic>PTPN6</italic> polyadenylation signal. Thus, the transcriptional <italic>PTPN6</italic> read-through could be the major mechanism explaining the strikingly similar kinetics of <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> upregulation following stress. Ideally, to demonstrate the impact of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene on <italic>pri-miR-200c-141</italic> transcription, a homozygous genetic knock-out model of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene would be required to definitely prove the role of <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcription on <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> regulation. A natural mutated mouse model for <italic>Ptpn6</italic> exists, the motheaten mice, but as the <italic>Ptpn6</italic> transcription is not impaired in these mice, they are not appropriate to investigate this question. We have thus evaluated if the read-through from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene can influence <italic>miR-200c-141</italic> transcription, by using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Deletion of <italic>PTPN6</italic> promoter demonstrated that <italic>PTPN6</italic> transcription is required for <italic>miR-200c-141</italic> primary transcription in SKOV3 cells. Unfortunately, <italic>PTPN6</italic> silencing is deleterious for the survival of IGROV-1 cells, characterized by high basal <italic>PTPN6</italic> expression rate. Being detected in cells with high expression levels, we can speculate that the 3D chromatin structure and subsequent high interaction frequency between the two promoters favours the co-regulated transcription of the two genes. The read-through molecule can reach the miRNAs locus, as demonstrated previously, or also favour the start of the polymerization from the miR-200c/141 TSS. In contrast, in cell lines that exhibit low basal expression rate of <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic>, such as SKOV3, the interaction frequency between the two promoters is low. Interestingly, our data suggest also that the 3D DNA loop is not only associated with a high rate of transcription initiation but also of read-through from the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene.</p><p>The so finely regulated co-expression of <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> suggest a functional relationship between the two genes. The levels of the miR-200 family members are reproducibly upregulated upon oxidative stress conditions in various cell lines and participate in stress response. Interestingly, the co-regulated gene <italic>PTPN6</italic> encodes for a Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase that is itself implicated in anti-oxidant defense<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. Importantly, in HGSOC, the oxidative stress signature has a prognostic value and the miR-200s are significantly upregulated, as shown by several independent studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In that sense, our data on the mechanism of their regulation give another additive insight into the different ovarian transcriptomic subgroups defined by the miR-200/141. In complete agreement with our results, <italic>PTPN6</italic> is also generally overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells and in HGSOC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. PTPN6 and miR-200s play a physiological role in oxidative stress regulation and interestingly, they have both a negative impact on the p38 pathway. Indeed, in cells depleted for <italic>PTPN6</italic>, the levels of phosphorylated p38 are increased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. The activation of this key redox sensor that is also directly targeted by miR-14/200a (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) is rescued by a treatment with an antioxidant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. Finally, the 3C experiment also revealed that the promoter of the <italic>ATN1</italic> gene, located upstream <italic>PTPN6</italic>, could interact with <italic>PTPN6</italic> 5&#x02032;-end. As ATN1 is involved in OXPHOS regulation and mitochondrial disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>, this observation may represent interesting new clues for the global regulation of this genomic locus by oxidative stress, and for its role in this process. These results are complementary to previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref> showing a reciprocal interaction between miRNA and their regulatory transcription factor. Indeed, one of the largest known mammalian miRNA-containing cluster, Gtl2-Dio3, is regulated by MEF2A, a key transcription factor involved in skeletal muscle. Reciprocally, these miRNA directly target the secreted Fizzled-related protein 2, an inhibitor of the wingless-type (WNT) pathway. These observations are similar to our own findings showing the co-regulation of <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> by oxidative stress, the two exerting a role in oxidative stress response. Altogether, these data give complementary insights of the interplay between miRNA, their regulatory elements and the processes in which they are involved. The kind of transcriptional regulation we describe here are probably not restricted to these miRNAs and other examples of such mechanisms are likely to be discovered in the future.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>All cells lines were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, &#x00023; 41966) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (except for immortalized mouse fibroblasts, which were maintained in 7&#x00025; fetal bovine serum) at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

(<bold>b</bold>) The short-range intergenic DNA-looping formed by the physical interaction between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoters is associated with the transcription rate of the two genes. The grey-shaded ovals indicate the genomic regions, which have been defined as interacting with each other, according to 3C experiments. In cells characterized by high basal levels of <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> transcription, the <italic>PTPN6</italic> promoter can interact with a large region including the 3&#x02032;-end of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene, the <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> promoter and downstream sequences. In cells expressing low basal levels of the two genes, the interaction is restricted to the 3&#x02032;-end of <italic>PTPN6</italic> and does not include <italic>miR-200c/141</italic>. This conformation is not altered by the increased transcription upon oxidative stress (&#x0002b;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), suggesting the existence of another mechanism is responsible for the co-expression of <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> and <italic>PTPN6</italic> following oxidative stress. (<bold>c</bold>) The transcriptional co-regulation between <italic>PTPN6</italic> and <italic>miR-200c/141</italic> can also be mediated by a transcriptional read-through of the <italic>PTPN6</italic> gene. This is highlighted by the intermediate transcripts, linking <italic>PTPN6</italic> to <italic>miR-200c/141</italic>, we identified. These intermediate transcripts can result from alternative polyadenylation or late termination of transcription by RNA-polymerase II, as schematically represented.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms9959-f9"/></fig></floats-group></article>
