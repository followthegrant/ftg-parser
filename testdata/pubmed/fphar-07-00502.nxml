It is essential to evaluate the expression of CYP2E1 in the studies of drug&#x02013;drug interactions and the screening of drugs, natural products, and foodstuffs. The present work is a feasibility study on the development of immunoassays using a specific and sensitive chicken-sourced anti-CYP2E1 IgY antibody. Cloning, expression, and purification of a recombinant CYP2E1 (mice origin) protein were carried out. Anti-CYP2E1 IgY antibodies were generated by immunizing white Leghorn chickens with purified recombinant CYP2E1 protein and were purified by immune affinity chromatography. The IgY titer attained a peak level (&#x02265;1:128,000) after the fifth booster injection. For evaluation of the expression of CYP2E1 in different herbal treatment samples, the mice were treated by oral gavage for 3 days with alcohol (50% 15 mL/kg), acetaminophen (APAP, 300 mg/kg), <italic>Cornus officinalis</italic> extract (100 mg/kg), Alhagi-honey extract (100 mg/kg), <italic>Apocynum venetum</italic> extract (100 mg/kg), hyperoside (50 mg/kg), isoquercetin (50 mg/kg), 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (50 mg/kg), 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (50 mg/kg), and 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (50 mg/kg). The expression of CYP2E1 was determined by Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and immunomagnetic beads (IMBs) using anti-CYP2E1 IgY in liver tissue. The results showed that <italic>C. officinalis</italic> extract, Alhagi-honey extract, <italic>A. venetum</italic> extract, hyperoside, isoquercetin, and their xenobiotics 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid significantly decreased CYP2E1 levels. Alcohol and APAP treatments significantly increased CYP2E1 levels as analyzed with Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. The IMB method is suitable for large-scale screening, and it is a rapid screening (20 min) that uses a portable magnet and has no professional requirements for the operator, which makes it useful for on-the-spot analysis. Considering these results, the anti-CYP2E1 IgY could be applied as a novel research tool in screening for the CYP2E1 inhibitor/enhancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1)</kwd><kwd>chicken egg yolk antibody (IgY)</kwd><kwd>falconoid</kwd><kwd>alcohol</kwd><kwd>APAP</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="34"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 is one of the key enzymes in the metabolism of numerous low molecular weight (&#x0003c;100 Da) endogenous compounds and many xenobiotics. This enzyme is highly induced by food or beverage constituents (alcohol), drugs (acetaminophen) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Hartman et al., 2015</xref>), and pollutants (styrene). CYP2E1 may eliminate potentially toxic compounds and, paradoxically, bioactive compounds in toxins or carcinogens. For example, CYP2E1 is induced during alcohol or acetaminophen (APAP) overdose and results in the formation of ROS and the increased generation of hydroxyl radicals (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Hartman et al., 2015</xref>). Increased oxidative stress from induction of CYP2E1 can damage cellular and mitochondrial components, including mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Demeilliers et al., 2002</xref>). An altered expression of CYP2E1 can influence the disposition of drugs in the body, causing altered plasma drug concentrations and leading to adverse drug reactions or treatment failures. The evaluation of CYP2E1 expression by different assays is the major focus of this article.</p><p>Flavonoids, a wide group of natural products, have gained considerable attention because of their low toxicity and powerful biological activities against many ailments, such as liver disease, cancer, reduced immune function, cardiovascular disease, and hypoglycemia. Flavonoids are widely distributed in plants and enter the human body through tea, vegetables, fruits, health care products, herbal medicines, and other plant-derived products. <italic>Apocynum venetum</italic> L., Alhagi-honey, and <italic>Fructus Corni</italic> are popular herbs in traditional Chinese medicine and are rich in flavonoids. Hyperoside and isoquercetin (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>) are major flavonoids significant for their hepatoprotective effects, but they are poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). After flavonoid administration, colonic bacteria convert flavonoids into several simple phenolic acids &#x02013; such as 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>) (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>) &#x02013; that can be absorbed into the circulation and exert biological effects in the body. CYP2E1 are not only the metabolic enzymes directly involved in hepatic oxidative damage, but they also are important targets of the oxidation mechanism of liver injury. Flavonoids have strong antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties. Therefore, we speculated that flavonoids might be active compounds that can reduce the impact of liver-damaging substances by inhibiting the expression of CYP2E1, which might be one of the hepatoprotective mechanisms of flavonoids. Also, an investigation of the effects of flavonoids on CYP2E1 expression is necessary since some daily foods (purple potato, purple sweet potato, broccoli, bitter gourd, garlic, and tomato), beverages (coffee and cacao polyphenol), and drugs (<italic>Schisandra chinensis</italic>, danshen, <italic>Gelsemium elegans</italic>, isoniazid, diallyl sulfide, sulforaphane, and tamoxifen) are metabolized by CYP2E1 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Vang et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Wargovich, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Konstandi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Shayakhmetova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2016a</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p><bold>The structures of flavonoids and their metabolites.

The most common assay to test the activity of CYP2E1 is a PK-based method, such as HPLC (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Gil et al., 2015</xref>) and HPLC-MS/MS (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Liang and Zheng, 2014</xref>). While these assays are effective in determining the activity of CYP2E1, they require substrates and costly instruments. Another method to test the expression of CYP2E1 is Western blotting. This assay, however, is a time-consuming (more than 6.5 h), complicated operation with many steps, expensive instruments, and no high-throughput screening. This article focuses on the development of a fast, sensitive, convenient, and immuno-based method to determine the expression of CYP2E1.</p><p>IgY is the major serum antibody in avians, amphibians, and reptiles. The significant advantage of using IgY antibodies is that egg collection is non-invasive compared to the stressful bleeding of animals to obtain serum. Also, the absence of immunological cross-reactivity between chicken IgY and mammalian IgG reinforces the advantages of using IgY over IgG as the antibody of choice in some types of immunological reactions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Larsson et al., 1993</xref>). For instance, in immunochemical analysis, cross-reactions are commonly observed between tissue IgG and epitopes shared by the primary antibody and recognized by the secondary mammalian antibody. This cross-reactivity is not observed when IgY is used as the secondary antibody (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Dias da Silva and Tambourgi, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the aim of the present study is to develop an immunoassay to determine CYP2E1 expression in mammals. An anti-CYP2E1 antibody can be applied as an efficient research tool alternative to mammalian sourced antibodies. This study also focuses on investigating flavonoids and their secondary metabolites that may affect CYP2E1 expression and cause medicine/food-medicine interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning and Expression of CYP2E1</title><p>Total mRNA was extracted from a mouse liver using an RNAsimple Total RNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China).

The classical assay to assess the CYP2E1 protein and activity is by PK-based HPLC and HPLC-MS/MS analysis. While these assays are precise and sensitive methods for CYP2E1 detection, CYP2E1-specific substrates and sophisticated instrumentation are required for analysis. In this study, we have developed an alternative analysis immunochemical procedure that is fast and sensitive for CYP2E1 screening. The anti-CYP2E1 antibody was successfully prepared, and the levels of hepatic CYP2E1 expression in different flavonoid treatment groups, as well as alcohol and APAP treatments, were evaluated by different immunoassays.</p><p>The IMB assay is a novel biosensor assay that combines magnetic separation and a visual readout in one step for the determination of biomarkers (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Quantification of the protein being detected is dependent on the degree of IMB aggregation, which is sample-concentration dependent. Compared to other immunoassays, the IMB assay enables readout by the naked eye (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). The aggregated IMBs will present a brown color with a narrow stripe, distinguishable from dispersed IMBs with a yellow coating. In this study, the color change of IMBs could allow the reader to distinguish concentrations of CYP2E1 ranging from 10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup> mg/mL to 1 mg/mL (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref></bold>). Results indicated that the anti-CYP2E1 IgY antibody showed no cross-reactivity with other proteins (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4), indicating that the anti-CYP2E1 IgY antibody is highly specific for CYP2E1; however, the sensitivity of IMB is lower than that for ELISA and Western blotting. Importantly, our IMB tendency is consistent with those using Western blotting, and this semi-quantity is sufficient for preliminary analysis of herbs and compounds. Compared to Western blotting, the IMB method is suitable for large-scale screening, as it is a rapid process (20 min) that applies a portable magnet and does not require a professional for its operation. These features make IMB suitable for on-the-spot analysis. Western blot and ELISA are widely used methods for the immunological detection of proteins. Compared to IgG antibodies, using anti-CYP2E1 IgY antibodies creates a significant difference between each group by ELISA (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>). For example, the levels of CYP2E1 in Alhagi-honey were significantly different from that of the control using the anti-CYP2E1 IgY, while no significant difference was observed using the anti-CYP2E1 IgG, suggesting the anti-CYP2E1 IgY antibody has a good sensitivity and specificity. However, these immunoassays are time-consuming and require complex manipulation and expensive instrumentation. The IMB assay is easily developed into a rapid assay, allowing a one-step process that can be completed within 20 min. IMB is a low-cost and portable diagnostic tool with magnetic beads and a camera, thus meeting the needs of point-of-care-testing and high-throughput screening. Furthermore, IMBs are stable after 24 h in a magnetic field without affecting the results of the IMA sensor (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Chickens are a good choice for the preparation of specific antibodies with high titers developed against highly conserved mammalian antigens due to the evolutionary distance between the source of the antigen (mammals) and the immune system (chickens) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Schade and Hlinak, 1995</xref>). Indeed, it has been widely recognized that the absence of immunological cross-reactivity between chicken IgY and mammalian IgG is determined by the evolutionary divergence (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2004</xref>). In this study, the highest titer of 1:1,280,000 was observed after the fifth booster injection, and it remained elevated for more than 1 month (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref></bold>). IgY is easily produced with large yields of approximately 100 mg IgY per egg yolk (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Schade and Hlinak, 1995</xref>). A total of 84 eggs were collected with anti-CYP2E1 IgY titers of more than 1:25,600 CYP2E1 per egg yolk following four boosters. Western blotting revealed that the anti-CYP2E1 IgY antibody could specifically recognize the CYP2E1 protein. The anti-CYP2E1 IgY antibody showed a lower false positive rate than that of a commercial antibody (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,C</xref></bold>). These findings suggest that anti-CYP2E1 is a valuable research tool for exploring the expression of the CYP2E1 protein.</p><p>An overdose of alcohol or APAP generates the <italic>first hit</italic> on the liver, and the major metabolic enzyme CYP2E1 could generate the <italic>second hit</italic> of cellular injury (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>), particularly when antioxidant reserves are depleted. In this study, higher levels of CYP2E1 expression were observed after alcohol or APAP treatment by different immunoassays. In contrast, <italic>C. officinalis</italic> extract, Alhagi-honey extract, and <italic>A. venetum</italic> extract significantly decreased the expression of CYP2E1. These three herbal medicines can protect the liver against alcohol- or APAP-induced liver injuries in animal models (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Shaker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Nam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that hepatocyte damage was effectively attenuated by <italic>C. officinalis</italic> extract, Alhagi-honey extract, and <italic>A. venetum</italic> extract. To further explore whether the major hepatoprotective effects of flavonoids and their metabolites can inhibit the expression of CYP2E1, hyperoside, isoquercetin, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid were used to modify the expression of CYP2E1 as determined by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and IMB methods. Results showed that these five compounds all inhibited the expression of CYP2E1, suggesting they may protect the liver against alcohol- and APAP-induced injury. The clinical dosages of drugs metabolized by human CYP2E1 might need to be adjusted in patients because these herbal medications may increase the plasma concentrations of these drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, a rapid IMB was developed to test the hepatic expression of CYP2E1 following different flavonoid treatments. This investigation formed the basis for a proof of concept for the use of various applications of anti-CYP2E1 IgY as a screening tool using different immunological methods. Also, the use of anti-CYP2E1 IgY with IMA sensors could be applied as a fast and useful research tool in the development and high-throughput screening of CYP2E1 inhibitor/enhancer compounds by the naked eye based on the color change of the IMBs. Furthermore, this assay may serve as a valuable tool to provide an application for the detection of clinical drug&#x02013;drug interactions observed during early or late drug development.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Northwest A&#x00026;F University for the use of Laboratory Animals.

The mice were sacrificed 24 h with diethyl ether after the last administration. Livers were instantly removed, one part of the liver was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the other part was washed in ice-cold saline and frozen at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C for further study. (2) Chicken immunization &#x02013;7-week-old white Leghorn chickens were first immunized with 250 &#x003bc;g of CYP2E1 protein with Freund&#x02019;s complete adjuvant (FCA; Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), four booster injections with Freund&#x02019;s incomplete adjuvant were injected in 2-week intervals. The last booster with Freund&#x02019;s incomplete adjuvant was injected at a 30-day interval.
