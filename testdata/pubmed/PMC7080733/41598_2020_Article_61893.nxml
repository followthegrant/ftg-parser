Emerging technological advances present an opportunity to provide objective measurements of activity. In a prospective, observational study we utilized a low-cost consumer grade wearable accelerometer (LCA) to determine patient activity (steps per day) preoperatively (baseline) and up to one year (Y1) after cervical and lumbar spine surgery. We studied 30 patients (46.7% male; mean age 57 years; 70% Caucasian) with a baseline activity level of 5624 steps per day. The activity level decreased by 71% in the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative week (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and remained 37% lower in the 2<sup>nd</sup> (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and 23% lower in the 4<sup>th</sup> week (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.015). At no time point until Y1 did patients increase their activity level, compared to baseline. Activity was greater in patients with cervical, as compared to patients with lumbar spine disease. Age, sex, ethnic group, anesthesia risk score and fusion were variables associated with activity. There was no correlation between activity and PROMs, but a strong correlation with depression. Determining activity using LCAs provides real-time and longitudinal information about patient mobility and return of function. Recovery took place over the first eight postoperative weeks, with subtle improvement afterwards.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Physical examination</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Outcomes research</kwd><kwd>Neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>Skeletal muscle</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Patients with degenerative spine disease typically suffer from pain and functional disability, which negatively impact their activity levels and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). For a comprehensive patient evaluation, a variety of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) can be applied. These multi-dimensional questionnaires are considered the gold-standard of self-assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, these self-reported outcome measures are, at best, an approximation of pain and disability before and after surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">More recently, a variety of functional tests have increasingly been applied to quantify objective functional impairment (OFI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In a systematic review of the literature, accelerometer and physical activity analyses using wearable devices ranked among the top five most frequently applied methods for objective outcome measurement in spine care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. To date, the activity levels of about 340 patients with lumbar degenerative diseases of the spine have been reported in nine research articles, which included patients with low back pain (LBP), lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and lumbar disc herniation (LDH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Despite its great potential to contribute to the comprehensive patient evaluation, the current literature on activity tracking in spine patients remains limited. A recent systematic review confirmed that additional studies are needed to determine the strengths and weaknesses of using wearable devices in spine surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, no prior studies have evaluated the use of wearable activity monitors to track postoperative recovery in patients with diseases of the cervical spine. Furthermore, prior studies involving patients with lumbar disorders have had small sample sizes and were restricted to short follow-up periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This study aimed at determining the feasibility of a low-cost consumer grade accelerometer (LCA) for objective assessment of pre- and postoperative step activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par5">In a prospective feasibility study, we utilized LCAs to provide longitudinal activity-based outcome measurements for patients undergoing elective spine surgery. The study was approved by the institutional review board at Stanford University.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>LCA technology</title><p id="Par6">LCAs utilize three-dimensional accelerometers to sense user movement and can continuously measure home and community activity levels. For our study, the Mi Band (Xiaomi, Mountain View, CA (USA)) was utilized. While no device-specific data is available, a body of literature supports the notion that wearable LCAs are generally reliable and are valid indicators of overall physical activity in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">At the time of study inclusion, patients were educated on LCA use by a study physician, including how to properly wear, maintain the device, and sync data to their mobile phones with Bluetooth technology. Patients were encouraged to wear the device as much as possible, though voluntary removal of the device for periods of time did not lead to exclusion from the study. The device was interrogated by study staff for preoperative data extraction and removed on the day of surgery. The device was reapplied immediately post-operatively. Data was extracted again on the day of discharge as well as at each follow-up visit for up to one year post-operatively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Population</title><p id="Par8">Over a 9-month period, we screened adult patients (&#x02265;18 years) presenting at our department&#x02019;s outpatient spine clinic for the first evaluation of a degenerative condition of the subaxial cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine. We offered participation to those owning an iOS or Android smartphone (for compatibility with the Mi Fit app), scheduled for an elective surgical procedure under general anesthesia in more than one week.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par9">Activity tracking was conducted longitudinally. PROMs were assessed in the 30-day period before surgery (baseline), as well as at clinic visits at 3 months (M3) and 1 year (Y1) postoperatively. For this, we used our department&#x02019;s integrated electronic medical record database that collects PROM data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, including a screening for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-)2 for all patients, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for patients with lumbar spine conditions and the Neck Disability Index (NDI) for patients with cervical spine disease.</p><p id="Par10">The ODI and NDI are the most commonly used PROMs for patients with degenerative diseases of the spine, as they include many relevant aspects of life (pain, personal care, common activities) and their reliability and validity has repeatedly been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

Descriptive analyses were used to report activity data (daily steps; mean and standard deviation (SD)), as well as feasibility and safety.</p><p id="Par12">Independent variables were patient age (in years), sex, body mass index (BMI; obesity defined according to the WHO as BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), ethnic background, smoking status (stratified into active/former smokers vs. never smokers), diagnosis, type of procedure (decompression vs. decompression/fusion), number of operated levels (single, two-level or multiple levels), anesthesia risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) risk scale; stratified into low (ASA 1 or 2) and high (ASA 3)), as well as disability measures (ODI &#x00026; NDI) at baseline and follow-up (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To evaluate for depressive comorbidity, PHQ-2 scores &#x02265; 3 were used as recommended cut-offs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The independent variables&#x02019; association with the activity levels at baseline and/or follow-up was tested using linear regression, student&#x02019;s t-tests and analysis of covariance (ANOVA) models. As we found a marked difference between the activity levels in patients with cervical and lumbar spine disease, we adjusted for this in subsequent analyses using multivariable linear regression or multivariable analysis of covariance (MANOVA) models. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between PROMs and activity levels.

Even though disability and pain was improved after surgery, our patients did not maximize the benefits of the intervention by walking more steps.

Further potential lies in the early detection of complications and/or unfavorable treatment outcomes in patients with decline in activity or lack of postoperative improvement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par41">It must be emphasized that the use of LCAs in spine health is likely still in its relative infancy.

In addition to the objective activity tracking, several well-validated PROMs were applied to assess outcome on subjective scales. Finally, this is the first study to include cervical spine patients and to compare activity levels of patients with degenerative lumbar versus cervical spine diseases.</p><p id="Par44">Certainly, a weakness of this study is the small percentage of potentially eligible patients that were finally asked to participate in this study. The single most important reason behind non-inclusion was lack of dedicated study personnel; incompatibility issues between the LCA and smartphone device were infrequent. A further implication of the sample size and heterogeneity is that we refrain from going into more detail regarding the observed relationship of patient characteristics (e.g., ASA score, obesity, etc.) and objective mobility data. As with many other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, also this study was impacted by loss of follow-up and inherent missing data in the range of 0&#x02013;30% at short and 3&#x02013;63% at long-term follow-up. The inclusion of a heterogeneous patient sample allowed us to gain insights into recovery for a wide range of disease types. Further research should concentrate on characterizing short- and long-term recovery for more well-defined populations. Lastly, we utilized simplified summary data for the main analyses; a more detailed review of day-to-day activity data as illustrated in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> might identify additional important factors impacting spine-related mobility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par45">This prospective observational study provides novel insight into the objective activity levels of patients before and after cervical and lumbar spine surgery. Activity tracking provided evidence for progressive recovery over the first 8&#x02013;12 postoperative weeks, but improvement beyond the preoperative activity level was uncommon up to the Y1 follow-up. The correlation between daily steps and subjective outcome measures was weak, indicating that activity tracking should not replace PROMs but rather add another dimension to the comprehensive outcome assessment of patients undergoing spine surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>These authors contributed equally: Martin N.
