How the conformation of a prion dictates the disease phenotype remains unclear. Mice expressing GPI-anchorless or GPI-anchored prion protein exposed to the same infectious prion develop fibrillar or nonfibrillar aggregates, respectively, and show a striking divergence in the disease pathogenesis. To better understand how a prion's physical properties govern the pathogenesis, infectious anchorless prions were passaged in mice expressing anchorless prion protein and the resulting prions were biochemically characterized. Serial passage of anchorless prions led to a significant decrease in the incubation period to terminal disease and altered the biochemical properties, consistent with a transmission barrier effect. After an intraperitoneal exposure, anchorless prions were only weakly neuroinvasive, as prion plaques rarely occurred in the brain yet were abundant in extracerebral sites such as heart and adipose tissue. Anchorless prions consistently showed very high stability in chaotropes or when heated in SDS, and were highly resistant to enzyme digestion. Consistent with the results in mice, anchorless prions from a human patient were also highly stable in chaotropes. These findings reveal that anchorless prions consist of fibrillar and highly stable conformers. The additional finding from our group and others that both anchorless and anchored prion fibrils are poorly neuroinvasive strengthens the hypothesis that a fibrillar prion structure impedes efficient CNS invasion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Prions cause fatal neurodegenerative disease in humans and animals and there is currently no treatment available. The cellular prion protein is normally tethered to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor. A rare stop codon mutation in the <italic>PRNP</italic> gene leads to the production of GPI-anchorless prion protein and the development of familial prion disease, which has been reproduced in mouse models. GPI-anchorless prions in humans or mice form large, dense plaques containing fibrils in the brain that vary from the more common non-fibrillar prion aggregates. Here we investigated the biochemical differences between GPI-anchored and GPI-anchorless prions. We also assessed the capacity of GPI-anchorless prions to spread from entry sites into the central nervous system. We found that infectious GPI-anchorless prions were extraordinarily stable when exposed to protein denaturing conditions. Additionally, we show that GPI-anchorless prions rarely invade the central nervous system and then only after long incubation periods, despite their presence in extraneural tissues including adipose tissue and heart. Our study shows that GPI-anchored prions converted into GPI-anchorless prions become extraordinarily stable, more resistant to enzyme digestion, and are poorly able to invade the nervous system.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NS069566, R01NS076896, and U54AI0359) (CJS), the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (KPRN), the European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant: project MUMID, KPRN), and Institutional Grants for Younger Researchers from The Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education (STINT) (CJS, KPRN).

Within fibrils, &#x003b2;-sheets are arranged perpendicular to the fibril axis, with H-bonds forming a dry interface between &#x003b2;-strands <xref rid="ppat.1003280-DiazAvalos1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Petkova1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Sawaya1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Benzinger1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The observation that the anchorless prions are stable in chaotropes raises the possibility of long &#x003b2;-sheets, more H-bonds, or increased strength of H-bonds between &#x003b2;-strands. Indeed, H-bond strength can differ among prion fibrils <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Shashilov1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. However, length of the &#x003b2;-sheet core can also differ. An elegant study of two yeast prion strains revealed a longer stretch of amino acids constituting the amyloid core in the more stable strain <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Toyama1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Thus far in mammalian prions, H/D exchange studies of anchorless versus anchored prions have revealed only small differences in the length of the buried core, which is suspected to be &#x003b2;-sheeted <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Smirnovas1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>Intriguingly, anchorless prions accumulate to very high levels over a relatively short incubation period in Tg(GPI<sup>&#x02013;</sup>PrP) mice, a finding also noted in the passage of spontaneous anchorless prions <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Stohr1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This differed from findings observed in other fibrillar prions, which tend to have low levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and very long incubation periods <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Bett1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Collis1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Tuzi1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. What mechanism may underlie the relatively short incubation period? Anchorless prions may rapidly convert monomers due to increased interactions between extracellular PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and secreted PrP<sup>C</sup>. Alternatively, the extracellular location may promote interactions with co-factors that enhance conversion of anchorless PrP <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Piro1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Degradation and clearance of anchorless prion fibrils may be exceedingly poor, as suggested by their ability to resist high concentrations of PK. Lastly, it is possible that there is a high frangibility leading to release of many small aggregate &#x0201c;seeds&#x0201d; and subsequent efficient recruitment of PrP<sup>C</sup>. Although the latter may seem unlikely from the high stability measurements, it remains possible since frangibility was not directly measured.</p><p>Anchorless RML prions readily switched back into a nonfibrillar form when inoculated intracerebrally into WT mice (IP inoculations are ongoing). Pathological features resembled RML and were characterized by diffuse PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposits, extensive spongiosis and astrogliosis. The lesion profiles, incubation period after IC inoculation, stability in chaotropes and at high temperatures, and glycoform profiles were indistinguishable from RML. Nevertheless, Mahal and colleagues showed interesting differences between the RML and anchorless RML passaged into WT mice using the Extended Cell Panel Assay, indicating that anchorless RML passaged in WT mice produces a novel strain <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Mahal1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>Similar to the inefficient neuroinvasion we observed with the anchorless RML prions in Tg(GPI<sup>&#x02013;</sup>PrP) mice, the neuroinvasion of WT-RML prions was also infrequent in Tg(GPI<sup>&#x02013;</sup>PrP) mice in an extensive study in which mice were inoculated by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intraocular, intranerval, and intralingual routes <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Klingeborn1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. After intralingual inoculation, no prions were detected in the CNS, indicating a robust barrier to neuroinvasion despite the limited distance for prion transport from tongue to brain. Even after direct intranerval (sciatic) inoculation, prions were not detected in the brain, however prions accumulated in the lumbar spinal cord ipsilateral to the injection site, indicating very slow conversion along the injected nerve <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Klingeborn1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In the present study, serially-passaged, more rapidly lethal anchorless prions were only weakly neuroinvasive in Tg(GPI<sup>&#x02013;</sup>PrP) mice, indicating that the adapted prions remained slow to invade the CNS, although prions readily accumulated at extracerebral sites, including the spleen, adipose tissue, and heart. These findings are reminiscent of other fibrillar prions that are poorly neuroinvasive, including 87 V <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Bett1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Collis1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, mCWD <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Bett1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and vCJD in transgenic mice expressing human PrP <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Beringue1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and may indicate that the common fibrillar structure effectively impairs a prion's ability to neuroinvade. Although 87 V and mCWD are also highly stable, stability does not seem to correlate with neuroinvasion, as some highly stable strains can efficiently neuroinvade <xref rid="ppat.1003280-Ayers1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Instead only the fibrillar structure correlates with inefficient neuroinvasion ability.</p><p>In conclusion, nonfibrillar and fibrillar anchored prion strains all converged into fibrillar prions in mice expressing anchorless PrP, and GPI<sup>&#x02013;</sup>RML reverted back to a nonfibrillar form in mice expressing anchored PrP. To earlier evidence that anchorless prions are poorly neuroinvasive, fibrillar, and exhibit a new tropism for adipose tissue and heart, here we add that anchorless prions are exceedingly stable in denaturants, resist enzyme degradation, and even after serial passage, remain inefficient at neuroinvasion. These features are common to anchored fibrillar prions and suggest that having a fibrillar structure hinders invasion of the CNS from extraneural sites. Therefore other anchored or anchorless fibrillar prions that accumulate in non-neural tissues would be expected to show very slow spread to the brain or spinal cord.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All procedures involving animals were performed to minimize suffering and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UC San Diego.
