Typhimurium D23580 were compared to sera from HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected subjects with bactericidal activity. The failure of sera from certain HIV-infected subjects to kill <italic>Salmonella</italic> was found to be due to an inherent inhibitory effect of anti-LPS antibodies. This inhibition was concentration-dependent and strongly associated with IgA and IgG2 anti-LPS antibodies (p&#x0003c;0.0001 for both). IgG anti-LPS antibodies, from sera of HIV-infected individuals that inhibit killing at high concentration, induced killing when diluted. Conversely, IgG, from sera of HIV-uninfected adults that induce killing, inhibited killing when concentrated. IgM anti-LPS antibodies from all subjects also induced <italic>Salmonella</italic> killing. Finally, the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of anti-LPS antibodies is seen with IgM as well as IgG and IgA. No correlation was found between affinity or avidity, or complement deposition or consumption, and inhibition of killing.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>IgG and IgM classes of anti-<italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium LPS antibodies from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals are bactericidal, while at very high concentrations, anti-LPS antibodies of all classes inhibit in vitro killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. This could be due to a variety of mechanisms relating to the poor ability of IgA and IgG2 to activate complement, and deposition of complement at sites where it cannot insert in the bacterial membrane. Vaccine trials are required to understand the significance of lack of in vitro killing by anti-LPS antibodies from a minority of HIV-infected individuals with impaired immune homeostasis.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Bacteremia caused by nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonellae</italic> are a major health burden in Africa. While antibody-induced complement-mediated killing protects healthy Africans against <italic>Salmonella</italic>, increased levels of anti-LPS antibodies in some HIV-infected Africans block this killing. Little is known about the mechanism of the interference of killing by these antibodies. Here, we compared sera and affinity-purified antibodies from African HIV-infected adults that are unable to kill invasive <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium D23580, with sera from HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected subjects with bactericidal activity. We found that the blocking effect of anti-LPS antibodies is a factor of antibody concentration, rather than antibody structure or specificity. While all three isotypes (IgG, IgA and IgM) can inhibit killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic> at grossly high concentrations, the IgG and IgM isotypes of the anti-LPS antibodies have in vitro bactericidal activity against invasive African <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. Inhibition of killing did not associate with antibody affinity or avidity, or complement deposition or consumption. It is possible that a LPS-based vaccine would induce antibodies at bactericidal rather than inhibitory concentrations in HIV-uninfected individuals. In HIV-infected individuals, it is uncertain whether vaccination will induce a protective response or a dysregulated excess of anti-LPS antibodies that impairs serum killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by postdoctoral fellowships from the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research (to YSG and FN), a Research Fellowship in Clinical Tropical Medicine from the Wellcome Trust (Grant number 067902/Z/02/Z) and a Clinical Research Fellowship from GlaxoSmithKline (both to CAM).

Case fatality rates are around 20&#x02013;25% [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and up to 47% in HIV-infected adults [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] prior to the availability of antiretroviral therapy. Diagnosing NTS bacteremia is difficult due to a lack of specific clinical presentation. The emergence of multi-drug resistant isolates [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] has added to the problem of management and no vaccine is currently available.

Typhimurium LPS O-antigen has been considered as a vaccine candidate for many years. We previously reported an association between impaired serum killing of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and high levels of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium LPS-specific IgG in some African HIV-infected adults [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This study extends the association to high titers of anti-LPS IgA, but not IgM. Factors we examined that do not appear to cause impaired killing are antibody affinity, avidity and complement consumption. The latter was previously postulated as an explanation [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The first key finding is that antibody concentration is an important determinant of the presence or absence of serum killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. HIV+ve inhibitory sera have elevated LPS-specific IgA and IgG, compared with HIV-ve and HIV+ve bactericidal sera. While whole undiluted HIV+ve inhibitory sera cannot kill <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium D23580, these sera kill <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the presence of exogenous complement when diluted. The concentration dependency of killing is also observed with purified antibodies from all groups of sera. Killing is also isotype-dependent, being mediated by IgG and IgM in HIV-ve bactericidal sera, but predominantly by IgM in the HIV+ve bactericidal sera tested.</p><p>The counter-intuitive lack of killing observed with purified total and LPS-specific IgG from HIV+ve bactericidal sera could be due to the epitopes recognized by these antibodies, suggesting that the specific O-antigen epitopes recognized are important for efficient killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. The SBA and flow cytometry experiments with <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains of different O-antigen profiles supports this hypothesis and offers a possible explanation whereby preferential targeting of anti-LPS IgG from the HIV+ve bactericidal group to O:4 could underlie this finding. The O:5 antigen, present in <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium D23580, is an acetylated form of the O:4 antigen [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and can hinder accessibility of antibodies targeting O:4. The underlying reasons for this difference in epitope specificity of IgG anti-LPS antigens in HIV+ve bactericidal and HIV+ve inhibitory sera are not clear. The difference may be partly explained by the small number of sera available for antibody extraction. With larger numbers of sera, it is conceivable that both bactericidal and inhibitory sera would be found with antibodies preferentially targeting the O:4 or O:5 epitopes. The presence of a skewing in antibody response to particularly epitopes is consistent with the well-recognized B cell dysregulation and dysfunction observed in HIV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], characterized by various abnormalities including oligoclonal antibody responses [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The second key finding is that anti-LPS antibodies from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected African adults can effect complement-dependent killing, indicating their potential for mediating protective immunity against NTS. Purified anti-LPS IgG and IgM kill <italic>Salmonella</italic>, while IgA does not. Hence, bactericidal activity is dependent on antibody isotype, which is consistent with the known ability of IgM, IgG1 and IgG3, but not IgA, and only to a limited extent IgG2, to activate complement [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While purified IgA from African adults could not effect complement-mediated killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, we recently found that a vaccine-induced mouse monoclonal IgA against O:4 of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium LPS has bactericidal activity [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This could simply be due to species differences between human and mouse IgA. While serum IgA did not kill <italic>Salmonella</italic>, secretory IgA, which was not examined in this study, is likely to be important for reducing <italic>Salmonella</italic> colonization via the oral route.</p><p>Concentration of anti-LPS IgA and IgG2 in total serum from HIV-infected participants correlated most strongly with inhibition of <italic>Salmonella</italic> killing (P&#x0003c;0.0001 for both) and it is possible that the high levels of this immunoglobulin class and subclass in HIV+ve inhibitory serum contributes to impaired killing. Very few HIV-uninfected participants had raised IgG2 levels in comparison with HIV-infected participants. Although IgG1 is the most abundant IgG subclass in human serum, IgG2 appears to be induced preferentially to bacterial polysaccharides [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As well as its poor ability to activate complement, high levels of IgG2 to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> LPS in patients with bronchiectasis have been found recently to inhibit serum killing of these bacteria [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The relevance of different antibody isotypes for protection has implications for vaccine development against invasive <italic>Salmonella</italic> disease. Vaccine design, formulation and regimes that induce antibody responses consisting predominantly of IgG1 and IgM are more likely to elicit bactericidal antibodies which can counter bacteremia, while IgA induction is likely to be important for preventing the initial invasion from the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>The third key finding is that while anti-LPS IgG and IgM are bactericidal at low concentrations, high concentrations inhibit normal serum killing. Together, these findings suggest that impaired killing with HIV+ve inhibitory sera is primarily the outcome of high anti-LPS antibodies concentrations. The exact mechanism by which this inhibition occurs is still unclear, but could partly be due to the very high levels of anti-LPS IgA and IgG2 antibodies in HIV+ve inhibitory sera which are non/poorly-complement activating. This does not, however, appear to explain the similar profiles of killing and lack of killing by anti-LPS antibodies extracted from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected sera over the range of concentrations tested, with the possible exception of lack of killing of IgG with HIV+ve bactericidal sera if this was predominantly IgG2 subclass.</p><p>As previously postulated [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], binding of an excess of antibodies to the <italic>Salmonella</italic> surface could sterically hinder insertion of the MAC into the bacterial membrane, so that although MAC is formed, as we have detected, it is unable to kill <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Lack of killing could also result from deposition of MAC at a distance away from the bacterial surface, since anti-LPS antibodies will bind theoretically along the length of the LPS molecule, with some locations distal to the bacterial surface. Location of MAC deposition has previously been highlighted as an important factor in killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, this alone cannot be the full explanation, since anti-LPS antibodies are bactericidal [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], unless distal MAC deposition occurs preferentially at higher anti-LPS antibody concentrations. Such distally-positioned MAC may be prone to shedding from the bacteria as previously demonstrated for <italic>S</italic>. Minnesota [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Finally, it is conceivable that high concentrations of antibodies bound to individual bacteria may result in defective formation of the MAC, leading to a lack of killing.</p><p>Trebicka et al. have recently described the absence of killing of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium by sera from HIV-infected Americans associated with a lack of IgG antibodies to LPS [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], rather than the high levels of these antibodies that we have found in HIV-infected Africans. This is consistent with the concept that some, but not excessive, antibodies to LPS are required to kill <italic>Salmonella</italic>. The reason for the absence of antibodies to LPS may relate to differences in exposure to <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the USA compared with Africa, leading to reduced antigenic stimulation of LPS-specific B cells, or to differences in the nature of B cell dysfunction and dysregulation between the two study populations. Interestingly, despite the lack of anti-LPS antibodies, Trebicka et al found that these HIV-infected sera inhibited killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic> by control sera, suggesting multiple mechanisms for impairment of killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in HIV infection. Although data on levels of IgA and IgM antibodies to LPS were not shown, the authors speculated that high levels anti-LPS IgM present in some study participants could be the reason for inhibition of killing. This is consistent with the findings in our current study.</p><p>The LPS-specific hypergammaglobulinemia found in some HIV-infected African adults is not present in HIV-uninfected subjects, and appears to occur secondary to natural exposure to <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium in the context of the dysregulated humoral immunity that accompanies HIV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Inhibition of normal serum killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic> by anti-LPS IgG and IgM required 500 &#x003bc;g/ml and 125 &#x003bc;g/ml purified antibodies respectively. The combined concentrations of all anti-LPS antibody isotypes exceeded 500 &#x003bc;g/ml in HIV+ve inhibitory sera, but were below 500 &#x003bc;g/ml in HIV+ve and HIV-ve bactericidal sera. Immunization has been reported to induce &#x0223c;15 &#x003bc;g/ml specific IgG in healthy adults [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, a <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium O-antigen-based vaccine should induce antibodies at bactericidal rather than inhibitory concentrations in HIV-uninfected individuals.</p><p>Several factors could determine the immunological response to such a vaccine in HIV-infected individuals. HIV infection has a global effect on the immune system characterized by impaired immune homeostasis, and is associated with higher risk and increased severity of infections including pneumonia and tuberculosis [<xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004604.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The difference in immunity resulting from vaccination instead of natural exposure to NTS is uncertain, as is the effect antiretroviral therapy will have on anti-<italic>Salmonella</italic> LPS antibody levels. Therefore, it is not known whether vaccination will induce a protective response or a dysregulated excess of anti-LPS antibodies that impairs serum <italic>Salmonella</italic> killing.</p><p>In conclusion, antibodies against <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium LPS O-antigen are present in the blood of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected African adults, most likely following natural exposure to <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. The IgG and IgM isotypes of these antibodies have in vitro bactericidal activity against invasive African <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, but at high concentrations, all three isotypes (IgG, IgA and IgM) can inhibit killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004604.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Subject details.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004604.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004604.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Expression of O antigens by <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004604.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004604.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Anti-<italic>S</italic>.
