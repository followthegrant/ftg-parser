For this reason, before it is introduced on the market, it has to undergo clinical research. Unfortunately, there are many limitations on research and not all side effects are identified in the course of it. The limitations comprise, among others, a relatively short time of exposure of a patient to a drug, a relatively small number of participants (around 1,500), multiple exclusion criteria, or the fact that clinical research is conducted under conditions that are different from the conditions of everyday practice.<xref rid="b1-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> For this reason, the monitoring of a drug is not finished at the moment of introduction on the market.

The study was based on an original survey composed of 15 single- and multiple-choice questions. The questionnaire was divided into two sections; demographic characteristics and ADRs reporting knowledge. Demographic characteristics consisted of six items; age, sex, educational level, place of living, medications, and side-effect history. In the second part, the respondents answered questions concerning the means of reporting of ADRs (6 questions) and the data that must be included in the report on ADRs (3 questions). <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ppa-11-047">Tables 1</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ppa-11-047"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ppa-11-047">3</xref> show all the possible answers. The questionnaire was subjected to validity by sending to pharmacy academics who work in Department for Monitoring Adverse Reactions of Medicinal Products at the Office for Registration of Medicinal Products, Medical Devices and Biocidal Products in Warsaw. Their feedbacks were incorporated. The instrument was then administered to 5 males and 5 females. The respondents were advised of the purpose of the study. The participation was voluntary and anonymous. The study involved individuals who have experienced adverse reactions as well as individuals who have never experienced any adverse reactions; people over the age of 18; literate; residing in Mazowieckie Voivodeship, who have not been diagnosed with any disease that could compromise their logical thinking skills. Initially, 228 patients agreed to participate in the study. The final analysis covered surveys completed by 200 patients. The remaining 28 surveys were rejected due to missing information. The data was analyzed by descriptive statistics and nonparametric <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test (ie, comparisons of percentage of responses by sex, age, and place of residence).</p><p>Ethical Committee consent for the presented research was not required.

However, a large percentage of the respondents were not aware of the fact that every health professional has such entitlements. According to a research study by Schetz et al conducted in Pomorskie Voivodeship, as many as 87% of analyzed doctors thought that the reports on ADRs should be delivered only by doctors, and only 9% of doctors thought that patients, too, should have such rights.<xref rid="b11-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Despite the upward trend in the number of reports on ASRs in Poland, the number is still not satisfactory compared to other countries. The data collected by WHO for 2013 indicates that 7.3% of reports were submitted in the UK, 6% &#x02013; in Germany, 3.1% &#x02013; in France, and around 2% in Italy and Spain. In Poland, we had around 11,000 reports, 30 out of which were submitted by the patients themselves (in the other countries, nearly half of the reports are submitted by patients).<xref rid="b12-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In Denmark, patient reporting of ADRs commenced in 2004. In the period 2004&#x02013;2006, 8.6% reports were submitted by patients.<xref rid="b13-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In the Netherlands, since April 2003, patients can also report ADRs. In 2005, 13% reports were submitted by patients,<xref rid="b14-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and in the period 2004&#x02013;2007, a total of 2522 reports (5401 suspected ADRs) were received from patients and 10,635 reports (16,722 suspected ADRs) from heath care professionals.<xref rid="b15-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In Canada in 2008, 10.6% reports were submitted solely by patients.<xref rid="b16-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In the USA, in 2008, of the 226,647 reports, 46% were submitted by patients. The proportion of total reports submitted by patients has increased since the mid-1990s.<xref rid="b17-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>A comforting fact is that according to the authors&#x02019; original study, 90% of the patients knew that the suspected ADRs must be reported to URPLWMiPB. Unfortunately, a large percentage of the respondents also chose an incorrect answer pointing to different institutions, eg, the Ministry of Health (95%) or the Main/Voivodeship Pharmaceutical Inspectorate (65%). Not all doctors know where they should report adverse reactions; 89% of them pointed to the right place.<xref rid="b11-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>According to the relevant laws of Poland, the suspected ADRs might be reported on the so-called yellow card, international CIOMS form, forms available from the accountable entities, or on a sheet of paper containing minimum required information. For the application to be valid, it must include information such as: identification data of the patient, description of adverse reaction (one or more), name of medicinal product/active ingredient that caused the adverse reaction, and identification data of the reporting person.<xref rid="b8-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the authors&#x02019; original study, the patients indicated that they would report the adverse reaction by means of a CIOMS form (32%) or a form available from the pharmaceutical company or a sheet of paper with required information (27% and 26%, respectively). The number of those who pointed to the so-called yellow card was smaller (8%). Nonetheless, every method indicated by the patients was a correct option.</p><p>Another reason to be satisfied is that all the patients who participated in the authors&#x02019; original study knew how they can report an ADR. Although the respondents chose answers such as &#x0201c;only in person&#x0201d; (99%), &#x0201c;by email&#x0201d; (72%), &#x0201c;by post&#x0201d; (69%), or all of the above (69%), all the methods indicated by the patients are allowed.</p><p>The patients were also asked about adverse reactions that should be reported. Most respondents stated that serious adverse reactions must be reported (67%). The patients were right to declare that adverse reactions not covered by the package leaflet (62%) and reactions covered by the leaflet (31%) need to be reported.</p><p>It should be stressed that even the recognized and confirmed adverse reactions should be reported as it may help in the identification of the most dangerous drug(s) out of a therapeutic group. Some of the respondents mistakenly claimed that only those adverse reactions experienced by a given patient for the first time should be reported (19%) or those reactions that are frequently experienced by a given patient (11%). An alarming fact is that only 58% of doctors covered by a study of Schetz et al thought that all serious ADRs should be reported.<xref rid="b12-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Over a half of the patients (58%) rightly said that adverse reactions of dietary supplements should not be reported to URPLWMiPB, and 32% would not report adverse reactions of medical devices. One should stress that the answers given by the respondents, such as: herbal medicines (45%), homeopathic medicines (28%), drugs applied in inpatient treatment (22%), and imported drugs (17%), are covered by the reported products because the reporting obligation applies to all adverse reactions associated with the use of any type of drugs.</p><p>The final question included in the survey referred to the information on the patient, drug, and adverse reaction and the reporting person that must be included in the report form. In terms of the information concerning the patient, most respondents pointed to first name and surname (90%) and PESEL (72%). The most important information, however, includes the initials, sex, and age and information about the weight of the patient (in case of patients with atypical weight and children).<xref rid="b8-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the authors&#x02019; original study, 61% of the respondents pointed to date of birth, 52% pointed to sex, and 19% pointed to weight. In terms of the information about the drug and adverse reaction, the majority of the respondents pointed to the trade name of the drug (93%), description of adverse reaction (88%), and date of occurrence. In a study of the attitudes among doctors in Pomerania to the obligation of reporting of ADRs, 71% of the doctors pointed out that it is important to indicate the trade name of the drug with suspected adverse reaction.<xref rid="b12-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In reality, the report should contain the name of the drug and description of the adverse reaction.<xref rid="b8-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the section that referred to the reporting person, the respondents listed the following data as required: first name and surname (92%) and signature (83%). In reality, first name, surname, and address of employment in case of medical personnel are enough.<xref rid="b8-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Statistically significant relations between the place of residence of the respondents and the correct answer to the question about the data that must be included in the report on adverse reactions (Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>=11.7, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), the knowledge on the means of reporting of ADR (Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>=47.70, <italic>P</italic>=0.0013), and the type of adverse reaction to be reported (Pearson&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>=50.66, <italic>P</italic>=0.012) were found. The general knowledge on the reporting of ADRs was greater among city dwellers. Similar relations that referred to patient knowledge on ADRs were found by Kadhim who evaluated reporting of ADRs by patients in Iraq.<xref rid="b18-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The authors&#x02019; original study was conducted in Mazowieckie Voivodeship; the majority of respondents resided in the city (62%). In Warsaw, there was a campaign about the reporting of ADRs, which might explain the greater knowledge of the respondents.</p><p>A comforting fact is that 92% of the patients have never experienced any ADRs. Among those who have experienced adverse reactions, the reactions were associated with the use of aspirin and VPA.</p><p>Reporting of adverse reactions of medicinal products is a key element of drug policy in every state. It allows for accumulation of important information concerning the safe use of drugs. Unfortunately, 21% and 40% of doctors who participated in the study conducted by Schetz et al respectively considered reporting of ADRs to play a &#x0201c;very important&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;important&#x0201d; role in the improvement of safety of drug treatment.<xref rid="b11-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Research conducted in other countries &#x02013; USA,<xref rid="b19-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Norway,<xref rid="b20-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Portugal,<xref rid="b21-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Hong Kong,<xref rid="b22-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> the UK,<xref rid="b23-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Turkey,<xref rid="b25-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and Jordan<xref rid="b26-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> also points to low awareness in respect of reporting of adverse reactions among pharmacists. In a study by Herdeiro et al, it was shown that hospital pharmacists report ADRs 20 times more frequently than community pharmacists, this was due to the fact that the hospital pharmacist was better educated and informed about pharmacovigilance practice.<xref rid="b27-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> On the other hand, in a study by Abdel-Latif and Abdel-Wahab, pharmacists were the most knowledgeable group (70.27%) about pharmacovigilance and ADRs reporting (other health care professional: physicians, nurses, and pharmacists&#x02019; technicians).<xref rid="b28-ppa-11-047" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Therefore, there is a need for continuing education in the society, including among the people with a medical degree in terms of the role of and need for monitoring of adverse reactions of medicinal products.</p><p>Since November 2015, ADRs in Poland might be reported by means of a smartphone application known as Mobit Skaner. Perhaps, this solution will improve the number of reported adverse reactions &#x02013; the app is extremely easy to use. After installation, the patient just needs to scan the barcode on the drug package and will instantly receive all basic information about the product and be able to report an adverse reaction via the app. The patient will need to complete some boxes in a form &#x02013; there is no need to know what information is required and where the form must be sent. One can hope that thanks to new technology the whole procedure for reporting of adverse reactions will become easier, nonetheless, education is still a key element in this respect.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>On the basis of the conducted survey, one can conclude that patient knowledge about reporting of adverse reactions is relatively low. Patients are unaware of the gravity of occurrence of adverse reactions and the high value of information about adverse reactions. Patients have contradictory information as to how they should proceed in the event of occurrence of adverse reactions. Hence, the knowledge must be broadened, otherwise, ignorance will spread. In order to improve the safety of the drugs there is a need to show the important role of adverse reactions reporting for public safety and make clear and easy procedures to report ADRs. The patients&#x02019; education by health care providers and the workers of Department for Monitoring Adverse Reactions of Medicinal Products at the Office for Registration of Medicinal Products, Medical Devices and Biocidal Products on issues pertaining to ADRs reporting could help the involvement of patients in ADRs reporting process. The mass media campaigns seem to play a key role in reporting ADRs.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>There are a number of limitations on the study: it was conducted on a relatively small group of patients, it was conducted only in Mazowieckie Voivodeship, it is concerned only with the basic aspects associated with reporting of ADRs. However, the fact that this is the first and, so far, the only study on patient knowledge on reporting of adverse reactions, conducted in Poland is worth a mention. Hence, it should constitute a foundation for further detailed research.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ppa-11-047"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ivy</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name><name><surname>Siu</surname><given-names>LL</given-names></name><name><surname>Garrett-Mayer</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubinstein</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Approaches to phase 1 clinical trial design focused on safety, efficiency, and selected patient populations: a report from the clinical trial design task of national cancer institute investigational drug steering committee</article-title><source>Clin Cancer Res</source><year>2010</year><volume>16</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>1726</fpage><lpage>1736</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20215542</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-ppa-11-047"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vlahakes</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The value of phase IV clinical testing</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>2006</year><volume>354</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>413</fpage><lpage>415</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16436775</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-ppa-11-047"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wiela-Hoje&#x00144;ska</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ja&#x0017a;wi&#x00144;ska-Tarnawska</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mi&#x00119;dzynarodowe i krajowe systemy monitorowania niepo&#x0017c;&#x00105;danych dzia&#x00142;a&#x00144; lek&#x000f3;w &#x02013; ich rozpoznawanie i zg&#x00142;aszanie</article-title><source>Farm Pol</source><year>2009</year><volume>65</volume><fpage>725</fpage><lpage>732</lpage><comment>Polish</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-ppa-11-047"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><source>The WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring</source><comment>Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/safety_efficacy/National_PV_Centres_Map/en/">http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/safety_efficacy/National_PV_Centres_Map/en/</ext-link></comment><date-in-citation>Accessed May 26, 2016</date-in-citation></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-ppa-11-047"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO Programme Members</collab></person-group><source>Countries participating in the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring, with year of joining</source><comment>Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who-umc.org/DynPage.aspx?id=100653&#x00026;mn1=7347&#x00026;mn2=7252&#x00026;mn3=7322&#x00026;mn4=7442">http://www.who-umc.org/DynPage.aspx?id=100653&#x00026;mn1=7347&#x00026;mn2=7252&#x00026;mn3=7322&#x00026;mn4=7442</ext-link></comment><date-in-citation>Accessed June 11, 2016</date-in-citation></element-citation></ref><ref id="b6-ppa-11-047"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>Notice of the President of Office for Registration of Medicinal Products, Medical Devices and Biocidal Products of 3 November 2015</article-title><source>Zg&#x00142;o&#x0015b; dzia&#x00142;anie niepo&#x0017c;&#x00105;dane [Report a side effect]</source><comment>Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.urpl.gov.pl/pl/produkty-lecznicze/monitorowanie-bezpiecze%C5%84stwa-lek%C3%B3w/zg%C5%82o%C5%9B-dzia%C5%82anie-niepo%C5%BC%C4%85dane-0">http://www.urpl.gov.pl/pl/produkty-lecznicze/monitorowanie-bezpiecze%C5%84stwa-lek%C3%B3w/zg%C5%82o%C5%9B-dzia%C5%82anie-niepo%C5%BC%C4%85dane-0</ext-link></comment><date-in-citation>Accessed October 13, 2016</date-in-citation></element-citation></ref><ref id="b7-ppa-11-047"><label>7</label><note><p>Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council 2010/84/EU of 15 December 2010 amending &#x02013; as regards pharmacovigilance &#x02013; Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use.</p></note></ref><ref id="b8-ppa-11-047"><label>8</label><note><p>Drug safety monitoring, Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.urpl.gov.pl/pl/produkty-lecznicze/monitorowanie-bezpiecze%C5%84stwa-lek%C3%B3w">http://www.urpl.gov.pl/pl/produkty-lecznicze/monitorowanie-bezpiecze%C5%84stwa-lek%C3%B3w</ext-link>.
