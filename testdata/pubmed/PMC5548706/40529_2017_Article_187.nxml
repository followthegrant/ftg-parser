This leads to opportunistic collecting as part of general seed collecting schedules that may last few weeks especially in remote areas. The study explored the feasibility of collecting near mature and immature seeds to support conservation action plans. Mature, near mature and immature seeds of orchids were collected from the wild in the Central Highlands of Madagascar (CHM). Seed capsules were collected in sterile culture medium in the wild, to prevent deterioration of seeds inside the capsule after collecting, later to be cultured under laboratory conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Seed capsules collected by the in vitro collecting (IVC) method were kept in very good condition for up to 4&#x000a0;weeks before germination under in vitro conditions. Significantly faster and higher germination rate (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) than mature seeds was observed in a number of taxa collected during a 3&#x000a0;year-long study. In some taxa even immature seeds, with no apparent sign of testa covering the embryo, germinated following IVC where mature seeds failed to germinate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">We propose that IVC method has potential to complement conventional seed collecting by increasing the germplasm that can be used in integrated conservation action plans. Improvements can be made in developing collections for taxa from biodiversity hotspots and remote areas where collecting requires considerable resources. This method can further be used on a wider selection of plants from different geographic areas and on embryo rescue programmes for economically important plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40529-017-0187-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Sainsbury Orchid Endowment Fund</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Bentham and Moxon Trust</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">Orchids are the most complex and enigmatic group of flowering plants, with a global distribution, yet are considered to be the most threatened family. A large proportion of orchids are endemic in areas where habitat loss, illegal collecting and loss of pollinators are prevalent (Merritt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>). Due to the threats to orchids worldwide and the adverse effect on recruitment in the wild they have been included in Appendix II of the Conservation on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Orchid seeds appear to be short-lived compared to crop plant seeds, even if considered desiccation tolerant (Pritchard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1999</xref>; Seaton and Pritchard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2003</xref>). Seed dormancy in many plant families seriously impacts outcomes at the time seeds are sown (Merritt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>). Lack of seed information and handling practices continuously affect outcomes in restoration programmes. This includes data deficiencies pertaining to phenology of seed development and maturation for the majority of wild species (Broadhurst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>; Mortlock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2000</xref>) and this can lead to asynchronous timing of seed collection (Merritt and Dixon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2011</xref>). In orchids, irregular germination in nature as well as under in vitro conditions is a major bottleneck for conservation of rare and threatened taxa (Barsberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>). In particular, terrestrial orchid seeds are even more difficult to work with due to quick seed maturation, dormancy-related germination issues, and desiccation sensitivity. Therefore, terrestrial orchids present significant conservation challenges.</p><p id="Par5">The number of ex situ conservation facilities worldwide has grown dramatically over the years (Wyse-Jackson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2001</xref>), but have become specifically integrated to achieve objectives under national and regional conservation priorities (Maunder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2001</xref>). Nevertheless, biodiversity conservation in resource poor areas of the world still faces an uncertain future. One of the key priorities of ex situ conservation is long term storage in seed banks and cryopreservation facilities which require substantial resources for capacity building. Long term storage of orchids requires cryopreservation at ultra-low temperature as a general rule because longevity under conventional seed banking conditions is not completely reliable (Merritt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">There are nearly 1000 orchid taxa in Madagascar, of which 85% are endemic&#x02014;an exceptional area of biodiversity for orchids (Moat and Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>; Tyson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2000</xref>). They are found in several phytogeographical regions with unique climatic conditions. This global biodiversity hotspot is a perfect study area to test orchids for collecting methods and assessing viability. We selected the Central Highlands of Madagascar (CHM) as our study area with over 50 species of orchids. The habitats of the study comprised inselbergs, savannah, grasslands, montane rocky scrubland and gallery forests. This area has granitic rocks, marble and quartzite with the majority of orchids being lithophytes and the rest true epiphytes and terrestrials.</p><p id="Par7">In the present paper we describe methods for collecting seeds at different maturity levels from the CHM habitats using IVC methods. IVC is the method of initiating in vitro cultures from plants in the wild. The method has been used in the past for a variety of functions ranging from horticulture to conservation (Warren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1983</xref>; Alvarenga et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2002</xref>; Henao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>; Saldana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2002</xref>; Brenes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2002</xref>; Engelmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2002</xref>; Sandoval <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2002</xref>). Propagation of orchids from seeds has long been achieved through the use of capsules which are either fully matured or green, un-dehisced and near-mature. Collected dry seeds are cleaned and dried before either storage or culturing for germination. Seed viability upon storage under standard seed bank conditions is still not completely reliable for orchids (Merritt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>). In many cases, especially in temperate terrestrial orchids, higher germination rates have been achieved using green capsules than mature seeds. This method is dependent on the immediate culturing of seed after harvest from green capsules. Seeds collected from plants in the wild, spread over large swathes of land mass, from remote locations usually perish due to moisture loss and microbial contamination (unpublished results). The critical aspect of working towards developing a successful IVC protocol is the control of contamination (Pence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>) along with maintaining the viability of the differentially matured seeds. In many cases the techniques were specifically developed for only a limited number of taxa as described in the present study. We discuss the importance of this new method to improve collecting and germination efficiency of differentially matured orchid seeds. The implications of this approach to cryopreservation and living collection development for reintroduction and assisted colonisation are discussed in detail.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study area and seed collecting</title><p id="Par8">Studies in the field were conducted in the CHM habitats where a large number of endemic orchids are found in discontinuous populations. The orchid seed capsules were collected from plants in the wild in inselberg, savannah, montane rocky grassland, and gallery forests (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Orchids and their habitats in Itremo, Central Highlands, Madagascar. <bold>a</bold>

</p><p id="Par9">Only a small number of capsules were allowed to be collected due to the fragmented nature of populations and few available capsules in individual plants. Orchids from these diverse habitats exist as epiphytes, lithophytes, and terrestrials. Different habitats and life forms contribute to the diversity of seed capsules which were available for this study. Seed capsules were categorised into five groups based on their size.</p><p id="Par10">Seed capsules were considered mature when they were yielding to the touch and had yellow, red or brown colouration, and contained mature seeds. Seed capsules were collected in vitro if they contained near-mature or immature seeds. These capsules were green, firm and of similar dimensions to mature capsules. Mature capsules were cut from the plant, wrapped in paper in a sealed seed envelope and placed in a field desiccator. This consisted of a sealable plastic box containing orange silica gel. Several collections were made per species for both IVC and mature capsules, and collection was performed in an opportunistic manner in accordance with guidelines laid down by the seed conservation department, RBG Kew (Way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2003</xref>). On arrival at RBG Kew the seeds were equilibrated over a saturated solution of CaCl<sub>2</sub> inside a glass desiccator, before being sealed in glass vials and stored in a fridge at 3&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.</p><p id="Par11">The following three-step procedure was employed for the IVC of seed capsules from all species collected from the wild in Itremo, CHM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Surface sterilisation in the field</title><p id="Par12">Flower parts were removed by scalpel blade and the capsules were cleaned with moist sterile towels immediately after collection. These seed capsules were then sterilised in 0.5% (w/v) sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) solution (Sigma Chemicals, UK) for a period depending on size, nature of seed capsule and where it was collected from (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Using results of the preliminary IVC studies, on two terrestrial orchid species at RBG Kew, the concentrations of NaDCC and PPM to be used in this study were optimised. For sizes 1&#x02013;3 plastic disposable containers (150&#x000a0;ml volume) with screw cap lids (Sterilin, UK) were used to culture the capsules following surface sterilisation; for size 4 and 5 Dilu vials (27&#x000a0;ml volume, Alpha Laboratories, UK) with flip tops were used. Sterilised seed capsules were washed in one change of 0.01% NaDCC before being transferred to IVC medium containing NADCC and plant preservative mixture (PPM, Apollo Scientific, UK). The culture medium selected for Madagascar IVC was &#x000bc; MS (Murashige and Skoog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1962</xref>) supplemented with 1% sucrose, 0.1% activated charcoal and 1% agar to which was added 0.03% (w/v) NaDCC, once the medium had cooled to around 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C to avoid evolution of chlorine gas, and 2&#x000a0;ml/l of PPM (v/v).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>List of taxa from Itremo, Central Highlands, Madagascar: seed capsule size and seed capsule colour 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;weeks after in vitro collecting and results of seed capsule sterilisation that yielded clean seeds 3&#x000a0;weeks after sowing</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2">Taxon</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Life form</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Colour of seed pod on arrival at RBG Kew</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Size group</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Init ial pod sterilisat ion t ime (mins)</th><th align="left" colspan="3">Response at step 1, 2 and 3 [Sterile (S)/Contaminated (C)]</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Response after seed sowing</th></tr><tr><th align="left">1</th><th align="left">2</th><th align="left">1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">

Staining to observe lignin on the carapace (covering of the embryo) was done by embedding seeds into JB-4 resin and sectioning using an ultra&#x02013;microtome (Sullivan-Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>). Sectioned seed samples were left to dry at 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and stained in Nile red (Sigma-Aldrich Co.

For both IVC and mature seed, numbers of total full seeds within randomly selected fields under microscope (approximately 100 seeds in each field) were used to calculate the percentage of full seeds. Germination was defined as emergence of the protocorm from the testa. Germination was recorded based on the number of full seeds, discounting seeds with poorly formed or no embryos and four replicates were used. Percent of clean cultures and percent of seed germination data were analysed against the seed capsule size and geographical location of the plant. Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was employed as a non-parametric method to look for the difference of germination rate between species because it does not assume a normal distribution of the residuals, and is applicable to comparing groups with different sample sizes (Theodorsson-Norheim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1986</xref>). The p-values of pairwise comparisons in the post hoc Dunn&#x02019;s test were adjusted using Bonferroni-type adjustment to avoid type I error inflation that leads to a false positive discovery rate. Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test with post hoc Dunn&#x02019;s test was performed using PMCMR package for R (Pohlert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>) while correlation analyses used the stats package for R (R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><p id="Par17">Small numbers of capsules were collected from fragmented populations, single plants in some cases, from the CHM following the guidelines stipulated in the collecting permit from Madagascar Conservation authorities.

Use of a lower concentration of NaDCC as a successful sterilant is due to the greater proportion of HOCl which is pH dependant (White <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1986</xref>). Unlike hypochlorites NaDCC can stay stable in liquid form (Parkinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1996</xref>) due to its chemical structure and release chlorine slowly as has been reported before (Sarasan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006</xref>). This quality is useful for in vitro (Niedz and Bausher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2002</xref>) and post-harvest studies (Nicholl and Prendergast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1998</xref>) in plants. With low phytotoxicity, and damage restricted to old living tissue, NaDCC makes a suitable antimicrobial substance to be used for longer treatment as discussed in this study.

</p><p id="Par31">Collecting mature seeds is the generally accepted approach as seeds remain viable for a reasonable period of time for use in culture compared to less mature seeds as reported before (Stoutamire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1992</xref>). As seeds mature the seed coat becomes hydrophobic which limits water and nutrient absorption (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2013</xref>) and, as reported before, in terrestrial taxa accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) occurs as seeds mature (Kinderen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1987</xref>; Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>; Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>). This must be the case with some of the species to prepare them to face adverse environmental conditions before they can be germinated with the help of mycorrhizal fungi in the wild. The testa of near mature seeds have living cells and are yet to acquire their hydrophobic nature. Accordingly, there were not many barriers to absorb water/nutrients from the media to germinate in vitro. In addition to the physical barrier the high endogenous ABA level in mature seeds may cause poor germination in orchids, especially terrestrial orchids (Kinderen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1987</xref>). In the cases of <italic>Calanthe tricarinata</italic> (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>) and <italic>Cypripedium formosanum</italic>, the endogenous ABA level is low in immature seeds, and increases rapidly as the seeds approach maturity, coinciding with a rapid decrease in seed germination. Collecting immature seeds at 6&#x000a0;weeks after pollination (WAP) could give high seed permeability and low endogenous ABA, which results in improved seed germination in vitro (Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>).</p><p id="Par32">Mature orchid seeds showing varying germination frequencies may be demonstrating dormancy induced by inhibitory substances as reported before (Nagashima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1982a</xref>). However, immature seeds are only available during a short of window of time and need to be sown immediately because of the lack of an effective preservation method (Steele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1996</xref>; Hirano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2005</xref>). It has been predicted that populations occurring in marginal habitats may be more vulnerable to repeated population crashes which can also result in a significant reduction in genetic diversity (Cozzolino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>), which may be the case in many orchids of Madagascar where only a few individuals are left in the wild.</p><p id="Par33">Expanding IVC along with conventional collecting for seed banking will significantly improve the success of ex situ conservation of Madagascan orchids. Ultimately there is a great need to understand the importance of mycorrhizal fungi in epiphytes and, especially, lithophytes to improve reintroduction/restoration to support integrated conservation for meaningful outcomes in the longer term. At the moment very little is known about the mycorrhizae of lithophytes and epiphytes of Madagascan orchids except the preliminary studies conducted in our laboratory (Yokoya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">During embryo development in orchids the inner integument shrinks and forms a tight layer, which encloses the embryo, termed &#x02018;carapace&#x02019; (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2005</xref>), mainly described in terrestrial taxa. The cuticular stain Nile Red detects this layer which may play a role in the hydrophobic nature of orchid seed and may help the seeds survive in harsh conditions. The carapace is visible in the seeds of <italic>Angraecum protensum</italic> as reported in terrestrial orchids (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2013</xref>; Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2005</xref>), when seeds were sectioned and stained with Nile Red. The carapace is quite prominent in lithophytic orchids, as in terrestrial taxa, and can act as a robust protective cover for the embryo. When seeds were scarified mechanically, germination percentage achieved was close to the viability percentage recorded by TTC staining. This could be the reason why IVC collected seeds performed better, with carapace under-developed, compared to fully mature seeds with well-developed carapace. In lithophytic species this may be a distinctive feature as they endure long periods of harsh conditions in a dry lithophytic habitat but detailed screening is essential to find out the trend within this group of plants. According Lee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2005</xref>) the timing of seed collection outweighs the composition of the culture medium and the seed pre-treatments in a terrestrial orchid, where they have used bleach as chemical scarification. When sonication (0.5&#x02013;5&#x000a0;min) was used, however, 3&#x000a0;min exposure improved seed germination by more than 30%. This treatment made perforations in the carapace which improved germination, either by reducing the hydrophobic nature of the seed, aiding moisture absorption and/or breaking the dormancy. Although this is a small study in a lithophytic orchid, the results indicate that the carapace is a barrier which protects the seeds in order to overcome adverse environmental conditions and keep seeds viable until germination can take place under favourable conditions with the help of orchid mycorrhizal fungus/fungi.</p><p id="Par35">
<italic>Angraecum rutenbergianum</italic> appeared to be a good coloniser of its habitat in the study area of Itremo. Although the species has both epiphytic and lithophytic habit, plants were found, in most cases, growing in exposed cracks and bare faces of crags and boulders. Seedling recruitment appeared to be high as large groups of seedlings could be found growing in lichen within a few metres of groups of adult plants. This would tally with a reasonable germination percentage of mature seed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Aerangis ellisii</italic>, which is also found as either epiphyte or lithophyte but found predominantly growing as a lithophyte in the CHM, existed in extremely small populations of large adult plants with few seedlings evident in their vicinity. Erratic pollination has been recorded in two separate studies in <italic>Aerangis ellisii</italic> (Nilsson and Rabakonandrianina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1988</xref>; Nilsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1992</xref>) where the pollinator activity is geographically limited. It is striking that, in both IVC and mature capsules with high percentage of full seeds, germination percentage was nil. This discovery raises further concerns for this CITES Appendix I species.</p><p id="Par36">The low germination in mature seeds of <italic>Aerangis ellisii</italic> may be showing the consequences of inbreeding as only isolated plants were encountered in each location. This has been reported before in this species (Nilsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1988</xref>). The same kind of response was noticed in the case of mature seeds of an unidentified species of another <italic>Aerangis</italic>. Full seed percentage was consistent in all the capsules collected, both mature and IVC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), although mature seeds failed to germinate while IVC seeds germinated very well (more than 60% from all seed capsules). We have conducted further studies with small seed samples in another <italic>Aerangis</italic> species and noticed a similar trend. This means there may be an onset of dormancy/development of carapace layer/s as soon as the seeds start maturing. IVC can be used as a complementary tool as part of an integrated conservation action plan.</p><p id="Par37">In both <italic>Aerangis</italic> and <italic>Angraecum</italic> a trend exists where IVC seeds performed far better than mature seeds and this cannot be ignored. As Madagascar is home to about 133 <italic>Angraecum</italic> species and more than 20 species of <italic>Aerangis</italic> their ex situ conservation action plans can be built around collecting seeds at immature/near mature stages to support asymbiotic models for living collection development and cryopreservation. The number of full seeds and viability of mature seeds all point to the fact that <italic>Aerangis</italic> is a genus which has serious conservation issues. The reported pollination behaviour of <italic>Aerangis ellisii</italic> (Nilsson and Rabakonandrianina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1988</xref>; Nilsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1992</xref>) explains the low full seed percentage, and the fragmentation we have found in the wild shows very little recruitment, all of which could drive the species to serious population decline in the coming decades. Detailed studies are in progress in our laboratory to understand the symbiotic relationship of this species using fungi isolated from seedlings collected from the wild.</p><p id="Par38">Harding et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>) reviewed the ex situ conservation of endemic flora from biodiversity hotspots, specifically using Brazil as an example and are of the opinion that ex situ conservation of endemic taxa in gene banks is often mired by information deficiency in areas of molecular genetics, seed storage and related aspects. Changing climate, population fragmentation and a lack of phenology data means reliable methods are required to collect seeds from as many species as possible to conduct trials for germination, cryopreservation and reintroduction programmes. The recent recommendation to cryopreserve orchid seeds rather than attempting to store them in conventional seed banks at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (Merritt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>) requires urgent attention. Mature good quality seed collections are a pre-requisite to achieve this system of storage. However, there are some orchid taxa which can only be collected opportunistically and in small numbers which need an alternative approach. According to Nagashima (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1982b</xref>) some mature seeds have intrinsic germination problems due to accumulation of inhibitory substances and ensuing dormancy or potentially by the impermeability of the seed to a level that reduces germination following full seed maturation (Miyoshi and Mii <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1988</xref>). Several methods such as sonication (Miyoshi and Mii <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1988</xref>), scarification by chemicals (Mweetwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>), and chilling (Kauth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>) have been reported to improve germination by degrading the physical barrier. According to Rasmussen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1995</xref>) the alternative to bypass this bottleneck is by sowing immature seeds without any pre-treatment. For example, seeds of <italic>Cymbidium goeringii</italic> showed higher germination when they were harvested close to the completion of embryogenesis but not at seed maturation Nagashima (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1982b</xref>). As seeds are available only during a specific window of time they should be collected at the right time and sown immediately. When an in vitro laboratory is remotely located and access to facilities is limited it is difficult to collect plant material at the right maturity, therefore, IVC has applications to circumvent this bottleneck.</p><p id="Par39">Statistical analysis showed that the tribe Vandeae, comprising the genera <italic>Aerangis, Angraecum, Jumellea</italic> and <italic>Polystachya</italic> had significantly higher germination of seeds collected through IVC than conventionally collected mature seeds. This suggests a trend in seed behaviour in this taxon. In other tribes (here including Podochileae, Cymbidieae and Orchideae), there was no significant difference between the germination of mature versus IVC seeds. The majority of epiphytic species from Madagascar can be collected by the standard collecting method as we have noticed in several species of <italic>Bulbophyllum</italic> and <italic>Polystachya</italic>. This shows that in these taxa, for seed that is viable, IVC does not lead to deterioration of seed and can complement conventional collecting as part of collecting for conventional seed banking.</p><p id="Par40">Due to restricted availability of orchid capsules from the wild the numbers of capsules obtained for each species varied, as seen in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. Only mature seeds were available to collect in the case of <italic>Angraecum protensum</italic>. In order to justify the improved orchid seed germination by IVC method a data set consisting of full seed ratio and germination rate for collections of 6 species was subject to Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis one-way analysis of variance. Comparing with mature seed the collections by IVC method promoted the germination rate of overall collection of six species in the present study with high significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), No difference of germination rate observed between species (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.29). The unverified species <italic>Aerangis</italic> sp. showed significantly higher full seed ratio than <italic>Aerangis ellisii</italic>.

Pearson&#x02019;s product-moment correlation test on the total 37 observations in the overall data set revealed a weak positive linear relationship (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.35) between full seed ratio and germination rate of those collected seed (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par41">One of the principal threats in the CHM habitats is fire (Hermans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>; Whitman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2011</xref>) and a number of lithophytic orchids may be more prone to threats of extinction from the studied habitats than terrestrial orchids. This group of vulnerable taxa from the CHM should be prioritised and targeted for ex situ collections with IVC as a potential tool to complement conventional seed collecting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">There are several impediments to work on species of high conservation value especially in small islands and biodiversity hotspot countries. The main problems are remoteness of the area for international teams who collaborate with local partners to access plants in the wild, few seed samples to collect, and in particular only limited information available on the phenology of seed capsule development and maturity. Seed storage of recalcitrant crop wild relatives, which underpins food security in the coming decades, and threatened plants (Li and Pritchard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>) requires high quality materials. Collecting of recalcitrant seeds for large scale storage programmes require tangible sterilisation models to keep the embryonic axis/embryos in good condition until they can be processed in the lab. Our method using NaDCC offers great potential to work on storage, especially cryopreservation. Berjak et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>) demonstrated the efficiency of NaDCC to keep materials in good condition before cryostorage.</p><p id="Par43">For orchids our work done in the Central Highlands of Madagascar points to the fact that large genera such as <italic>Angraecum</italic> and <italic>Aerangis</italic> are facing serious threats to their existence due to low seed set, poor quality of seeds, and intrinsic poor recruitment in addition to the well-documented problems of habitat loss and climate change. As terrestrial taxa have specific maturity periods for their peak viability IVC offers great potential for collecting seeds at the right maturity for species where phenological data is available.</p><p id="Par44">The method described here has the potential to aid species with recalcitrant seeds, and vegetative materials from critically endangered species. We believe our findings also have the potential to harvest seeds straight from the plant to growth medium without creating a major shock to the physiology of the seed which is essential for both applied research in groups of high conservation and crop value, and for experimental studies.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional file</title><p>
