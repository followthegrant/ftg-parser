HTR8/SVneo cells were randomly assigned into normal, hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), HR + AAT and HR + siRNA-AAT groups. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to detect the mRNA and protein expressions of p-p38MAPK, AAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and activating transcription factor2 (ATF2). Flow cytometry, scratch test, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and the 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiazol (-z-y1)-3,5-di- phenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were conducted to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell apoptosis, cell migration, proliferation and cytotoxicity, respectively. Mouse models in PE were established, which were divided into normal pregnancy (NP), PE and PE + AAT groups with blood pressure and urine protein measured. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were conducted to detect the activity of oxidative stress-related kinases and expressions of inflammatory cytokines and coagulation-related factors in cells and mice placenta. Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were performed to detect AAT and p38MAPK expressions, apoptosis-related protein expressions, and apoptosis rate in mice placenta. Compared with the normal group, the H/R group had decreased expression of AAT, activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and GSH-Px, cell proliferation and migration, but increased p38MAPK, STAT1, ATF2, MDA, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, inflammatory cytokines, coagulation-related factors, cell cytotoxicity, ROS, apoptotic factors and apoptosis rate. Compared with the H/R group, the HR + ATT group had increased expressions of AAT, activity of SOD and GSH-Px, cell proliferation and migration but decreased p38MAPK, STAT1, ATF2, malonyldialdehyde (MDA), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, inflammatory cytokines and coagulation-related factors, cell cytotoxicity, ROS, apoptotic factors and apoptosis rate, while opposite results were observed in the HR + siRNA-ATT group. Compared with the NP group, the PE group had decreased activity of SOD and GSH-Px but increased MDA, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, AAT, p38MAPK, inflammatory cytokines, coagulation-related factors and apoptosis rate. The indexes in the PE + AAT group were between the NP and PE groups. Thus, we concluded that AAT suppressed oxidative stress in PE by inhibiting p38MAPK signaling pathway.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Jiangsu Provincial Science and Technology Department of the Key Disease Standardized Diagnosis and Treatment Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. BE2015618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Ya-Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Standardized Diagnosis and Treatment Projects Research Program of Medical Science and Technology Development Fund of the Medical Control Center in Wuxi City</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. YGZXG1408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Ya-Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Nature Sciences Foundation of Jiangsu Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>No.BK20141100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Ya-Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Wuxi Maternal and Child Health-Care Hospital Dr. Start Fund Research Projects</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 2014BS06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Ling-Qin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Maternal and Child Health Research Projecting Jiangsu Province</institution></funding-source><award-id>F201422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Ling-Qin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported in part by a grant from Jiangsu provincial science and Technology Department of the key disease standardized diagnosis and treatment project (No. BE2015618), by a grant from standardized diagnosis and treatment projects research program of Medical Science and Technology Development Fund of the Medical Control Center in Wuxi City (No. YGZXG1408), by Nature Sciences Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20141100), by Wuxi Maternal and Child Health-Care Hospital Dr. start fund research projects (No. 2014BS06), and by Maternal and Child Health research projecting Jiangsu province (F201422).

PE is the third major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality across the world and affects 3% to 5% of all pregnancies, with estimated 60,000 maternal deaths each year worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Pregnancy itself increases susceptibility to oxidative stress, possibly resulting in tissue damage [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the production of pro-oxidants and reactive oxygen species (ROS) towards the end of pregnancy is increased in normal uncomplicated pregnancy and maintained through the accumulation of antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), tocopherols, and carotenoids, as well as ascorbic acid [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Interestingly, the pro-oxidant (MDA) and antioxidant (GSH and SOD) balance is disturbed in pregnancy with PE, and increased oxidative stress along with antioxidative defense mechanisms may contribute to the progression of PE [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), a kinase belonging to the MAPK superfamily, which modulates diverse cellular events, is of great importance for placental organogenesis along with trophoblastic growth and invasion [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It has been found that oxidative stress is an important inducer of the synthesis of the placenta along with the release of pro-inflammatory factors, and most of these effects are regulated by the p38MAPK signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), a serine protease inhibitor (serpins) encoded by the AAT gene that includes seven exons and six introns, is located on chromosome 14 at q31 within the serpin-related gene cluster [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. AAT, an abundant protein that is mainly expressed in hepatocytes, primarily functions to inhibit the destructive neutrophil proteases elastase, and proteinase 3, as well as cathepsin G [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has been suggested that accumulation of AAT weakens neutrophil infiltration during acute and chronic inflammation and decreases neutrophil infiltration into the kidney during the attack of ischemia-reperfusion [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A deficiency of AAT will lead to misfolded mutant protein expression, which is further involved in some disorders, such as tissue injury and oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A recent study suggests that AAT injection can not only inhibit oxidative stress but also inactivates the PAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)/p38 signaling pathway in PE [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As previous researches were mainly focused on the vascular endothelial cells and tissues or the relationship between AAT or p38MAPK signaling pathway and the development of PE, there was no study conducted regarding how AAT affects the development of PE through oxidative stress by regulating p38MAPK signaling pathway in trophoblast cells. Therefore, this current study aims to explore the role of AAT and the p38MAPK signaling pathway in oxidative stress during the onset of PE and to investigate whether AAT treatment could be therapeutically beneficial to the improvement of PE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The HTR-8/SVneo cell lines were obtained from Professor Charles H.

Our study aims to investigate the roles of AAT and the p38MAPK signaling pathway in OS during PE. The data revealed that AAT could reduce OS, promote proliferation and migration and suppress apoptosis of HTR-8/SVneo cells via inhibiting the p38MAPK signaling pathway in PE.</p><p>In our study, the mice in PE group have higher blood pressure and proteinuria, increased MDA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels but decreased SOD activity compared to the mice with normal pregnancy. PE is a pregnancy-specific syndrome characterized by hypertension and proteinuria [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Consistent with our study, Bosco et al. detected a lower activity of SOD in PE placentas compared with normal placentas [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; A previous study also confirmed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA levels were also detected significantly increased in preeclamptic placentas than in normal ones [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173711.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Our findingsuggest that AAT overexpression decreased the MDA level and elevated the activities of both SOD and GSH-Px damaged by H/R inury, which is further confirmed by the evidence that the PE mice with AAT overexpression had higher SOD activity but lower MDA or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in the placental tissues as compared to the PE mice. Oxidative stress of the placenta is a leading risk factor, leading to endothelial dysfunction by direct actions on the vasculature [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Various important antioxidants, such as SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (which is able to protectthe vasculature from ROS damage and maintain the vascular function at normal levels), are remarkably reduced in the maternal circulation stage of women with PE [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Through a dose- and time-dependent manner, exogenous AAT can alleviate the damage caused by H/R, which implies the cytoprotective role of AAT in vascular endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The work of Feng et al. indicates that AAT injection plays an anti-oxidative stress role by facilitating a significant reduction of PE mediated-elevation of MDA and ROS and an increase in the levels of GPx and SOD with increased AAT dosage [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which is consistent with our results.</p><p>Additionally, compared with the normal HTR-8/SVneo cells, the AAT expression was reduced, while p38MAPK, STAT1 and ATF2 expressions were increased in the HTR-8/SVneo cells after H/R treatment, suggesting that AAT and OS oppose each other and that oxidative stress can promote the p38MAPK signaling pathway. Similarly, Cindrova-Davies et al. discovered that HR-induced oxidative stress could activate the p38MAPK signaling pathway at the onset of PE [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, compared with the normal HTR-8/SVneo cells, the HTR-8/SVneo cells with AAT overexpression have reduced the expressions of p38MAPK, STAT1 and ATF2, indicating that AAT may participate in OS via down-regulation of the p38MAPK signaling pathway, which is further confirmed by in vivo experiment that the placental tissues of PE mice with AAT expression have weaker p-p38MAPK expression than the PE mice.</p><p>Our study also revealed that after H/R treatment, the expressions of eNOS, ET-1, sFlt, coagulation-related genes (PAI-1 and t-PA), and inflammatory factors (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-4, IL-2 and IL-6) is elevated. An elevated eNOS level increases NO production, which may be an adaptive response to the increased resistance as well as poor perfusion in the pathological pregnancies [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additonally, H/R intervention causes p38 activation and ultimately leads to an increase in sFlt-1 secretion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It has been reported that increased circulating ET-1 is associated with PE [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and that PAI-1 levels were found up-regulated in patients with PE [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which is related to enhance inflammatory reactions [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A previous study supported our results that AAT could inhibit cell secretion and the expressions of secretion function-related genes (eNOS, ET-1, sFlt), coagulation-related factors, and inflammatory factors by regulating the p38MAPK signaling pathway. It was found that eNOS and sFltwas reduced when AAT is increased [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. AAT can also inhibit the proteinases and restrain the ectatic process, which hasbeneficial effects on the balance of the coagulation system [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As Jonigk et al. suggested that AAT could possesse anti-inflammatory as well as immunomodulatory properties [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Evidence has shown that oxidative stress can activate the p38MAPK signaling pathway, which results in a maternal inflammatory reaction manifested in endothelial dysfunction and the symptoms of PE [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As reflected in our study, the addition of PMA (an agonist of p38MAPK) recovers the cell secretion function.</p><p>It has been found in our study that AAT overexpression can increase the migration and proliferation abilities of the HTR-8/SVneo cells after H/R damage. Feng et al. have also indicated that overexpression of AAT decreases cell apoptosis and increases cell proliferation through the inhibition of the p38 signaling pathway and oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It was also revealed in our study that AAT can reduce cell apoptosis by regulating the p38MAPK signaling. In the H/R treated HTR-8/SVneo cells, elevated AAT expression can decrease cell apoptosis and apoptosis factors (Fas/FasL and caspase) as well as increase anti-apoptosis factors (Bcl-2). In PE, the apoptosis rate was increased because of oxidative stress and hypoxia reperfusion injury, and Bcl-2 protein can especially cause H/R-induced apoptosis in the placenta [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. That may be due to p38 inhibition, which can provide protective effects on H/R-exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells by suppressing oxidative stress and inhibiting apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0173711.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests that AAT could suppress oxidative stress, promote proliferation and migration and suppress apoptosis of HRT-8/SVneo cells and improve PE via inactivating the p38MAPK signaling pathway, which may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy applicable to the management of PE. Considering that the experiments <italic>in vivo</italic> were performed in mice instead of human beings, the data might not be convincing enough to confirm our findings. Therefore, our results shall be further verified and enriched by future studies to enhance the power of our results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to reviewers for critical comments to the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0173711.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Whitley</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cartwright</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name>. <article-title>Pre-eclampsia: fitting together the placental, immune and cardiovascular pieces</article-title>. <source>J Pathol</source>. <year>2010</year>; <volume>221</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>363</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>78</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/path.2719</pub-id>
