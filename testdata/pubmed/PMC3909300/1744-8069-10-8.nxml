Therefore, Kv channels might be potential targets for prevention and/or treatment of this disorder. We reported here that a majority of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were positive for Kv channel alpha subunit Kv1.2. Most of them were large and medium, although there was a variety of sizes. Peripheral nerve injury caused by lumbar (L)<sub>5</sub> spinal nerve ligation (SNL) produced a time-dependent reduction in the number of Kv1.2-positive neurons in the ipsilateral L<sub>5</sub> DRG, but not in the contralateral L<sub>5</sub> DRG. Such reduction was also observed in the ipsilateral L<sub>5</sub> DRG on day 7 after sciatic nerve axotomy. Rescuing nerve injury-induced reduction of Kv1.2 in the injured L<sub>5</sub> DRG attenuated the development and maintenance of SNL-induced pain hypersensitivity without affecting acute pain and locomotor function. This effect might be attributed to the prevention of SNL-induced upregulation of endogenous Kv1.2 antisense RNA, in addition to the increase in Kv1.2 protein expression, in the injured DRG. Our findings suggest that Kv1.2 may be a novel potential target for preventing and/or treating neuropathic pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Potassium channels</kwd><kwd>Kv1.2</kwd><kwd>Distribution</kwd><kwd>Dorsal root ganglion</kwd><kwd>Neuropathic pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peripheral nerve injury often causes persistent neuropathic pain that is characterized by spontaneous ongoing or intermittent burning pain, allodynia, and hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Treatment options are limited in part because our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the induction and maintenance of neuropathic pain is incomplete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Peripheral nerve injury causes several changes in the nervous system, including abnormal ectopic firing from neuromas and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These abnormal neuronal activities play a critical role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain.</p><p>DRG neurons express a variety of ion channels, including voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Kv channels are tetramers of superfamily-specific channel subunits that comprise ion-conducting integral protein &#x003b1; subunits and auxiliary cytoplasmic &#x003b2; subunits. More than a dozen &#x003b1; subunits of the Kv channel have been isolated from mammalian cells and divided into 12 subfamilies, Kv1&#x02013;12; many subfamilies consist of more than one subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Because Kv channels are critical for establishing resting membrane potential and controlling neuronal excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], changes in the expression levels and operating characteristics of Kv channels in the DRG after peripheral nerve injury may contribute to abnormal activities of DRG neurons in neuropathic pain.</p><p>The Kv1.2 subunit may participate in the formation of Kv channel tetramers in most DRG neurons. The mRNA for Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 is highly abundant, whereas that of Kv1.3, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, and Kv1.6 is present at lower levels in the DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Some controversy exists regarding the subpopulation distribution of Kv1.2 in rat DRG. For example, Ishikawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] showed that Kv1.2 was expressed in small DRG neurons, whereas Rasband et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] revealed that Kv1.2 was predominantly distributed in large DRG neurons. Interestingly, peripheral nerve injury down-regulated the expression of Kv1.2 in the injured DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This down-regulation may be responsible for the nerve injury-induced increase in the ectopic discharge activity observed in DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, DRG Kv.1.2 might be a potential target for neuropathic pain treatment.</p><p>In the present study, we first characterized the subpopulation distribution patterns and neurochemical properties of Kv1.2-positive cells. Second, we used immunohistochemistry to further examine the temporal change in the number of K v1.2-positive neurons in the injured DRG in two peripheral nerve injury models: lumbar (L)<sub>5</sub> spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and sciatic nerve transection (axotomy). Finally, we tested whether rescuing Kv1.2 downregulation by over-expressing Kv1.2 RNA in the injured DRG affected SNL-induced neuropathic pain, acute pain, and locomotor functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats (250&#x02013;300&#x000a0;g, Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Indianapolis, IN) were housed in cages on a standard 12:12&#x000a0;h light/dark cycle. Water and food were available <italic>ad libitum</italic> until rats were transported to the laboratory approximately 1&#x000a0;h before experiments. All experimental procedures received prior approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Johns Hopkins University. Animal procedures were consistent with the ethical guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and the International Association for the Study of Pain and the ethical guidelines to investigate experimental pain in a conscious animal. Efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used. The experimenters were blind to the treatment condition during the behavioral testing.</p></sec><sec><title>DRG microinjection</title><p>DRG microinjection was carried out as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Briefly, the DRG was exposed by laminectomy. A midline incision was made in the lower lumbar back region, and the L<sub>5</sub> vertebral body was exposed. The lamina was then removed with small ronguers. After the DRG was exposed, viral solution (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/DRG, 10<sup>12</sup> particles/ml) was injected into one site in the L<sub>5</sub> DRG with a glass micropipette connected to a Hamilton syringe. The pipette was removed 10 min after injection. The surgical field was irrigated with sterile saline and the skin incision closed with wound clips.</p></sec><sec><title>L<sub>5</sub> SNL-induced neuropathic pain model</title><p>L<sub>5</sub> SNL was carried out according to our previous protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Briefly, after the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, the left L<sub>6</sub> transverse process was removed to expose the L<sub>4</sub> and L<sub>5</sub> spinal nerves. The L<sub>5</sub> spinal nerve was then carefully isolated, tightly ligated with 3&#x02013;0 silk thread, and transected just distal to the ligature. The surgical procedure for the sham group was identical to that of the SNL group, except that the spinal nerve was not transected or ligated.</p></sec><sec><title>Sciatic nerve axotomy</title><p>After the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, the left sciatic nerve was exposed, and the nerve was cut at a point approximately 1&#x000a0;cm distal to the exit point of spinal nerve roots according to the method described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Proximal and distal stumps were separated to ensure full transection. In the sham group, the surgical procedure was identical, except that the sciatic nerve was not transected.</p></sec><sec><title>Capsaicin-induced acute pain</title><p>The experimental procedure used for the capsaicin test was carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Briefly, fifty &#x003bc;l of vehicle (0.7% alcohol) or capsaicin (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) was injected intradermally under the dorsal surface of the rat left hindpaw by use of a microsyringe with a 26-gauge needle. The amount of time that animals spent licking and/or lifting the injected paw was measured with a stopwatch and was considered as an indicator of the nocifensive response. The animal was observed individually for 5&#x000a0;min immediately after the injection of vehicle or capsaicin. Mechanical, cold, and thermal tests as described below were carried out 30&#x000a0;min after the injection of vehicle or capsaicin.</p></sec><sec><title>Behavioral testing</title><p>Mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds were measured with the up&#x02013;down testing paradigm 1 day before surgery and on days 3, 7, and 14 after SNL or sham surgery according to our previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Briefly, the rat was placed in a Plexiglas chamber on an elevated mesh screen. Von Frey hairs in log increments of force (0.407, 0.692, 1.202, 2.041, 3.63, 5.495, 8.511, 15.14&#x000a0;g) were applied to the plantar surface of the left and right hind paws. The 2.041-g stimulus was applied first. If a positive response occurred, the next smaller von Frey hair was used; if a negative response was observed, the next higher von Frey hair was used. The test was ended when (i) a negative response was obtained with the 15.14-g hair, (ii) four stimuli were applied after the first positive response, or (iii) nine stimuli were applied to one hind paw.</p><p>Paw withdrawal latencies to cold were measured with a cold plate, the temperature of which was monitored continuously. A differential thermocouple thermometer (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA) attached to the plate provided temperature precision of 0.1&#x000b0;C. Each animal was placed in a Plexiglas chamber on the cold plate, which was set at 0&#x000b0;C. The length of time between the placement of the hind paw on the plate and the animal jumping, with or without paw licking and flinching, was defined as the paw withdrawal latency. Each trial was repeated three times at 10-min intervals for the paw on the ipsilateral side. A cutoff time of 60&#x000a0;s was used to avoid paw tissue damage.</p><p>Paw withdrawal latencies to heat were measured with a Model 336 Analgesia Meter (IITC Life Science Instruments, Woodland Hills, CA, USA). Each animal was placed in a Plexiglas chamber on a glass plate (at 25&#x000b0;C) located above a light box. Radiant heat was applied by aiming a beam of light through a hole in the light box through the glass plate to the middle of the plantar surface of each hind paw. When the animal lifts its paw in response to the heat, the light beam is turned off. The length of time between the start of the light beam and the foot lift was defined as the paw withdrawal latency. Each trial was repeated five times at 5-minute intervals for each paw. A cutoff time of 20 seconds was used to avoid paw tissue damage.</p><p>The following locomotor function tests were performed: (1) Placing reflex: The rat was held with the hind limbs slightly lower than the forelimbs, and the dorsal surfaces of the hind paws were brought into contact with the edge of a table. The experimenter recorded whether the hind paws were placed on the table surface reflexively; (2) Grasping reflex: The rat was placed on a wire grid and the experimenter recorded whether the hind paws grasped the wire on contact; (3) Righting reflex: The rat was placed on its back on a flat surface and the experimenter noted whether it immediately assumed the normal upright position. Scores for placing, grasping, and righting reflexes were based on counts of each normal reflex exhibited in five trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid construction, cell culture and transfection, and virus production</title><p>To construct the full-length Kv1.2 expression plasmid, total RNA was extracted from rat DRG tissue using Trizol. The reverse transcription was performed with specific primer (5&#x02032;-GGGTGACTCTCATCTTTGGA-3&#x02032;). Then the full-length sequence of Kv1.2 cDNA was amplified using primers (Forward: 5&#x02032;-ATCCACCGGTGCCACCATGACAGTGGCTACC GGAGA-3&#x02032;; Reverse: 3&#x02032;-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTCAGACATCAGTTAACATTTTGG-5&#x02032;). The PCR products were subsequently digested using AgeI and NotI and cloned into the restriction sites of the proviral plasmids (pHpa-trs-SK, provided by Dr. R.J. Samulski, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) to replace enhanced GFP (EGFP) sequence. The cDNA sequence and recombinant clones were verified by using DNA sequencing. The resulting two vectors expressed EGFP and Kv1.2 RNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. AAV5 viral particles carrying the two cDNAs were produced at the University of North Carolina Vector Core.</p><p>Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup>) were seeded in 6-well culture plates and cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (10,000 U/ml and 10&#x000a0;mg/ml, respectively). After 24 hours of culture, 2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of the plasmids (pHpa-trs<italic>-</italic>Kv1.2 or pHpa-trs-EGFP) were transfected into the HEK-293&#x000a0;T cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. After the 4-day incubation, the cells were collected and subjected to Western blot analysis as described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Total RNA preparation and quantitative real-time RT-PCR</title><p>RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR were performed according to our previously published protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Briefly, rats were decapitated, and bilateral L<sub>4/5</sub> DRGs and L<sub>5</sub> spinal cord were rapidly collected. To obtain enough RNA, L<sub>4</sub> or L<sub>5</sub> DRGs from one side of three rats per time point were pooled. Total RNA was extracted with the Trizol method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), precipitated with isopropanol, treated with RNase-free DNase I (1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L/20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and reverse-transcribed by using the Omniscript kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with specific primers [Kv1.2: 5&#x02032;-GGG TGA CTC TCA TCT TTG GA-3&#x02032;, Kv1.2 AS: 5&#x02032;-CGTCACACCTCCTGAGGACAG-3&#x02032;, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, an internal control for normalization): 5&#x02032;-GAG CAC AGG GTA CTT TAT TGA T -3&#x02032;]. cDNA was amplified by real-time PCR by using the probes for Kv1.2/Kv1.2 AS (5&#x02032;-/56-FAM/TGC TGT TGG AAT AGG TGT GGA AGG T/BHQ_1/-3&#x02032;) (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA), and GAPDH [probe/primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems (catalog number: 4331182), Foster City, CA]. The Kv1.2 PCR primer sequences were 5&#x02032;-AGA AAG GGT CGG TGA AGG AGG T-3&#x02032; (forward) and 5&#x02032;-GTG TGG CTT CTC TTT GAA TAC C-3&#x02032; (reverse).

Real-time PCR for each sample was run in quadruplicate in a 20-&#x003bc;L reaction with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were performed in an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The amplification protocol was: 3&#x000a0;min at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 45 cycles of 10&#x000a0;sec at 95&#x000b0; for denaturation and 45&#x000a0;sec at 58&#x000b0; for annealing and extension. Ratios of ipsilateral-side mRNA levels to contralateral-side mRNA levels were calculated by using the &#x00394;Ct method (2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup>) at a threshold of 0.02. All data were normalized to GAPDH, which has been demonstrated to be stable even during peripheral nerve injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>The protocol for Western blot analysis has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In brief, cultured cells and bilateral L<sub>5</sub> DRGs were collected and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cultured cells were sonicated and tissues homogenized in chilled lysis buffer (50&#x000a0;mM Tris, 1&#x000a0;mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 1 &#x003bc;M leupeptin). The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C for 15&#x000a0;min at 1,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>. The supernatant was collected and the pellet (nuclei and debris fraction) discarded. After protein concentration was measured, the samples were heated at 99&#x000b0;C for 5&#x000a0;min and loaded onto a 4% stacking/7.5% separating SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 1&#x000a0;h and incubated with primary mouse anti-Kv1.2 (NeuroMab, Davis, CA), primary mouse anti-Kv1.4 (NeuroMab), or primary mouse anti-&#x003b2;-actin (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight under gentle agitation. &#x003b2;-actin was used as a loading control. The proteins were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence regents (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) and exposure to film. The intensity of blots was quantified with densitometry. The blot density from the contralateral side of the EGFP-treated group was set as 100%. The relative density values from the ipsilateral side of the EGFP group and the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of Kv1.2-treated groups after sham or SNL were determined by dividing the optical density values from these groups by the value of the contralateral side in the EGFP-treated group after they were normalized to the corresponding &#x003b2;-actin.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>After being deeply anesthetized with isoflurane, the rats were perfused through the ascending aorta with 100&#x000a0;mL of 0.01&#x000a0;M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH&#x000a0;7.4) followed by 400&#x000a0;mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1&#x000a0;M phosphate buffer (pH&#x000a0;7.4).

An early study reported that Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 are expressed in small-sized DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This finding was not confirmed in a subsequent study that showed Kv1.2 and Kv1.1 to be expressed predominantly in medium- and large-sized DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We used specific cytochemical markers and the measurement of neuronal cell body area to further characterize Kv1.2 expression in functional classes of DRG neurons. In neuron profiles, approximately 72% of Kv1.2-positive neurons were large, 19% were medium, and 9% were small. Consistently, we found that most (80.3%) Kv1.2 co-localized with NF200, a marker for large, myelinated afferents, and some co-localized with P2X3 (11.11%) and CGRP (10.7%), markers of small nociceptive cells. Unexpectedly, few Kv1.2-positive neurons co-expressed two other markers of small nociceptive cells, IB4 (2.45%) and SP (3.97%). It is unclear why Kv1.2 showed different levels of co-localization with distinct nociceptive markers, but the observation may be related to different subpopulation distribution of these markers in rat DRG. CGRP and P2X3 are expressed not only in small DRG neurons but also in medium and/or large DRG neurons, whereas SP and IB4 are expressed exclusively in small DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In addition, CGRP is co-expressed with P2X3, but not with IB4, in some DRG neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Unique subpopulation distribution of Kv1.2 in DRG suggests a functional consequence of its down-regulation on pain-associated behaviors following peripheral nerve injury.</p><p>Nerve injury-induced Kv1.2 downregulation in the injured DRG may participate in neuropathic pain development and maintenance. Data from the present study and those of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] showed a time-dependent decrease in expression of Kv1.2 mRNA and protein in the injured DRG neurons following peripheral nerve injury. This decrease occurred predominantly in large and medium DRG neurons. We recently demonstrated that DRG Kv1.2 reduction in the large and medium DRG neurons decreased total voltage-gated potassium current, depolarized the resting membrane potential, decreased current threshold for activation of action potentials, increased the number of action potentials in these DRG neurons, and produced neuropathic pain symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Blocking SNL-induced reduction of Kv1.2 expression in the injured DRG attenuated neuropathic pain during development and maintenance periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The evidence indicates that DRG Kv1.2 is a key player in neuropathic pain genesis and may be a potential target for preventing and/or treating neuropathic pain. Consistent with this speculation, the present study demonstrated that rescuing Kv1.2 expression in the injured DRG diminished the induction and maintenance of SNL-induced mechanical, cold, and thermal pain hypersensitivities. These behavioral effects may be attributed to direct compensation of SNL-induced reduction of Kv1.2 protein and inhibition of SNL-induced upregulation of Kv1.2 AS RNA in the injured DRG. The latter may be related to the extensive overlap of complimentary regions between Kv1.2 mRNA and Kv1.2 AS RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Given that the nerve injury-induced increase in spontaneous ectopic activity in the injured myelinated afferents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] is believed to play a leading role in the genesis of neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], rescuing Kv1.2 downregulation may maintain normal resting membrane potential and reduce abnormal ectopic activity in the injured DRG neurons. This effect may decrease primary afferent transmitter release and result in attenuation of spinal central sensitization formation and nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity. Interestingly, rescuing DRG Kv1.2 expression does not alter acute pain, which is supported by the observation that the altered DRG Kv1.2 expression did not change the threshold of action potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the strategy of rescuing DRG Kv1.2 expression may be a novel treatment for neuropathic pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing financial interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>YXT conceived and&#x000a0;designed the project and supervised all&#x000a0;experiments.
