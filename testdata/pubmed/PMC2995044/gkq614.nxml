However, regulated splicing changes are likely to be important in biological transitions such as cellular differentiation, or response to environmental stimuli. To assess the extent and significance of AS in myogenesis, we used splicing-sensitive microarray analysis of differentiating C2C12 myoblasts. We identified 95 AS events that undergo robust splicing transitions during C2C12 differentiation. More than half of the splicing transitions are conserved during differentiation of avian myoblasts, suggesting the products and timing of transitions are functionally significant. The majority of splicing transitions during C2C12 differentiation fall into four temporal patterns and were dependent on the myogenic program, suggesting that they are integral components of myogenic differentiation. Computational analyses revealed enrichment of many sequence motifs within the upstream and downstream intronic regions near the alternatively spliced regions corresponding to binding sites of splicing regulators. Western analyses demonstrated that several splicing regulators undergo dynamic changes in nuclear abundance during differentiation. These findings show that within a developmental context, AS is a highly regulated and conserved process, suggesting a major role for AS regulation in myogenic differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Current estimates are that &#x0223c;95% of multi-exon genes in humans are subject to alternative splicing (AS), greatly expanding the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). AS also serves a crucial regulatory role by altering the function, localization and expression level of gene products, often in response to the activities of key signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5">2&#x02013;5</xref>). Misregulation of AS is implicated in the pathogenic mechanisms of several diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>). Splicing regulatory proteins are subject to multiple levels of regulation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>) and AS regulation has been shown to occur during a number of developmental processes including heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>) and T-cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Despite increased recognition of the prevalence of AS and its relevance to development, tissue identity and disease, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate natural splicing transitions. In addition, the broad biological relevance of the extensive transcript diversity generated by AS continues to be debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21">18&#x02013;21</xref>).</p><p>Recent efforts to examine splicing on a global scale using high-throughput techniques such as splicing sensitive microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) have focused primarily on comparing splicing patterns in adult tissues or examining events affected by depletion of <italic>trans</italic> acting factors. Other studies have used purely computational approaches to ascertain the global impact of AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), often relying on EST databases, which are heavily biased towards transcripts derived from brain and cancer tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). By restricting global AS analyses to adult tissues, temporally regulated aspects of AS biology are overlooked. Analysis of global AS transitions during key biological transitions such as development provides an experimental system in which to identify the regulatory mechanisms and biological relevance of AS.</p><p>AS is enriched in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), as are several splicing factors, such as the FOX and Muscleblind-like (MBNL) families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), suggesting that myogenesis is accompanied by high levels of AS regulation. The C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line is a subclone of a cell line derived from adult muscle satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The cells are committed to the myogenic pathway and are highly proliferative when maintained in high serum/low confluence conditions. Exposing confluent C2C12 cells to low serum conditions induces differentiation. Cultures up-regulate the myogenic transcription factor myogenin within 24&#x02009;h, exit the cell cycle within 36&#x02009;h and myoblasts fuse within 72&#x02009;h to form multinucleated myotubes that exhibit morphological and biochemical similarities to immature skeletal muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).

We specifically set out to define networks of AS transitions that occur during myogenic differentiation and to identify <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that control these regulatory networks. Using splicing sensitive microarrays we identified &#x0223c;100 alternatively spliced regions that undergo robust splicing transitions during C2C12 differentiation. Most of the strongly regulated splicing transitions tested are conserved during differentiation of mammalian and avian myoblasts and are dependent on the myogenic program. Computational analysis identified multiple sequence motifs that are significantly enriched and conserved within the intronic regions surrounding the regulated alternative regions. Many of these motifs were significantly associated with specific temporal subsets of splicing transitions. The identified motifs included binding sites for known splicing regulators such as FOX, CELF, hnRNP L, TIA and PTB. A large number of novel sequence motifs were also enriched near regulated regions. Furthermore, many of the splicing regulators with enriched and conserved binding motifs exhibit changes in nuclear abundance during C2C12 differentiation, either due to apparent nuclear/cytoplasmic transitions (MBNL2 and MBNL3) or changes in total steady-state levels (MBNL1, CUGBP1 and CUGBP2, PTB, FOX1 and hnRNP C), while other splicing regulators exhibit relatively constant nuclear steady-state levels (FOX2). These results reveal regulatory networks controlling natural splicing transitions that are likely to be directly relevant to physiological changes associated with muscle differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) were maintained in high-glucose DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (all Invitrogen).

Briefly, the array design included probes to 10&#x02009;111 genes expressed in muscle or heart. Optimized 60-nt probes were designed to monitor each exon, and 36-nt probes were centered across each exon&#x02013;exon junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).

To define the kinetics of splicing transitions, validated events were further analyzed by RT&#x02013;PCR in a series of time course experiments, using total RNA collected at &#x02212;24, 0, 12, 24, 72 and 120&#x02009;h relative to differentiation induction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq614/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). AS is expressed as the percent of mRNA that includes the variable region and splicing transitions are expressed as the change of percent of mRNAs containing the variable region between time points; thus an event that changes from 20 to 50% inclusion is a 30% point change. At least two biological replicates were performed for all time points of all events analyzed in the time course. In addition, all events were tested in at least two additional biological replicates at the &#x02212;24 and 120 time points. The magnitude of most splicing transitions was highly consistent between biological replicates.</p><p>Of the 117 validated splicing events, 95 exhibited strong transitions of &#x02265;20 percentage points with 49 of these exhibiting a change of 40 percentage points or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq614/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). Sixteen events changed between 10 and 20 percentage points and six events displayed changes &#x0003c;10 percentage points. Of the 95 strong events, the average alternative region length was 96&#x02009;nt, with a SD of 49&#x02009;nt. A total of 69 of the 95 strong events (73%) showed increased inclusion during differentiation, and the remaining 26 (27%) showed increased skipping. Among all 117 validated transitions, there were 100 cassette exons (85%), including 16 multiple cassette exons, 8 mutually exclusive exons (7%) and 9 alternative 3&#x02032; or 5&#x02032; splice sites (7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Ninety-six of these 117 events (82%) are predicted to retain the reading frame. In addition, 38 of the 117 events (32%) underwent an average fold change &#x02265;2.0 in gene expression.</p><p>To assess the biological roles of the transcripts undergoing AS transitions during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, we performed comparative GO analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The 95 strong events were compared against a reference set of &#x0223c;10&#x02009;000 transcripts expressed in mouse striated muscle. Genes expressing transcripts undergoing AS transitions were significantly enriched for GO molecular function terms relating to cytoskeletal, actin binding, cell junction and nucleotide kinase molecular functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), as well as a significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.021) over-representation in integrin signaling pathway components, consistent with other muscle specific splicing data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Overall, this data set represents a large cohort of validated, robustly regulated splicing transitions that occur in several temporally coordinated patterns (see below) during myogenic differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>AS transitions associated with muscle differentiation are conserved in mammalian and avian cultures</title><p>To asses the biological relevance of the splicing transitions during muscle differentiation, we examined their conservation between the murine C2C12 line and the quail myoblast cell line QM7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). From a set of 77 strongly regulated alternative exons from the validated data set, we identified 48 orthologous exons in the published chicken genome (build 2.1). A total of 38 (79%) of these were detected by RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq614/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>) of which 22 (57%) were regulated similarly to mouse, three (8%) were oppositely regulated and 13 (34%) were alternatively spliced but showed little or no regulation during QM7 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). We used GO analysis to define the molecular functions of the 25 genes containing exons regulated in both quail and mouse and found that 7 (30%) were within transcripts encoding RNA-binding proteins, a statistically significant enrichment (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.39&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>), while 6 (24%) were within transcripts encoding cytoskeletal components. The high level of conservation of regulated AS transitions in avian and mammalian muscle differentiation strongly suggest that AS regulation plays a biologically significant role and that RNA-binding proteins are conserved targets of splicing regulation.

To determine whether AS regulation is an integrated component of the myogenic program or simply a result of growth factor withdrawal and cell-cycle exit, we used 2,3, butanedione monoxime (BDM) to induce cell-cycle exit and simultaneously block myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). As expected, C2C12 cultures treated with 15&#x02009;&#x000b5;M BDM failed to undergo morphological changes associated with differentiation, including cell alignment and formation of myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). In addition, BDM-treated cultures showed no increase in cell number over time (data not shown), exhibited upregulated expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27, and failed to upregulate expression of the myogenic transcription factor myogenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). We examined 21 splicing events that undergo strong (&#x02265;20 percentage points) differentiation-induced splicing transitions in cells treated at time 0 with BDM compared to cells treated with the DMSO vehicle alone.

Of particular interest are the several splicing transitions that occur predominantly between &#x02212;24 and 0&#x02009;h of differentiation. These events are initiated much earlier than the appearance of transcriptional markers of myogenesis or overt morphological changes indicative of differentiation. Most of these events revert toward the level of inclusion observed at &#x02212;24&#x02009;h when BDM is added at time 0, suggesting dependence on the myogenic differentiation program despite the transition initiating before addition of differentiation media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>Cii).

FOX motifs downstream from regulated alternative regions strongly correlated with continuous increased inclusion of variably spliced regions during differentiation, while upstream FOX motifs were correlated with an early decrease. For PTB, motifs located upstream of the variably spliced region correlated with continuous inclusion and downstream motifs correlated with late exclusion. Upstream hnRNP-L motifs correlated with an early increase in variably spliced region inclusion, while upstream STAR motifs correlated with an early decrease in inclusion. Overall, these data suggest different position- and time-dependent effects for several known splicing regulators and identified novel motifs associated with specific location and time-dependent effects.

Both MBNL2 and MBNL3 undergo changes in nuclear abundance as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution early in differentiation, with nuclear protein first detectable at 12&#x02009;h. Five proteins (hnRNP L, CUGBP1, CUGBP2, FOX1 and PTB) showed modulation of nuclear abundance &#x0003e;24&#x02009;h following induction of differentiation. Nuclear levels of CUGBP1 and CUGBP2 proteins shown a respective slight decrease and increase during C2C12 differentiation. FOX1 levels increased modestly, while FOX2 protein levels remained constant throughout differentiation and PTB decreases during differentiation.</p><p>Overall, changes in nuclear levels of some proteins correlated well with the preceding analyses associating known binding motifs with specific temporal patterns. Motifs associated with hnRNP L and PTB correlated predominantly with late changes, which is consistent with the late changes in protein expression. It is important to note that regulated splicing is likely to involve combinatorial control such that expression levels of individual proteins might be involved in but not solely determinative of splicing patterns (see Discussion). We conclude that several of the splicing regulators identified through enriched/conserved binding motifs and that undergo changes in nuclear abundance are likely to play important roles in regulating myogenic splicing transitions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Although there is ample evidence for extensive regulation of AS in metazoans, there are conflicting views as to the extent of its biological significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21">18&#x02013;21</xref>). By amassing a large validated data set of AS transitions that occur in response to myogenic differentiation, we characterized global splicing regulation directly and in a biologically relevant context. We found nearly 100 splicing transitions that were robustly regulated during differentiation, most AS events detected in both mouse and quail myoblasts underwent conserved transitions during differentiation, were dependent on the myogenic program, and can be grouped into four temporal patterns, demonstrating coordinated regulation. In addition, AS transitions initiate prior to the appearance of the earliest transcriptional markers of differentiation, indicative of links to myogenic differentiation program within proliferating myoblasts. These findings strongly support a biologically significant role for AS as an integral component of myogenic differentiation. This conclusion is further supported by results from mRNA-Seq analysis published while this manuscript was in revision, demonstrating extensive splicing changes during C2C12 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>).</p><p>We found that more than half of the splicing transitions detectable in the QM7 quail cell line were conserved with mouse. This high level of conservation is particularly striking given the 300 million years of evolution that separates mammals and birds and the fact that not only is AS conserved, but also a regulated transition of splicing patterns during a shared developmental process. Genome-wide analysis using EST and full-length cDNA databases have detected low levels of AS conservation across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49 B50 B51">49&#x02013;51</xref>). However, here we find that a high proportion of splicing transitions in myogenic differentiation are conserved, consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Previously, we identified a conserved network of splicing transitions that occur during postnatal murine heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). It is interesting to note that 49 out of 78 (62.8%) of the splicing transitions that occur during postnatal heart development are regulated during C2C12 differentiation. Additionally, in both systems splicing transitions occurred in tightly grouped temporal waves, suggesting that the splicing regulatory programs in myoblast differentiation and heart development at least partially overlap. GO analysis of the regulated transcripts in C2C12 showed a strong enrichment in molecular function terms relating to muscle development and function, even when compared against a muscle specific background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), consistent with other muscle splicing data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Additionally, several of the regulated AS transitions we observed during C2C12 differentiation have already been experimentally shown to be important for normal muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52 B53 B54 B55 B56">52&#x02013;56</xref>), further supporting the view that AS regulation is affecting processes that are biologically significant to muscle. A substantial subset of alternative exons that have been previously shown to be enriched in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) muscle were found to undergo transitions in exon inclusion during C2C12 differentiation. Specifically, of the 56 muscle-enriched human exons described by Das <italic>et al</italic>., 21 (37.5%) were orthologous to exons we observed to undergo splicing transitions during C2C12 differentiation. Consistent with our results, this study identified enrichment of Fox and CELF-binding sites within 200-nt downstream of muscle enriched exons. Sugnet <italic>et al.</italic> reported 28 exons enriched in adult mouse skeletal muscle. Of these 28 exons, 12 (42.9%) were found to undergo regulated splicing transitions during C2C12 differentiation. However, it should be noted that both of these studies examined adult tissues, thus it is likely that many of the events they identified were excluded from our study because they do not undergo regulated changes in the level of alternative exon inclusion during C2C12 differentiation (despite being enriched in adult muscle). It is also important to note that we did not attempt to exhaustively identify all exons that undergo changes in inclusion levels during C2C12 differentiation, but instead our goal was to identify a large set of robust splicing transitions which we could then use for computational and molecular analysis, and it is likely that many splicing transitions that occur during C2C12 differentiation were not detected in our study.</p><p>To determine whether the splicing transitions are specific to the myogenic differentiation pathway or are a general response to cell-cycle withdrawal, we included BDM in the differentiation medium which allows induction of cell-cycle arrest but prevents progression of the differentiation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). The results indicated that most of the splicing transitions tested are dependent on induction of the myogenic program and cannot be induced through serum deprivation, cellular confluence and/or cell-cycle exit alone. Time course experiments showed that &#x02265;10 splicing transitions occur largely before the addition of differentiation media (Hour 0), suggesting that these events are regulated by signals associated with increasing cell density or cell-cycle exit. It is particularly interesting that for the majority of the early events tested, the transition initiated in proliferative cells was reversed when myogenic differentiation was blocked by using BDM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>Cii). These results indicate the presence of a signaling mechanism that links early differentiation-dependent splicing transitions with components of the myogenic program that initiate as proliferating myoblasts become confluent.</p><p>Two independent computational analyses to identify motifs associated with specific temporal patterns showed that specific sequence motifs are associated with distinct temporal splicing transition patterns. Both analyses identified hnRNP-L motifs (ACACA) within the proximal upstream intronic region of alternative regions as strongly associated with an early increase in alternative region inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). FOX-binding motifs were also identified in both analyses as strongly associated with increased inclusion when located within the proximal downstream intronic region of alternative regions. Such concordance of two independent computational analyses is strongly supports a position-dependent role for these two proteins in AS regulation.</p><p>Computational analysis demonstrated that motifs associated with known regulators of AS, including the FOX, CELF, PTB, MBNL and hnRNP-L families of splicing regulators, are enriched within the intronic regions surrounding the variably spliced regions that undergo regulation during differentiation. Many of these enriched binding motifs are also conserved with regard to sequence and relative location among eight mammalian species. Regression analysis predicted that FOX-binding upstream from alternative regions promotes skipping, and downstream promotes inclusion, which is in agreement with experimental evidence from other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57 B58 B59">57&#x02013;59</xref>). While FOX-binding sites are highly enriched near differentiation-induced splicing events, steady-state nuclear FOX2 levels remain relatively constant, while FOX1 levels modestly increase very early in C2C12 differentiation but remain constant thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Regression analysis showed that FOX sites are most enriched in early AS changes, suggesting that the early increase in FOX1 steady-state levels could account for early AS transitions observed. However, the FOX2 transcript contains two exons which undergo regulated splicing changes of &#x0003e;20 percentage points during C2C12 differentiation, which could alter its activity independent of its steady-state levels, leading to another mechanism for the regulation of FOX activity. This possibility is supported by reports that show AS in the FOX1 and FOX2 transcripts result in alterations in splicing regulatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>).</p><p>MBNL family members show dynamic regulation in steady-state nuclear protein levels early in myogenic differentiation. Considering the large proportion of validated splicing transitions that show dramatic changes within the first 24&#x02009;h of differentiation, these data indicate that MBNL family members are likely contributors to developmentally regulated myogenic AS. While MBNL-binding motifs were detected in our computational analysis, the high stringency of the analysis combined with the relatively high variability of MBNL-binding motifs likely led to their under-representation. Nevertheless, MBNL-binding motifs were still found to be significantly enriched (corrected <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.55&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) in the downstream distal intronic regions of regulated alternative region. Furthermore, the well characterized role that MBNL family members play in the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy suggest they are important for normal muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Overall, these data demonstrate that AS during myogenic differentiation is highly conserved, extensively regulated and suggests that splicing regulation is influenced by multiple regulatory factors associated with distinct temporal clusters of splicing transitions.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq614/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (grant number <award-id>R01GM076493</award-id> to T.A.C.); Ford Foundation Predoctoral Diversity Fellowship (to C.S.B.); Baylor Research Advocates for Student Scientists (BRASS) (to C.S.B.).</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
