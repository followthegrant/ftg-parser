cord injury (SCI). Nearly 75% of all SCI results in NP affecting 17,000 new
individuals in the United States every year, and an estimated 7&#x02013;10% of
people worldwide. It is caused by damaged or dysfunctional nerve fibers
sending aberrant signals to pain centers in the central nervous system
causing severe pain that affects daily life and routine. The mechanisms
underlying NP are not fully understood, making treatment difficult.
Identification of specific molecular pathways that are involved in pain
syndromes and finding effective treatments has become a major priority in
current SCI research. Yoga has therapeutic applications may prove beneficial

prominent and present a significant complication towards recovery. SCI is persistent
worldwide with an annual incidence up to 40 cases per million, with more than 17,000
cases each year in the United States alone [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. NP is a common outcome following SCI occurring in up to 70% of SCI
patients [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Currently, no globally acceptable treatment exists for SCI-induced
neuropathic pain. The mechanisms behind the pain syndrome are not well understood
due to its complexity and its likeliness to be induced by multiple causes. In
addition to pain, the patient also experiences tremendous loss of function below the
level of the lesion and quality of life. Yoga as an alternative medicine in
rehabilitation has shown may increase pain tolerance in SCI and other patients with
pain [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The impact of yoga on SCI has not been officially documented as
there are no known published studies of this work. Most of the yoga studies are
confronted with methodological limitations especially with regard to choice of
control group and lack of blindness. These limitations also apply to majority of
studies examining the effect of diet and exercise on disease management and wellness
because human compliance to change in diet, exercise or yoga is not easy to
address.</p><p>&#x0201c;Yoga&#x0201d; (/jo&#x0028a;&#x00261;&#x00259;/) is an ancient Indian combination of a physical, mental and spiritual
practice. It is defined as a system of exercises for mental and physical health. In
Hindu philosophy, the inner peace is achieved by controlling the body and mind
functions. Further, in order to attain liberation and to achieve the supreme, yoga
may help in achieving the mental control and well-being [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These studies show
yoga is being practiced by several religious faiths like Hinduism, Jainism, and
Buddhism, particularly Vajrayana Buddhism. Implication of yoga practice for insulin
resistance syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and possible protection [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as a complementary intervention for cancer
[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], schizophrenia [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and as an alternative and complimentary
treatment for asthma [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] has been
documented. In general, these studies suggest that yoga acts as a preventive measure
and helps in patient&#x02019;s psychological healing process.</p><p>The term &#x0201c;yoga&#x0201d; has changed much since its arrival into our world. It is derived from
the sanskrit word <italic>yuj</italic> which means to unite and it is an ancient
Indian way of life. The main aim of yoga is to achieve holistic health by following
the 8-fold path of yoga. The eight paths include<italic> yama (</italic>universal
ethics for the moral and spiritual development), <italic>niyama</italic> (individual
ethics), <italic>asana</italic> (physical postures for physical development),
<italic>pranayama</italic> (breath control for the improvement of physiological
functions), <italic>pratyahara (</italic>control of the senses), <italic>dharana
(</italic>concentration for making our mind alert and pointy),
<italic>dyana,</italic> (meditation), and <italic>Samadhi (</italic>a bliss
which helps in attaining inner peace)[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
Different branches of yoga also exist which includes <italic>Karma</italic> (path of
service), <italic>Raja</italic> (path of meditation), <italic>Jnana</italic> (path
of sage or scholar), <italic>bhakti</italic> (path of devotion), and
<italic>Tantra</italic> (path of rituals). Also there are various styles
followed by different yoga practitioners like <italic>Hatha</italic> Yoga,
<italic>Kundalini</italic> Yoga, Iyengar Yoga, <italic>Ashtanga</italic> Yoga
etc.</p><p>David Gordon White in 2014 described the <italic>pranayama</italic> technique of
controlling the body with regulated breathing [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, there are always variations in practice but the main steps
of this technique are consistent: 1) inhalation or inspiration, which in Sanskrit
terminology is known as <italic>puraka</italic> which means filling up of lungs, (2)
exhalation or expiration, which in Sanskrit is called <italic>rechaka</italic>
meaning emptying the lungs, and (3) retention or holding the breath which is termed
<italic>kumbhaka</italic>, a state where there is no inhalation or exhalation
[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Regulation of breath affects the
control of the autonomic nervous system, which further has beneficial effects on the
different organs of the body. The autonomic nervous system is the involuntary
response the body has to certain stimuli and is made up by the sympathetic and
parasympathetic systems [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. When Pranayama
breathing is performed with long breath retention, the parasympathetic nervous
system is amplified, resulting in lower metabolic rate and oxygen consumption. On
the other hand, with brief breath retention there is an adverse result of augmented
oxygen consumption and metabolic rate [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
It is also observed that while performing &#x02018;<italic>kapalabhati&#x02019;</italic> yogic
breathing (high frequency breathing) there is exaggerated sympathetic activity and
during &#x02018;<italic>nadisudhi&#x02019;</italic> yogic breathing (Anulom Vilom or slow alternate
nostril breathing) decreased sympathetic activity is observed. Since autonomic
nervous system is the primary control center of the cardiovascular system, a strong
sympathovagal balance ensures its stability.</p><p>Yoga, a healing discipline which includes breath control, meditation and adaptation
of various specific body poses or<italic> asanas</italic> assists in relaxation and
pain relief. Meta-analysis of yoga practice has been suggested as a possible
alternative medicine intervention for patients with physical and psychosocial
symptoms, however, breast cancer patients showed small effect size on functional
wellness [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Various studies have noted
improvement in sleep, mood, and quality of life (i.e. depression, emotional
function, anxiety) among cancer patients [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These studies indicate
how yoga may be helpful in relief of some symptoms associated with cancer; however,
there is no known study on pain improvement in cancer patients. Yoga is believed to
provide relief to cancer patients (American Society of Cancer and NIH), however,
there are no documented studies on the impact of yoga in alleviating the pain
associated with malignancies and the effect it has on the overall well-being of
cancer patients. Like cancer and other disorders, yoga may promote healing for SCI
induced NP, by alleviating pain as it has shown promising results in the other pain
disorders. One of the studies by Galantino<italic> et al</italic> has shown the
impact of the modified Hath yoga practice in chronic low back pain. Results
indicated the improvement in the balance and flexibility of the patients having low
back pain [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] but a large trial is required.
In another study on low back pain, Sherman and colleagues found Viniyoga, which is a
therapeutically oriented yoga school, more significant as compared to control group
in diminishing the low back pain and pain-related disability [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This defines potential role yoga may play in the healing
processes of NP.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Chronic pain in relation to environmental factors</title><p>A large number of evidence from the patients suffering with pain as well as
associated animal models has revealed that chronic pain is not uni-factorial but has
many co-morbidities and consequently may lead to anxiety, depression and cognitive
decline [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Pathophysiology</title><p>It is also observed that there is development of anxiety and depression among
patients undergoing long-term pain, which results in the impairment of their
cognitive functions, particularly working memory. Many studies suggest that
non-pharmacological interventions can reduce the burden of chronic pain. Social
and environmental manipulations have been shown to influence NP. Environmental
enrichment weakens both nerve-injury induced mechanical and cold
hypersensitivity. It is also believed to lower the calcitonin gene-related
peptide (CGRP) and concentration of substance P (SP). On the other hand, an
impoverished environment intensifies mechanical hypersensitivity [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Emerging targets like chemokines,
<italic>Wnt</italic> pathway and proteases have been shown to increase
spinal cord neuro inflammation and chronic pain [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Pro-resolution lipid mediators and anti-inflammatory mediators
have also been implicated to work on glial cells, immune cells, and neurons and
result in resolution of synaptic plasticity, neuro inflammation, and pain.
Targeting the increased neuroinflammation could provide newer therapeutic
opportunities for treatment of chronic pain and related neurological disorders.
The pain can be classified on the basis of its mechanism into five main types
that are peripheral neuropathic, central sensitization, sympathetically
maintained pain, nociceptive, and cognitive-affective [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The management and treatment of NP depends on the
incidence and underlying pathologies. The conventional Post herpetic neuralgia
includes use of Topical lignocaine and anticonvulsants such as Gabapentin and
Carbamezepine. Sodium channel blockers such as Lidocaine, SSRI (Selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors) such as Venlaflaxine, Duroxetine, Opioids such as
Morphine and Fentanyl and transdermal patches remains an expensive intervention
with various side-effects such as orthostatic hypotension, cardiac conduction
defects, memory impairment, urinary retention and sedation. Even the latest
modalities such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS),
conduction blocks, decompression surgeries and spinal cord stimulation have
failed to provide the relief. Moreover, their increased cost and long term side
effects call for an integrative approach which includes yoga [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Understanding molecular mechanisms of NP</title><p>NP following SCI is complex and the mechanisms underlying such pain syndromes are not
well understood. Traumatic SCI leads to changes in the expression of several genes
with significant functional consequences. Different therapies for pain and
functional impairment in both acute and chronic state following SCI are being
explored. To develop a workable therapy, it is a necessity to identify the specific
molecular pathways that are altered as a function of time, following SCI. Several
mechanisms based on animal models have been implicated in SCI-induced NP; however,
no practical relationship of these novel findings has been established with yoga
practice. Various studies have described the role of several nociceptive molecules
including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cation-dependent chloride transporter
(NKCC1), CB1/CB2, Bradykinin1 (B1), and Vanilloid receptor TRPV1. Authors have
speculated, through various grant proposals that by inhibiting up-regulation of such
pain molecules in the early phase and/or late phase of injury, spinal cord damage
and induced NP could be ameliorated. Our research findings from previous studies
have helped in understanding novel mechanisms and treatments for SCI and NP
employing a rat model [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This review aims to prompt new studies
that examine the possible relationship of nociceptive proteins and its implications
in translational approach of yogic processes in neuropathic pain.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Role of Cation-dependent chloride transporter</title><p>In our research group, we describe Cl-regulatory protein
Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>-</sup> 1 (NKCC1) as a cation-dependent
chloride transporter involved in NP following contusion SCI (cSCI)[<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. NKCC1 is inhibited by bumetanide (BU)
in a rat model and resulted in the implication of NKCC1 in post-injury response
that suggests contribution to NP following cSCI. After administration of
Bumetanide to the subjects, thermal hyperalgesia (TH) and hind-paw withdrawal
latency times are increased. A kinase known as the with-no-lysine (K)-1 (WNK1)
is a regulator of NKCC1 activation by phosphorylation. In many systems,
including nociception, mutations in this kinase with neuronal-specific exon of
WNK1 in patients with hereditary sensory neuropathy type II (HSANII) show that
patients with a mutation in nociception have a lessened awareness to pain,
touch, and heat. The overall implication of NKCC1 and its activating kinase WNK1
shows their contribution in sensing and developing NP [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It will be interesting to investigate the relationship
between NKCC1 and WNK1 upregulation as it relates to yoga practice.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)</title><p>Following NP, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are triggered to be released, both
as early (MMP9) and late (MMP2) reactions. The release of these MMPs trigger
inflammatory cytokines, which in turn results in NP after injury via
interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;)-mediated activation in a spinal nerve ligation model of
rat and mice. By using tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) and intrathecal
injections of siRNAs, MMP levels are reduced, and resulting in a decreased
amount of inflammatory markers in comparison with wild type mice [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Following induced cSCI in male adult
Sprague-Dawley rats, we studied MMP2 in SCI-induced NP, the role of &#x003b2;-catenin in
the WNT signaling pathway, and extracellular signaling kinase within the MAPK
cascade [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>ATP receptors</title><p>These receptors exist in the peripheral as well as the central nervous system and
could be implicated in pain signaling. ATP is discharged from cells following
damage and activates sensors, which in turn activates sensory neurons.
Therefore, these sensory neurons could be involved in sensing NP, such as the
P2X4 receptors [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A common response following nerve injury induced P2X4
in the ipsilateral spinal cord and induced hyperactive microglia. After
administration of P2X4 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, tactile allodynia was
subdued from the depreciated activation of P2X4 receptors. To confirm this, the
induction of P2X4 receptors increased tactile allodynia in a normal rat model
[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Microglia are suggested
intermediates in the pathway of induction of hypersensitivity following NP. The
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and P2X4 receptors are necessary molecules
that are activated after peripheral nerve injury in the spinal cord [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. ATP is believed to be involved in
acute pain as it is released from all the injured cells and excites the initial
sensory neurons by stimulating their receptors [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, in sensory neurons or in the spinal cord, suppressing
the expression of P2X/Y receptors by molecular targeting and blocking P2X/Y
receptors pharmacologically didn&#x02019;t show any improvement in acute physiological
pain. Understanding the importance of ATP receptors including P2X4 receptors may
prove to be a cornerstone for newer strategies in the NP management.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Cannabinoid receptors</title><p>Hama and Sagen report that by injecting the nonselective CB receptor agonist WIN
55,212&#x02013;2 (WIN) SCI-induced mechanical allodynia following a thoracic-level
compression SCI was reduced [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The
emerging role of AEA-specific-fatty acid amide hydrolase and 2AG-specific
monoacylglycerol lipase as regulators of catabolism and biosynthesis of the CBs
is reported [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In our research
group<bold>,</bold> pretreatment with CB-1 antagonist AM 251 had not
affected the anti-hyperalgesic effect of WIN while pretreating with the CB-2
receptor antagonist AM 630 reduced the effect of WIN significantly, suggesting a
modulating role of the CB receptor in SCI-induced TH [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Selectively activating the CB receptors and its
possible therapeutic value for treating SCI patients has been discussed as
potential for analgesic effects on NP.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Bradykinin-1 and TRPV-1 receptors</title><p>Following a rat cSCI model of NP in our lab, we have demonstrated B1 and
vanilloid (TRPV-1) receptor genes are highly expressed following injury of
animals displaying thermal hyperalgesia in comparison to similarly injured
animals without hyperalgesia [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In
animals exhibiting hyperalgesia, more than two-fold increase in the expression
of these two genes were detected in the epicenter region of the spinal cord when
compared with animals with SCI that did not display hyperalgesia. This finding
is consistent with others findings revealing contribution of B1 and vanilloid
(TRPV1) receptors in nociception.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and serotonin</title><p>In certain animal models of chronic pain, BDNF signaling contributed to central
sensitization. By deleting trkB.T1, which is spliced truncated isoform of the
BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B.T1 in a mice model, there is a
notable decrease in post-SCI locomotor dysfunction, mechanical hyperesthesia,
and white matter loss. This suggests that the mechanism of SCI-induced chronic
pain includes trkB.T1 in its cycle pathway [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Astrocyte Contribution to Pain Signaling</title><p>Glial cells in the spinal cord are important regulators of chronic pain.
Specifically, astrocytes play a prominent role in up regulating signaling
pathways that contribute to chronic pain. This is distinct from microglial
mechanisms in that astrocyte activation is longer lasting and more persistent.
Multiple chemokines, CCL2 and CXCL1, released by spinal cord astrocytes have
been found to contribute to NP [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It is unclear how astrocytes regulate
NP sensitization via the release of astrocytic mediators. CCI provoked the
increase of astrocytic connexin-43 in spinal astrocytes. Three weeks
post-injury, mechanical allodynia can be reduced by intrathecal injection of
carbensoxolone, a non-selective hemi channel blocker and selective connexin-43
blocker. TNF-&#x003b1; leads to the release of chemokine CXCL1 which is further blocked
by carbenoxolone, connexin-43 small interfering RNA, and Gap26/Gap27.
TNF-&#x003b1;-activated astrocytes induced persistent mechanical allodynia which is
restrained by CXCL1 neutralization, antagonist CXCL1 receptor (CXCR2), and
pretreated astrocytes with RNA of connexin-43. In nerve injury, there is
increase of excitatory synaptic transmission which was suppressed by
carbenoxolone and Gap27 [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>The hemi channel protein Cx43 provides a release portal for astrocyte mediators
such as chemokines. Post nerve injury, astrocyte junction signaling may switch
from fast gap-junctions to a slow paracrine route through Cx43 hemi channels.
Cx34 contributes to pain hypersensitivity in mouse with SCI. Additionally, Cx34
was shown to play a role in chronic pain maintenance after CCI. The intrathecal
injection of carbenoxolone (CBX), a Cx43 blocker, was shown to weaken mechanical
hypersensitivity post-CCI. Electrophysiological experiments showed that
spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were higher in CCI models
compared to controls, a result lowered by CBX or mimetic peptides [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Spinal p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)</title><p>Spinal p38 MAPK plays a crucial role in pain induced by inflammation while
activated spinal microglia plays a direct role in spinal nociceptive processing.
As compared to post-treatment, pre-treatment with p38 MAPK blocks spinal
sensitization which is manifested by up regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2)
and appearance of Fos-positive neurons [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It has been suggested that the stimulation of the Src/p38MAPK
signaling cascade gives rise to persistent mechanical hyperalgesia in late
stages which is excited by formalin injection into the paw of the animal [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Furthermore, this unique finding is of
significance for clinicians while developing therapeutic treatment during acute
and persistent pain state.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Role of Glutamate Receptor-5 and Protein Kinase C-epsilon</title><p>

patients</title><p>When disruption of spinal cord occurs, the communication is affected in parts
that are innervated at or below the lesion. Almost half of the spinal cord
injuries are an outcome of motor vehicle crashes and the other half are due
to falls or sports injuries, etc. Apart from the trauma, other factors
responsible for the spinal cord injury are bleeding, swelling, and oxygen
deprivation which are further accompanied by the release of toxic substances
and inflammatory cytokines. Several neuro-protective agents, which include
methylprednisolone, are being used as the treatment for spinal injuries and
may prevent cell death. SCI is followed by several complications for which
there is need of rehabilitation [<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].
Existing SCI centers are trying to incorporate and redevelop skills in SCI
patients. Teams of nurses, physicians, psychologists, social workers,
physical, and occupational therapists provide multidisciplinary services for
rehabilitation of SCI patients but the area of yoga as a therapy is
unexplored in this field. Yoga is a holistic approach, which is believed to
stimulate neural pathways and neurotransmitters. With proper adaptation and
through guided assistance, different yogic techniques may act as a valuable
healing tool in the regeneration of nerve fibers in SCI patients for which
many research studies are being undertaken [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4d2"><title>Role of Iyengar Yoga as a treatment therapy for SCI patients</title><p>After SCI, prevalence of sedentary lifestyle leads to secondary impairment
and deterioration of the functional activities. For performing movements and
overcoming the side effects of pharmacological approaches, SCI patients need
special exercise programs, mind body techniques and assisted guidance to
overpower these problems. Existing evidence is available which shows Iyengar
form of yoga is a boon for SCI patients. B. K.S Iyengar introduced Iyengar
yoga which empowers the strength, flexibility, and physical balance through
stretching of muscles. The <italic>asanas</italic> in this style of yoga are
modifiable and the use of props makes it more innovative. Some studies have
provided instructions regarding the integration of Iyengar yoga as
rehabilitation for SCI patients [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].
According to these authors, the Iyengar form of yoga helps to empower the
patient by building symmetric and asymmetric postures to gain flexibility
and awareness of the body structure by integration of
<italic>Pranayama</italic> into the postures and focuses on the weight
and time management of muscle contraction and relaxation [<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4d3"><title>Asana, Pranayama and meditation in other dysfunctions of SCI</title><p>SCI patients suffer from many dysfunctions including bowel, bladder, sexual,

metabolism, and neurotransmitters. One studied the reaction time after
performing bellows type breathing and breathe awareness. Reaction time was
analyzed in two groups containing 35 participants, yoga group, and control
group with mean age of 29 years. The yoga group had a prior 6-month
experience of yoga practice, while the control group was not involved in any
kind of yoga practice. The yoga group was assessed in two sessions. The
first was Bellows breathing and the second was breath awareness. Assessments
were made using a multi-operational apparatus for reaction time. Results
concluded a significant reduction in number of anticipatory responses

participants were adults having low back pain and were instructed in a 12-week yoga

relaxation exercises was considered. At the 3 month time point, pain was assessed by
the RMDQ score. Results indicate that this 12-week protocol for adults had improved
lower back pain. In another study done in England, 851 participants were randomized

subjects were divided based on low, medium, or high risk for persistent pain and
disability. Patients at low-risk were excluded while medium and high-risk patients
were considered for standardized physical therapy to address symptoms and function.

The yoga program consisted of physical postures, Pranayama, meditation, and

pain related outcomes and a goniometer was used to asses spinal flexibility pre- and
post- intervention. The yoga group showed a significant decrease in the ODI scores

such an injury in the thoracic (T4&#x02013;6) in 1978, resulting in paralysis, and since
then has been teaching yoga to others who have experienced a similar SCI. He teaches
the practice of yoga for paralysis patients. By having reduced sensory stimuli,
patients suffering from paralysis have clarity of mind and &#x0201c;presence&#x0201d; by
experiencing yoga. This &#x0201c;presence&#x0201d; has very real, tangible effects, including being
more balanced and grounded, having improved bowel-and-bladder sensation, being more
efficient and powerful in movements, increased sexual ability, and even the
possibility of regaining some physiological function. Different
<italic>asanas</italic>, which are extremely relevant to the practice of yoga,
are chosen specifically to line up all systems within the body, including digestive,
circulatory, immune, etc. This teaching is also known as Iyengar yoga and has
greater emphasis on sustained alignment and precision.</p><p>A different case study of a gunshot wound victim helps us understand the integration
of Iyengar yoga in rehabilitation therapy [<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The patient experienced injury at the T4 level resulting in paraplegia.
After some evaluations, Iyengar yoga was integrated into his rehabilitation therapy

(SKY)</title><p>One of the approaches of yoga is <italic>Pranayama</italic>, a type of voluntary
breathing regulation generally performed with the physical exercise of yoga.
There are many different ways to practice <italic>pranayama</italic>, but three
steps to perform it are consistent. There is the inhalation
&#x0201c;<italic>puraka</italic>&#x0201d;, the retention of the breath
&#x0201c;<italic>kumbhaka</italic>&#x0201d;, and finally the exhalation
&#x0201c;<italic>rechaka</italic>&#x0201d;. Regulation of breath in a stepwise manner
affects the control of autonomic nervous system, which has further beneficial
effects on different organ systems in the body. When pranayamic breathing is
performed with long breath retention, the parasympathetic nervous system is
amplified, seen by the lowering of metabolic rate and oxygen consumption. On the
other hand, with brief breath retention there is an adverse result of augmented
oxygen consumption and metabolic rate. <italic>Pranayama</italic> is a vital
component of yoga associated with breathing. In chronic pain, breathing is
strained and becomes shallow and uses more thoracic muscles. If the breathing
pattern can be corrected with the help of yogic breathing then, certainly it may
help in the management of pain. Alterations in neurotransmitters, like
serotonin, have a vital action in the NP and have demonstrated interactions with
immunocytes [<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Another study treated
NP in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) using
duloxetine, a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] SKY has also been reported as a useful,
low-risk, low-cost alternative for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress,
stress-related medical illnesses, and criminal offenders for treatment in
rehabilitation [<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Studies also show
that <italic>Pranayama</italic> can be a prescriptive treatment to modulate
neurotransmitters. They have demonstrated beneficial effects of yogic practice
which involved Pranayama, meditation, and asana on immune function and the
release of stress hormones [<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. The
study was randomized, double-blinded, and performed on healthy volunteers from
the university. They analyzed the immune-related cytokines in serum or plasma,
in addition to oxidative stress, antioxidant components, and stress hormones.
They found that Yogic practice had markedly raised immune-related cytokines in
serum which included interleukin-12 and interferon-&#x003b3;, and low levels of
adrenalin in plasma along with enhanced levels of serotonin in plasma when
compared to the control group who were not involved in any kind of exercise.
Thus, they concluded that regular practice of yoga will reduce oxidative stress
and improve antioxidant levels in addition to the reducing the release of stress
hormones and improving the immune system. <italic>SudarshanKriya</italic> (SKY)
is a cyclic controlled breathing practice, which includes
<italic>Ujjayi</italic>, <italic>Bhastrika</italic> and Om chanting. This
breathing practice also has a role in alleviating pain involved in the pathology
of certain diseases. One study demonstrated that SK and
<italic>Pranayama</italic> act as an effective intervention in decreasing
stress and pain among patients of advanced stage breast cancer [<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. This study was based on 147 women
participants and randomized into two groups: a yoga group (n = 78) and a
standard group (n = 69). The yoga group performed exercise for 18 hours over
three days and they had to practice it daily for 20 min at home. Results showed
a significant difference in the blood cortisol levels after three months of
practice. Pain perception as measured on 0&#x02013;10 verbal scale of pain, was reduced
by 3 points in the yoga group as compared to standard group. This showed the
effectiveness of Pranayama and SKY exercise in patients suffering from advanced
stages of cancer. However, the direct role of SKY in NP needs to be
