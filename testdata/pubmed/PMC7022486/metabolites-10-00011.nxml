However, high doses of copper will induce cell damage and toxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate toxicity, bioavailability, and effects on metabolic processes of varying copper sources using porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) as a model. The IPEC-J2 were treated with two doses (30 and 120 &#x003bc;M) of CuSO<sub>4</sub>, Cu Glycine (Cu-Gly), and Cu proteinate (Cu-Pro) for 10 h, respectively. Cell damage and cellular copper metabolism were measured by the changes in cell viability, copper uptake, oxidative stress biomarkers, and gene/protein expression levels. The results showed that cell viability and ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) decreased significantly in all treatment groups; intracellular copper content increased significantly in all treatment groups; total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased significantly in the 120 &#x003bc;M exposed groups; SOD1 protein expression levels were significantly upregulated in 30 &#x003bc;M Cu-Pro, 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Gly, and 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Pro treatment groups; intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased significantly in 30 &#x003bc;M treatment groups and 120 &#x003bc;M CuSO<sub>4</sub> treatment group. <italic>CTR1</italic> and <italic>ATP7A</italic> gene expression were significantly downregulated in the 120 &#x003bc;M exposed groups. While upregulation of <italic>ATOX1</italic> expression was observed in the presence of 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Gly and Cu-Pro. <italic>ASCT2</italic> gene expression was significantly upregulated after 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Glycine and CuSO<sub>4</sub> exposure, and <italic>PepT1</italic> gene expression was significantly upregulated after Cu-Pro exposure. In addition, CTR1 protein expression level decreased after 120 &#x003bc;M CuSO<sub>4</sub> and Cu-Gly exposure. PepT1 protein expression level was only upregulated after 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Pro exposure. These findings indicated that extra copper supplementation can induce intestinal epithelial cell injury, and different forms of copper may have differing effects on cell metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>copper</kwd><kwd>cytotoxicity</kwd><kwd>bioavailability</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>intestinal epithelial cell</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-metabolites-10-00011"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Copper is an essential trace element in animals that is beneficial to hematopoiesis, growth, metabolism, and various important physiological activities of life [<xref rid="B1-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For a long time, copper has been added to swine diets at high concentrations to reduce infection and promote growth, especially for weanling pigs [<xref rid="B2-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, high concentrations of copper in the diet may lead to organ damage of swine and pose a threat to the environment [<xref rid="B4-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to the latest regulations of China and the European Union, the maximum level of copper in piglets feed should not exceed 150 and 125 ppm, respectively [<xref rid="B6-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, many researchers are exploring the appropriate concentration of copper fed to swine.</p><p>The traditional method of copper supplementation has been through using inorganic copper sources, such as CuSO<sub>4</sub>. However, inorganic coppers are poorly absorbed by swine, and the diets are often supplemented with more copper than they actually need. Huang et al. evaluated the effect of dietary copper amount on weanling pigs. Compared with control pigs (0.88 mg/L), soluble copper concentrations in the proximal jejunal (5.54 mg/L) were increased significantly when fed with a diet containing 225 mg of copper per kilogram [<xref rid="B8-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that Cu overload leads to oxidative stress and subsequent oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids because of its ability to generate free radical species, such as hydroxyl radicals (OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) [<xref rid="B9-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. At the cellular level, copper ions in various oxidation states can participate in oxidation and reduction reactions. For example, the reduction of cupric ions forming cuprous ions by superoxide radical anions that may catalyze the formation of hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction inducing oxidative stress and thereby cell injury [<xref rid="B11-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Over the last two decades, organic copper sources, such as amino acid chelate and proteinate, have been increasingly used in livestock. Many studies have shown that organic sources of copper have higher bioavailability and lower mineral excretion than inorganic sources, with improved growth performance of pigs [<xref rid="B12-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, one of the major challenges when investigating high absorption of organic copper is that there is little known about the metabolism mechanisms in livestock.</p><p>Copper metabolism includes many processes related to copper uptake, intracellular distribution of copper, and copper export. In general, copper ions dissociate from their organic or inorganic carriers in the intestinal lumen and are absorbed via a passive or active route into enterocytes lining the gastrointestinal tract. After processing in the liver to bound albumin, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, and excess copper is excreted in feces. Because both copper deficit and excess are deleterious to the organism [<xref rid="B14-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], copper levels are tightly regulated by a complicated system, which has many vital proteins working together to ensure a stable level of copper in organisms. The high-affinity copper transporter 1 (CTR1) is the primary player in the uptake of extracellular copper. ATOX1 can carry copper to copper-ATPases (ATP7A and ATP7B) in the Golgi apparatus, and ATP7A and ATP7B are ATP-dependent translocators of copper across membranes when intracellular copper levels are high [<xref rid="B15-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Studies have shown that organic metals, such as proteinate, may be absorbed attached to PepT1, a brush border membrane-bound di- and tri-peptide transporter, which has been identified in all major livestock species. This transporter is not overly specific, as molecules other than di- and tri-peptides can be transported through it. Joanne Keenan et al. compared organic and inorganic copper exposure to HT29 and Caco-2 cells. Their findings showed that PepT1, ZnT1, and CTR1 were increased, particularly for CuSO<sub>4</sub> and copper proteinate in Caco-2 cells [<xref rid="B17-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is scarce study about different damage and metabolic mechanisms between organic and inorganic copper in pigs at the cellular level. In this study, we analyzed the effects of organic and inorganic copper sources on porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) to evaluate their effect on cell growth, oxidative stress, copper absorption efficiency, and copper metabolism, to provide data support for the precise use of copper in swine production. Three sources of copper (copper sulfate&#x02014;CuSO<sub>4</sub>, copper glycinate&#x02014;Cu-Gly, and copper proteinate&#x02014;Cu-Pro) were compared.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-metabolites-10-00011"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>Copper is an essential trace element that has been involved in various biological processes. In this study, we mainly focused on the uptake, metabolism, and the damage induced by different copper sources and compared the expression of various genes <italic>CTR1, ATOX1, ATP7A, ASCT2</italic> and <italic>PepT1</italic> between normal and copper exposed IPEC-J2 cells.</p><p>Significantly increased copper content in cells was observed with the rising doses of three copper sources. Cellular copper contents were affected by copper supplementation. The absorption efficiency of organic copper was higher than that of inorganic copper at 120 &#x003bc;M level as the uptake rate of copper was Cu-Pro &#x0003e; Cu-Gly &#x0003e; CuSO<sub>4</sub>. Moreover, the detection results of CCK-8 assay and EdU staining assay showed that the cell viability was significantly decreased with rising copper exposure, and the cell viability after Cu-Pro incubation was significantly higher than CuSO<sub>4</sub> and Cu-Gly incubation at both doses. These findings indicated that organic and inorganic copper exposure in intestinal cells could induce varying extents of cell injury.</p><p>To assess the cell injury, we also measured several biomarkers, such as GSH, SOD, ROS, and MDA, which are crucial biomarkers in the oxidative stress process. GSH and SOD act as scavengers of oxygen free radicals and protect the organism against negative effects. Under oxidative stress conditions, GSH is generally oxidized or catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase (GPX) to GSSG, and the ratio of GSH to GSSG is changed. GSH/GSSG is an important parameter indicating the extent of oxidative stress in a biological system [<xref rid="B20-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, GSH/GSSG ratios of copper treatment groups were always significantly lower than that of the control group within the rising copper concentrations. GSH, as a vital antioxidant, may be oxidized to GSSG in the oxidative stress process caused by excess Cu, resulting in GSH depletion [<xref rid="B9-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B21-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The GSH/GSSG ratios of the CuSO<sub>4</sub> treated group was significantly lower than that of Cu-Gly and Cu-Pro treated groups at both 30 and 120 &#x003bc;M, which may also indicate the cytotoxicity of organic copper and inorganic copper may be driven by a different mechanism.</p><p>Under the induction of free radicals and the compensatory stress of an organism, the cells or the organism, will inductively enhance the antioxidant capacity, and generally, SOD levels will increase. However, with the high consumption of SOD by high concentrations of free radicals and the decompensation of the organism, the biosynthesis ability of SOD will soon fall back to a low level and maintain a new dynamic balance with higher concentrations of free radicals [<xref rid="B22-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our research, there was no significant difference between control cells and the 30 &#x003bc;M copper exposed groups. However, the SOD activity of 120 &#x003bc;M copper exposed groups was significantly increased in comparison to control cells, and the levels of SOD activity were ordered as Cu-Pro &#x0003e; Cu-Gly &#x0003e; CuSO<sub>4</sub>, which indicated a significant antioxidant reaction occurred, and it seemed to be more easily induced by organic copper than inorganic copper. In addition, the SOD1 protein expression level was also investigated. SOD1 protein expression levels were significantly upregulated by 30 &#x003bc;M Cu-Pro, 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Gly, and 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Pro incubation. Copper is an important co-factor of SOD1; however, referring to copper uptake data, intracellular copper content was increased significantly at 30 &#x003bc;M treatment, but there was no significant change in SOD1 protein content except for Cu-Pro group. As the intracellular copper contents increased to a higher level, the expression of SOD1 protein increased significantly in the organic cooper treatment group compared to control. And SOD1 protein expression level in the 120 &#x003bc;M CuSO<sub>4</sub> treatment group was significantly higher than that in the 30 &#x003bc;M CuSO<sub>4</sub> treatment group. Intracellular copper content may not lead to an increase in SOD1 protein expression until it reaches a certain concentration in CuSO<sub>4</sub> and Cu-Gly groups. In the 120 &#x003bc;M CuSO<sub>4</sub> treatment group, SOD activity was significantly increased but not for protein expression level; it may be upregulated due to oxidative stress. In the 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Gly and Cu-Pro treatment groups, SOD1 protein content was significantly increased, which may be as a result of the high accumulation of copper.</p><p>Copper, as a transition metal ion, can participate in the formation of reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="B24-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, we measured intracellular ROS generation. The intracellular ROS generation was significantly increased after all 30 &#x003bc;M and 120 &#x003bc;M CuSO<sub>4</sub> incubations compared to the control, which indicated the oxidative stress occurred in these treatment groups. But there was no significant difference in the 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Gly and Cu-Pro treatment groups compared to the control. This may have been contributed to by the antioxidant effect of GSH and SOD, which caused the difference in intracellular ROS generation to not reach a significant level and maintain a balance. When an oxygen-free radical acts on lipid peroxidation, the final oxidation product is malondialdehyde, which has deleterious effects and is generally regarded as the reflex of cell injury [<xref rid="B25-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. MDA content was significantly increased in copper exposed cells compared to control cells. This result also strongly proved that oxidative stress occurred in cells. Interestingly, the MDA content of the 120 &#x003bc;M copper exposed groups declined in comparison with the 30 &#x003bc;M copper exposed groups, which probably resulted from the compensatory increase of SOD, and a new dynamic balance of oxidation-reduction was established. Consistent with the preceding intracellular ROS generation, significant lower MDA content was observed in the presence of 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Gly and Cu-Pro compared to CuSO<sub>4</sub>. That is, the absorption efficiency of organic copper is higher than that of inorganic copper, but the cytotoxicity of organic copper is lower than that of inorganic copper. These results are consistent with previous studies: Wang et al. found that 30 to 300 &#x003bc;M copper exposure caused about a 20% to 60% reduction in cell viability of brain microvascular endothelial cells. And SOD activity increased with rising copper levels [<xref rid="B26-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Yang et al. investigated the cytotoxicity of excessive copper (Cu)-induced in chicken hepatocytes. The results indicated that excessive Cu (100 &#x003bc;M) could increase levels of ROS generation, SOD activity, and MDA content, and decrease cell viability and GSH content [<xref rid="B27-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the study of Nazim Husain et al., they found after copper chloride (0.01 mM&#x02013;2.5 mM) incubation, ROS production and lipid peroxidation were enhanced, GSH content was decreased in erythrocytes [<xref rid="B28-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Copper homeostasis in mammals requires complex processes of absorption and excretion, which is accomplished by regulation of copper import, intracellular flux, and efflux across the basolateral intestinal membrane [<xref rid="B29-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. CTR1 is a homotrimeric protein that transports Cu across the plasma membrane with high affinity and specificity [<xref rid="B31-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The import of copper by CTR1 does not require energy or a proton gradient, but efflux requires hydrolysis of ATP. Two well-studied ATPases are known to participate in copper homeostasis, ATP7A and ATP7B. Among them, ATP7A is expressed in the intestinal epithelium as well as in most other tissues other than the liver [<xref rid="B32-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Cu is carried to Cu-dependent enzymes or subcellular compartments through the target-specific Cu chaperone proteins that include Atx1/Atox1, Cox17, and CCS. The Atx1/Atox1 Cu chaperone directly interacts with the cytosolic Cu-binding domains of the Cu transporting P-type ATPases [<xref rid="B34-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>There are studies showing that organic metals, such as proteinates, may increase mRNA expression of other transporters, such as the intestinal peptide transporter (PepT1), a high-capacity, low-affinity intestinal transporter that is expressed on the apical membrane of endocrine cells [<xref rid="B35-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, glycine can be transported by an ASC-type transporter, the important transit mechanism for neutral amino acids [<xref rid="B36-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>In our study, copper import transporter <italic>CTR1</italic> was downregulated in all treatment groups, and copper export transporter <italic>ATP7A</italic> was downregulated with 120 &#x003bc;M copper exposure. The results suggested that in the transcription process, cells decreased the expression of these two genes to regulate intracellular copper flux, thus responding to elevated copper concentrations, except for the Cu-Pro treatment group, because at the translational level Cu-Pro treatment group was not consistent with mRNA expression. It will be discussed later. Further, the increase of <italic>ATOX1</italic> expression after 120 &#x003bc;M copper exposure may be correlated with the significant higher intracellular copper contents after copper treatments. We also observed the significant upregulation of the <italic>PepT1</italic> (in 30 &#x003bc;M Cu-Pro, 30 &#x003bc;M CuSO<sub>4</sub>, and 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Pro groups) and <italic>ASCT2</italic> (in 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Gly and CuSO<sub>4</sub> groups), which meant peptide and amino acid transport pathways were activated.</p><p>Furthermore, at the protein level, the protein expression of CTR1 and PepT1 was altered with Cu treatments. Consistent with the mRNA expression, CTR1 protein expression decreased after 120 &#x003bc;M CuSO<sub>4</sub> and Cu-Gly exposure, it may be a response to elevated copper concentrations to prevent more copper from being transported. However, inconsistent with mRNA expression, there was no significant difference in CTR1 protein expression between Cu-Pro treatment group and control. In other words, at the protein level, the inhibitory effect of high concentration copper on CTR1 expression was not observed in the Cu-Pro treatment group. The CTR1 protein content of the Cu-Pro treatment group was higher than that of CuSO<sub>4</sub> and Cu-Gly treatment groups, so it may transport more copper into cells. The results may explain why copper uptake was higher in cells treated with Cu-Pro as compared to CuSO<sub>4</sub> and Cu-Gly at 120 &#x003bc;M. But it cannot explain the high absorption efficiency of 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Gly compared to 120 &#x003bc;M CuSO<sub>4</sub> and control. PepT1 protein expression was only upregulated after 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Pro exposure, which indicated that the level of the peptide from 120 &#x003bc;M Cu-Pro can increase the expression of PepT1 protein. More peptides and amino acids may be transported into cells, and it may have a positive effect on cells.</p><p>Some studies have similar results to ours. Cheng et al. found that CTR1 and ATP7a mRNA levels declined in fish anterior intestine with increasing dietary Cu levels [<xref rid="B37-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the study of Liao et al., examining the different mechanisms of absorption of diverse iron sources in pig intestinal epithelial cells, PepT1 transcription expression in ferrous bisglycinate groups was significantly higher in treatments with 0.5 and 1 mM iron at 24 h, compared with ferrous sulfate [<xref rid="B38-metabolites-10-00011" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>However, there are still some limitations to our research. We cannot confirm whether PepT1 and ASCT2 are able to transport amino acids and peptides as well as copper as the causative mechanism for the higher absorption rate of organic copper. According to existing results, the high absorptivity of Cu-Pro may be due to CTR1 protein expression not being suppressed. Additionally, the reason for the difference in cytotoxicity between organic copper and inorganic copper, especially CuSO<sub>4</sub> and Cu-Pro, is still unknown. Therefore, the area of differential copper transport mechanisms and cytotoxicity for various copper sources still require more in-depth research.</p><p>In conclusion, copper supplementation induced intestinal epithelial cell injury and oxidative stress in vitro. Therefore, high doses of copper supplementation in swine production should be carefully considered. Compared with inorganic copper (CuSO<sub>4</sub>), organic copper (Cu-Pro) was less toxic and had higher absorption efficiency at the higher dose. However, the different transport mechanisms between inorganic and organic copper need to be further investigated.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Data curation, R.L. and Y.W.; Formal analysis, R.L., Y.W. and G.L.; Funding acquisition, G.L. and P.H.; Investigation, R.L. and Y.W.; Project administration, P.H. and F.W.; Writing&#x02014;original draft, R.L.; Writing&#x02014;review &#x00026; editing, Y.W., G.L., C.M., P.H. and F.W.
