Knockout of <italic>rac1</italic> caused complex changes in basal as well as doxorubicin and ionizing radiation-induced mRNA expression of various genotoxic stress response-related genes, including <italic>hspa1b, rad51, wrn</italic> and <italic>xpc</italic>. <italic>Rac1</italic> deletion protected the liver from acute toxicity following doxorubicin treatment. Moreover, the level of S139 phosphorylated histone H2AX (<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>H2AX), which is indicative of DNA damage, and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory (IL-6) and pro-fibrotic (CTGF, TGF<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>SMA) factors were mitigated in <italic>rac1</italic> knockout animals. By contrast, lack of <italic>rac1</italic> promoted subacute hepatotoxicity, which was determined 3 weeks after injection of multiple low doses of doxorubicin by assaying the <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>H2AX level, mitotic index and pro-fibrotic gene expression. Regarding ionizing radiation, <italic>rac1</italic> deficiency had no major effects on DNA damage induction or acute pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic stress responses. Mice lacking hepatic <italic>rac1</italic> for extended period of time (15 months) revealed increased mRNA expression of fibrosis-related factors (CTGF, TGF<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, collagen, MMP1) and fibrotic tissue remodeling. In addition, protein expression of the senescence marker p16 was enhanced in the absence of <italic>rac1</italic>. Taken together, the data provide evidence that Rac1 is required for doxorubicin-induced DNA damage induction. It is also involved in both the acute and delayed inflammatory and fibrotic stress response in the liver following doxorubicin, but not ionizing radiation, treatment and, furthermore, protects against endogenous liver aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>small GTPases</kwd><kwd>Rac1</kwd><kwd>genotoxic stress response</kwd><kwd>hepatotoxicity</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Membrane-bound low molecular weight GTPases of the Rho (Rho=Ras homologous) family play pivotal roles in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions, including proliferation, gene expression, transformation and apoptosis as well as actin cytoskeleton-related functions such as cell motility and cell adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Among the Rho family, the Ras-related C3 botulinum substrate 1 (Rac1) is a key regulator of stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK/JNK), p38 kinase and extracellular regulated kinases (ERK),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> NADPH oxidase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> as well as numerous transcription factors including NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> AP1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Smad<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> and Stat proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Moreover, Rac1 signaling regulates mitosis and meiosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> which is in line with its recently reported nuclear localization and interaction with proteins of the replication machinery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Rac1 is also highly important for tumor progression and metastasis as it controls cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Rac1 affects Ki-Ras mediated lung carcinogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> and cross-talks with the MLL-AF9 oncogene, which is important for development of acute myeloid leukemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Using transgenic technology it has further been shown that Rac1 is essential for B-cell development and signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Rac1 affects cell spreading and membrane ruffling, but does not influence the motility of macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup></p><p>Bearing in mind the aforementioned key functions of Rho GTPases in the onset and progression of malignant diseases, therapeutic targeting of members of the family of Rho GTPases is suggested to improve anticancer therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> One therapeutic option to interfere with Rho signaling are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), which are widely used for cholesterol lowering purpose nowadays.

To investigate the influence of Rac1 on acute liver damage following doxorubicin treatment, S139 phosphorylation of histone H2AX (<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>H2AX), which is a generally accepted marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> was monitored. As shown by both western blot-based analysis of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>H2AX protein levels and immunofluorescence-based detection of <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>H2AX foci, we found that Rac1 deficiency significantly protects against doxorubicin-induced formation of DSBs as analyzed 48 and 96&#x02009;h after single exposure to different doses of doxorubicin (10&#x02009;mg/kg BW and 15&#x02009;mg/kg BW, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and b</xref>). The genoprotective effect in the absence of Rac1 signaling was also observed 48&#x02009;h after treatment with doxorubicin (10&#x02009;mg/kg) by western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). Taken together, Rac1 signaling is required for doxorubicin to provoke genotoxicity in an acute setting.</p><p>By contrast, IR-induced hepatic <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>H2AX phosphorylation, which was analyzed 72&#x02009;h after total body irradiation (TBI) of mice with 6 Gy, was not altered when <italic>rac1 was</italic> deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c and d</xref>).

Overall, the data show that lack of <italic>rac1</italic> does not cause a general hepatoprotection against the acute DNA damaging effects of genotoxins. Rather, genoprotection is specific for doxorubicin and does not comprise IR.

Under normal (non-exposed) conditions, a total of nine genes was found to be differently (i.e., &#x02264;0.5-fold or &#x02265;2.0-fold) regulated in liver tissue when <italic>rac1</italic> knockout mice were compared with the control. These genes code for transcription factors (c-Jun, c-Fos), cell-cycle regulators (Ccne1 (=Cycline E)), chemokine receptor (Cxcr4), heat shock 70&#x02009;kDa protein 1B (Hspa1b) and DNA repair related factors (Rad51, TopoII<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, Wrn, Xpc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Next, we investigated the influence of Rac1 on the acute hepatic stress response provoked by genotoxins agents, that is, the anthracycline derivative doxorubicin and ionizing radiation (IR). As determined 48&#x02009;h after i.p. injection of doxorubicin, Rac1 deficiency caused inhibition of doxorubicin-stimulated mRNA expression of <italic>cdkn1a</italic> (p21), <italic>hspa1b</italic> (Hsp701b), <italic>icam1</italic> and <italic>topoII&#x003b2;</italic> whereas it augmented the mRNA expression of the DNA repair gene <italic>rad51</italic> and the cell-cycle-associated kinase <italic>wee1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Regarding IR-induced changes in gene expression following 24&#x02009;h after TBI, Rac1 deficiency exclusively resulted in inhibitory effects, most notably IR-induced mRNA expression of the DNA repair genes <italic>fen1, topoII&#x003b2;, wrn and xpc</italic>, the cell-cycle regulatory genes <italic>cdkn1a</italic> (p21) and <italic>ccne1</italic> (cycline E) and the heat shock gene <italic>hspa1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Taken together, <italic>rac1</italic> knockout in liver affected both basal and acute genotoxic stress-induced mRNA expression of a subset of genes important for the regulation of cell-cycle progression, heat shock response and DNA repair. The gene encoding the heat shock 70&#x02009;kDa protein 1B (Hspa1b) showed altered hepatic mRNA expession in <italic>rac1</italic>-deficient mice under all experimental conditions tested.</p><p>Regarding the mRNA expression level of detoxifying factors, we observed a slightly reduced basal mRNA expression of glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase isoform mu1 (<italic>gstm1</italic>) in <italic>rac1</italic> knockout animals as compared with the wild-type, whereas Nrf2-regulated heme oxygenase-1 (<italic>hmox-1</italic>) expression was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). <italic>gstm1</italic> and <italic>hmox-1</italic> mRNA expression remained unaffected by the <italic>rac1</italic> status following doxorubicin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

The mitotic index, which was analyzed by calculating the number of phospho-histone H3 (Ser10)-positive cells, was enhanced up to threefold in <italic>rac1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4c and d</xref>), pointing to a higher level of regenerative proliferation in Rac1-deficient liver tissue. The basal frequency of pH3-positive cells was similar in wild-type (3.6 pH3 positive cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) and <italic>rac1</italic> knockout mice (3.4 pH3 positive cells/mm<sup>2</sup>). In the subacute model, doxorubicin treatment caused a slight increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells in wild-type animals.

Analysis of the <italic>rac1</italic> status in Rac1<sup>flox/flox-Mx1-Cre</sup> mice treated or not with poly(I:C) revealed that also in the non-treated (wild-type) animals part of the <italic>rac1</italic> gene became deleted with age. The age-related partial deletion of the <italic>rac1</italic> gene in the absence of poly(I:C) induced Cre expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) discloses a partial leakiness of the Mx1-Cre system.</p><p>Analyzing body weight of <italic>rac1</italic> ko and wild-type animals, no significant differences were observed in the course of the observation period of 15 months (data not shown). Also, the ratio of organ/body weight, which was analyzed 15 months after poly(I:C)-induced recombinational knockout, was similar in <italic>rac1</italic> wt and <italic>rac1</italic> ko animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Histopathological analysis showed that fibrotic tissue remodeling was significantly enhanced in <italic>rac1</italic> knockout animals and further increased with age in mice lacking hepatic <italic>rac1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c and d</xref>). Notably, protein expression of the senescence-related marker p16 was also largely enhanced when <italic>rac1</italic> was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). The mRNA expression profile also revealed differences in age-related processes between <italic>rac1</italic> proficient and deficient animals. For incidence, the mRNA levels of the fibrosis-associated factors CTGF, TGF<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, collagen type I and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>SMA increased with age in both <italic>rac1</italic> ko and wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). As CTGF mRNA expression was reduced in both young and old <italic>rac1</italic> knockout mice and TGF<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> expression was largely unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), the observed increase in fibrosis in the absence of <italic>rac1</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>) likely does not rest on a stimulated expression of pro-fibrotic cytokines. mRNA expression of type I collagen was found to be enhanced in the absence of <italic>rac1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), while expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) was reduced in <italic>rac1</italic> ko animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). The Rac1 status did not affect the mRNA expression level of the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Taken together, the data indicate that increased expression of collagen I and concomitantly reduced expression of MMPs favors fibrotic remodeling of liver tissue in <italic>rac1</italic> ko animals. Regarding inflammatory processes, we observed a two- to threefold increase in the mRNA level of IL-6 in elder wild-type animals but not in <italic>rac1</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>), indicating that <italic>rac1</italic> is required for IL-6 mRNA expression. Moreover, deletion of <italic>rac1</italic> for an extended period of time (i.e., 15 months) results in the appearance of large areas (conglomerates) of MPO-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). These conglomerates are less frequent and much smaller in elder <italic>rac1</italic> proficient animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). As a further marker of liver integrity, we monitored the serum level of liver transaminases GPT and GLDH. As compared with <italic>rac1</italic> wild-type mice, we found higher levels of GPT and GLDH in the serum of both young and old <italic>rac1</italic> ko mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Analysis of the serum level of urea and creatinine, which are indicative of kidney damage, was included for control and did not reveal any differences related to the <italic>rac1</italic> status of the animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previously, we reported that the lipid lowering drug lovastatin protects human endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> and rat cardiomyoblasts against the toxic effects of doxorubicin <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> We also showed that it protects mouse liver and heart <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> These data together with the reports from other groups,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> let us hypothesize that inhibition of Rac1 signaling by statins reduces normal tissue damage evoked by anthracyclines. Inhibition of Rac1 signaling has also been suggested to be of importance for the cardioprotective effects of statins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> Moreover, inhibition of Rho/Rac signaling by statins was demonstrated to be radioprotective <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> To scrutinize the relevance of Rac1 for genotoxin-induced responses <italic>in vivo</italic>, we made use of a Cre-LoxP-based knockout system, which enables an inducible recombinational deletion of the <italic>rac1</italic> gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> We found that poly(I:C)-induced expression of Cre-recombinase results in a highly efficient (&#x02265;90&#x00025;) knockout of the <italic>rac1</italic> gene in liver tissue. Not all tissues were equally responsive. The lowest levels of <italic>rac1</italic> deletion were observed in intestine and brain.</p><p>Using this model, we investigated the biological consequences of hepatic <italic>rac1</italic> deletion on acute doxorubicin- and IR-induced DNA damage formation. We found that the level of DNA damage following doxorubicin treatment was reduced in <italic>rac1</italic> knockout animals, pointing to genoprotection in the absence of Rac1 signaling. This observation is in line with our previously reported statin-based <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> Notably, <italic>rac1</italic> deletion does not protect from acute IR-induced formation of DNA damage, showing that genoprotection resulting from lack of Rac1 is not a general phenomenon, but rather specific for anthracyclines. This is in line with previous reports showing that lovastatin neither affects the initial nor the residual level of DSBs observed after IR exposure of endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> or following TBI of mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Taken together, these results strongly support the view that Rac1 is essential for doxorubicin-induced formation of DSBs in the liver. Data obtained with endothelial cells and cardiomyoblasts suggest that the genoprotective effect resulting from the absence of functional Rac1 is neither related to mechanisms of drug transport nor ROS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> Accordingly, we report here that liver from <italic>rac1</italic> knockout animals does not differ from control tissue with respect to the mRNA expression of the drug transporters Mdr-1 and Mrp-1 or defence functions such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione-S-transferase (Gstm1). PCR array-based analysis revealed that <italic>rac1</italic> deletion caused complex alterations in the mRNA expression of the DNA repair factors Rad51, XPC and WRN, which are involved in DSB repair, nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER), respectively. The biggest difference in gene expression between <italic>rac1</italic> wild-type and <italic>rac1</italic> ko animals was observed for the gene encoding the Hspa1b protein, which belongs to the family of Hsp70 proteins. The biological meaning of the differences in the mRNA expression patterns, which were observed under basal conditions and/or after treatment with doxorubicin and ionizing radiation, will be subject of forthcoming studies. Apart from reducing doxorubicin-stimulated hepatic DNA damage and mRNA expression of susceptibility-related factors, <italic>rac1</italic> deficiency also had complex effects on acute pro-fibrotic stress responses stimulated by doxorubicin. As analyzed by Masson&#x02013;Goldner staining, <italic>rac1</italic> deletion caused a reduction of acute pro-fibrotic tissue remodeling processes. These data are, again, in line with reports obtained <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Rac1 defect had no major consequences on IR-induced pro-fibrotic stress responses, indicating that the biological importance of Rac1 following acute genotoxic insults is agent specific.</p><p>Interestingly, as opposed to the acute setting, <italic>rac1</italic> deletion enhanced the level of DNA damage and promoted fibrotic processes when mice were treated repeatedly with doxorubicin. Thus, Rac1 has protective functions regarding subacute liver damage evoked by repeated anthracycline treatment. Based on the data we suggest that the biological relevance of Rac1 for doxorubicin-induced hepatic stress responses varies with time: Rac1 promotes acute toxic effects of doxorubicin whereas it protects from its subacute toxicity. This is in contrast to what has been observed with lovastatin, which functions in a protective manner in both acute and subacute settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Based on our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings presented here, we speculate that only acute protective effects of statins can be attributed to inhibition of Rac1 signaling. Protection from subacute anthracycline-induced toxicity by co-administration of statins might involve Rac1 independent mechanisms. Taking into account the data that have been obtained with ionizing radiation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> it is tempting to speculate that additional inhibition of the Rho/ROCK pathway by statins is important for mitigating normal tissue damage caused by repeated exposure to doxorubicin.</p><p>It should be noted that the Mx1-Cre based poly(I:C)-inducible knockout model does not allow a selective deletion of the <italic>rac1</italic> gene in the liver only (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). This brings up the question whether poly(I:C)-induced <italic>rac1</italic> deletion in other tissues than the liver might have influenced hepatic fibrosis. There is no obvious rationale to assume that deletion of <italic>rac1</italic> in spleen, lung, heart or kidney affects DNA damage induction and acute stress responses of the liver following doxorubicin treatment. However, appreciating a possible influence of <italic>rac1</italic> deletion in cells of the hematopoietic system, in particular macrophages and neutrophils, for delayed (subacute) hepatic stress responses and fibrotic processes is more complex. Rac1 and Rac2 play pivotal roles in the function of myeloid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> and are key players for B- and T-cell development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Moreover, Rac1 is essential for the function of neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> and affects cell spreading of macrophages,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> yet without influencing their migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Taking into account these reports, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>rac1</italic> deletion in particular cell types of the immune system (indirectly) influenced the subacute (delayed) hepatotoxicity of doxorubicin or the age-related alterations observed. To address this concern, analyses of transgenic mice that are characterized by a specific deletion of the <italic>rac1</italic> gene in the liver, without concomitant <italic>rac1</italic> deletion in cells of the immune system, is required. Therefore, we consider to include Rac1<sup>flox/flox/Alb-Cre</sup> mice into forthcoming studies.</p><p>Recently, small GTPases have been suggested to be involved in the regulation of the TOR complex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> which determines life span.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> Moreover, insulin signaling plays a key role in aging and Rac1 is important for insulin secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> as well as insulin stimulated signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> Keeping in mind these reports we asked the question whether <italic>rac1</italic> deletion affects age-related processes. To this end, mice were analyzed at different time points (i.e., 3 weeks and 15 months) after poly(I:C)-induced <italic>rac1</italic> deletion and compared to corresponding non-poly(I:C) treated controls. Both at early and late time points after <italic>rac1</italic> deletion, Rac1-deficient mice revealed more signs of fibrosis than wild-type animals. Moreover, as compared with animals that lack <italic>rac1</italic> for 3 weeks only, the expression of fibrotic markers was enhanced in mice lacking <italic>rac1</italic> for 15 months. With increasing age, <italic>rac1</italic> ko animals also showed hepatotoxicity as determined by the level of serum transaminases. In addition, the protein expression of the senescence-associated marker p16 was enhanced in <italic>rac1</italic> deleted animals, supporting the view that anti-aging mechanisms are regulated in a Rac1 dependent manner.</p><p>Taken together, the data present the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that the Ras-related GTPase Rac1 promotes acute and protects against subacute doxorubicin-induced stress responses of the liver and, moreover, counteracts processes that determine intrinsic hepatic aging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Mouse experiments</title><p>Mice were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions in the local animal housing facility at the University Medical Center Mainz (Germany).
