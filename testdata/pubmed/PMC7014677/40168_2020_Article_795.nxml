Investigating the bacteriophage community from soil will shed light not only on the yet largely unknown phage diversity, but may also result in novel insights towards their functioning in the global biogeochemical nutrient cycle and their significance in earthbound ecosystems. Unfortunately, information about soil viromes is rather scarce compared to aquatic environments, due to the heterogeneous soil matrix, which rises major technical difficulties in the extraction process. Resolving these technical challenges and establishing a standardized extraction protocol is, therefore, a fundamental prerequisite for replicable results and comparative virome studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">We here report the optimization of protocols for the extraction of phage DNA from agricultural soil preceding metagenomic analysis such that the protocol can equally be harnessed for phage isolation. As an optimization strategy, soil samples were spiked with <italic>Listeria</italic> phage A511 (Myovirus), <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> phage 2638A&#x00394;LCR (Siphovirus) and <italic>Escherichia</italic> phage T7 (Podovirus) (each 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/g soil). The efficacy of phage (i) elution, (ii) filtration, (iii) concentration and (iv) DNA extraction methods was tested. Successful extraction routes were selected based on spiked phage recovery and low bacterial 16S rRNA gene contaminants. Natural agricultural soil viromes were then extracted with the optimized methods and shotgun sequenced. Our approach yielded sufficient amounts of inhibitor-free viral DNA for shotgun sequencing devoid of amplification prior library preparation, and low 16S rRNA gene contamination levels (&#x02264;&#x02009;0.2&#x02030;). Compared to previously published protocols, the number of bacterial read contamination was decreased by 65%. In addition, 379 novel putative complete soil phage genomes (&#x02264;&#x02009;235 kb) were obtained from over 13,000 manually identified viral contigs, promising the discovery of a large, previously inaccessible viral diversity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">We have shown a considerably enhanced extraction of the soil phage community by protocol optimization that has proven robust in both culture-dependent as well as through viromic analyses.

Soil is known to harbour a vast abundance of phages (10<sup>7</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>9</sup> gdw<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), with their numbers exceeding those of co-occurring bacteria by 10 to 1000-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This undiscovered viral diversity could lead not only to novel findings into phage biology, but its characterization may also result in exciting insights towards their functioning in the global biogeochemical nutrient cycle and their significance in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite this ecological importance, the soil virome is particularly poorly studied. This circumstance is emphasized by the limited data on publicly available soil viromes, which represent only 1.8% of all accessible viromes, whereas controversially, 97% of all viruses are thought to be found in solid matrixes as soil and sediment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This narrow exploration likely results from major technical difficulties in phage isolation, which arise due to the utter microheterogeneity of soils, the presence of organic inhibitors that interfere with many molecular biology techniques and a lack of appropriate screening tools. Given the explained physicochemical diversity of soil, its matrix complexity and high microbial diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], it is not surprising that no universal phage extraction protocol or standardization towards viral elution, concentration and DNA extraction have yet been proposed. Some phage extraction protocols for soil samples have been suggested in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], of which only few have experimentally optimized the process of viral recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Those phage extraction protocols need consistency to compare changes in viral abundance within and across soil samples, and require DNA amplification prior to library preparation for metagenomic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, the routinely applied (rather harsh) methods may render phage isolation impossible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Among them, soil phage extraction has included a wide range of elution media, such as deionized water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], saline magnesium (SM) buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], potassium citrate buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], 10% beef extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], amended potassium citrate buffer (AKC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], Na/K buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with beef extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (some reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). Those elution media are commonly combined with mechanical approaches to disrupt phage soil interactions, such as homogenization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], sonication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], vortexing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], shaking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], magnetic stirring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], blending [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] or bead-beating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Despite these diverse approaches, the elution and recovery of soil phages remains the major bottleneck in the extraction, considering the high absorption of viruses to soil particles (&#x0003e;&#x02009;90%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Soil viruses are therefore unintentionally removed by centrifugation or filtration techniques in the very first steps of most protocols. For soil phage concentration, a universal approach is likely to be found, which could include typical techniques as tangential flow filtration (TFF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], or polyethylene glycol concentration (PEG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Those concentration techniques are occasionally combined with caesium chloride (CsCl) ultracentrifugation for purification, but have unfortunately only been evaluated for efficiency in other sample matrixes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], or resulted in uncertain conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">For functional and sequencing viromics, purified phage DNA without contaminating bacterial or eukaryotic sequences is critical for experimental success. However, the selective extraction of viral DNA from any source, including soil matrixes, has shown to be challenging, since most extracted phage viromes show bacterial DNA contamination above the proposed limit for a pure virome (&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.2&#x02030; of ribosomal DNA reads) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. No studies have yet assessed the influence of different phage elution, concentration and DNA extraction methods concerning soil bacteriophage diversity and, importantly, bacterial contaminants, using plaque assay and metagenomics. Here, we report the optimization of protocols for the extraction of dsDNA bacteriophages from soil samples that can be used prior to metagenomics and equally be applied to infective phage particle isolation from soil. The advantage of using a culture-dependent detection method for viral recovery is evident when considering phage isolation and the obvious viability of phages used for DNA extraction. For this, soil samples were spiked with a viral community consisting of phages from different families of <italic>Caudovirales</italic>, and the efficiency of several bacteriophage elution, concentration and DNA extraction procedures were determined. Successful extraction routes were selected based on spiked phage recovery and low bacterial 16S rRNA gene contaminants. Natural agricultural soil viromes were then extracted with the optimized methods and shotgun sequenced. Our approach yielded sufficient amounts of inhibitor-free viral DNA for shotgun sequencing without any amplification step prior to library preparation, and low 16S rRNA gene contamination levels (&#x02264;&#x02009;0.2&#x02030;). Compared to previously published protocols, the number of bacterial read contamination could be decreased by 65%. In total, we obtained 379 novel, putative circularized soil phage genomes of up to 235 kb in size, from &#x0003e;&#x02009;13,000 manually curated viral contigs. This data set greatly extends the amount of today&#x02019;s available soil viral contigs, and opens the door for the discovery of a remarkably diverse soil virome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Protocol optimization strategy</title><p id="Par26">The selective criteria for optimized extraction routes relied on three major parameters: (i) phage yield at each step of the extraction route, (ii) reduction of bacterial DNA contamination levels and (iii) bias minimization in the relative abundance and diversity of viruses. The efficacy of different bacteriophage elution, concentration and DNA extraction procedures was determined by monitoring spiked phage recovery by plaque assay and bacterial contamination levels by qPCR (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). For this, a mock viral community consisting of phages from different families: <italic>Listeria</italic> phage A511 (Myovirus), <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> phage 2638A&#x00394;LCR (Siphovirus) and <italic>Escherichia</italic> phage T7 (Podovirus), was spiked (each phage at 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/g soil) into agricultural soil samples. Successful extraction routes were then shotgun sequenced to gain a deeper understanding of the soil viral community and to compare the soil viral diversity in each extraction route, including data generated from a literature-based approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Resuspension of soil phages</title><p id="Par27">A proper suspension of bacteriophages from soil particles is crucial to retain viral diversity and reproducibility. We compared the most promising elution buffers found in the literature to maximise bacteriophage suspension from agricultural soil samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For this, the most commonly used (or elsewhere optimized) elution buffers such as SM buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], AKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], 10% beef extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] or PBS amended with beef extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] were assessed and compared in viral yield using plaque assay. When soil samples were suspended using SM or AKC buffer, as little as 0.5 to 5% of all spiked phages were recovered (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b). Those simple salt-supplemented buffers, however, provided good filtration properties after soil suspension and did not interfere with any downstream analysis. Protein-supplemented elution buffers, such as PBS + 2.5% beef extract or 10% beef extract, recovered a compelling number of spiked bacteriophages (51.1% and 66.7%, respectively). However, when performing phage elution protocols with more than 300 g of soil, any buffer that contained beef extract resulted in being a poor choice. Vacuum-filtration attempts with a filter pore size smaller than 1 &#x003bc;m were instantly clogged and further techniques applied downstream (qPCR, microscopy or concentration methods) failed completely. It is therefore evident that beef extract is a very efficient supplement to suspend soil phages, but equally dissolves other organic compounds that interfere with ensuing techniques.

Bacteriophage elution from soil samples was assessed for different elution buffers. The ability to elute phages from soil samples was tested for elution buffers previously published in literature or novel constituted elution buffer.

(<bold>b</bold>) Elution amelioration measured by plaque assay (mean &#x000b1; SD) when using optimized PPBS instead of literature proposed elution buffer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40168_2020_795_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par28">Our elution buffers were, therefore, adapted and assessed for efficiency with the following modifications: SM buffer was supplemented with 0.01% tween or reduced in magnesium, and additionally, two novel in-house elution buffers were designed consisting of PBS with either a bovine serum albumin (BSA) (PPBS) or beef extract (BPBS) supplementation. For PPBS (protein supplemented PBS), the 10% PBS, 1% potassium citrate and 150 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> were adapted from the optimized AKC buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], while ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was removed and substituted with a 2% BSA supplementation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For beef extract supplemented PBS (BPBS), BSA from PPBS was replaced by beef extract. Salt components in these elution buffers serve as pH and viral particle stabiliser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], whereas the protein addition as BSA or beef extract offers viral binding sites and disrupts soil-viral interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The adjusted SM buffer failed to improve recovery and, hence, did not prevent non-specific phage soil interactions. PPBS performed only negligibly worse in the elution of bacteriophages compared to 10% beef extract (55.8% vs. 66.2% recovery, respectively), and did not trigger any of the technical difficulties described above, even when applied to large samples (&#x0003e;&#x02009;1 kg soil). Interestingly, when replacing BSA with beef extract (BPBS) in this optimized buffer, no enhanced phage recovery was observed. As previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], recovery of spiked bacteriophages was further optimized by resuspending the soil pellet thrice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, route 5&#x02013;6), resulting in a relative increase in recovery of 48% compared to a single suspension step (45.7% and 67.3% recovery, respectively). Our optimized elution protocol allows, hence, a virtually complete recovery of infective bacteriophages with simple methods such as adjusting elution buffer constitution and washing rounds of the soil pellet (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). In summary, soil samples should be eluted in equal volumes of PPBS, manually shaken by inversion and left to settle overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. The suspended soil should then be centrifuged as described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the supernatant kept aside and the pellet resuspended in another volume of PPBS for a total of three rounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Removal of bacterial contaminants using centrifugation and filtration</title><p id="Par29">After elution optimization of bacteriophages from soil particles, the complete removal of contaminating bacterial cells was attempted.

The utilization of such diverse filter pore size in literature has likely arisen by the fear of a compromising effect on the viral community through smaller filter pores. A reductive effect on soil phage diversity when using a 0.22 &#x003bc;m filter has however not been demonstrated yet. In this optimization protocol, any filtration attempt with pore size &#x0003c;&#x02009;16 &#x003bc;m was impaired if the single (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, route 1&#x02013;4) or united (Fig. 1, route 5&#x02013;6) supernatants were not centrifuged thrice at 5000&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 10 min beforehand. Filtration procedures and the spiked phage community though were measurably not impaired when using low-speed centrifugation to remove impurities. No significant difference in spiked phage recovery was observed when comparing a 0.22 &#x003bc;m to 0.45 &#x003bc;m filter pore size (unpaired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.7782, <italic>n</italic> = 9) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). In addition, a 16S rRNA qPCR analysis revealed that both the 0.45 &#x003bc;m and 0.22 &#x003bc;m PES filtration techniques removed &#x0003e;&#x02009;99.9% of all bacterial 16S rRNA genes, whereat the latter decreased bacterial contamination significantly better (unpaired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, <italic>n</italic> = 6) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Yet, a higher recovery of phages in viromic samples was recently suggested when substituting a 0.22 &#x003bc;m for a 0.45 &#x003bc;m filtration step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Along these lines, the 0.45 &#x003bc;m filtration was nevertheless chosen here for further optimization purposes in order to avoid a potential bias in the native soil viral community and both routes (0.22 &#x003bc;m and 0.45 &#x003bc;m filtration) were selected for shotgun sequencing analysis (see below).

These techniques have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and were assessed for functionality in eluted soil samples. An optimal concentration technique should concentrate viral particles without introducing a bias to the native viral community, and equally reduce the suspensions&#x02019; volume sufficiently to allow DNA extraction. Spiked phages were eluted from soil samples using the optimized elution protocol, filtrated through a 0.45 &#x003bc;m PES filter and subjected to PEG or TFF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, route I&#x02013;II). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, both concentration techniques performed equally well in concentrating spiked phages and no differences in spiked phage yield after concentration was observed. Furthermore, viral suspensions were reduced in both approaches to a final volume of 20&#x02013;50 ml, which allowed CsCl ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration. Similar to filtration, the spike-dependent approach for evaluating the efficiency of those concentration methods has not resulted in a clear conclusion. Both routes were therefore selected for shotgun sequencing to elucidate the superior technique for viral recovery and diversity (see below). CsCl ultracentrifugation concentrates and purifies phages from environmental samples or pure cultures. It is, however, not only technically demanding but also cost and equipment intensive. The necessity of a CsCl purification for soil samples prior to DNA extraction was evaluated by extracting soil viruses with and without CsCl centrifugation prior to ultrafiltration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, route II and III). Ultrafiltration units were coated with PBS + 1% BSA to reduce viral absorption as suggested and optimized elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Purification of soil samples with CsCl ultracentrifugation seemed to slightly diminish spiked viral yields (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b). However, this loss in PFU could also be attributed to a loss in infectivity rather than a loss in viral yield caused by centrifugation conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. When avoiding a CsCl purification step prior to ultrafiltration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, route III, and Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), the centrifugal filters clogged while concentrating and the remaining volume could not be reduced below 5 ml. A purification of soil viral suspensions using CsCl ultracentrifugation was therefore implemented in the optimized protocol, which ensured a concentration to a final volume below 300 &#x003bc;l. When aiming for isolating infective viral particles from soil samples, however, this purification can easily be omitted.

DNA extraction using the suggested kit resumed in a &#x0003e;&#x02009;10-fold reduction of viral DNA than other proposed DNA extraction routes, and was therefore excluded from the optimized protocol (data not shown). The phenol/chloroform DNA extraction was adapted from Thurber et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], whereas the necessity of formamide and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in both viral DNA extraction routes was assessed by bypassing these steps singularly or in combination. DNA extraction routes with larger volumes that originated directly from the TFF concentrated sample (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, route III, no CsCl purification) resulted in a jellification of the sample after the addition of formamide, or presented contamination with qPCR inhibitors that even flawed DNA measurements if formamide was neglected. Extraction routes covering a formamide treatment resulted therefore either in a complete loss of viral DNA through a jellification of the sample (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, route III), or reduction in DNA yield from CsCl purified routes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). Formamide treatment decreased the viral DNA yield irrespectively of purification and was therefore excluded. On the other hand, a CTAB/NaCl treatment did not correlate consistently with a disadvantageous outcome and was further highly dependent on the experimental setup. For the sake of simplicity, a CTAB/NaCl treatment of viral suspensions was hence incorporated in viral DNA extraction (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). When performing the optimized protocol, a sufficient amount of pure viral DNA was extracted from 400 to 1000 g of soil (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which allowed shotgun sequencing devoid of any biasing amplification step prior to library preparation.

The four optimized phage DNA extraction routes (0.22 &#x003bc;m + TFF, 0.22 &#x003bc;m + PEG, 0.45 &#x003bc;m + TFF and 0.45 &#x003bc;m + PEG) were hence compared for viral richness, diversity and bacterial DNA contamination levels using metagenomic analysis. Viral DNA was extracted from 1 kg of soil for each extraction route and paired-end shotgun Illumina sequenced with 76 million reads per route. Over 90% of all raw reads survived the initial data pre-processing as trimming and size exclusion and a total of 311 million reads from all four viromes remained.

As a normalization measure and to exclude a potential direct effect of the number of reads to the assembled contigs, a sub-assembly with 60 million reads for each sequenced extraction route was performed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3). This sub-assembly resulted in less assembled contigs for each virome, indicating an incomplete coverage of the viromic diversity.

This finding is consistent with Lasobras et al.

In summary, the optimized elution protocol described here results in a substantial recovery of spiked bacteriophages, whereas no technical, difficult or harsh method was applied to maximise viral retrieval. As a major advantage, this gentle optimized elution protocol potentially allows the isolation of infective viral particles through omitting techniques that could result in tail breakages or defective particles.</p><p id="Par39">For shotgun sequencing or functional metagenomics, a maximum reduction of bacterial DNA contamination is crucial to allow data analysis. Filtration of unknown viral suspensions to remove bacterial contamination is, therefore, an extensively discussed topic in previous studies. Published protocols in literature suggest either a 0.22 &#x003bc;m, 0.45 &#x003bc;m or 0.8 &#x003bc;m filtration of extracted viromes to decrease bacterial contamination below a threshold and simultaneously not impair viral yield or diversity. As shown by shotgun sequencing of 0.22 &#x003bc;m and 0.45 &#x003bc;m filtrated viromes, a 0.22 &#x003bc;m PES filter removed more bacterial DNA contamination compared to a 0.45 &#x003bc;m PES filter, while simultaneously not compromising soil viral diversity and recovery. Indeed, less viral diversity was observed in viromes filtrated through a 0.45 &#x003bc;m pore-size, which is most likely due to the increased bacterial DNA contamination and thus, the impaired assembly of viral contigs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This finding is supported by our recruitment analysis, which revealed similar amounts of reads recruited to the manually classified viral or bacterial fraction (14.7% and 15% respectively) in 0.45 &#x003bc;m viromes. The vast majority of reads recruited in the 0.22 &#x003bc;m viromes, however, matched to viral contigs and &#x0003c;&#x02009;5% to bacteria (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

Any virome extracted from those samples must, therefore, be either manually curated to remove bacterial reads, or handled with great care to reach valid conclusions.</p><p id="Par40">In order to concentrate bacteriophages from large volumes, the most commonly used approaches such as TFF and PEG precipitation were compared for efficiency here. Independently from the initial filtration technique applied, TFF performed better in recovering and concentrating soil phages and, therefore, revealed a greater soil viral diversity as assessed using sequencing analysis. After concentration, a purification of soil viral suspensions using CsCl ultracentrifugation was implemented in the optimized protocol before viral DNA extraction to remove inhibitors and allow ultrafiltration concentration to a final volume below 300 &#x003bc;l. As resolved here, CsCl ultracentrifugation needs to be applied for purification purposes prior to DNA extraction when working with large amounts of soil, but could be omitted when aiming for the isolation of infective viral particles or the extraction of phages from small amounts of soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

This finding roughly doubles the currently 27,502 published viral contigs from soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and highlights the still very fragmented nature of available datasets from soil ecosystems. Out of our manually identified viral fraction, 379 novel and presumably complete phage genomes, which average size is consistent with presently isolated dsDNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], were extracted. In addition, we obtained another 89 possibly closed and novel putative phage genomes in length up to 70.9 kb from the contigs that were classified as unknown.

We have shown a dramatically enhanced extraction of the soil phage community by protocol optimization and present soil viromes harbouring 468 novel, possibly complete soil bacteriophages in over 25,000 non-bacterial contigs. Our huge data set of manually curated soil viral contigs provides insights into the yet largely undescribed soil viral sequence space and is the most comprehensive study to date. Our optimized protocol could be valuable for any viral extraction from solid matrixes, given the development of an adequate phage elution buffer for the respective sample. Our guidelines for the elution process and buffer design will facilitate such proposals in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Soil samples</title><p id="Par43">Agricultural soil samples were collected from a long-term soil experimental field (ZOFE, Zurich Organic Fertilization Experiment), located in a rural area surrounding Zurich (Agroscope, Reckenholz, Switzerland).
