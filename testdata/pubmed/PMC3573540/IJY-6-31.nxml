According to the 1998&#x02013;2004 National Health and Nutritional Survey (NHANES), the prevalence of CKD in the US population is 15.3%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The United States Renal Data System (USRDS) reported that the estimated risk for cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction, is 3.5&#x02013;50 times higher among patients on renal replacement therapy than in the general population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Approximately 50% of the patients with ESRD die from cardiovascular events,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] which indicate that cardiovascular mortality is 30 times higher in dialysis patients. Chronic kidney disease patients are known to be affected by diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity &#x02013; which are known traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in the general population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Reports from the Caribbean Renal Registry of six countries identified hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) as the most common causes of CKD and ESRD. The leading causes of death reported were listed as ischemic heart disease/heart failure, sepsis, and cerebrovascular accident.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Chronic renal insufficiency <italic>per se</italic> is associated with uremia&#x02013;specific risk factors, such as, chronic volume expansion, anemia, disturbances of calcium-phosphate metabolism, hyperhomocysteinemia, and a micro-inflammatory state associated with increased oxidant stress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Oxidative stress is defined as tissue damage resulting from an imbalance between the excessive generation of oxidant compounds and insufficient anti-oxidant defense mechanisms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Impaired oxidative balance in CKD is likely to come from a combination of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and reduced clearance, as well as an ineffective antioxidant defense mechanism. Several important antioxidant pathways have been reported to be altered in patients with CKD, including reduced erythrocyte SOD activity,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] diminished plasma glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Plasma ascorbic acid and lipid-soluble alpha-tocopherol, both potent components of an antioxidant defense system, were found to be significantly reduced after a single hemodialysis session.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] However, the hemodialysis procedure was also reported to have beneficial effects on the total antioxidant capacity by increasing the plasma thiol content.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), a by-product of lipid peroxidation, are increased in the plasma and red blood cells of ESRD patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Hemodialysis patients are significantly less active than the sedentary age-matched controls and their physical activity declines by about 3.4% each month, after initiation of dialysis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] A large research literature documents a variety of potential benefits that ESRD patients may achieve from exercise training.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Improvements in reaction time and lower extremity muscle strength, left ventricular systolic function, and psychosocial functioning have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] In addition, exercise has beneficial effects on the functional capacity, anemia, cardiovascular risks factors, dyslipidemia, and psychosocial problems.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Yoga has become increasingly popular in Western cultures as a means of exercise and training fitness.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] It has been used clinically as a therapeutic intervention and its practice includes muscle stretching, breathing exercises, behavioral modification, and dietary control, through mental discipline.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] A growing number of research studies have shown that <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga can improve strength and flexibility, and may help control physiological variables such as blood pressure, respiration, heart rate, and metabolic rate, to improve the overall exercise capacity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Studies carried out on the medium or long-term effect of yoga exercise on oxidative stress parameters and antioxidant status in end stage renal disease patients are sparse. To date, only one study by Yurtkuran <italic>et al</italic>. has evaluated the effects of a yoga-based exercise program on pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and biochemical markers, in hemodialysis patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] This study has investigated the impact of <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga exercise on oxidative stress indicators and the oxidant status in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Selection of subjects</title><p>The study was conducted between January 2009 and April 2009, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All the participants were recruited from the Hemodialysis Unit at the University Hospital of the West Indies. The inclusion criteria were: End-stage renal disease, between 20 to 70 years old, good psychological condition (in accordance with the psychologist's consideration), non-smoker and non-alcoholic, had no associated serious illness or harmful dependency on toxic habits, and had signed a consent form. There were two groups in the study. The yoga group consisted of patients who participated in 30 minutes of guided <italic>Hatha</italic> Yoga exercise and an additional 30 minutes of instructed and unsupervised home training. The yoga exercises consisted of <italic>pranayama</italic> (breath-control exercises), <italic>asanas</italic> (yogic postures), and supine relaxation in <italic>savasana</italic> (corpse pose). The participants in the control group continued their regular lifestyle practice, without direct intervention from the personnel of this investigation.</p><p>Using the Sample Power statistical software, set at type 1 error (alpha) = 0.05 and power of 90%, the minimum number of participants needed to pick up the mean differences from the normal was calculated to be five persons per group of interest. The groups of interest include analysis broken down by four age categories, two gender categories, four body mass index categories, and two overall groupings of cases versus controls. Hence, a minimum of 66 participants (33 cases in the Yoga group and 33 comparison control patients without a guided training program) were needed for this study. Informed consent was obtained, and intervention and control patients were selected using a random sample, from the sample frame of list of patients who attended that Hemodialysis Unit.</p><p>On the day of blood collection, the subjects were asked to abstain from <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga or any other form of exercise. Blood (5 mL) was drawn from an antecubital vein at baseline (0 month) and after four months in one sample tube, with a serum separator gel, for oxidative stress indicators and other biochemical investigations in the post absorptive state. The blood was drawn between 7:30 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., without stasis. The serum samples were processed and refrigerated within three hours of blood draw. The serum samples that were not assayed within 24 hours after collection were stored at 2&#x000b0;C to 8&#x000b0;C.

Evaluation of the antioxidant status demonstrates a significant increase in SOD and catalase activities, with a concomitant non-significant reduction in MDA in the <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga exercise group, after four months. The improved antioxidant status, due to this exercise regimen, may point to an adaptive response to oxidative stress, reflecting free radical production and increased enzyme biosynthesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>]</p><p>Patients with chronic renal failure, including those receiving regular long-term hemodialysis have a high incidence of premature cardiovascular disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Free radicals may cause lipid peroxidation, and damage macromolecules and the cellular structure of the organism, endothelium, and erythrocytes. Oxidative stress generally causes damage to the membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids leading to the generation of MDA, a thiobarbituric acid reacting substance (TBARS). Plasma MDA is the breakdown product of the major chain reactions leading to definite oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic and linolenic acids, and thus, serves as a reliable marker of lipid peroxidation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Plasma MDA is a predictor of cardiovascular disease in patients on hemodialysis, which may underscore the role of oxidative stress as a cardiac risk factor in these patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] Some studies have shown that hemodialysis is connected with increased free radical production.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] In a study by Marjani <italic>et al</italic>., examining the possibility of lipid peroxidation and lipid profile variation in hemodialysis patients, there were increased plasma levels of lipid peroxidation and triglycerides in ESRD patients compared to the control subjects. The authors conclude that the changes in the level of plasma lipid peroxidation and triglycerides in hemodialyzed patients, may be related to the patients uremia, dialysis membrane, and the dialysis process.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] In the present study there was no difference in the baseline MDA concentration of the patients in both groups. This result differs from other studies, where some researchers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] have reported that the level of plasma MDA in hemodialysis patients had increased when compared with that of the control group. Furthermore, there was preliminary evidence that regular yoga exercise training reduces oxidative stress markers and fibrinogen levels in non-randomized, controlled, and uncontrolled trials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] In our study the decreased concentration of MDA (although not statistically significant) after four months, in ESRD patients in the <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga exercise group, indicated that there was a reduction in lipoperoxidation.</p><p>Cellular intracellular enzymes such as SOD and catalase, along with non-enzymatic antioxidants such as glutathione, act as a primary line of defense, to cope with the deleterious effects of the reactive oxygen species.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>] Superoxide dismutase detoxifies the superoxide radicals and converts them to hydrogen peroxide, which is further converted to water by catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Reduced scavenging of free radicals by SOD, decreased glutathione, and decreased activity of catalase are associated with diabetes mellitus and vascular pathology.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>] The activities of SOD and catalase in the ESRD patients in the <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga exercise group were significantly increased after four months, compared to the baseline values. A major benefit of a non-exhaustive exercise, such as yoga, is to induce a mild oxidative stress that stimulates the expression of certain antioxidant enzymes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] For example, the gene expression of SOD is enhanced after an acute bout of exercise, preceded by an elevation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 binding. An increase in <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis of SOD or catalase usually requires repeated bouts of exercise.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] This could explain the increase in the activity of SOD in the <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga exercise group after four months.</p><p>An oxidative stress due to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species by activated monocytes and impairment in antioxidant defense mechanisms may take place in hemodialysis patients and may contribute to accelerated hemodialysis-induced atherogenesis by oxidatively modified proteins and lipids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] Protein oxidation does not have the features of chain reactions and the process has quite a long period. Therefore, the evaluation of POX in plasma is a respected marker of free radical intensity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>] Reactive oxygen species modify amino acid side chains of proteins such as arginine, lysine, threonine, and proline residues to form protein carbonyls.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>] Carbonyl group formation is considered to be an early and stable marker for POX. The POX significantly increases in the ESRD patients in the <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga group, with a minor increase in the control group. This indicates carbonyl group formation, and thus, evidence of the free radical modification of proteins over the four months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>]</p><p>The functions of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> include increasing the rate of the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, as well as the synthesis and degradation of proteins inside the cell.

Thyroid hormones are important regulators of energy metabolism and may influence energy processes during physical exercise.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>] In this study, there has been a significant decrease in TSH level and a significant increase of FT<sub>4</sub>, after four months, compared to the baseline. Few studies have investigated the effect of yoga exercises on thyroid function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>] In a study by Rawal and colleagues, who investigated the effect of one month's yoga and physical training exercise on the thyroid function of subjects, resident at sea level, a greater increase in thyroidal activity was induced by the conventional physical training exercise compared to yoga.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>]</p><p>Some studies have reported that exercise improves solute removal due to increased muscle blood flow in the open capillary surface area associated with increased flux of urea from the tissue to the vascular compartment during exercise and increased cell membrane permeability to water-soluble molecules, such as creatinine, due to rising exercise-induced body temperature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>] In our study, there was a significant decrease in serum urea in the post dialysis sample of patients in the <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga exercise group after four months compared to the baseline values. There was also an increase in albumin and calcium, post and pre hemodialysis, respectively, in the <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga exercise group. Yurtkuran <italic>et al</italic>., conducted a single-blind, randomized trial, comparing the effects of yoga with gentle range-of-motion exercises on symptoms related to hemodialysis in 37 renal failure patients. After three months of twice-weekly sessions consisting primarily of standing and seated <italic>asanas</italic> and meditation, the yoga group exhibited significant reduction in the serum levels of urea, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol, erythrocytes, and hematocrit. These changes were also better than those in the control group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The findings of the study demonstrate the efficacy of <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga exercise on the oxidative stress markers and antioxidant status in patients with ESRD. These findings suggest that <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga exercise in patients with ESRD has therapeutic, preventative, and protective effects in ESRD, by decreasing the oxidative stress. This may have a direct impact on the use of <italic>Hatha</italic> yoga exercise as a safe therapeutic modality in ESRD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors express gratitude to Dr. Georgiana Gordon-Strachan, for her assistance with the statistical analyses.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Whaley-Connell</surname><given-names>AT</given-names></name><name><surname>Sowers</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>McFarlane</surname><given-names>SI</given-names></name><name><surname>Shlipak</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Norris</surname><given-names>KC</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>, CKD in the United States: Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004</article-title><source>Am J Kidney Dis</source><year>2008</year><volume>51</volume><issue>suppl 2</issue><fpage>S13</fpage><lpage>20</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18359403</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Levey</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Beto</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Coronado</surname><given-names>BE</given-names></name><name><surname>Eknoyan</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Foley</surname><given-names>RN</given-names></name><name><surname>Kasiske</surname><given-names>BL</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Controlling the epidemic of cardiovascular disease in chronic renal disease: What do we know?
