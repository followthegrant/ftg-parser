Previous pre-clinical approaches primarily focused on the administration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to promote vascular repair after stroke. Although shown to improve angiogenesis and functional recovery from stroke, VEGF increased the risk of blood brain barrier disruption and bleedings to such an extent that its clinical use is contraindicated. As an alternative strategy, antibodies against the neurite growth inhibitory factor Nogo-A have recently been shown to enhance vascular regeneration in the ischemic central nervous system (CNS); however, their effect on vascular permeability is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that antibody-mediated Nogo-A neutralization following stroke has strong pro-angiogenic effects but does not increase vascular permeability as opposed to VEGF. Moreover, VEGF-induced vascular permeability was partially prevented when VEGF was co-administered with anti-Nogo-A antibodies. This study may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for vascular repair and maturation in the ischemic brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Ischemic stroke results from focal cerebral ischemia due to occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel. At the core of the stroke, affected brain regions lose their supply of oxygen and glucose with immediate disturbance of function followed by necrotic cell death within hours. Surrounding the core is a zone of reduced blood flow with partial blockade of vessels, the ischemic border zone. Prolonged ischemia leads to tissue damage in this zone; however, restoration of blood supply by angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, may prevent some of these degenerative events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Preclinical research has linked therapeutic enhancement of angiogenesis through vascular growth factors to improved neurological outcomes, but these therapies have failed to be translated into clinical application due to safety concerns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In parallel to inducing angiogenesis, vascular growth factors have been shown to trigger a cascade of aggravating events including increased vascular permeability and blood brain barrier breakdown as well as an increased risk of bleedings from immature, unstable vessels (hemorrhagic transformation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. VEGF has been shown to disrupt the barrier function of the vessel endothelium through the promotion of pericyte detachment and degradation of tight junction proteins including claudins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and cadherins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, VEGF delivery appears to have a narrow therapeutic window due to dosing and a half life time of only several minutes <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, alternative strategies are required without the risk of vascular leakage and bleeding.</p><p id="Par3">Recently, the neurite outgrowth inhibitor Nogo-A, a membrane protein expressed by oligodendrocytes and subpopulations of neurons, has been shown to limit vascular growth in development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and after CNS ischemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Its neutralization improved vascular repair in the ischemic border zone of cerebral strokes as well as functional outcome.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we hypothesized that Nogo-A might represent a safe pro-angiogenic therapeutic target that does not increase vascular permeability and BBB integrity in contrast to VEGF. We identified anti-Nogo-A antibodies as promising new reagents to enhance vascular repair and maturation. In particular, we demonstrate that anti-Nogo-A antibodies (1) have similar pro-angiogenic effects as local VEGF treatment (2) do not increase vascular permeability in the peri-infarction regions, (3) partially reverse the VEGF induced blood vessel leakage when co-administrated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Blood-brain-barrier permeability is elevated in peri-infarct regions following ischemic stroke</title><p id="Par5">A significant hallmark of the brain tissue in the peri-infarct regions is the dysfunction of the BBB resulting in edema and the penetration of serum proteins into the CNS parenchyma. Yet the role of disturbed vascular permeability in stroke progression is not clear. We induced a photothrombotic stroke in the sensorimotor cortex of adult mice and analyzed vascular permeability in the acute (1 day post injury (dpi)), subacute (7 dpi), and chronic (21 dpi) phase by Evans Blue (EB) extravasation in micro-dissected lysates of different brain regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>). Moreover, histology of coronal cortical sections was performed in a subgroup of animals that were either intact or at 7 dpi in the peri-infarct regions (Suppl. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). In the intact animals, EB was entirely confined to the vessel system in the CNS and could be fully removed by perfusion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). EB/albumin concentrations in lysed brain tissue could be detected (at Ex: 620/Em: 680) with a sensitivity of 0.006&#x02009;ng/mg (LOD), or respectively 0.019&#x02009;ng (LOQ) per mg brain lysate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Analysis of EB extravasation in the peri-infarct region revealed a disrupted BBB throughout the time course (1 dpi: 42.91&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.80&#x02009;ng/mg, 7 dpi: 34.01&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.77&#x02009;ng/mg, 21 dpi: 31.54&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;16.06&#x02009;ng/mg tissue compared to uninjured cortices 5.32&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01&#x02009;ng/mg, all p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C,E</xref>). With progressing time the intragroup variability increased, suggesting a partial restoration of the BBB in individual animals. Interestingly, acutely after stroke, a subset of animals showed increased EB concentrations also in the contralesional cortex (17.04&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.92&#x02009;ng/mg tissue, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and in both hippocampi (left: 8.63&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.09&#x02009;ng/mg, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002, right: 8.97&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.49&#x02009;ng/mg, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.027) compared to corresponding regions in uninjured animals, suggesting the extension of the BBB damaging effects into the contralesional hemisphere (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>).

However, the clinical usability of vascular growth factors to promote revascularization of the ischemic tissue is compromised by the BBB destabilizing effects of VEGFs, which lead to enhanced edema and raise the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. In this study, we pursued an alternative strategy to enhance vascular repair by targeting the growth inhibitory protein Nogo-A. We demonstrate that antibody-mediated neutralization of Nogo-A protects the adult vasculature against leakage during the recovery phase after stroke while promoting vascular repair in the peri-infarct region. In particular, we show that 1) Nogo-A neutralization and VEGF treatment display equivalent pro-angiogenic effects by increasing vascular density in the peri-infarct regions; and 2) that newly formed vessels after Nogo-A neutralization are mature and do not show enhanced leakage as opposed to VEGF. Overall, this study identifies Nogo-A antibodies as a new and safe therapeutic agent to enhance angiogenesis following ischemic stroke.</p><p id="Par19">Pro-angiogenic therapeutics have attracted increasing attention in the field of CNS ischemia. In particular, VEGF is well known for its prominent role in angiogenesis; however, VEGF therapy has failed to meet its promising expectations mainly due to safety concerns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Our study supports these findings and shows that intracerebroventricular administration of recombinant VEGF for 7 days following a focal cortical stroke exacerbates vascular leakage, along with a prominent angiogenic effect. Besides its neuroprotective and pro-angiogenic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, VEGF has been previously shown to disrupt vascular barrier function and promote edema development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, newly formed VEGF-induced blood vessel sprouts are leaky and enhance inflammatory processes in the peri-infarct region. The decreased vessel stabilization has been linked to VEGFR2 activation leading to internalization of tight junction proteins (e.g. VE-cadherins) and loosening of endothelial cell contacts <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, VEGF treatment may lead to pericyte ablation and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. These detrimental effects have also been observed in other major ischemic conditions including myocardial infarction and retinal ischemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Consequently, VEGF treatment following ischemia raises considerable safety concerns and thus has not been implemented in human trials.</p><p id="Par20">One key mechanism for VEGF-induced hyperpermeability is the RhoA/ROCK pathway; Rho kinase activity has strong barrier-disruptive effects and has been associated with increased VEGF levels following ischemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the vascular growth inhibitory signaling of Nogo-A via its receptor S1PR2 has been shown to also activate the RhoA/ROCK pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Consequently, antibody-mediated inactivation of Nogo-A signaling may directly decrease RhoA levels in stroked tissue and contribute to the vascular integrity. Genetic and pharmacological blockage of S1PR2 reduced the neurovascular injury and permeability in experimental stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>; previous work from our group confirmed these results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The reduction of leakage following anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment may be a consequence of the higher number of pericytes and tight junctions in the vasculature of the peri-infarct region observed in our study. Interestingly, co-delivery of VEGF and anti-Nogo-A antibodies also reduced vascular hyperpermeability in the peri-infarct region and in part improved the maturation of the vasculature. However, it remains unclear if this is mediated through the Rock/RhoA pathway. Future studies may address the underlying mechanism between Nogo-A and VEGF following stroke and elucidate how anti-Nogo-A antibodies stabilize the microvasculature. Interestingly, the pro-angiogenic effects in the combined treatment group were not enhanced compared to the single treatment groups of VEGF or anti-Nogo-A antibodies alone. However, it is unclear whether this is due to intrinsic regulatory mechanisms that may inhibit excessive levels of angiogenesis or a consequence of the interaction between both substances.</p><p id="Par21">A limitation of the study is the usage of end point measures and the photothrombotic stroke model. We cannot distinguish if the enhanced Evans blue signals in due to the damaged peri-infarct vasculature caused by the initial stroke injury or rather reflects the leakiness of newly formed and immature blood vessels. Dissecting these mechanisms is however, difficult and might be addressed in future studies with advancements in genetic models and <italic>in vivo</italic> microscopy.</p><p id="Par22">Apart from Nogo-A, guidance molecule targeted therapies have been previously shown to act on both vascular repair and permeability following stroke.

Moreover, ephrinA1- EphA2 signaling has important roles in maintaining tight junction formation and its misregulation has been linked to BBB disruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Since it is known that genetic deletion of Nogo-A may change expression of other guidance molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, we cannot exclude that such indirect effects may also contribute to the reduced vascular leakage in anti-Nogo-A antibody treated animals.</p><p id="Par23">Taken together, the administration of anti-Nogo-A antibodies may represent a new, promising, and safe therapeutic strategy to enhance angiogenesis, prevent vascular leakage and retain tissue integrity and functionality in the peri-infarct zone following ischemic stroke.

The mixture was centrifuged to remove precipitated fragments (25&#x02009;min, 15000&#x02009;g, 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) and the extracted supernatant was collected in a 96-well plate. The EB concentrations were measured at 620&#x02009;nm using a standard microplate reader (Spark, Tecan) and quantified against a standard curve. The results were expressed as micrograms of EB per milligram of brain tissue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Fluorescence microscopy and quantification</title><p id="Par34">Imaging of brain sections 10 days after stroke was performed with an Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner (Zeiss) and an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with 10&#x000d7;, 20&#x000d7; and 40&#x000d7; objectives. Images were processed using Fiji (ImageJ) and Adobe Illustrator CS6.
