As no other drug before it, quinine, the first antimalarial agent derived from the cinchona tree, helped to shape today's world by enabling explorers and colonists from Europe to survive in tropical countries and to build their colonial empires despite lethal tropical malaria. When physicians were asked to choose the ten most important drugs being used in medicine in 1945, quinine and quinacrine were preceded only by penicillin, sulfonamides and blood derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The antimalarial activity of quinoline antimalarial drugs can be attributed to the interfering with hemoglobin digestion in the blood stages of the malaria parasite's life cycle. The parasite degrades the host hemoglobin, in an acidic food vacuole, to generate amino acids for its own protein synthesis, and producing free heme and reactive oxygen species as toxic by-products. The heme moieties are neutralized by polymerization, and this process is thought to be the biochemical target for antimalarial drugs. Although antimalarial drugs were developed primarily to treat malaria, and never lost their place in treating this life-threatening disease (still a major cause of infant death in the tropics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]), they are also beneficial for many dermatological, immunological, and rheumatological diseases, for which they are mostly used today in the Western world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Some of the many patients who receive antimalarials for the treatment of non-infective inflammatory diseases (lupus erythematosus and other collagen vascular diseases, vasculitis, panniculitis, rheumatoid arthritis and others) are also immunosuppressed because of their disease and/or treatments and have a concomitant bacterial infection. These patients often need systemic antibiotics, either as prophylaxis or for the treatment of active infections of the skin or other organs.</p><p>Therefore, if antimalarials could prove to be effective against bacterial infections, they can protect against (and even treat) such conditions and obviate the need for an additional antibiotic drug.</p><p>To examine this possibility, we studied the effect of quinine sulfate (QS) on bacterial growth and on bacterial invasion of cultured cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Organism and media</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) HB101 (pRI203) was kindly provided by Dr. Falkow (Stanford Medical School, Calif.

Infection was performed for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The cells were then thoroughly washed with PBS, and 1 ml of fresh medium containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamicin was added to each well. After a further 2-h incubation period at 37&#x000b0;C, infected cells were treated with trypsin-EDTA (mixture of 0.05 % trypsin [1/250] and 0.02 % EDTA) for 5 min at 37&#x000b0;C and lysed by the addition of 0.1 %Triton-X100.

Their place in the treatment of autoimmune dermatological and rheumatological diseases has already been widely discussed in the literature <sup>4</sup>. Apart from their well-documented advantages, i.e., excellent bioavailability, low toxicity, long-term safety, and low-cost, one more property of these drugs might be of special interest in the setting of HIV infection and of autoimmune diseases, namely, their ability to prevent/treat several infectious diseases other than malaria. The antimalarials have been proven as being beneficial for several intracellular pathogens, but only intracellular ones that mainly affect individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, such as Legionella pneumophila, Histoplasma capsulatum, Francisella tularensis, Penicillium marneffei Cryptococcus neoformans, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and others.</p><p>Although the antimalarials are generally regarded as being inactive against most extracellular bacterial species, in the early seventies one British group reported that the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> could be inhibited by chloroquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Another group found that antimalarials inhibited in vitro the activity of DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase of <italic>E. coli</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], thus confirming findings of earlier experiments by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The adhesion of <italic>E. coli</italic> to host epithelial cells is the very first step of infections, followed by the internalization of some bacteria into the cells. The internalization of attached bacteria is a kind of endocytosis rather than an invasion and is thus influenced by the adherence of bacteria to the epithelial cells. According to Straube et al. chloroquine leads to a significant inhibition of internalization of bacteria by inhibiting endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] by Wiseman's group (which were carried out on chloroquine and not quinine), our QS experiments failed to show any antibacterial activity or any effect on bacterial growth what-so-ever.</p><p>Our in vitro invasion assays, however, did show that QS significantly inhibited the internalization/invasion efficacy of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the host cells, in accordance with one previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data further support the finding that QS interferes with invasion and internalization of <italic>E. coli</italic> into host cells, thus protecting living cells from its pathogenic effects. In contrast to the results of previous reports, we demonstrated that it does not affect bacterial growth.</p><p>Apart from the theoretical considerations of these findings in providing further insight into the pathomechanism of bacterial invasion and the contra-action of antimalarial drugs, our current findings might also have practical implications in illuminating the antibacterial action of antimalarial drugs, data which might be especially important to immunosuppressed patients who receive these drugs for autoimmune collagen vascular diseases, or as additional therapy for AIDS. It is worth noting that the antimalarials do not act directly on the invading pathogens, but rather on the host cells and, therefore, the potential for microorganisms to become resistant to its effects may be limited.</p><p>The antibacterial action of antimalarials against various other common bacteria is currently under investigation by our group.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Ronni Wolf, Eleonora Ruocco and Vincenzo Ruocco conceived the idea, designed of the study, drafted the article and revised it critically for important intellectual content.
