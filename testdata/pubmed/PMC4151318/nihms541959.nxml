This tool affords the opportunity to control neural activity over a broad dynamic range of stimulation intensities. Using time-resolved activation, we show that the neural control of male courtship song can be separated into probabilistic, persistent and deterministic, command-like components. The former, but not the latter, neurons are subject to functional modulation by social experience, supporting the idea that they constitute a locus of state-dependent influence.

Likewise, the use of light-sensitive microbial opsins, such as channelrhodopsin, has revolutionized the functional dissection of neural circuits in behaving animals<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, with the exception of larval neurons and peripheral sensory neurons in adults<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> this powerful technology and model organism have been largely incompatible in the case of adult flies (but see refs<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>). Therefore <italic>Drosophila</italic> researchers have, to a large extent, been unable to exploit the rapidly expanding optogenetic toolkit for neural circuit manipulation. Although P2X2, an ionotropic purinergic receptor, has been used as an optogenetic tool in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this technique requires injection of caged ATP into the brains of individual anesthetized flies<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. This relatively invasive technology is sub-optimal for many applications, especially large-scale, high-throughput screening.</p><p id="P3">In the absence of facile optogenetic manipulation, dTRPA1, a thermosensitive cation channel, has been the preferred method for neuronal activation in freely behaving adult flies<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Since this method depends on changes in temperature to control neuronal activity, however, it lacks precision in both the temporal and intensity domains and suffers from potentially confounding influence of temperature changes on behavior.</p><p id="P4">Here, we demonstrate that expression of ReaChR in adult central nervous system (CNS) neurons enables rapid and temporally precise control of behavior in freely moving adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Using this optogenetic method, we have separated the control of wing extension, a male-specific courtship behavior, into probabilistic, state-dependent and deterministic, command-like components.

Indeed, direct measurements <italic>in vivo</italic> indicated that the penetrance of blue light through the cuticle is much weaker (c.a. 1 %) than that of longer wavelengths such as green or red light (5&#x02013;10 %) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Therefore, we created transgenic flies that express the recently developed red-shifted channelrhodopsins, C1V1(T/T)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and ReaChR<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> under the control of the Gal4-UAS system, to test whether red shifted light can penetrate the cuticle sufficiently to activate neurons expressing these channels (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for a listing of all transgenic fly strains created).</p><p id="P6">We first compared the efficacy of different opsins to activate sugar-sensing gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) that express the receptor Gr5a<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Optogenetic activation of Gr5a neurons using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) has previously been shown to trigger the proboscis extension reflex (PER) in <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). All of the blue light-sensitive opsin variants tested (ChR2<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, H134R<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and C128T<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>) induced PER behavior in response to photostimulation at 470 nm, although only H134R yielded responses in 100 % of flies (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Flies expressing ReaChR in Gr5a GRNs yielded robust PER responses to both red (627 nm) and green (530 nm) light. In contrast, flies expressing C1V1(T/T) did not exhibit PERs in response to either red or green light (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Instead, they moved their proboscis slightly, albeit in a manner time-locked to photostimulation, suggesting that C1V1(T/T) has only a weak ability to activate Gr5a GRNs.</p><p id="P7">Surprisingly, in flies expressing dTrpA1 in Gr5a GRNs, we did not observe any behavioral response at an ambient temperature known to activate the ion channel (32 &#x000b0;C)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), or during gradual ramping to this temperature from 22 &#x000b0;C (data not shown). Interestingly, activation of dTrpA1 in Gr5a GRNs using heat pulses from an IR laser<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> has been reported to induce a PER. Upon continuous current injection some neurons develop a depolarization block<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. We reasoned that if Gr5a neurons are continuously or gradually activated via TrpA1, they may undergo a rapid depolarization block that prevents PER behavior. Consistent with this idea, continuous illumination of Gr5a-ReaChR flies produced only a transient PER reaction (half-time for decay = 1.5 sec), while pulsatile illumination (1 Hz, 100 msec pulse duration) evoked a train of PERs time-locked to each light pulse (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Consistent with this, electrophysiological recording of Gr5a GRNs revealed that pulsed light caused continuous bursts of spiking throughout the stimulation period (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, e</xref>) with short latencies (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). In contrast, spiking activity decayed exponentially during continuous light stimulation (half-time for decay, &#x0223c;1.5 sec; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, e</xref>). The rapid decay of both spiking and PER behavior during continuous activation of ReaChR (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>; Pearson's correlation coefficient: <italic>r</italic> = 0.96), suggests that the former likely accounts for the latter.</p><p id="P9">Similar to the results obtained using continuous ReaChR activation, TrpA1 activation triggered only transient spiking in Gr5a GRNs, with a strong decay after several seconds (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). Together, these data may explain why PER responses were not induced by constitutive or gradual thermal activation in Gr5a-TrpA1-expressing flies (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). They also reconfirm the importance of pulsed activation of neurons to avoid depolarization block, as reported previously in other systems<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (but note that depolarization block does not occur in all neuronal subtypes<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Activation of CNS neurons with ReaChR</title><p id="P10">Only a few studies have reported successful elicitation of behavior in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> by activating CNS neurons expressing blue light-sensitive opsins<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. To determine whether activation using ReaChR would be more effective, we directly compared the behavioral responses of flies expressing blue light- vs. red light- sensitive opsins in GAL4 lines driving expression in different populations of CNS neurons. These lines included: HB9-GAL4<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> whose activation induces side walking (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 2</xref>) and, at higher intensities, paralysis (loss of postural control and immobility); Corazonin (Crz)-GAL4 whose activation induces abdominal bending and ejaculation<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 3</xref>); Fru-GAL4<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, which labels &#x0223c;1,500 neurons throughout the brain and whose activation in males induces mating behavior including wing extension<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, and abdominal bending; at higher intensities, paralysis is observed (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Video 4</xref>); and &#x0201c;P1-GAL4,&#x0201d; a split-GAL4<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> driver generated from parental GAL4 lines<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> identified in a behavioral screen (E.D.H. and D.J.A., unpublished), that is specifically expressed in &#x0223c;16&#x02013;20 male-specific P1 neurons, activation of which elicits wing extension in males in the absence of females<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. To facilitate the control and monitoring of light-induced behaviors in freely moving adult flies in a high-throughput, cost-effective and flexible manner, we developed a high power LED-based activation system (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a&#x02013;c</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a&#x02013;e, Table 2</xref>, Software and Online Methods).</p><p id="P11">Strikingly, among all 5 opsins tested using these CNS drivers, ReaChR was the only one whose activation yielded robust behavioral phenotypes in a light-dependent manner (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The evoked behaviors were not due to innate responses to light, because control flies lacking <italic>UAS-ReaChR</italic> did not exhibit them in response to all the wavelengths tested (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The fact that blue-light activated opsins yielded a behavioral response (PER) when expressed in GRNs, but not in the CNS neurons tested here, likely reflects the fact that the peripheral GRNs are located close to the cuticle, where blue light may penetrate more easily. Analysis of C1V1(T/T) expression in CNS neurons revealed that this opsin is expressed weakly in cell somata and not trafficked to arborizations, while ReaChR is strongly expressed in somata and trafficked to arborizations as well (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). This difference likely accounts for the different efficacies of the two red-shifted opsins in this system.</p><p id="P12">The peak of the ReaChR action spectrum (measured in cultured hippocampal neurons) is &#x0223c;590 nm<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The efficacy of ReaChR activation by different wavelengths in freely behaving flies will, however, reflect a combination of factors including cuticular penetration and intensity, as well as proximity to peak sensitivity. To empirically determine the optimal wavelength of light for behavioral assays, therefore, we compared the ability of blue (470 nm), green (530 nm), amber (590 nm) and red (627 nm) light to induce behavior in flies expressing ReaChR under the control of different CNS GAL4 drivers. When not normalized for intensity, green LEDs had the strongest capacity to elicit ReaChR-dependent behaviors (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, f, g</xref>). In some cases (pIP10 neurons; see below), robust behavioral responses were detected only using green light, and hardly at all using other wavelengths. Although amber light is closest to the peak of the ReaChR action spectrum, commercial LEDs of this wavelength are dimmer than the others and therefore did not elicit strong behavioral responses (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f, g</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Although TrpA1-mediated activation of P1 neurons can elicit wing extension<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, in our direct comparison the fraction of solitary male flies showing a wing extension phenotype was much higher using ReaChR and green light, than using TrpA1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). This suggests that the intensity of activation obtained using ReaChR (and green light) can be substantially stronger than that achieved using dTrpA1, without subjecting flies to the high temperatures necessary to activate the latter. Nevertheless, although green LEDs elicited the strongest behavioral responses, flies can see this wavelength, whereas their sensitivity to wavelengths &#x0003e; 620 nm is much lower <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> (see, however, Hanai (2008)<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>). Therefore we used red LEDs whenever possible to avoid behavioral artifacts caused by strong visual stimulation.</p><p id="P14">To investigate whether the strength of a given ReaChR-dependent behavioral phenotype can be quantitatively tuned, we tested multiple frequencies and intensities of light pulses using the P1-GAL4 driver (pulse width: 5 msec). There was a frequency-dependent increase in the fraction of flies showing wing extension, as well as in the average number and duration of wing extension bouts per fly (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>), even when correcting for the total duration of illumination (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). The HB9 and Fru-GAL4 drivers also yielded an increase in the fraction of flies showing the respective behavioral responses as the intensity was increased, albeit over different ranges (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f, g</xref>). Together, these data indicate that ReaChR can be used to tune behavioral phenotypes by varying the light intensity and/or pulse frequency, over a relatively broad dynamic range.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Probabilistic vs. deterministic control of wing extension</title><p id="P15">Previous studies of the neural circuitry underlying male courtship behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have used neuronal activation methods, including P2X2 and TrpA1, to identify different neuronal subclasses that control courtship song<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. In particular, studies using TrpA1 have described two neuronal classes in the central brain controlling this behavior: one, called P1 or pMP4, constitutes a population of interneurons<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, while the other, called pIP10, constitutes a small group of descending neurons that project to the ventral nerve cord (VNC)<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). The pre-synaptic terminals of P1 neurons overlap the dendrites of pIP10 neurons, suggesting that they may be synaptic partners<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>; however the difference, if any, between the roles of these neurons in controlling courtship song has not been apparent, as similar behaviors are evoked by TrpA1-mediated stimulation of both classes<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">We exploited the time-resolved control of neuronal activation afforded by ReaChR to compare the temporal patterns of stimulation-evoked behavioral responses in P1 vs. pIP10 neurons. To express ReaChR in the latter cells, we used an intersectional strategy combining a specific GAL4 line (VT40556<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>) with <italic>fru</italic>-FLP<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and a <italic>UAS&#x0003e;STOP&#x0003e;ReaChR</italic> transgene (where &#x0201c;&#x0003e;&#x0201d; denotes FRT sites, the target of FLP recombinase; see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b, c and Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Anatomical analysis using a citrine reporter fused to the C-terminus of ReaChR confirmed the restricted expression of ReaChR in flies of the appropriate intersectional genotype (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Surprisingly, we found that the temporal dynamics of wing extension evoked by activation of P1 vs. pIP10 neurons were strikingly different. ReaChR-mediated activation of P1 neurons evoked wing extension in a probabilistic or stochastic manner: the initiation of wing extension was not time-locked to the onset of illumination, but rather occurred with variable latencies throughout the stimulation period (17.7 &#x000b1; 27.5 sec) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, c</xref>). The average duration of each bout was short (0.99 &#x000b1; 0.48 sec) relative to the duration of photostimulation (30 sec). Finally, the offset of the behavior was not time-locked to the offset of stimulation; rather, we observed persistent wing extension bouts in the intervals between photostimulation trials (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, e</xref>: Pearson's correlation coefficient between stimulation pattern and behavioral response: <italic>r</italic> = 0.004).</p><p id="P18">In contrast to the results observed with P1 neurons, activation of pIP10 neurons triggered robust wing extension in a deterministic manner (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The onset of the behavior was strongly time-locked to the onset of stimulation, with a very short latency (0.08 &#x000b1; 0.04 sec) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, c</xref>). Once initiated, wing extension continued throughout the photostimulation period, and co-terminated, with few exceptions, with the offset of photostimulation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, d</xref>: Pearson's correlation coefficient between stimulation pattern and behavioral response: <italic>r</italic> = 0.993). With weaker intensities of illumination close to threshold (&#x02264; 0.012 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), wing extension responses were less efficiently evoked, but responses were still restricted to the photostimulation period and no persistent behavior between trials was observed (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P19">These differences between P1 and pIP10 neurons in the temporal dynamics of ReaChR activation-evoked wing extensions do not reflect a higher sensitivity of pIP10 than P1 neurons, because the intensity dependence of pIP10-evoked wing extension by green light was almost identical to that of P1 neurons (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). Moreover, these properties were largely independent of illumination intensity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4a&#x02013;c</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5a&#x02013;c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Social isolation modulates ReaChR-activated wing extension</title><p id="P20">The probabilistic or biasing nature of the wing extension responses elicited by ReaChR-mediated activation of P1 neurons suggested that these neurons might encode, or be modified by, state-dependent influences on male courtship behavior. Interestingly, social isolation of male flies for more than several days enhances courtship behavior, including singing, towards females<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. To investigate whether P1 neurons might be modulated by such experience, we first determined whether social isolation lowers the threshold for eliciting wing extension using ReaChR-mediated stimulation of these neurons. Indeed, the intensity of red light that evoked wing extension in 50 % of flies expressing ReaChR in P1 neurons was lower in males that were socially isolated for 7 days, than in group-housed males (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>). A similar effect was observed using green light as well (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). For each of 3 different parameters measured, socially isolated flies exhibited significantly higher values than group housed flies (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Thus, social isolation effectively &#x0201c;tuned&#x0201d; the response to ReaChR activation of P1 neurons, such that the probability of a wing extension response was increased. These data suggest that the increased sensitivity to ReaChR activation of wing extension occurs in P1 neurons themselves, or in a functionally downstream population.</p><p id="P21">Because pIP10 neurons are thought to be functionally &#x0201c;downstream&#x0201d; of P1 neurons<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), we investigated whether ReaChR activation of wing extension via these descending neurons was also sensitive to social experience. Because red light was not strong enough to activate wing extension in male flies expressing ReaChR in pIP10 neurons, we used green light to trigger wing extension. Activation of pIP10 neurons using ReaChR did not reveal any differences between single vs. group-housed flies in the efficiency with which photostimulation evoked wing extension behavior, even at lower intensities that evoked responses in only a subset of flies (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a&#x02013;c</xref>). These data indicate that the enhanced sensitivity of ReaChR-evoked wing extension in single-housed flies using the P1-GAL4 driver is likely to occur in P1 neurons themselves (or in other downstream neurons), rather than in pIP10 neurons. They also indicate that the sensitization of the P1 response by social isolation does not reflect a general increase in sensitivity among all neurons involved in wing extension behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Functional calcium imaging combined with ReaChR activation</title><p id="P22">To examine directly whether social isolation enhances the sensitivity of P1 neurons to ReaChR activation, we performed calcium imaging experiments using laser-scanning 2-photon microscopy, taking advantage of the relative separation of the action spectrum peaks for ReaChR and GCaMP3.0<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Importantly, co-expression of GCaMP3.0 in P1 neurons together with ReaChR did not diminish the ability of the latter to mediate light-evoked wing extension in freely moving flies, indicating that the calcium buffering effect of GCaMP3.0 does not interfere with this behavior (data not shown).</p><p id="P23">An amber LED (590 nm) was used for photostimulation during imaging experiments in order to maximize overlap with the peak of the ReaChR action spectrum. Excitation scanning caused an initial increase in baseline GCaMP3.0 fluorescence in flies co-expressing ReaChR in P1 neurons, even in the absence of amber light excitation of ReaChR (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). These increases were not observed in flies lacking <italic>UAS-ReaChR</italic> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) implying that they reflect cross-activation of ReaChR by the GCaMP3.0 excitation beam (925 nm). Nevertheless, amber light still evoked a clear increase in the strength of GCaMP3.0 emissions over this background (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Using these conditions, we compared the GCaMP3.0 response of P1 neurons to ReaChR activation of these same neurons, between single-housed (SH) vs. grouped-housed (GH) flies. P1 neurons in SH flies showed larger ReaChR-evoked calcium influxes than did those in GH flies (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b, c</xref>). Quantitative analysis of ReaChR-citrine expression in these cells indicated that this difference was not due to higher levels of P1-GAL4 expression in SH vs. GH flies (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). Together, these combined behavioral and imaging experiments suggest that the excitability of P1 neurons can be modulated by prior social experience. Attempts to monitor calcium transients in pIP10 neurons were precluded by the complex expression pattern and low level of GCaMP3 expression driven by this GAL4 line.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Here we describe a system for optogenetic activation of behavior in freely moving adult flies using ReaChR, a newly described red-shifted opsin<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref> for discussion why ReaChR is more effective than other channelrhodopsins tested). The strength of activation obtained using ReaChR, and the broad dynamic range of intensities and frequencies over which stimulation can be delivered, offer a more quantitative and temporally controlled approach to investigating the neuronal control of behavior than is provided by available thermogenetic tools (but see ref<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>). The use of ReaChR with red light also reduces the confounding influence of strong visual stimulation that occurs when using blue light-activated opsins or the temperature increases required by thermogenetic effectors. Finally, the ability to control activation using LEDs, rather than lasers<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, permits a relatively inexpensive approach to large-scale, high-throughput screening of behaviors.</p><p id="P26">Using ReaChR to monitor both behavioral sensitivity and neuronal activation, we discovered that 1) P1 and pIP10 neurons control male courtship song in a state-like (probabilistic and persistent) vs. command-like (deterministic and time-locked) manner, respectively; and 2) the effect of social isolation to increase male courtship behavior is mediated, at least in part, through an increase in the excitability of P1 neurons (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). It has been proposed, based on anatomical data, that P1 neurons are part of a circuit integrating multimodal sensory cues that control courtship behavior<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Our observations suggest that P1 neurons also integrate this information with the flies' history of social experience, in a manner that influences the probability that the flies will exhibit courtship behavior.

Interestingly, we did not observe any evidence of persistent calcium transients in P1 neurons after photoactivation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>), implying that the persistent wing extension triggered by P1 activation is mediated by other neurons.

Briefly, the fly was mounted and immobilized for recording by inserting a pulled glass capillary (BF150-86-10, Sutter instruments) from the dorsal surface of the thorax to the tip of the labellum, passing through the cervical connective and the head. The mounting glass capillary was filled with recording solution (7.5 g/L NaCl, 0.35 g/L KCl, 0.279 g/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;2H<sub>2</sub>O and 11.915 g/L HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich)) and served as a ground electrode. Another glass capillary, pulled to a tip diameter of 10 to 20 micrometers and filled with 30 mM tri-choline chloride (TCC; Sigma-Aldrich), as an electrolyte, was used for recording the electrophysiological responses of the gustatory neurons innervating this sensillum. All the recordings were obtained from L7 sensilla. The recordings were made using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier and Digidata 1440A A/D converter (Molecular Devices). The recorded data was sampled at a rate of 10 kHz, filtered (band pass filter between 100 Hz and 3 kHz) and stored on a PC hard drive using Clampex 10 software (Molecular Devices). The data were analyzed by sorting the action potentials and measuring their frequency within the indicated time windows using Clampfit software (Molecular Devices).</p><p id="P56">For PER activation experiments, a high power amber LED (590 nm) collimated with an optic fiber (M590F1, Thorlab) was used as a light source to activate ReaChR. To deliver light to the labellum a 200 &#x003bc;m core multimode optic fiber with bare end (N.A. 0.39) (Thorlab) was used. The distance of optic fiber from the labellum was set to be 540 &#x003bc;m using a micrometer. The estimated light intensity at the labellum was approximately 1.0 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="P57">To activate TrpA1 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>), a custom-made heat source was used. In brief, the heat source is a small piece of thermistor (2K Bead Thermistor, Fenwal), which emits heat in proportion to the electrical current passed through it. The distance of the heat source from the labellum was set to be 540 &#x003bc;m using micrometer. The temperature at this distance was measured using a thermocouple (Omega) (top panel in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S23"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS541959-supplement-1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1210" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS541959-supplement-2.txt" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1214" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>3</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS541959-supplement-3.mov" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1218" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>4</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS541959-supplement-4.mov" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1222" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>5</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS541959-supplement-5.mov" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1226" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>6</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS541959-supplement-6.mov" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1230" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>7</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS541959-supplement-7.mov" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e1234" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><p>We thank K.
