SA plays important roles in responses to stress conditions in plants. Many studies have suggested that the function of plant ICSs is regulated at the transcriptional level. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the expression of <italic>AtICS1</italic> is induced by stress conditions in parallel with SA synthesis, and <italic>AtICS1</italic> is required for SA synthesis. In contrast, the expression of <italic>NtICS</italic> is not induced when SA synthesis is activated in tobacco, and it is unlikely to be involved in SA synthesis. Studies on the biochemical properties of plant ICSs are limited, compared with those on transcriptional regulation. We analyzed the biochemical properties of four plant ICSs: AtICS1, NtICS, NbICS from <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, and OsICS from rice. Multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed that their primary structures were well conserved, and predicted key residues for ICS activity were almost completely conserved. However, AtICS1 showed much higher activity than the other ICSs when expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. Moreover, the levels of AtICS1 protein expression in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves were higher than the other ICSs. Construction and analysis of chimeras between AtICS1 and OsICS revealed that the putative chloroplast transit peptides (TPs) significantly affected the levels of protein accumulation in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. Chimeric and point-mutation analyses revealed that Thr<sup>531</sup>, Ser<sup>537</sup>, and Ile<sup>550</sup> of AtICS1 are essential for its high activity. These distinct biochemical properties of plant ICSs may suggest different roles in their respective plant species.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>isochorismate synthase</kwd><kwd>salicylic acid</kwd><kwd>resistance</kwd><kwd>phytopathology</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chorismate, a product of the shikimate pathway, is a common intermediate for the biosynthesis of primary and secondary metabolites in plants and microorganisms [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Various types of enzymes use chorismate as a substrate and convert it into other compounds, and the reactions are often important steps toward the production of specific metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Amongst chorismate-utilizing enzymes, anthranilate synthase, isochorismate synthase (ICS), and salicylate synthase (SAS) evolutionally originate from a common ancestor because their overall tertiary structures are highly conserved [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and they have been grouped together as the MST (menaquinone, siderophore, and tryptophan) superfamily. ICS reversibly converts chorismate into isochorismate in an Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. In bacteria, isochorismate is a precursor of siderophores, low molecular weight Fe<sup>3+</sup> chelators, and menaquinones, electron acceptors. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has two <italic>ICS</italic> genes, <italic>EntC</italic> and <italic>MenF</italic>, which are associated with the production of siderophores and menaquinones, respectively [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In siderophore production, isochorismate is converted into salicylic acid (SA) or 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), which are incorporated into the siderophores. For example, isochorismate pyruvate lyase (IPL), encoded by <italic>PchB</italic>, converts isochorismate into SA in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], whereas isochorismatase and 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase, encoded by <italic>EntB</italic> and <italic>EntA</italic>, respectively, successively convert isochorismate into DHBA in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, bifunctional SAS encoded by <italic>Irp9</italic> successively converts chorismate into SA via isochorismate in <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Metabolism of chorismate in plants and microorganisms</title><p>Chorismate is a branch-point compound for the production of primary and secondary compounds such as aromatic amino acids and vitamins.

Phylloquinone functions as an electron acceptor in the photosystem I complex, and it is also essential for human health [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similar to bacteria, isochorismate is also a precursor of SA and DHBA in some plant species [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; however, incorporation of SA or DHBA into siderophores has not been reported currently. In plants, SA functions as a signaling molecule to induce responses against various forms of environmental stress, and its biosynthesis is activated in response to stress in many plant species [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although the biosynthesis pathways of SA in plants are still unclear, ICS plays an important role in the production of SA in some plant species. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, two genes (<italic>AtICS1</italic> and <italic>AtICS2</italic>) encode ICS, and <italic>AtICS1</italic> plays a key role in stress-induced SA production. In response to pathogen inoculation or ozone exposure, the levels of <italic>AtICS1</italic> transcripts and SA increase in parallel, and <italic>AtICS1</italic> is required for this SA synthesis [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>AtICS1</italic> transcription is also subjected to positive regulation by SA [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the other hand, the expression of <italic>AtICS2</italic> is not associated with SA synthesis [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and it is not required for SA production induced by UV irradiation [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similar to <italic>AtICS1</italic>, a <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana ICS</italic> gene (<italic>NbICS</italic>) is transcriptionally induced by a pathogen elicitor [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and is required for SA production induced by biotic and abiotic stress conditions [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, ICS in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>; <italic>NtICS</italic>) is unlikely to be involved in stress-induced SA production. The transcript levels of <italic>NtICS</italic> were not increased, and ICS activity was not detected after the activation of SA production by tobacco mosaic virus inoculation or ozone exposure [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Instead, the phenylpropanoid pathway initiated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase was activated and SA was produced in such stress conditions [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref>]. These studies suggested that the function of plant ICSs is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level. One interesting feature of SA is that its basal concentrations differ depending on the plant species. For example, rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) constitutively contains two to three orders of magnitude higher levels of SA than <italic>Arabidopsis, N. benthamiana</italic>, and tobacco [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although the involvement of rice ICS (OsICS) in SA synthesis is unclear, if such higher levels of SA production are catalyzed by OsICS, its activity might be much higher than AtICS1, NbICS, and NtICS.</p><p>The biochemical properties of bacterial ICSs have been studied extensively. For example, the tertiary structures of EntC and MenF have been determined, and many amino acid residues essential or important for ICS activity have been identified [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, reports on the biochemical analysis of plant ICSs are limited to that of <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> (CrICS) purified from elicited cell cultures [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and those of AtICS1 and AtICS2 expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> showed very similar catalytic characteristics [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the present study, we analyzed and compared the biochemical properties of AtICS1, NtICS, NbICS, and OsICS expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves. Although their primary structures are similar and most key amino acid residues are conserved, the ICS activities of NtICS, NbICS, and OsICS were much lower than that of AtICS1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in planta</italic>. The molecular mechanisms underlying differences in the ICS activities were investigated and discussed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Molecular cloning of the coding sequences of <italic>AtICS1, NtICS, NbICS</italic>, and <italic>OsICS</italic></title><p>To amplify the coding sequences, primers corresponding to the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends of the coding sequences were designed based on the sequences in the databases (<italic>AtICS1</italic>, AY056055, and <italic>OsICS</italic>, AK120689).

The nucleotide sequence of one variant was identical with that of AK120689, but, compared with the other plant ICSs, it contained a 4-nt deletion, which resulted in the generation of a premature stop codon. However, the other variant did not contain this deletion. Because the variant with the 4-nt deletion was very rare, we used the variant without the deletion as <italic>OsICS</italic>.

The remaining two amino acid residues were phenylalanine in EntC, but were tyrosine (496th and 528th amino acids of AtICS1) in all the plant ICSs shown here. Similarly, amongst six amino acid residues required for anthranilate synthase activity in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> TrpE [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], five were completely conserved in all the plant ICSs shown here, except for Glu<sup>412</sup> of OsICS, which was aspartic acid in TrpE. The remaining amino acid, threonine in TrpE, was alanine (472nd amino acid of AtICS1) in all the analyzed ICSs. The conservation of the overall structures and key amino acid residues suggested that <italic>NtICS, NbICS</italic>, and <italic>OsICS</italic> encode ICS proteins similar to <italic>AtICS1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Comparison of the ICS activity of the recombinant proteins expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>To compare the ICS activity of NtICS, NbICS, and OsICS with that of AtICS1, their recombinant proteins without putative TPs were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> as N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tagged proteins.

Therefore, recombinant proteins of plant ICSs and EntC with three FLAG tags at their C-terminus were expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves by agroinfiltration. In plants, ICS functions in the chloroplast, so TP<sup>SS</sup> was introduced into the N-terminus of EntC. Immunoblotting analyses with an anti-FLAG antibody confirmed the production of all the proteins, but their levels and band patterns differed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). EntC was detected as two major and several minor bands. The migration of two major bands (46.8 and 42.2 kDa) corresponded well with the predicted molecular mass of EntC with (47.3 kDa) and without the TP (41.6 kDa). Because EntC was fused to a heterologous chloroplast TP, it may not have been cleaved efficiently. Plant ICSs, except for OsICS, were detected as a single major band with a good correlation with the predicted molecular masses of the mature proteins. OsICS was detected as three bands with distinct intensities. From the migration of the middle (66.2 kDa) and lower bands (57.0 kDa) on the gel, they seemed to be pre-protein and mature forms of the protein (predicted to be 63.1 and 58.3 kDa, respectively). However, in subsequent experiments, it was suggested that the middle band corresponded to the mature protein, and the upper band was likely to be the pre-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The faint, lower band could be a degradation product of OsICS. The levels of EntC and AtICS1 were higher than those of NtICS, NbICS, and OsICS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). ICS activity was measured using the crude protein fractions. Again, AtICS1 and EntC showed ICS activity, but NtICS, NbICS, and OsICS showed little activity, which was not significantly different from the empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Comparison of ICSs expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> cells (A<sub>600</sub> = 0.1) carrying each ICS with three FLAG tags at the C-terminus were infiltrated into the leaves of <italic>N. benthamiana.

Because isochorismate is a precursor of phylloquinone, which is required for the function of the photosystem I complex, all green plants are thought to have ICS activity. These results suggested that NtICS, NbICS, and OsICS have activity in plant cells, but they are rapidly inactivated after extraction from the cells. Therefore, we tried to measure their ICS activity <italic>in planta</italic>. Because isochorismate is unstable and converted into other metabolites such as phylloquinone, it is difficult to measure <italic>in planta</italic> ICS activity by quantitating the levels of isochorismate in plant cells. In contrast with isochorismate, SA is stored in the form of SA-glucoside in plant cells for a long time. It has been reported that an artificial SAS can be created by fusing ICS with IPL, and overexpression of the artificial SAS resulted in the accumulation of SA [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We applied this artificial SAS system to measure the <italic>in planta</italic> ICS activity. IPL encoded by <italic>PmsB</italic> of <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was fused to the N-terminus of each ICS without a putative chloroplast TP, resulting in IPL<sup>PmsB</sup>-ICS&#x00394;TP. Because chorismate is produced in chloroplasts, TP<sup>SS</sup> was introduced at the N-terminus of fusion proteins, resulting in TP<sup>SS</sup>-IPL<sup>PmsB</sup>-ICS&#x00394;TP. The artificial SASs (TP<sup>SS</sup>-IPL<sup>PmsB</sup>-ICS&#x00394;TP) were expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves by agroinfiltration, and the levels of SA produced were measured 2 days later. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, the expression of artificial SASs containing EntC or AtICS1 resulted in higher levels of SA accumulation. In contrast, the expression of artificial SASs containing NtICS, NbICS, or OsICS led to very low levels of SA accumulation, which were not significantly different from those with TP<sup>SS</sup>-IPL<sup>PmsB</sup> alone. This result suggested that NtICS, NbICS, and OsICS showed little ICS activity even in plant cells; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that these proteins were inactivated by the fusion with TP<sup>SS</sup>-IPL<sup>PmsB</sup>. As a next attempt, ICSs were expressed with TP<sup>SS</sup>-IPL<sup>PmsB</sup>. This method has several disadvantages. First, isochorismate produced by ICS can be used not only by IPL but also by other enzymes. Second, if ICS activity is higher than IPL activity, only part of the isochorismate will be converted into SA. These factors may have led to an underestimation of ICS activity. Third, as shown later, TPs affected the levels of protein accumulation <italic>in planta</italic>. To overcome these difficulties, <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> cells carrying ICS were mixed with excess amounts of those carrying TP<sup>SS</sup>-IPL<sup>PmsB</sup>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B. When ICS and IPL were expressed at a ratio of 1 to 99, EntC and AtICS1 showed ICS activity, whereas the others showed little activity, which is not significantly different from that of TP<sup>SS</sup>-IPL<sup>PmsB</sup> alone. Unlike the results obtained using the artificial SAS assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), EntC and AtICS1 showed similar levels of activity. This difference suggested that the conversion of isochorismate into SA by IPL was rate-limiting even in these conditions, and ICS activity of EntC, and likely that of AtICS1, is underestimated. To increase the sensitivity of the assay, the ratio of ICS to IPL was changed to 1 to 19. In these conditions, the expression of NtICS or NbICS with IPL resulted in significant increases in the levels of SA, indicating that they had ICS activity. In contrast, the expression of OsICS with IPL did not increase the levels of SA, even when proportion of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> cells carrying OsICS was increased up to 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C).</p><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Comparison of ICSs <italic>in planta</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> cells (A<sub>600</sub> = 0.1) carrying each artificial SAS construct (TP<sup>SS</sup>-IPL<sup>PmsB</sup>-ICS&#x00394;TP) were infiltrated into the leaves of <italic>N. benthamiana.

In the present study, we showed that AtICS1 has much higher ICS activity than NtICS, NbICS, and OsICS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), and its chloroplast TP has the ability to increase the accumulation of attached proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). These biochemical properties of AtICS1 and the fact that the expression of <italic>AtICS1</italic> was strongly induced when the biosynthesis of SA is activated [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] matched well with its role in SA production in response to environmental stress. To cope with stress, especially to fight pathogens, it is important to induce stress responses by producing SA rapidly. In contrast, NtICS is unlikely to be involved in stress-induced SA production, because it showed much lower ICS activity than that of AtICS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), and its expression was not induced after the activation of SA synthesis by stress treatment [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Rice constitutively contains much higher levels of SA than <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but the ICS activity of OsICS was much lower than AtICS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Considering that rice contains only a single <italic>ICS</italic> gene, SA could be produced through an ICS-independent pathway in rice. Consistent with our hypothesis, a recent report showed that 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in &#x003b2;-oxidation, is involved in SA production in rice roots [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The result that the ICS activity of NbICS was similar to that of NtICS and OsICS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) was inconsistent with its role. Similar to AtICS1, NbICS is required for SA synthesis induced by biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and its expression is increased by INF1, an elicitor protein secreted by <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. On the other hand, it was consistent with the fact that the primary amino acid sequence of NbICS is quite similar to that of NtICS, with approximately 95% identity (Supplementary Figure S1). This inconsistency prompted us to analyze the expression pattern of <italic>NbICS</italic>, and we found that, in our reverse-transcription quantitative PCR analysis, <italic>NbICS</italic> was not induced by INF1<sup>*</sup>. Although the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, the lack of a mock treatment in Shibata et al. 2010 [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] might be one reason. Moreover, a recent report showed that the expression of two ICS genes is not induced, but rather suppressed after the activation of SA synthesis in soybean, but their suppression by virus-induced gene silencing compromises SA accumulation induced by pathogen inoculation [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Because isochorismate is a precursor of phylloquinone, a component of the photosystem I complex, severe suppression of ICS caused several developmental defects, as observed in the double mutant of AtICS1 and AtICS2 [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and in an <italic>NbICS</italic>-silenced plants [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

First, putative chloroplast TPs were shown to determine the levels of protein accumulation in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). TP<sup>AtICS1</sup> increased the protein levels of several ICSs, and its effect on the levels of OsICS accumulation was similar to that of TP<sup>SS</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B,C). The TP of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase small subunit proteins has been used to increase the levels of foreign protein accumulation in transgenic plants [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although the effect of TP<sup>AtICS1</sup> on proteins other than ICS has not been tested, it might be an attractive alternative to the TP of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase small subunit proteins. Second, three amino acid residues (Thr<sup>531</sup>, Ser<sup>537</sup>, and Ile<sup>550</sup>) located in the C-terminal region of AtICS1 were required for its ICS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C).

The structural model of AtICS1 suggest that Thr<sup>531</sup>, Ser<sup>537</sup>, and Ile<sup>550</sup> are close to the active site with the product isochorismate and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A). The Thr<sup>531</sup> residue forms hydrogen bonds with Glu<sup>542</sup> and Tyr<sup>296</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B), suggesting that the T531A mutation caused the loss of the two hydrogen bonds and destabilized the structures around it. The Ser<sup>537</sup> residue is located in a loop near the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B), implying that the S537T mutation caused destabilization of the loop and decreased the activity. In addition, the Ile<sup>550</sup> residue contributes to hydrophobic interactions with Leu<sup>526</sup> and Phe<sup>553</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). The I550A mutation reduced the hydrophobic interactions and destabilized the structure in the &#x003b1;-helix around the active site. Therefore, these mutations have serious consequences for the ICS activity of AtICS1. All three amino acid residues are conserved in AtICS2 which shows near-identical enzymological properties with AtICS1 [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], whereas Ile<sup>550</sup> is replaced with threonine in NtICS and NbICS (Supplementary Figure S1), suggesting that Ile<sup>550</sup> is responsible for the differences in the activity of AtICS1, NtICS, and NbICS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Third, these three amino acid residues are involved in the activity of AtICS1, but they are not sufficient to explain the difference in activity between AtICS1 and OsICS. Little ICS activity was detected with the OsICS mutant in which the three amino acid residues (Ala<sup>536</sup>, Thr<sup>542</sup>, and Ala<sup>555</sup>) were replaced with the corresponding ones from AtICS1 (Thr<sup>531</sup>, Ser<sup>537</sup>, and Ile<sup>550</sup>)<sup>*</sup>, suggesting that amino acid residues in other regions are also involved in the differences between the activities of AtICS1 and OsICS. Identification of such regions and residues should be a subject of subsequent analyses. To further understand the structural mechanisms underlying the differences between AtICS1 and OsICS, it will be required to determine their tertiary structures in a future analysis because no structural data for plant ICSs has yet been reported.</p><fig id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Tertiary structure model of AtICS1 predicted by homology modeling</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representation of the structure model of the chorismate-binding domain (279-558) of AtICS1.

For example, AtICS1 and AtICS2 show near-identical enzymological properties [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but the transcript levels of <italic>AtICS1</italic>, but not <italic>AtICS2</italic>, are increased by stress conditions, and <italic>AtICS1</italic> is mainly required for the accumulation of SA induced by stress conditions [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Populus has a single <italic>ICS</italic> gene, which undergoes extensive alternative splicing, and the majority of the alternative transcripts encode nonfunctional proteins due to premature stop codons or multiexon skipping [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this study, however, we revealed that plant ICSs show quite distinct biochemical properties despite their sequence similarities. These differences in transcriptional regulation and biochemical properties of plant ICSs may reflect their roles in primary (e.g. phylloquinone) and secondary (e.g. SA) metabolite production in their respective plant species.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec5"><title>Supporting information</title><fig id="F9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><media mimetype="pdf" xlink:href="bsr20171457_Supp1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1798" position="anchor"/></fig></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="footnotes"><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>S.
