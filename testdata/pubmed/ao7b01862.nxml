crystals are encountered in a variety of energy-harvesting
applications, where they serve as waveguides or filters for electromagnetic
and electro-optic energy. Techniques such as electric or magnetic
assembly are used to assemble colloidal crystals, but are limited
by crystal size, yield, and throughput. This article demonstrates
the continuous, high-throughput assembly of two-dimensional (2D)-colloidal
crystals in an acoustofluidic flow cell. The device is fabricated
using off-the-shelf components and does not require a clean-room access.
An experimental state diagram shows how the fluid flow rate and voltage
applied to the piezoelectric element in our device can tune the crystal
microstructure. Highly ordered colloidal crystals are continuously
assembled in less than a minute with a throughput yield of several
hundred particles per minute using this device. The acoustically assembled
ordered 2D crystals are immobilized using a UV-curable resin and extracted
as ordered polymer&#x02013;particle fibers, demonstrating the ability
of using acoustic fields to assemble ordered structures embedded in
bulk materials. Particle tracking is used to construct the cross-channel
particle distribution to understand the effect of acoustic compression
on colloidal crystal assembly. Microparticle image velocimetry data
is compared to a theoretical transport model to quantify the effect
fluid flow and acoustic trapping has on the colloidal crystal ensemble.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao7b01862</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao-2017-018629</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Manufacturing defect-free

using individual colloidal particles as building blocks is a bottom-up
manufacturing process, where colloids form ordered microstructures
in the presence of an externally applied field (e.g., electric,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> magnetic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> and acoustic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup>). External fields offer a pathway toward mediating self-assembly
due to short assembly time scales and controllability. Externally
driven self-assembly processes can form single crystals in a short
span of time,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> typically ranging from
a few seconds to a few hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Particles
can be controlled and positioned individually using feedback methods
or annealing techniques, allowing for external control of crystal
growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> However, the assembly is conducted in small
batches with limited material throughput,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> making it
difficult to produce bulk materials at the scale required for many
applications. Producing ordered materials in bulk using batch production
increases the manufacturing time and complexity of production, as
materials are processed in small batches and then assembled separately
to form bulk materials. External fields require specific material
properties (e.g., dielectric, ferro- or paramagnetic) to drive the
assembly of sedimented microparticles in solution to form two-dimensional
(2D) ordered structures. Many of the external field techniques require
photolithography to fabricate electrodes to generate the required
external field patterns, which increases cost and device complexity
due to the clean-room operations and expensive equipment required
for lithography techniques and to conduct the experiment.</p><p>In
comparison to other directed techniques, acoustically driven
self-assembly can be done on a variety of materials, as sound waves
exert a mechanical force on the particles and do not require specific
electrical, magnetic, or chemical material properties. An acoustically
driven system only requires a difference in density and material compressibility
between the colloidal particles and solution to drive assembly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Complex microstructures can be obtained using acoustic wave interference
that can be created using off-the-shelf piezoelectric elements, eliminating

irrespective of the geometry of the experimental assembly chamber
or electrodes. Hence, an acoustically directed assembly does not require
electrodes with complex geometries for assembly, eliminating the need
for complex photolithography equipment and clean-room settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Acoustically driven assembly can be done using
off-the-shelf devices, making the process affordable and accessible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> Acoustic fields act over large areas (&#x0223c;1000

a continuous, high-throughput process for
producing ordered 2D colloidal crystal structures using acoustofluidic
self-assembly of microparticles, using off-the-shelf components, without
the need to access a clean room. Fifteen micrometer, non-Brownian
polystyrene microparticles dispersed in water are continuously introduced
to a glass capillary microfluidic flow cell with a syringe pump. A
piezoelectric element attached to the side of the capillary generates
an acoustic standing wave inside the microfluidic flow cell. We image
the particles at approximately 20 mm from the inlet, by which point
sedimentation has caused the particles to settle on the bottom of
the capillary. The acoustic standing wave drives sedimented microparticles
to assemble at acoustic nodes. Acoustofluidic devices based on glass
capillaries have been used to trap Brownian particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> (&#x0223c;6 &#x003bc;m) and nanoparticles down to 500 nm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup></p><p>An experimental state diagram shows the
effect that the fluid flow
rate and applied acoustic pressure have on the assembled microstructure.
Highly ordered, continuous crystals observed to assemble in less than
a minute with a yield throughput rate of several hundred particles
per minute were observed under various pressures and flow rates. Finally,
the ability to fabricate a bulk material using an acoustically directed
assembly is demonstrated by freezing the acoustically assembled particles
in a UV-curable resin continuously through the acoustic cell to form
ordered microparticle&#x02013;polymer threadlike structures.</p><p>Particle tracking software is used to identify the location of
microparticles assembled in ordered structures. This data is used
as part of a cross-channel distribution analysis to understand the
compressive influence that the acoustic pressure has on the observed
structures. The flow cell throughput is quantified using the microparticle
image velocimetry (PIV) analysis of optical video microscopy data.
The degree of order within the assembled structures is quantified
by calculating the experimental order parameter and comparing the
number of nearest neighbors to theoretical expectations for an ideal
ordered structure.</p><p>The approach described in the article can
be used to support materials
applications for non-Brownian microparticles. Microparticles on the
15 &#x003bc;m diameter scale can influence the optical transmission
of white light as long as the particles themselves are part of a superassembly
(i.e., composed of other, smaller particles).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> The use of larger particles also offers the possibility of manipulating
longer wavelength electromagnetic energy (e.g., near IR emissions),
which can only be done by fabricating inverse opal structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> This is a challenge due to the fast sedimentation
times associated with large diameter colloids. Assembled non-Brownian
microparticles are used as a scaffold support material to fabricate
immunoassays for the detection of biological molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> Non-Brownian microparticles can act as filler
material for polymer composites for enhancing mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> The mechanical properties can be tuned over
a wide range of Young&#x02019;s modulus if the particles are internally
ordered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup></p><p>Unlike previous demonstrations

per minute. The flow-through reactor configuration of our microfluidic
cell lends itself well to additive manufacturing and rapid prototyping
platforms, leading to an increase in throughput, material yield, reduced
operating costs, and improved production time. Future work will focus
on mitigating defects in assembled structures and applying this platform
to additive manufacturing of polymer&#x02013;particle composites, where

is primarily convection driven as opposed to Brownian motion. As the
applied voltage increases, the increasing acoustic pressure on the
colloidal particles induces hexagonal close-packing. Particles form
crystals but have line and point defects in the 1 mL/h case when voltage
is applied at 60 V<sub>pp</sub>. At 80 V<sub>pp</sub> and 1 mL/h,
we observe the formation of a colloidal crystal with less defects,
as shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.7b01862/suppl_file/ao7b01862_si_002.avi">Movie 1</ext-link>, Supporting Information.
Increasing the voltage to 99 V<sub>pp</sub> resulted in an ordered
crystal that was acoustically trapped at the node. The crystal did
not flow as seen in the 60 and the 80 V<sub>pp</sub> cases, as shown
in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.7b01862/suppl_file/ao7b01862_si_003.avi">Movie 2</ext-link>, Supporting Information. Because
of the high compression, the particles did not have time to rearrange
and the defects were formed.</p><p>Similar behavior was observed at
several other flow rates. At a
flow rate of 3 mL/h, particles formed a partially close-packed system.
As we increased the voltage further, crystals with line defects were
formed at 80 V<sub>pp</sub>. Upon increasing the voltage to 99 V<sub>pp</sub>, a close-packed structure was observed. At a flow rate of
5 mL/h, particles do not form a close-packed structure at 60 V<sub>pp</sub>, as the applied acoustic compression is not sufficient to
form a close-packed structure with the increased flow rate. As we
increase the applied acoustic pressure, a partially formed crystal
and a close-packed microstructure can be observed at 80 and 99 V<sub>pp</sub>, respectively.</p><p>We observed that as the flow rate increases,
the order decreases.
A clear demonstration of the effect of the flow rate can be observed
at 60 V<sub>pp</sub> case in the 1, 3, and 5 mL/h cases. A crystal
microstructure is observed at 1 mL/h. At 3 mL/h, a randomly ordered
microstructure is formed and at 5 mL/h, a random aggregate is formed,
showing that the degree of crystallinity decreases with an increase
in the flow rate. The effect of increase in the flow rate on the crystal
structure from 1 to 5 mL/h at 99 V<sub>pp</sub> can be seen in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.7b01862/suppl_file/ao7b01862_si_003.avi">Movies 2</ext-link>&#x02013;<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.7b01862/suppl_file/ao7b01862_si_005.avi">4</ext-link>,

crystal kinetics observed previously in results for shear flow colloidal
crystal kinetics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> The 80 V<sub>pp</sub> case has behavior similar to that in the 60 V<sub>pp</sub> case
where a crystalline microstructure is formed at 1 mL/h, followed by
a randomly close-packed microstructure at 3 mL/h and finally, a random
aggregate for the 5 mL/h case. At 99 V<sub>pp</sub>, the 1 and 3 mL/h
cases show a close-packed crystal and the 5 mL/h case shows the formation
of a small crystallite, demonstrating that acoustic compression is
the dominating force compared with the fluid flow at increased applied
voltage.</p><p>An increased flow rate also increases the rate of crystal
formation
due to enhanced mass transport. However, above a critical flow rate,
it was observed that the crystal formation rate decreases as the flow
rate increases. This is a result of flow-displaced crystallized microstructures,
where incoming particles do not have adequate time to assemble into
close-packed structures. This leads to a decrease in the degree of
hexagonal close-packing. We observe this in the case of acoustic assembly
at 7 mL/h, where assembly does not occur at 60, 80, or 99 V<sub>pp</sub>. When the acoustic field is switched on, an ordered structure can
form given sufficient time and particle concentration. However, the
fluid flow transports particles faster than they are able to nucleate
into crystalline structures, leading to random dispersions like the
one shown in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.7b01862/suppl_file/ao7b01862_si_001.pdf">Figure S1</ext-link>, Supporting Information.</p><p>Polystyrene bead concentration varied due to stochastic addition
of particles to the acoustofluidic device during pumping. A decreasing
concentration tends to a decreased degree of hexagonal close-packing
and increased assembly time. Particles are transported to the acoustic
node irrespective of how low the particle concentration is at all
of the voltages and flow rates. Although sample concentration affects
crystallization, the acoustic field driving particles to assemble
at the node acting to locally concentrate the particles is the most
critical factor in determining the degree of hexagonal close-packing.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Defect Formation</title><p>During assembly, we observe defects

average, the wall separation increases with increasing flow rate,
suggesting that lift causes the particles to come off the wall. We
would expect the wall separation to be an order of magnitude higher
on the basis of similar hydrodynamic measurements in the literature;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> however, we attribute the discrepancy to several
factors. First, the hindrance factors reported here are for single
particles translating above a plane wall and the analysis neglects
the effects of hydrodynamics in the presence of multiple particles,
which would reduce particle mobility.</p><p>Second, our data suggests
that an acoustically generated force
maybe present normal to the capillary wall, as evidenced by the trapping
behavior at 1 mL/h and 99 V<sub>pp</sub>. This component likely drives
particles down toward the wall, which also reduces particle mobility.
This normal force maybe present due to the fact that the piezoelectric
element is at a slight angle and is not perfectly perpendicular to
the capillary wall as a result of the manufacturing process. The piezoelectric
element tilts slightly as the epoxy used to glue the element dries.</p><p>Third, it has been shown theoretically that acoustic streaming
effects push the particles downward, which may push particles toward
the capillary wall, reducing the expected theoretical height.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> The combination of these effects slow particles
down and make them to appear as though they have a separation of &#x0223c;3&#x02013;30
nm. The height in the 1 mL/h-99 V<sub>pp</sub> case is not calculated
as the particles are trapped and no longer flow.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Acoustic Streaming</title><p>The transverse component of the

averages &#x0223c;0 &#x003bc;m/s with a negligible standard deviation.
This indicates that there is no detectable transport in the transverse
direction (i.e., perpendicular to the direction of flow) at steady
state, which indicates that significant flows driven by acoustic streaming
are not present in this direction. Rayleigh and Eckart streaming are
two mechanisms that may contribute to acoustic streaming effects in
our device scale. Fluid jets due to Eckart streaming are negligible
because our device is small and operates at a low frequency, which
reduces the fluid momentum generated by acoustic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> Rayleigh streaming produces vortices, which we would expect
to have significant effect on crystal formation. Literature results
from a computational analysis found that the acoustic streaming effect
is more significant in the transverse <italic>x</italic>-direction
rather than in the longitudinal <italic>z</italic>-direction, where
the flow of fluid in the capillary is a more significant effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> It is possible that the velocity measured in
the longitudinal direction is a result of fluid flow due to pumping
and acoustic streaming; however, a more detailed study is necessary
to decouple the effect of these combined mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrate a continuous flow colloidal crystal fabrication

the colloidal particles hexagonally close pack to form ordered structures
while entrained in a fluid flow. However, we show that it is possible
to acoustically trap a crystal structure despite the presence of flow.
Microparticle image velocimetry is used to examine the transport of
colloidal crystals subject to fluid flow. The average particle velocity
and colloidal crystal throughput increase with the flow rate. However,
flow rates of 5 mL/h and higher increase particle velocity such that
crystalline microstructure is difficult or impossible to maintain
under the acoustic field conditions examined in this work. We compare
the observed and expected degree of hexagonal close-packing using
an order parameter analysis. Overall, the degree of hexagonal close-packing
increases with applied acoustic field strength and decreases with
the flow rate. We find that experimental structures have a degree
of order that deviates from expectations on the basis of spherical
packing by 10&#x02013;20%. This deviation arises from the presence
of point and line defects, grain boundaries, acoustic trapping, and
flow effects.</p><p>The approach demonstrated here can serve as a
continuous flow reactor
to produce colloidal crystals with energy-harvesting applications.
Unlike batch assembly techniques, where the number of input particles
is fixed, our platform has a high-throughput yield of several hundred
particles per second. The use of off-the-shelf components to fabricate
the acoustofluidic cell is advantageous as the device costs less than
$20 and does not require any special processes like photolithography.
Experiments were done in normal lab conditions instead of a clean-room
setting, making it suitable for many applications while using minimal
laboratory equipment. The relatively small footprint of the device
makes it easy to integrate into complex fluid systems.</p><p>Future
work will focus on studying the optimum conditions necessary
to obtain uniform crystals cured in the resin and design the experimental
setup to obtain the resin&#x02013;particle bonding without the excess
polymer demonstrated in this article. Integration of the platform
described here with additive manufacturing techniques will enable
the production of self-assembled materials on demand with unique material
properties. Our experimental setup does not allow us to directly observe
nucleation during assembly. We plan to streamline our experimental
cell to help us observe this process. Given the defects observed during
the experiment, it is necessary to understand the interplay between
forces (e.g., acoustic, hydrodynamic, and surface) and how these forces
influence assembly kinetics. A more detailed study of dislocation
dynamics using an updated experimental cell will allow us to develop
real-time annealing techniques to remove defects during crystal formation.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Materials

using off-the-shelf components without the use of a clean room (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>). A square borosilicate
glass capillary (Vitrocom, Catalog# 8100-100) with an inner side dimension
of 1 mm and wall thickness of 0.2 mm was cleaned using protocols established
for removing contaminants from glass capillaries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> The glass capillary was immersed in 1% Sparkleen (Fisher
Scientific, Catalog# 04-320-4) solution at 80 &#x000b0;C for 30 min.
Sparkleen immersion is followed with immersion of the glass capillary
in deionized water for 30 min and drying using air. A lead zirconate
titanate piezoelement (APC International Inc., P-30.00 mm-5.00 mm-1.00
mm-841 WFB) was attached to the capillary using high-strength epoxy
(JB Weld Epoxy Steel Resin) and cured for 24 h at room temperature.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>(Top)

(Fisher
Scientific, 12-550-A3) using two poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) (Ellsworth
Adhesives, Part# 184 SIL ELAST KIT 0.5 kG) pillars, 5 mm in diameter
and 4 mm high, with epoxy to serve as the supporting element for the
capillary. First, the capillary is glued to the PDMS pillars using
epoxy (Devcon home 5-minute Epoxy) and is allowed to cure for 24 h.
Next, the tubing is glued to the ends of the capillary on both sides
and is allowed to cure for 24 h. The setup was allowed to cure for
an additional 24 h to ensure that epoxy (Devcon home 5-minute Epoxy)
completely bonded the acoustofluidic device to the PDMS pillars. Silicone
tubing (VWR International, Catalog# 16211-316) was attached on both
ends of the capillary using epoxy. The capillary and tubing are glued
at an interval of 24 h and are not glued immediately (as epoxy needs
only 15&#x02013;20 min to set), as attaching the tubing to the capillary
immediately causes the capillary to bend, casting a shadow when viewed
through the microscope and affecting the imaging process.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.2"><title>Sample Preparation</title><p>Polystyrene beads with a 15 &#x003bc;m
diameter (Polysciences Inc., Cat# 18328) were used as building blocks
to form colloidal crystals. One hundred microliters of polystyrene
bead solution was suspended per 1 mL of deionized water sourced from
an ARIES High Purity Water System with a 0.2 &#x003bc;m filter (Aries
Filterworks).</p></sec><sec id="sec5.3"><title>UV-Resin&#x02013;Microparticle Solution</title><p>Unfunctionalized,
dry PMMA particles (27&#x02013;32 &#x003bc;m diameter) were purchased
from Cospheric (PMPMS-1.2 27&#x02013;32 &#x003bc;m). The UV-curable resin
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (CPS 1030 UV-A). The resin was diluted
using acetone and isopropyl alcohol using a 1:1:1 ratio of the resin
and solvents to reduce the viscosity of the resin. The PMMA microparticles
were then added to the diluted resin solution.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.4"><title>Experimental Setup</title><p>The acoustic cell was fixed to an
optical microscope stage. The piezoelement on the acoustic cell was
driven with a sine function wave input using a wave function generator
(Agilent 33220A). A radio frequency (RF) amplifier (Electronics &#x00026;
Innovation, 210L) with a maximum input of 1 V<sub>rms</sub> was used
to amplify the signal input into the piezoelement. The amplitude and
frequency of the signal from the amplifier was monitored continuously
using an oscilloscope (Tektronix, TBS 1052B-EDU). A signal attenuator
(Tektronix P2220 Voltage Probe) was used on the oscilloscope to reduce
the possibility of damage on the oscilloscope due to high voltage
inputs. Two dummy loads of 1 W (Tektronix 011-0049-01) and 50 W (Pasternack
PE6234) were used with the wave function generator and the RF amplifier,
respectively, to ensure that the circuit remained closed at all times.</p><p>The polystyrene bead dispersion was interfaced with the acoustofluidic
device through the silicone tubing and introduced into the device
with a syringe pump (Lucca Technologies, GenieTouch). The acoustic
pressure was generated by applying various voltages to the piezoelement.
All experiments were conducted at peak-to-peak voltages of 60, 80,
and 99 V<sub>pp</sub> as a direct input from the RF amplifier at a
fixed frequency of 830 kHz. The colloidal throughput was varied by
introducing the dispersion at flow rates of 1, 3, and 5 mL/h using
the syringe pump.</p><p>At the outlet of the tubing, a 48 W UV-light
source (SUNUV SUN2C
48 W LED UV lamp) ranging from 355 to 405 nm was set up and the device
was manually operated to be lit up for 4.5 min continuously to obtain
continuously cured resin structures. The assembly is cured while the
suspension is flowing. The UV lamp is placed at the end of the tubing,
and the flow rate and UV exposure time used in this experiment was
empirically determined so that the flowing UV resin with the acoustic
assembly was cured as it flowed out of the tubing. Our method works
as the resin is cured at the exit of the tubing and is not cured while
the resin is inside the tubing (which would lead to blocking). The
resin&#x02013;polymer composite cure can be extracted as a continuous
process. The flow does not have to stop to extract the cured fibers.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.5"><title>Optical Microscopy and Analysis</title><p>An inverted optical
microscope (Olympus IX70) was used to observe the assembly process
at 10&#x000d7; magnification. Videos were recorded using a scientific
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor camera (QImaging, Optimos).
Five hundred frames of video were taken at a frame rate of 10 frames/s.
Each pixel in the recorded video was measured to be 885.6 nm with
a stage micrometer. The videos were processed and analyzed using the
MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox (Mathworks). Each frame was filtered
to remove noise before identifying centroid locations. The centroid
locations are written to a text file and saved for bead distribution
analysis. The images and video for the particle&#x02013;resin sample
were taken using a Lumenera Infinity3 6UR camera mounted on an upright
microscope (Leica DM3000).</p><p>An open source particle image velocimetry
(PIV) package, PIVLab,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> was used to identify particle velocity distributions.
PIVLab uses a cross-correlation algorithm to calculate particle displacement
between two images. Before our images are processed by PIVLab, we
crop the frames to remove areas not occupied by beads to eliminate
spurious velocity vectors that arise from local intensity variations
caused by fluctuations in the light source. Seeding densities below
10 particles per interrogation area within an image will produce faulty
vectors for velocimetric data analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></sup> The cropped images are then filtered using a highpass filter and
a Wiener denoise filter prior to analysis. The PIV algorithm then
divides a frame into smaller interrogation areas and performs a correlation
between these areas and the same areas on a consecutive frame to calculate
the displacement of particles.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes id="notes-1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information
