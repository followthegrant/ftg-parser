Receptor activation leads to the formation of membrane-proximal protein microclusters. These clusters undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and organize multiprotein complexes thereby acting as molecular signaling platforms. Little is known about how the quantity and phosphorylation levels of microclusters are affected by costimulatory signals and the activity of specific signaling proteins. We combined micrometer-sized, microcontact printed, striped patterns of different stimuli and simultaneous analysis of different cell strains with image processing protocols to address this problem. First, we validated the stimulation protocol by showing that high expression levels CD28 result in increased cell spreading. Subsequently, we addressed the role of costimulation and a specific phosphotyrosine phosphatase in cluster formation by including a SHP2 knock-down strain in our system. Distinguishing cell strains using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester enabled a comparison within single samples. SHP2 exerted its effect by lowering phosphorylation levels of individual clusters while CD28 costimulation mainly increased the number of signaling clusters and cell spreading. These effects were observed for general tyrosine phosphorylation of clusters and for phosphorylated PLC&#x003b3;1. Our analysis enables a clear distinction between factors determining the number of microclusters and those that act on these signaling platforms.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work has been supported by the Volkswagen Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/">http://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/</ext-link>&#x0201c; Nachwuchsgruppen an Universit&#x000e4;ten&#x0201d;, I/7 7 472).

One of the downstream effectors is phospholipase C-&#x003b3;1 (PLC&#x003b3;1) for which CD28 costimulation leads to increased activation and tyrosine phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0079277-PerezVillar1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079277-Michel1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Numerous studies have addressed the role of CD28 in T cell signaling and activation. Manz et al. <xref rid="pone.0079277-Manz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> have even shown that CD28 costimulation decreases the number of engaged peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) per TCR cluster required for T cell activation. Additionally, CD28 has recently been observed to form microclusters that colocalize with TCR clusters upon stimulation with CD80. CD28 subsequently recruits protein kinase C &#x003b8; (PKC&#x003b8;) clusters and both CD28 and PKC&#x003b8; clusters migrate to subregions of the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) that are distinct from TCR subregions <xref rid="pone.0079277-Yokosuka2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Importantly, however, the quantitative impact of CD28 costimulation on cluster phosphorylation has not been addressed so far.</p><p>Procedures for T cell stimulation incorporating receptor ligands on planar surfaces have proven to be highly powerful in analyzing the dynamics and molecular composition of protein microclusters in a highly defined manner <xref rid="pone.0079277-Bunnell1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The incorporation of TCR ligands into lipid bilayers has been key to developing the molecular concept of IS formation <xref rid="pone.0079277-Grakoui1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and has among others been applied to analyzing the delivery of cytolytic granules and the formation of SRC family kinase microclusters upon TCR engagement on cytotoxic T lymphocytes <xref rid="pone.0079277-Beal1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and signaling induced by viral envelope proteins <xref rid="pone.0079277-VasiliverShamis1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The latter study also highlights the advantages that planar-supported substrates offer for quantitative analyses of signaling.</p><p>Conversely, microstructured surfaces have been employed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of the specific geometric arrangement of the IS <xref rid="pone.0079277-Mossman1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> as well as the role of specific patterns in the arrangement of stimuli and costimuli in generating a T cell response <xref rid="pone.0079277-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The latter study employed microcontact printing for the generation of various patterns of TCR and CD28 stimuli.</p><p>Microcontact printing is a robust method for the generation of microstructures of functional proteins in various geometries in micrometer dimensions <xref rid="pone.0079277-Singhvi1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079277-Bernard1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Through printing of stripe patterns, functional analysis of different stimuli has been conducted side-by-side for single cells <xref rid="pone.0079277-Culley1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.This side-by-side arrangement of stimuli is of particular interest for quantitatively addressing the impact of costimulation on protein cluster formation and tyrosine phosphorylation. Here we describe an accessible procedure that combines microcontact printing, confocal microscopy, high-content image analysis and statistics to study, in parallel, the effect of different stimuli on tyrosine phosphorylation, cluster formation and membrane spreading during early T cell signaling. Within this setup we additionally include the simultaneous analysis of two different cell types and cells with different levels of receptor expression. We demonstrate that the main effect of CD28 costimulation is an increase in the number of microclusters formed as well as the formation of a larger contact area with the stimulating surface.</p><p>Moreover, we address the impact of deficiency of SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) on cluster formation. SHP2 is a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that is ubiquitously expressed <xref rid="pone.0079277-Feng1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Intriguingly, unlike its close relative SHP1, which is widely accepted as a negative regulator of T cell signaling <xref rid="pone.0079277-Lorenz1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, SHP2 has been implicated in both, the inhibition of T cell signaling <xref rid="pone.0079277-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079277-Latchman1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079277-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079277-Yokosuka3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, as well as sustained activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by the TCR <xref rid="pone.0079277-Lorenz1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079277-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and many growth factor and cytokine receptors <xref rid="pone.0079277-Neel1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The T cell signaling proteins PLC&#x003b3; and PI3K might be directly regulated by SHP2 since it has been shown that these proteins and SHP2 bind to growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2)-associated binding protein (GAB)-family adapter proteins which are activated upon activation of T and B cell receptors as well as insulin, growth factor and cytokine stimulation <xref rid="pone.0079277-HolgadoMadruga1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079277-TakahashiTezuka1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079277-Nishida1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. When addressing the impact of SHP2 on the phosphorylation of signaling microclusters, we show that the deficiency of this PTP leads to a significant increase in overall phosphotyrosine levels and, more specifically, phosphorylation of PLC&#x003b3;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Reagents were purchased from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany) unless otherwise specified. &#x003b1;CD3 (mouse monoclonal IgG2a, clone OKT3) and &#x003b1;CD28 (mouse monoclonal IgG2a, clone 9.3) antibodies were kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Gundram Jung (Department of Immunology, University of T&#x000fc;bingen, Germany).

The microstructures were designed in autoCAD 2007 (Autodesk, M&#x000fc;nchen, Germany) and ordered as laser-written chromium masks (ML&#x00026;C, Jena, Germany).

</xref>). This effect was independent of CD28 expression levels, meaning that there was no significant difference in the increase between CD28-high and CD28-low cells. Furthermore, it confirmed that, on both &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28, CD28-high cells had significantly lower phosphotyrosine levels per surface area than CD28-low cells. Expression of CD3 had not been reduced as a consequence of CD28-GFP expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079277.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) and could therefore not have been the cause of this reduced phosphorylation.

</xref>), CD28-high cells seemed to have a slightly higher total tyrosine phosphorylation level, but after a Bonferroni correction this difference could not be shown to be significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079277-g003">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic>

</xref>) or total tyrosine phosphorylation per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079277-g003">Fig. 3<italic>F</italic>
</xref>). As expected, significantly higher levels of phosphotyrosine were observed on &#x003b1;CD3 stripes in these samples. It should be noted that this difference was noted primarily on samples where &#x003b1;CD3 was applied as an overlay. When &#x003b1;CD3 was stamped, in many cells phosphotyrosine levels were observed to be higher on the overlay. However, as explained above, we corrected for this effect by pooling data from samples with inversed stamp-overlay orientations.</p><p>Finally, when &#x003b1;CD28 stripes were compared with IgG control stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079277-g002">Fig. 2<italic>F </italic>&#x00026; <italic>G</italic>
</xref>) no significant differences were found in the phosphotyrosine signal per surface area between stripes or cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079277-g003">Fig. 3<italic>G</italic>
</xref>). The presence of &#x003b1;CD28 stripes did however stimulate the CD28 cells to form larger interaction surfaces with the stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079277-g003">Fig. 3<italic>H</italic>
</xref>). This indicates that Jurkat T cells can respond to CD28 stimulation alone when high levels of CD28 are expressed, albeit in a limited fashion. The increased surface area of CD28-high cells was accompanied by a proportionate increase in total phosphotyrosine signal per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079277-g003">Fig. 3<italic>I</italic>
</xref>). As we expect this fluorescence to be of membrane proximal, background phosphorylation levels independent of TCR and CD28 signaling, the proportionate increase in total phosphotyrosine signal per cell with increased cell spreading is unsurprising. Even though sample-to-sample variation imposes limits to comparisons between samples, cells clearly responded in a strongly reduced fashion to unspecific IgG2a coated surfaces as compared to &#x003b1;CD3/&#x003b1;CD28 patterned surfaces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079277.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). For none of the combinations of stimuli a significant interaction factor between CD28 expression and stimulating surface was found when two-way factorial ANOVAs including interaction terms were applied. Therefore there were no detectable differences in the response to the different stimuli between CD28-low and CD28-high cells. In other words, even though the CD28-low cells had higher local phosphotyrosine signals, the increase of tyrosine phosphorylation on &#x003b1;CD3 was comparable between the two cell types.</p><p>Treatment with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, drastically reduces cell adherence and spreading (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079277.s005">Fig. S5</xref>) indicating that Jurkat T cells do not passively adhere to or spread on the striped surfaces and that the observed affects are an effect of CD28 costimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>SHP2 depletion increases cluster phosphorylation but not cluster numbers and decreases IL2 production</title><p>The analysis of phosphotyrosine levels, as described above, shows the potential of the striped pattern to perform a side-by-side analysis of two different stimuli.

In addition the effect on the tyrosine residue 783 of PLC&#x003b3;1 in particular was tested as a candidate target of SHP2. In contrast to the combination of stimuli used above, in these experiments we intended to more closely capture the physiological setting of CD28 costimulation in early signaling, which is in colocalization with CD3 engagement.

Image processing and quantification was done on a per image basis. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079277.s010">Macro S2</xref> describes the full procedure utilized to analyze the images. In short, the pPLC&#x003b3;1 signal was thresholded to generate a binary mask of all cells. This image was inverted to generate a mask of the background signal. The CFSE image was thresholded and was used in combination with the mask of all cells to generate a mask of CFSE labeled cells and a mask of unlabeled cells. The image of the printed stripes was thresholded to generate a mask of the printed structures and inversed to also generate a mask of the overlaid areas. Combining the masks of the printed structures and overlaid areas with the masks of the cells formed the masks of the CFSE labeled cells on stamped stripes, the CFSE labeled cells on overlaid structures, the unlabeled cells on stamped stripes and the unlabeled cells on overlaid structures. These four masks were used to measure the surface areas the cells covered on both surfaces. Combining the stripe and overlay masks with the background mask enabled the measurement of surface areas not covered by cells. The last six generated masks were, in turn, applied to the original pPLC&#x003b3;1 image and from the resulting images the total pPLC&#x003b3;1 signal per condition could be determined. Together with the total surface areas of the specific condition, the signal intensity per &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> was calculated. Surface specific background corrections were applied. In addition, a binary cluster mask was generated from the pPLC&#x003b3;1 image. This mask was segmented using the four masks of cells on surfaces creating four new masks. From these masks cluster numbers were counted and by applying them to the original pPLC&#x003b3;1 image cluster intensities could be determined.

In a first step, we established that different levels of CD28 expression translated into different responses on antibody-coated surfaces. Consistent with a positive stimulatory role in signaling, Jurkat T cells expressing high levels of CD28 covered larger surface areas than CD28-low cells when stimulated with parallel stripes of &#x003b1;CD28 and &#x003b1;CD3 or combinations of &#x003b1;CD28 and IgG control stripes. Interestingly, we were not able to detect an increased level of tyrosine phosphorylation in CD28-high cells. When no CD28 costimulus was present, no significant difference between the two cell lines was observed. This indicates that CD28-GFP expressing cells had not been compromised in their potential for activation through the stimulation of CD3.

Additionally, &#x003b1;CD3+&#x003b1;CD28 induced stronger local spreading than &#x003b1;CD3 alone. These results and the results discussed above show that CD28 plays a significant role in spreading of T cells suggesting that CD28 stimulation induces a T cells to more thoroughly probe the surface or APC it is currently engaging, even in the absence of CD3 engagement. Costimulation of T cells with CD28 has been previously demonstrated to promote expression of proteins involved in cytoskeletal remodeling <xref rid="pone.0079277-Lichtenfels1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> and the CD28 signal invokes actin reorganization and formation of lamellipodia through PI3K <xref rid="pone.0079277-Pages1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, cofilin <xref rid="pone.0079277-Lee3" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> and Rho family GTPases <xref rid="pone.0079277-Reif1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Our data supports the notion that CD28 costimulation initiates qualitatively different signaling pathways than stimulation of the TCR.</p><p>The impact of SHP2 deficiency on cluster formation was qualitatively and quantitatively different from the impact of costimulation. In contrast to the effect of CD28 engagement, no significant difference in phosphorylated cluster density was observed. However, SHP2 deficiency did lead to a small but significant increase of overall and cluster tyrosine phosphorylation and PLC&#x003b3;1 Y783 phosphorylation. PTP activity greatly exceeds kinase activity <xref rid="pone.0079277-Mustelin1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> and other PTPs may have overlapping substrate specificity with SHP2. Nevertheless, knock down of this single phosphatase had a perceivable effect on overall phosphotyrosine levels. This demonstrates that the loss of SHP2 cannot be fully compensated by other phosphatases, such as SHP1, and therefore plays a non redundant role in T cell signaling. Interestingly, it has been recently found by Yokosuka et al. <xref rid="pone.0079277-Yokosuka3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> that upon stimulation of the TCR and the negative regulator programmed cell death 1 (PD1), SHP2 itself forms clusters. In T cells expressing a phosphatase-dead dominant-negative form of SHP2 the phosphorylation of PD1 was increased which is in line with our observation of increased tyrosine phosphorylation.</p><p>In summary, these observations demonstrate that CD28 engagement contributes to the formation of clusters acting as signaling platforms, while SHP2 targets already formed signaling clusters. There were no indications that SHP2 specifically targets CD28 signaling.</p><p>Interestingly, for late T cell activity a reversed and large effect of SHP2 deficiency was observed. While general phosphotyrosine and phospho-PLC&#x003b3;1 signals were higher in the SHP2 KD cells during early signaling, IL2 production was lower as described previously <xref rid="pone.0079277-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This means that higher tyrosine phosphorylation levels during the first ten minutes of T cell stimulation do not necessarily result in a stronger T cell response. It also shows that SHP2, despite being one of many PTPs in T cells, has a significant regulatory effect on T cell activation. CD3 and CD28 stimulation were both necessary to generate an IL2 response. IL2 expression was also reduced for cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin suggesting that SHP2 exerts this latter effect at a later stage of the signaling cascade than the initial dephosphorylating effect on PLC&#x003b3;. The effect on cytokine secretion observed is likely due to the positive effect of SHP2 on MAPK signaling <xref rid="pone.0079277-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079277-Neel1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> which is crucial for IL2 production <xref rid="pone.0079277-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Further research, however, is required in order to verify this hypothesis. Remarkably, it appears that SHP2 plays a dual role in IL2 production as Yokosuka et al. <xref rid="pone.0079277-Yokosuka3" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> observed SHP2, through PD1, negatively affected IL2 production.</p><p>The combination of micropatterned surfaces with quantitative image processing as demonstrated here, adds a valuable and accessible tool to the repertoire of analytical techniques in the analysis of early T cell signaling. Image processing is applied to a cell population in an unbiased fashion. The stamping of stripes enables a highly sensitive side-by-side analysis of different stimuli on a microscale level, which can be further extended to a side-by-side comparison of different cell strains eliminating noise arising from sample-to sample variation. Even though state-of-the-art superresolution techniques provide the means to visualize single molecules within clusters, challenges such as cell-to-cell and sample-to-sample variation still apply to these more advanced techniques.</p><p>In this study we addressed the role of the PTP SHP2 in cluster formation and phosphorylation using a SHP2 KD Jurkat strain next to wt Jurkat cells. However, quantitative comparisons of signaling can benefit the analysis of T cell biology in multiple other ways.
