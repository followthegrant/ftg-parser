Wetlands in SSA lack suitable development for exploitation by human beings, with necessary infrastructure in terms of disease prevention - most importantly water, sanitation and waste management services, and personal and environmental hygiene - often unavailable or insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Since potentially prevalent diseases affect quality of life and productivity, consequently affecting overall socioeconomic development, adequate health care options are vital in order to respond to and meet the demand for remediation in such settings. Considering and understanding the behaviour and decision-taking of wetland communities in the case of ill-health can provide valuable information to guide future health interventions and health-promoting wetland management.</p><p id="Par25">Little research has been carried out to determine the level of healthcare utilization among wetland users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], although it can be assumed that such ecosystems per se are not well equipped and even &#x02018;underserved&#x02019; when it comes to human health infrastructure and service provision. Health care facilities might be distant and difficult to access, thus affecting the health-seeking behaviour of those suffering from ill-health. This paper contributes to the knowledge base on health-seeking behaviour in wetlands by adopting a syndromic surveillance approach of self-reported symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and related health-seeking event analysis of four different exposure groups in the Kenyan Ewaso Narok Swamp.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Health-seeking behaviour: a reference to livelihoods</title><p id="Par26">Health-seeking behaviour determines whether or not individuals suffering from diseases receive treatment or cure. Health-seeking behaviour research focuses on the first recognition of symptoms and follows the ill individual through different stages of formulating and handling ill-health - from deciding whether or not to seek care to actual pursuit of health through recovery.

These dimensions include the availability, accessibility, affordability of services, adequacy and acceptability of health services. Access refers to the interaction between the healthcare services, broader policies, institutions, organizations and processed, and livelihood assets individuals can mobilize and combine in a particular vulnerability context. Furthermore, access is determined by cultural norms, subjective preferences and medical traditions with the recognition of illness and treatment seeking depending on individual, community and societal access to livelihood assets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">According to this theoretical framework, wetlands (natural capital) contribute both to their inhabitants&#x02019; livelihoods, and to the generation of income (financial capital).

The same diseases were previously found to be treated with traditional medicines in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par89">In the Ewaso Narok Swamp, extensive local knowledge on the traditional treatment of health conditions existed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. &#x02018;Human&#x02019; (local knowledge) and &#x02018;natural&#x02019; (the wetland) capital (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) were highly valued and appreciated by the wetland community, with medicinal plants playing a major role in terms of treatment of ill-health. As the in-depth interviews revealed, the pastoralists in particular would rather use herbs - with knowledge taught by ancestors and handed down through generations - than trust conventional medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These findings dovetail with previous research underlining the importance of herbal medicines in Kenya and in other countries in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Perceived quality of healthcare provision and switching in health-seeking behaviour</title><p id="Par90">Our data confirm that the perceived quality of healthcare provision determines health-seeking behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Moreover, those coping with ill-health applied multiple therapeutic options towards cure: where self-treatment and use of herbs or pharmaceuticals were ineffective, the patients sought care from a health care facility or medical practitioner. Those who initially sought care from formal healthcare providers switched to traditional medicine if foregoing treatment was ineffective. Such decisions were driven by the perceived severity of self-reported symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This switching in health-seeking behaviour in our semiarid wetland setting confirms evidence from Kenya among pastoralists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] suffering from malaria where in order to recover as fast as possible and keep expenditures as minimal as possible, different treatment transitions are undertaken.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Methodological discussions and limitations</title><p id="Par91">This study aimed at addressing and understanding health-seeking behaviour in the Ewaso Narok Swamp. A cross-sectional study design using syndromic surveillance and event analysis was adopted. The study relied entirely on self-reporting, thus potentially entailing a recall bias - over- and underreporting by the community members, both in terms of symptoms and action taken in response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The recall period was four weeks in the dry season, a time span within which symptoms might have been forgotten or added, thus confounding the results. However, four weeks are not expected to bias the results substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par92">Due to the small sample size, only percentages were computed. Therefore, these findings are not per se generalizable beyond the regions studied. However, we triangulated our quantitative and qualitative results with the official health sector data to verify the results. Similar trends to the ones we uncover in our paper may be visible in similar settings.</p><p id="Par93">Although the design and training of this study involved the (re-)translation of health-related concepts beyond biomedical terminology in the multi-cultural context of the Ewaso Narok Swamp through the support of research assistants of different ethnic affiliations, it is likely that understandings of symptoms and ill-health were lost in translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par94">The cross-sectional design of the survey could only capture the health-seeking behaviour at one point of time and thus not fully account for behaviours in different seasons and years, for which a longitudinal design may have been more useful. It is important to note that the rainy season and flooding can pose different (enhanced) water-related health risks and disease exposures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] that lead to different health-seeking behaviours (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and at the same time substantially limited accessibility of health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], as compared to the dry season, particularly in a semiarid wetland setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par95">Moreover, considering potential disease risks in wetlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], one must keep in mind the co-occurrence of symptoms for one disease (e.g. abdominal complaints and fever both indicating typhoid fever), for which the care-seeking was recorded separately.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par96">In the Ewaso Narok Swamp, health-seeking behaviour is determined by numerous physical/infrastructural, natural/environmental, financial/socioeconomic, social/demographic, as well as human/cultural factors. Community members have different coping strategies towards ill-health, and few symptoms remain untreated. Whether it is a health care facility, chemist or medicinal plants: community member take action and apply some kind of treatment, either via a healthcare service provider or by the community members themselves. Healthcare services were scarce and community members as well as care providers reported an undersupply of easy-to-reach options, hinting at healthcare services not being available and accessible to all. The widely-practiced self-treatment of symptoms might mirror such weaknesses of healthcare provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par97">The population around the Ewaso Narok Swamp has been growing in the past 30&#x02009;years. In a semiarid area, this water resource attracts increasing in-migration of users and this, considering the disease exposure in the wetland, creates an increasing demand for healthcare services, which service providers can hardly keep pace with. Local options and the potential of self-treatment and traditional medicine therefore become ever more important to reach a wider portion of the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par98">As most disease cases in Sub-Saharan wetlands occur in marginalized communities, distant from effective diagnostic and treatment facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], the use and effectiveness of traditional medicine available on-site should be further validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The private retail sector could also be strengthened as self-treatment is usually the very first response to an ill-health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par99">Primary healthcare, community health workers and traditional healers become increasingly important in the engagement with underserved and hard-to-reach populations such as pastoralists, and in helping to close the service provision gap in wetlands as found in rural semiarid Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].
