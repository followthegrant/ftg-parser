It is associated with severe complications and has a poorly understood etiopathogenesis. Here, we present the results from extensive bioinformatics analyses of the first large-scale proteomic investigation of cholesteatoma. The purpose of this study was to take an unbiased approach to identifying alterations in protein expression and in biological processes, in order to explain the characteristic phenotype of this skin-derived tumor. Five different human tissue types (cholesteatoma, neck of cholesteatoma, tympanic membrane, external auditory canal skin, and middle ear mucosa) were analyzed. More than 2,400 unique proteins were identified using nanoLC-MS/MS based proteomics (data deposited to the ProteomeXchange), and 295 proteins were found to be differentially regulated in cholesteatoma. Validation analyses were performed by SRM mass spectrometry. Proteins found to be up- or down-regulated in cholesteatoma were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and clustered into functional groups, for which activation state and associations to disease processes were predicted. Cholesteatoma contained high levels of pro-inflammatory S100 proteins, such as S100A7A and S100A7. Several proteases, such as ELANE, were up-regulated, whereas extracellular matrix proteins, such as COL18A1 and NID2, were under-represented. This may lead to alterations in integrity and differentiation of the tissue (as suggested by the up-regulation of KRT4 in the cholesteatoma). The presented data on the differential protein composition in cholesteatoma corroborate previous studies, highlight novel protein functionalities involved in the pathogenesis, and identify new areas for targeted research that hold therapeutic potential for the disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by external sources: *Hans Skoubys og Hustru Emma Skoubys Foundation - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.audioweb.dk/Skouby/index.htm">http://www.audioweb.dk/Skouby/index.htm</ext-link> *John and Birthe Meyer Foundation *Danaflex - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.danaflex.com">www.danaflex.com</ext-link>; Internal source: Aarhus University Hospital - Institute of Clinical Medicin - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clin.au.dk/en/">http://clin.au.dk/en/</ext-link>.

The observed expansive, destructive, and invasive characteristics share similarities with malignant diseases, which is mirrored by the extensive surgery and control regimens. Most patients experience severe complications ranging from hearing loss to potentially fatal intracranial infections, and there is a pressing need for developing medical treatment alternatives, based on the molecular pathology.</p><p>The basis for the development of cholesteatoma is ectopic keratinizing epithelial cells in the middle ear cavity, but its etiopathogenesis is not fully understood. The introduction of keratinizing epithelia to the middle ear is thought to arise mainly from retraction-pockets and/or thinning of the tympanic membrane, which are prevalent conditions in middle ear pathology, but may also stem from the immigration of cells through tympanic membrane perforations, metaplasia of the middle ear keratinocytes, migration of external auditory canal (EAC) keratinocytes, and embryonic remnants <xref rid="pone.0104103-Olszewska1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The presence of keratinocytes in the tympanic cavity alone, however, does not necessarily lead to cholesteatoma formation, which is supported by the finding of low number of cholesteatoma formations from tympanic membrane perforations, and the varying success rates of simple animal skin graft models <xref rid="pone.0104103-Vennix1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104103-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Accordingly, additional unknown factors are involved in the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma. Various molecular factors, such as differentiation <xref rid="pone.0104103-Broekaert1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104103-Sanjuan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, growth/proliferation <xref rid="pone.0104103-Bujia2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104103-Huisman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0104103-Olszewska5" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104103-Shinoda1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, inflammation <xref rid="pone.0104103-Haruyama1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, infection <xref rid="pone.0104103-Ricciardiello1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104103-Chole1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> bone erosion, lipid metabolism <xref rid="pone.0104103-Bloksgaard1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>

The majority of studies have focused only on one or a few markers for the areas of interest, and due to differences in study design results are not easily compared between these studies. Inflammation and bone erosion are frequent observations, but the promoting molecular processes behind are not fully understood. The roles of other biological processes in cholesteatoma remain controversial.</p><p>Technological development has greatly enhanced untargeted OMICS-methods in transcriptomics and proteomics. These methods can produce larger and more coherent analyses compared to the traditional targeted analyses and aid the development of new hypotheses. In cholesteatoma research, large data sets have been produced by transcriptomics using microarrays <xref rid="pone.0104103-Tokuriki1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104103-Macias1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. mRNA analyses are important for the process of explaining the biology, but the interpretation of results has to be careful due to the very low concordance (around 20%) with protein expression <xref rid="pone.0104103-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Some of the most consistent findings from mRNA studies revealed up-regulated transcripts for a number of proteins of the S100 group <xref rid="pone.0104103-Tokuriki1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104103-Klenke1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104103-Macias1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>; many of the S100 proteins have strong pro-inflammatory capabilities, but their role and protein expression in cholesteatoma is not known. New approaches must be utilized in order to achieve a greater understanding of the etiopathogenesis, connect the results of earlier studies, and correlate the transcriptional profile to the protein expression.</p><p>This study is the first to employ large-scale proteomics with subsequent bioinformatics in the investigation of cholesteatoma. The purpose was to compare the proteomes of cholesteatoma and its surrounding tissues, thereby taking an unbiased approach to identify biological functions and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. The inclusion of five distinct tissue types in the analysis (cholesteatoma, neck of cholesteatoma, tympanic membrane, external auditory canal skin, and middle ear mucosa), instead of the usual two (cholesteatoma and skin), led to the identification of protein-levels unique for these tissues. Bioinformatics analyses were performed stringently on the most highly-regulated proteins in cholesteatoma. The strongest results from these analyses describe reductions/degradations of extracellular matrix/basement membrane proteins, possibly caused by inflammation induced proteolysis, which may have widespread consequences for the integrity, differentiation and survival of the tissue. This new overview of expression patterns and suggested disease mechanisms may improve the understanding of the disease and create a base for targeted analyses that focus on possible drug targets, such as inflammatory mediators or proteases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Tissue samples were collected by senior surgeons from patients undergoing cholesteatoma surgery at the department for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology Head and Neck Surgery at the Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark. Informed written consent was obtained from adult patients and from parents or legal guardians on behalf of minors and children prior to surgery. All procedures were carried out in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and with the permission from The Danish Research Ethics Committee (M-20090142). Data handling procedures were approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (2010-41-4378).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patients and samples</title><p>For the large-scale analyses nine patients were included (five males, four females; age range: 7&#x02013;77 years). Five biopsies were taken from each patient (same side): 1) Cholesteatoma sack, 2) Neck of cholesteatoma (the transition zone from the tympanic membrane), 3) Tympanic membrane (location remote from transition zone), 4) External auditory canal skin (deep part, few millimeters from the annulus), and 5) Middle ear mucosa (promontory area). The five tissues within a sample set were compared to each other such that each patient was his or her own control; this removed the effect of inter-individual differences, specifically, the differences in timing and inflammation state of the disease, and made it possible to follow the development in protein expression from apparent normal ear canal skin to pathologic cholesteatoma tissue and to evaluate the differences between neighboring tissues. Exclusion criteria: Unclear anatomy (no clear transition from the tympanic membrane to the cholesteatoma sack), use of topic/systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to surgery, and ongoing exudative/suppurative inflammation/infection at the time of surgery. Patients had not used antibiotics within two weeks prior to surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample preparation and pre-fractionation</title><p>All samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further processing.

Five of these (KRT4, 77, 23, 78, and 80) met the fold change criteria. Four keratins were found to have higher levels of expression compared with middle ear mucosa (KRT77, 23, 78, and 80). One keratin (KRT4) showed a higher level of expression compared with both the neck of cholesteatoma and EACS. Other keratins had increased levels of expression in non-cholesteatoma tissues: KRT76, 79 (Tympanic membrane), KRT15 (EACS), and KRT7, 8, 18, 19 (Mucosa). This latter group comprises keratins of simple epithelia, which are normally expressed in the mucosa but not in the skin <xref rid="pone.0104103-Moll1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and, interestingly, EACS showed lower levels of these proteins compared with both cholesteatoma, neck of cholesteatoma, and especially compared with the tympanic membrane.

The SRM analyses were carried out on another set of patient samples (n&#x02265;9) measuring each sample separately (no pooling). A set of proteins that was found to be up-regulated (RNASE7, S100A7A, KRT4, ELANE, and ECM1) or inconsistently up-regulated (S100A7) in cholesteatoma in the large-scale analysis was also found to be significantly up-regulated (p&#x0003c;0.05) in the SRM analyses.</p><p>The down-regulations of PFN2, NID2, COL18A1, and GSTM3 were also confirmed by SRM, whereas FMOD escaped detection in SRM. Furthermore, three proteins (SBDS, EIF3K, NRAS) could not be confirmed since they showed high variance and had low magnitude of alterations. Another three proteins (CTNNB1, DNAJB1, S100A16) could be confirmed qualitatively by having clear fold change in line with the large-scale study but with insufficient <italic>p</italic> values (p&#x0003c;0.15). The analysis of single samples, instead of pooled samples, meant that a lower protein amount (approximately 50%) was accessible for SRM analyses compared with the large-scale analyses, and no pre-fractionation was performed. These factors may have contributed to the failure to detect the FMOD protein in the SRM analyses. Out of the 16 tested proteins, 13 showed data matching the large-scale study (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104103.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0104103.s008">Methods S1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The identification and relative quantification of more than 2,400 unique proteins and the inclusion of five tissue types allowed for a broad bioinformatics analysis, combining groups of related proteins with differential levels into strong joint estimates. Considering the complexity of tissue biopsies in general and the differences between the five different tissue types, the profiles of the protein extracts showed large overlaps between tissues and a good reproducibility between replicates of the same tissue. Of the proteins identified in all three experiments, on average, 92% were found in all replicates of a given tissue type. A meaningful interpretation of the large amounts of data generated from large-scale proteomics studies requires systematic bioinformatics processing in the context of the disease. The biology most strongly associated with cholesteatoma is discussed in this study.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Extracellular matrix and basement membrane</title><p>The top IPA network synthesized from differentially-regulated proteins in cholesteatoma comprised mainly extracellular matrix-associated components including basement membrane related proteins. One of the components in the hypotheses concerning cholesteatoma pathogenesis is the breach/loss of basement membrane that allows for the invasion of keratinocytes. Sudhoff and colleagues found scattered discontinuities in the staining for collagen IV in cholesteatoma <xref rid="pone.0104103-Sudhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104103-Sudhoff4" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, whereas a continuous collagen IV distribution similar to that of EACS was found in other studies <xref rid="pone.0104103-Dallari1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Shunyu et al did not detect disruptions in the basement membrane of 48 cholesteatomas; however, the middle collagen layer was greatly reduced/lost in most retraction pockets investigated <xref rid="pone.0104103-Shunyu1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The fact that only some studies managed to detect these defects suggests that the breaches are either rare and focal, or that they, perhaps instead, are invisible widenings/thinnings of the basement membrane mesh that allow for transmigration of cells. Inclusion/invagination of epithelium with or without basement membrane breach is another possible mechanism for the introduction of epidermal cells to the middle ear <xref rid="pone.0104103-Sudhoff4" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Regardless of the mechanism, changes in the extracellular matrix around the basement membrane reflect consistent findings.</p><p>Several differentially-expressed extracellular matrix related proteins were identified in the present study. Indicated by the associated functions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104103-g004">Figure 4</xref> (cancer, adhesion, and cardiovascular system) and by the activated biological functions in <xref rid="pone-0104103-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (e.g. decreased 'Adhesion of tumor cell lines' and increased 'Migration of endothelial cells'), these proteins should not just be regarded as structural parts that form a physical barrier, but as active players that control the environment, and which in this case may allow for angiogenesis and cancer-like reorganization of the tissue. ECM1 was one of the few up-regulated extracellular matrix associated proteins.

Neck of cholesteatoma and cholesteatoma sack showed very low levels of these proteins (NID2 showed more than 20-fold lower levels compared with the tympanic membrane and EACS). The cell adhesion protein CEACAM6 was found to be highly up-regulated in cholesteatoma compared with the tympanic membrane and EACS, in particular.

Steroid sulfatase (STS) is one of the enzymes most strongly associated with desquamation of the skin and is important for the lipid composition and integrity of the skin barrier. Up-regulation, as measured in the present study, can lead to increased detachment of cells and increased desquamation rates, whereas the opposite results in decreased desquamation and thickening of the skin as seen in X-linked ichtyosis <xref rid="pone.0104103-Strott1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104103-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.

In the present study, around 30&#x02013;40 fold higher levels of STS were found in cholesteatoma compared to the tympanic membrane and EACS, whereas a counter-acting enzyme Sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) was down-regulated to the same degree, perhaps indicating activation and a resulting over-desquamation.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Protein-degrading enzymes</title><p>Neutrophil elastase (ELANE) was one of two up-regulated proteins in the network of otherwise down-regulated extracellular matrix associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104103-g004">Figure 4</xref>). It is a protease of polymorphnuclear cells that, in addition to its antimicrobial properties, also hydrolyzes a wide range of other proteins, including extracellular matrix proteins like collagen IV <xref rid="pone.0104103-Korkmaz1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>; regulation of its activity is important for balance between beneficial and harmful effects. Both cholesteatoma and the neck of cholesteatoma showed higher levels of ELANE compared to EACS, and higher, but more inconsistent levels, compared with the tympanic membrane. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104103-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104103-g006">6</xref>, the neck of cholesteatoma in particular is rich in proteins with the capacity of degrading extracellular matrix (e.g. PRTN3, ELANE, MPO, MMP9, and HTRA1). The significantly associated biological function "response to bacteria" in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104103-g005">figure 5</xref> indicates, that bacteria, in this case can evoke an immune response. No bacterial proteins were detected inside the tissues in present study (checked by database searches of MS data against a bacterial database), but the presence of bacteria has previously been detected in other cholesteatoma studies <xref rid="pone.0104103-Ricciardiello1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104103-Chole1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. As bacteria are ubiquitous on epidermis surfaces, their role in cholesteatoma is not clear. A constant presence of bacteria may chronically attract and activate immune cells, which have been found in high numbers in cholesteatoma <xref rid="pone.0104103-Szczepanski1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104103-Aberg1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. This possible chronic bacteria-induced inflammatory activation of proteases may explain the low abundance of extracellular matrix proteins in cholesteatoma. Among the up-regulated proteases in cholesteatoma tissues, HTRA1 (High temperature requirement A1, serine protease) is a novel finding which has interesting characteristics. This protease has been found in high levels in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis <xref rid="pone.0104103-Grau1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, and Alzheimer's disease <xref rid="pone.0104103-Grau2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>.

HTRA1 may therefore also have a role in the erosion of the ossicles that that is associated with cholesteatoma disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Down-regulation of translation (eif2) and oxidative stress (Nrf2) signaling</title><p>&#x0201c;eIF2 signaling&#x0201d; is the canonical pathway that showed the strongest association to the regulated proteins in cholesteatoma. A down-regulation of this pathway, which is a known reaction to cellular stress, reduces the global protein synthesis to limit the detrimental effects of toxins and ROS. All 11 associated proteins from this pathway were down-regulated in the large-scale analysis. However, the down-regulation of two representative proteins, NRAS and EIF3K did not reach significance in the validation analyses, indicating that parts of this stress pathway have high biological variation. The proteins associated with other high scoring stress-related canonical pathways (&#x0201c;Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Glutathione-mediated detoxification&#x0201d;) were down-regulated as well.

The present study replicated the identification of all the above-mentioned cytokeratins. In addition, the cytokeratins 2, 3, 9, 23, 76, 77, 78, 79, and 80 were also identified (excluding 11 identified hair/hair follicle keratins). All cytokeratins were identified in all five tissues. KRT4 is a keratin of mucosal stratified squamous epithelia and is normally absent in epidermis <xref rid="pone.0104103-Moll1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In the present study, it was detected in all tissues and found in higher levels in cholesteatoma compared to the neck of cholesteatoma and EACS, indicating alterations and poorer differentiation of the cholesteatoma keratinocytes. The higher levels of the primary- and secondary cytokeratins of simple epithelial cells (KRT 7, 8, and 19) in cholesteatoma and/or the tympanic membrane in comparison with EACS also support this finding. Vennix <italic>et al</italic>. found induction of KRT4 and KRT7 in a meatal-to-middle ear skin graft animal model <xref rid="pone.0104103-Vennix1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

In the present study, there was a tendency towards higher levels of a wide range of cytokeratins in cholesteatoma (15 out of 25) compared with the other keratinizing tissues. Increased complexity of the cytokeratin expression pattern often parallels the reduction in the degree of differentiation found in reactive conditions <xref rid="pone.0104103-Moll1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Both the general tendency and the specific up-regulated cytokeratins in cholesteatoma in this study indicate a lower degree of differentiation compared with the tissues from which it is believed to originate, which could have big consequences on the behavior of the cells in cholesteatoma.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>S100 proteins</title><p>Multiple S100 proteins showed high levels of expression in cholesteatoma.

The methods used in previous studies (2DE - MALDI ToF) are very different from the large-scale proteomics methods used in the present study exemplified by the difference in number of identified proteins (&#x0003c;20 in earlier studies vs &#x0003e;2400 in the present study). The previous 2DE studies share none of the identified proteins, and the small datasets describe no common biological traits for the disease <xref rid="pone.0104103-Kim3" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104103-Ho2" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>. An issue that has not often been specified in other studies is the frequent use of topical steroids. Steroid use was not allowed within two weeks prior to biopsy in the present study to avoid an iatrogenic depression of inflammatory mediators, which are of great interest and relevance to cholesteatoma pathology. In addition to a general masking of the inflammatory response, the differences in drug availability of EACS, tympanic membrane, and cholesteatoma could skew the relative levels between the tissues and overestimate the inflammatory action in cholesteatoma. To produce widely applicable protein profiles, patients were not sub-grouped by e.g. age or extent of bone erosion. The degree of inflammation varies over time in cholesteatoma. We consider times of severe infection/inflammation unsuitable for the investigation of the baseline protein expression of cholesteatoma tissue, if such exists; therefore we selected patients that showed no signs of acute inflammation. Retroauricular skin and EACS are very different, and the relative levels of given proteins in cholesteatoma will therefore differ depending on the reference tissue. Most studies have only used one reference tissue, and EACS is the most commonly used. The use of a panel of reference tissues provided a more nuanced picture of the differential protein levels and identified regulations of proteins specific for cholesteatoma.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This discovery proteomics study implicated several altered biological processes related to the cholesteatoma pathology. From the macroscopic appearance of the tissue, it is not surprising that proteins related to extracellular matrix and basement membrane were prevalent among the regulated proteins in cholesteatoma. The observed down-regulation of several extracellular matrix and basement membrane proteins, such as COL18A1 and NID2, could have great consequences on the integrity of the tissue and lead to altered differentiation (KRT4) and cancer-like alterations that may explain the characteristic phenotype. Up-regulation of proteases, such as ELANE and of pro-inflammatory S100 proteins (e.g. S100A7A and S100A7) were other clear and pronounced protein changes; these regulated biological areas in cholesteatoma may be linked components of a bacteria induced disease mechanism and hold potential as future drug targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0104103.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
