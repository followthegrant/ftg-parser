upon release from multidrug therapy (MDT) in new cases of leprosy, registered at
a referral center in Brazil. This is a longitudinal and retrospective study that
evaluated 260 patients. Multivariate analyses, using both the ordinal logistic
regression, as well as the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm
were performed to determine the factors associated with physical disability upon
release from treatment. The prevalence of disability did not differ
significantly between diagnosis and release from treatment. Number of affected
nerves and sensory impairment upon diagnosis were risk factors for disability at
the end of MDT. The analysis using the CART algorithm resulted in the
development of a clinical score to predict the risk of disability upon release
from MDT. The decision tree may have a direct applicability in clinical practice
for professionals dealing with leprosy, as it allows them to identify patients
with a higher risk of physical disability through the use of simple and widely
available clinical tests. This study also shows that the disability grade upon
admission is the main risk factor for disability upon release from MDT. This
result draws attention to the importance of early diagnosis in disability
prevention.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Complications</kwd><kwd>Leprosy</kwd><kwd>Risk factors</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="26"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous infectious disease caused by the intracellular

the world, presenting a greater importance in developing countries, where it is
endemic<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Neuropathy is the most serious manifestation of the disease, as it can lead
to impairments and disabilities. These are crucial elements that differentiate
leprosy from other diseases given that it has great physical, psychological and
social implications<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>In 2016, 12,437 new cases of leprosy with grade 2 disabilities (G2D) were reported
globally, corresponding to 1.7 per million people. Although it represents a 12%
reduction in the number of new G2D cases, when compared to 14,284 cases detected in
2015, some countries detected more new G2D cases in 2016 than in 2015<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. Except for the year 2016, the number of new G2D cases has remained constant
over the past ten years, within the range of 13,000 to 14,000, indicating a
stagnation in leprosy control<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. Due to the magnitude of the problem, the World Health Organization (WHO)
launched in 2016 a 5-year global leprosy strategy to reduce the burden of disease.
The strategy set three main targets to be achieved at global level by 2020:
reduction of new G2D cases in children to zero, a reduction in the rate of new G2D
cases to less than 1 case per million people and zero countries with laws that allow
discrimination against leprosy<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>To treat leprosy properly, it is necessary to have an in-depth knowledge of its
epidemiology and the determining factors of disability<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. Stagnation in the control of leprosy, especially in the number of new cases
with grade 2 disabilities, emphasizes the need for further research on preventive
measures<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. More evidence of risk factors for nerve function impairment is important to
prioritize the follow-up of high-risk patients and to develop disability prevention
strategies<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. Various studies have identified factors associated with physical disability
upon diagnosis, such as age, sex, classification, duration of disease, number of
skin lesions, number of affected nerves and socioeconomic factors<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Studies that analyze risk factors for disabilities upon release from
treatment are less common, especially in Brazil. As the epidemiology of the disease
varies greatly worldwide, a certain population may present specific risk factors for
disabilities, in addition to factors that are common to all populations. The present
study aims to identify and quantify the factors associated with the presence of
physical disability upon release from MDT in new cases of leprosy at a referral
center in Brazil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This is a longitudinal and retrospective study performed at Eduardo de Menezes
Hospital (HEM), which is a public referral center in dermatology located in Belo
Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Clinical and sociodemographic information was
collected from medical records and leprosy notification forms.</p></sec><sec><title>Study subjects and sample size</title><p>All new untreated cases of leprosy admitted to HEM for treatment over the period
of 2005-2010 were eligible for this study. Patients who for any reason did not
complete MDT at the referral center were later excluded. In the observed period,
342 new cases were reported. After analyzing the medical records, 82 patients
were excluded (45 were transferred, 35 discontinued treatment and two died).
Therefore, 260 new cases were included in the study.</p><p>As it was a convenience sample, the sample size calculation was not performed
before the study. Considering the sensory impairment as the main factor to
describe the grade of disability upon release from MDT, a sample of 260 patients
has a 99% power to detect the associations found at a significance level of
5%.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>The study procedures were part of the medical care routine of HEM. Upon
admission, all patients were submitted to dermatoneurological examination,
performed by a dermatologist, to confirm the diagnosis. Nerve function
assessment was repeated every three months and upon release from MDT in
asymptomatic patients. Nerve function was assessed monthly in patients with
symptoms of neuritis or leprosy reactions, or under treatment for these
conditions. The neurological examination followed recommendations set forth by
the Brazilian Ministry of Health<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Upon admission, skin smears were collected from all patients, in ear lobes, one
skin lesion and one sample from the elbow. As recommended by the Brazilian
Ministry of Health, patients received MDT according to their operational
classification<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The follow-up period of the study varied from six to nine months for
paucibacillary cases (PB) and from 12 to 18 months for the multibacillary cases
(MB). MB patients treated with alternative regimens without rifampicin were
followed-up for 24 to 36 months.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Variables</title><p>The explanatory variables in the analyses included: age, gender, origin, schooling,
method of case detection, number of skin lesions, number of affected nerves, type of
neural alteration, operational classification, Madrid classification,
bacteriological index (BI), leprosy reactions, type of treatment and disability
grade upon diagnosis. The response variable was the disability grade upon release
from MDT. All the explanatory variables, with the exception of reactions, were
assessed at the time of diagnosis. The occurrence of leprosy reactions was
investigated during the entire follow-up period.</p><p>Nerves were considered to be affected in the presence of nerve enlargement and/or
sensory impairment and/or motor impairment. Sensory impairment was defined as a lack
of response to 0.2 g monofilament (blue) on the hands and to 2.0 g (purple) on the
feet. These reference values were based on a Nepalese study that assessed the touch
sensibility in healthy volunteers<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. Motor impairment was defined as any reduction in strength identified in the
voluntary muscle testing.</p><p>The Madrid Classification was used to determine the clinical forms. For the
operational classification, the number of skin lesions and BI were used. Patients
with up to five lesions were classified as PB and patients with six lesions or more
as MB. In addition, all cases with positive BI were classified as MB<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Type 1 or 2 reactions were diagnosed when in the presence of reactional skin lesions,
accompanied or not by evidence of neuritis. Nerve function impairment, with or
without pain or nerve tenderness, and without other reaction symptoms, was
classified as isolated neuritis.</p><p>Regarding treatment, MDT/PB and MDT/MB were categorized as standard MDT regimens.
Therapeutic schemes substituting at least one of the drugs were classified in the
same category: alternative MDT regimens.</p><p>The maximum disability grade was assessed upon admission and release from MDT, as
recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. Grade 1 disability was defined as the inability to feel the 2 g
monofilament on the hands and feet, or the lack of immediate blinking in the eye
exam using dental floss. Grade 2 disability was defined as the presence of one or
more of the following alterations: lagophthalmos, ectropion, trichiasis, corneal
opacity, a central visual acuity of less than 0.1 or an inability to count fingers
at six meters, trophic and/or traumatic lesions on hands or feet, claws,
absorptions, wrist drop, foot drop and ankle contractures<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>.</p><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The marginal homogeneity test was used to compare the disability grade upon
diagnosis and release from treatment. In the univariate analyses, Pearson&#x02019;s
chi-squared test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test were used to compare the categorical
variables, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the numerical
variables. Non-parametric tests were used due to the asymmetric character of the
analyzed variables.</p><p>For the multivariate analysis, an ordinal logistic regression model was used<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. The variables with a p-value below 0.20 in the univariate analysis were
included in the multivariate model. In the final model, the significant
variables remained within the 5% significance level. A multivariate analysis was
also performed by means of a decision tree, using the Classification and
Regression Tree (CART) algorithm<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. In this analysis, an improvement of at least 0.01 was used as a stop
criterion. SPSS 15.0 and STATA 10.0 were used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Eduardo de Menezes

females (46.9%), with an average age of 44 years upon diagnosis. One hundred and
sixty three of the cases were multibacillary (62.7%) and the most common form of the
disease was the borderline (54.6%). During the follow-up period, 29 patients (11.2%)
presented a type 1 reaction, 48 (18.5%) with isolated neuritis and 41(15.8%)
presented a type 2 reaction. Upon diagnosis, nerve enlargement was observed in 70
(26.9%) of the cases, sensory impairment in 100 (38.5%), and motor impairment in 52
(20.0%), with the mean number of affected nerves reaching 2.5.</p><p>Upon diagnosis, 56 patients (21.5%) presented grade 1 disability, while 42 (16.2%)
presented grade 2. The prevalence of disability did not differ significantly between
diagnosis and release from treatment (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table

release from MDT and, therefore, were included in the univariate and multivariate
analyses.</p><p>

</p><p>Factors associated with the disability grade upon release from MDT, according to the
CART algorithm were the number of affected nerves, presence of sensory impairment
and gender (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>). The number of affected
nerves upon admission was the main factor associated with the disability grade upon
release from treatment. Patients with three or more affected nerves presented a
54.7% probability of having grade 2 disabilities by the end of the treatment. In
this patients&#x02019; subgroup, it was also observed that when more than nine nerves were
affected, this probability increased even further, reaching 95.7%. By contrast,
patients with up to two nerves affected upon admission presented less chances of
disability. To assess the disability risk in this subgroup of patients, the second
important factor was sensory impairment upon diagnosis. The presence of this type of
impairment increased the probability of grade 2 disability from 1.3% to 11.1%. The
male gender was the third factor associated with the presence of disability upon
release from treatment in a small subgroup (patients with up to two affected nerves
and with sensory impairment). The model presented good adjustment with an estimated
risk of 0.19 indicating that the decision tree is able to correctly classify 81% of
data variability.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The factors associated with physical disabilities upon release from MDT were the
number of affected nerves, sensory impairment, and, primarily, the presence of
physical disability upon diagnosis. A multivariate analysis using ordinal logistic
regression showed that the risk of physical disability upon release from MDT
progressively increases with an increasing number of affected nerves upon admission.
For each affected nerve presented upon admission, the chance of presenting grade 1
disability at the end of treatment increased by 1.35 fold, while the risk of having
grade 2 disability increased by 1.81 fold. Ordinal logistic regression also showed
that the presence of sensory impairment upon diagnosis increased by almost seven
times the chance of presenting grade 1 disability and by 45 times the chance of
presenting grade 2 disability upon release from MDT.</p><p>The multivariate analysis, using the CART algorithm, showed similar risk factors and
supported the findings from ordinal logistic regression. It also enabled the
development of a decision rule that may have direct applicability in the clinical
practice of professionals dealing with leprosy. The decision tree allows for these
professionals to identify patients with an increased risk of physical disabilities,
and who should thus be followed up more carefully. Another advantage of the decision
tree is that the factors used to predict the risk of disability upon release from
MDT can be assessed with simple and widely available clinical tests (nerve
palpation, sensory testing and voluntary muscle testing). Although promising, the
applicability of the clinical rule needs to be confirmed by additional research,
including prospective studies in different populations.</p><p>However, when the disability grade upon diagnosis was included in the multivariate
analysis, only this variable remained in the final model, which indicates that the
disability grade upon admission is the main risk factor for disability upon release
from MDT.</p><p>The main limitation of the study is the fact that it is retrospective, with the
possibility of information bias. The development of the present study in a referral
hospital in Brazil, with high rates of multibacillary cases and impairment upon
diagnosis, limits the extrapolation of results to other contexts, such as basic
health units and other populations.</p><p>A broad variation was observed in the prevalence of nerve function impairment and
physical disabilities due to leprosy in different studies. One cohort study in
Bangladesh showed sensory impairment in 11.9% of the cases and motor impairment in
7.39%<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>, while, in a study conducted in Nepal, sensory and motor impairment occurred
in 29.0 and 24.0% of cases, respectively<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>. In the present study, the prevalence of nerve function impairment was high.
Sensory impairment was observed in 38.5% of the cases and motor impairment in 20.0%.
In relation to the disability grade upon diagnosis, the percentage of patients with
grade 1 and grade 2 was, respectively, 9.6% and 5.9% in Bangladesh<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>, 11.0% and 7.3% in Thailand<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>, 29.1% and 10.1% in Minas Gerais<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>, and 31.0% and 27.0% in Ethiopia<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>. The present study also showed high rates of disability upon diagnosis
(21.5% of grade 1 and 16.2% of grade 2), even though these rates were still lower
than those reported in Ethiopia. Differences in the prevalence of nerve function
impairment and physical disability could be explained by several factors, including
differences in patient selection criteria, in the proportion of MB cases in the
population, in the disability grading system used, and in the nerve function
assessment. Studies that assess tactile sensations using a ballpoint pen, as is the
case of cohorts in Bangladesh and Thailand, could underestimate the prevalence of
sensory impairment<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> .</p><p>The proportion of new cases with grade 2 disability upon diagnosis among all new
cases detected during the year is used as an indicator of the quality of case
detection activities. Percentages equal to or greater than 10% are considered
high<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. In Brazil, there was an increase in the proportion of new cases detected
with grade 2 disabilities from 7.5% in 2015 to 8,3% in 2017<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>. The high prevalence of grade 2 disability upon admission in the present
study (16.2%) could be related to the fact that it was conducted in a referral
center which deals with high complexity cases, as well as to the delay in diagnosis,
due to the lack of awareness of the early warning signs of disease and the low
capacity of basic health care units to recognize and treat leprosy as early as
possible.</p><p>The multivariate analysis findings support previous studies showing that the number
of affected nerves and the presence of nerve function impairment upon diagnosis were
associated with physical disabilities. In a Nepalese study, the presence of more
than three enlarged nerves increased the chance of impairment by 3.3 fold<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">

enlarged nerves increased the risk of impairment by 1.2 fold<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

during two years of follow-up included MB classification, the presence of one or

disability in leprosy. In a retrospective study conducted in a basic health care
unit in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, the factors associated with
progression in the disability grade, in a multivariate analysis using the decision
tree included: disability grade upon admission, type of physiotherapy treatment,
dose of steroids, age, number of affected nerves and occurrence of leprosy
reactions<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The present study showed that the disability grade upon admission is the main risk
factor for disability upon release from MDT. Other studies have similar findings. A
retrospective study in Bangladesh showed that only 1.6% of the PB and 7.9% of the MB
patients without initial disabilities presented nerve function impairment during the
period of treatment<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. A cohort study conducted in Ethiopia, with 592 new leprosy cases, compared
the maximum grade of disability and the eye-hand-foot impairment score (EHF score)
at three moments: admission, release from treatment and between 24 and 48 months
after release from MDT. Overall, the EHF score distributions did not change
significantly over time<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>. The Ethiopian cohort study demonstrated that the initial disability grade
is still the main prognostic factor even five years after release from treatment.
Patients with initial EHF scores of 1 or 2 had a relative risk of 9.1, whereas
patients with scores equal to or higher than 3 presented 65 times higher risk of
disability five years after release from MDT<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">

different countries, demonstrating that risk factors for disabilities in Brazil are
similar to the ones found in other populations. Thus, strategies to reduce the
prevalence of disabilities could be developed globally, with contributions from all
highly endemic countries.</p><p>The present study reinforces that the greater the disability grade upon admission,
the higher the probability of disability upon release from MDT. It is known that the
presence of disability upon admission is an important indicator of delay in
diagnosis. Therefore, this study emphasizes the great importance of early detection
and treatment of leprosy to prevent disabilities and deformities.</p><p>The major impact of this study in the clinical practice is the development of a
clinical score that can be used to predict the risk of disability at the end of
treatment. The decision tree is based on simple clinical tests, which are available
worldwide with no additional costs and can be applied in a wide range of health
services. It may be useful in other settings, but it must be externally validated
before its application can be scientifically justified in other populations.
Nonetheless, we expect that patients in other settings will behave similarly since
the risk factors for physical disabilities are similar, as are the almost universal
methods of nerve-function assessment and treatment in leprosy. Additional research,
including prospective studies in different populations, is required to confirm the
applicability of the decision tree in daily practice.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Britton</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Lockwood</surname><given-names>DN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Leprosy</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2004</year><volume>363</volume><fpage>1209</fpage><lpage>1219</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15081655</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Haimanot</surname><given-names>RT</given-names></name><name><surname>Melaku</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Leprosy</article-title><source>Curr Opin Neurol</source><year>2000</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>317</fpage><lpage>322</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10871258</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rodrigues</surname><given-names>LC</given-names></name><name><surname>Lockwood</surname><given-names>DN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Leprosy now: epidemiology, progress, challenges, and research
