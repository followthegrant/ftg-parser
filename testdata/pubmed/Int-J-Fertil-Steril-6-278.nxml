preserve fertility in patients that face premature
ovarian failure, including immature and
mature oocyte, and embryo cryopreservation.
Each direction has its own benefits and limitations.
In cases where chemotherapy cannot be
postponed, cryopreservation of ovarian tissue
is an option (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A large number of follicles
at different developmental stages are present
in mammalian ovaries and the ovarian cortex
of young women can be considered a potential
storage source for oocytes that could be used
for clinical, agricultural, and zoological purposes
(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Thus, as the oocytes of primordial
follicles are less liable to cytogenetic errors,
they are favorable for cryopreservation (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).
Studies on murine models have shown development
of primordial to preantral follicles in
vivo, followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> growth (IVG), <italic>in vitro</italic>
maturation (IVM), fertilization and further development (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Cryopreserved primordial
follicles in their natural environment can be
used for fertility preservation in different ways.
Orthotopic transplantation of fresh or cryopreserved
ovarian tissues have resulted in recovery
of folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, ovulation,
and fertilization followed by the production of
embryos or the delivery of live young (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).
There are three ways to utilize frozen-thawed
ovarian tissue: heterotopic autografting, orthotopic
autografting and xenografting. Ovarian
tissue could be transplanted to the site of the
original tissue (orthotopic) or it can be at a heterotopic
site followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization
(IVF). Experiences on autotransplantation of
cryopreserved ovarian tissue have shown that
this method can restore endocrine function and
fertility in animals (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and humans (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Autotransplantation of cryopreserved ovarian
tissue offers the possibility of restoring ovarian
function in women and children after highly gonadotoxic
cancer treatment. Theoretically, orthotopic
autotransplantation can restore normal
reproductive function, which leads to natural
conception. A live birth in a primate following
a fresh ovarian tissue transplant and the first
live birth in a human after orthotopic transplantation
of cryopreserved ovarian tissue have
been reported in 2004 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). After completion of
chemotherapy treatment, the ovarian tissue is
considered for reimplant. Tissue ischemia after
grafting, however, can cause a significant loss
of follicles (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and consequently shorten the
life span of ovarian grafts. The transplantation
site is one of the most important factors (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).
The reimplantation site can be orthotopic (pelvic
cavity) or heterotopic (forearm) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), beneath
the abdominal skin (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and pelvic side
wall (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We have shown previously that the
back muscle is an available transplantation site
for follicle survival and development in mice
(<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). As with other groups, this location has
been proven to be a promising site for ovarian
tissue transplantation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, further
investigations and experiments are necessary
for this location to become a suitable site for
transplantation. The aim of this experiment is
to investigate the developmental potential cumulus
oocyte complexes (COCs) derived from
cryopreserved-transplanted ovaries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this experimental study, all chemicals were
purchased from Sigma company (Germany), except
those mentioned below.</p><sec><title>Animals</title><p>
Animal experiments were performed according
to the Declaration Helsinki and the Guiding Principles
in the Care and Use of Animals (DHEW publication,
NIH, 80-23).</p><p>For the experiments, we used female NMRI mice
that were housed, bred and kept at a temperature of
20-25&#x000b0;C and 50% humidity under light-controlled
conditions (12 hour light/12 hour dark) and provided
with sterile food and water in the Central
Animal House of Royan Institute according to national
standards.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental groups</title><p>
We euthanized two-week-old mice, after which
their left ovaries were removed and immediately
placed in &#x003b1;-MEM medium at room temperature.
The fat tissue surrounded the ovaries were removed
under a loop (5 minutes). Then, we immediately
collected the ovaries to perform the cryopreservation
procedure. After two weeks of cryopreservation,
whole ovaries were thawed and autotransplanted
to the same mouse from which the ovary
had been removed. Three weeks after transplantation
of thawed ovaries, the seven-week-old mice
were killed and the grafted ovaries on the gluteus
muscle tissue were collected. These ovaries were
considered the experimental group (Vit-trans
group). In addition to the collection of grafted ovaries,
we also collected the right ovaries from the
same mice, which were considered to be the opposite
ovaries (Opp) group. For the control group,
both ovaries of age matched (seven-week-old) female
mice were collected (7 week-fresh group).</p></sec><sec><title>Ovary vitrification and thawing</title><p>
Following ovariectomy, the ovaries were immediately
vitrified. During vitrification, ovaries were
immersed in an equilibration solution composed
of 7.5% DMSO and 7.5% ethylene glycol (EG) in
HEPES-buffer TCM 199 (Gibco, USA; pH=7.4) supplemented with 20% human serum albumin
(HSA) (Octapharma, Switzerland) for 15 minutes
at room temperature. Ovaries were subsequently
transferred into the vitrification solution that consisted
of 15% EG, 15% DMSO, and 0.5 M sucrose
in HEPES-buffer TCM 199 (pH=7.4) supplemented
with 20% HSA for 30 minutes. Each whole ovary
was placed on the Cryotop (Kitazato Co., Ltd.,
Fujinomiya, Japan) polyester sheet with a minimum
volume of the vitrification solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>).
The sheets were plunged immediately into liquid
nitrogen and capped. After placing the cryotops in
their cassettes, we transferred them to a nitrogen
tank where they remained for two weeks.</p><p>For thawing, after pulling up the cryotops from
liquid nitrogen, the sheets were placed directly in
a thawing solution composed of 1 M sucrose in
HEPES-buffer TCM199 (pH=7.4) supplemented
with 20% HSA for 10 minutes at room temperature.
The ovaries were detached from the sheet
and transferred to &#x003b1;-MEM medium (Gibco, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and an antibiotic solution composed of penicillin
G (100 IU) and streptomycin (100 IU) after which
ovaries were incubated for 30 minutes.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Whole mouse ovary on the Cryotop polyester sheet.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Int-J-Fertil-Steril-6-278-g01"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Transplantation</title><p>Thawed ovaries were immediately transplanted
back into the same female mouse which had her
left ovary removed two weeks prior. At this time,
we anesthetized four-week-old mice with intraperitoneal
injections of 10% ketamine (100 mg/
kg; Alfasan, Woerden, Holland) and 2% xylazine
(10 mg/kg; Alfasan, Woerden, Holland). The concentrations
of 100 mg/ml Ketamine and 20 mg/ml Xylazine were diluted in 8.5 ml physiological serum;
0.1 g body weight was injected.</p><p>After a full incision through the dermal tissue
and the placement of an incision along the gluteus
superficialis muscle fibers, the ovary was inserted
within the muscle incision. The muscle fiber was sutured
with 5-0 non-absorbable vicryl surgical thread
(Ethicon, Belgium) in order to allow detection of
the transplantation site. The skin was sutured with
6-0 absorbable threads (prolene; Ethicon, Belgium).
Following the grafting procedure and recovery, animals
were kept in the animal room.</p></sec><sec><title>Gonadotropin treatment</title><p>
About 72 hours prior to ovary removal, we injected
7.5 IU/ml PMSG (Folligon, Intervet) in mice
from both the experimental and control groups; 48
hours later, both groups received 7.5 IU/ml hCG
(Pregnyl, Organon) and after 14 hours we collected
the ovaries.</p></sec><sec><title>Graft recovery</title><p>
At three weeks following transplantation, mice
were killed by cervical dislocation. Grafted and
Opp were removed from the experimental groups
and fresh ovaries were removed from intact mice
for oocyte isolation.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanical dissection and oocyte isolation</title><p>
Each ovary was mechanically dissected by a 26-
gauge needle in &#x003b1;-MEM droplets supplemented
with 10% v/v FBS and antibiotic solution (penestrep).
Released oocytes and COCs from the
ovary were selected for IVM or IVF by the following
criteria. Those oocytes and COCs that lacked
polar bodies were chosen and divided into two
groups: germinal vesicle (GV) and germinal vesicle
breakdown (GVBD). Both groups were transferred
to IVM culture medium.</p><p>The oocytes and COCs that contained polar bodies
were selected and transferred to IVF medium. For selection,
the oocytes had to be visible and round in shape.</p></sec><sec><title>Oocyte <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation</title><p>
IVM medium was composed of &#x003b1;-MEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 100 mIU/ml rhFSH
(GONAL-f, Serono) and 7.5 IU/ml hCG (Pregnyl,
Organon). After a 16 hour incubation period,
we observed oocytes and COCs (after pipetting
to remove granolusa cells) to determine
which had released first the polar bodies. These
were assessed as metaphase II (MII) stage
oocytes, which were subsequently transferred
to IVF medium.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF)</title><p>
We used 7- to 14-week-old adult male mice to
obtain sperm. The caudae epididymides were cut
in several zones and placed in a 1 ml droplet of
T6 medium supplemented with 15 mg/kg BSA.
Droplets were covered with mineral oil and incubated
for at least 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for sperm capacitation.
About 10 mature MII oocytes were added to
the 100-150 &#x000b5;L droplet of sperm suspension at a
concentration of 0.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> sperm per ml and then
incubated for at least 4 hours. The oocytes were
pipetted to remove the attached sperm and monitored
under a microscope for the presence of a second
polar body or two pronuclei (2PN) to confirm
fertilization.</p></sec><sec><title>Embryo culture</title><p>
About 10 fertilized oocytes were cultured in a 20
&#x000b5;l droplet comprised of T6 medium supplemented
with 4 mg/ml BSA. Droplets were covered with
mineral oil. The developmental stages of the embryos
were observed at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours
after fertilization.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>
All numbers are presented as percentages. Analyses
and comparison of significances were performed
by the Chi-square test. P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered
to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>All Vit-trans mouse ovaries (n=15) were recovered
five weeks following vitrification and transplantation.
We collected the Opp ovaries (n=6) and
age-matched 7w-fresh mouse ovaries (n=10). There
were 66 oocytes, which included 16 COCs and 50
denuded oocytes collected from dissected Vit-trans
ovaries. There were 106 (47 COCs, 59 denuded

and 83 (53 COCs, 30 denuded oocytes) oocytes collected
from 7w-fresh ovaries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>We recorded the IVM rates of oocytes recovered
from transplanted and OPP ovaries for each female
mouse (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We considered each ovary
as one replication. After IVM, 43.8% of COCs
and 38% of denuded oocytes reached stage MII
in the Vit-trans group. The maturation rate of denuded
oocytes in Vit-trans group was significantly
lower than the 7w-fresh control group (76.7%).
There was a significantly lower percentage of MII
oocytes following IVM of the Opp group&#x02019;s denuded
oocytes (27.1%) compared to the 7w-fresh group.
There was a significant difference in the GVBD
rate of Vit-trans (37.5%) and Opp group (10.6%)

is still ischemia. Attempts have been
made to overcome ischemia-related damage
that exists at transplantation by treatment with
GnRH and antioxidant agents in addition to
microvascular anastomosis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Through our
previous study we have demonstrated that the
gluteal muscle is a suitable site for ovarian
transplantation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The combination of the
cryopreservation method using cryotops and
transplantation in the gluteal muscle has been
evaluated by the histological examination of
transplanted ovaries. Histological results indicated
that this method increased both the numbers
of good quality follicles and angiogenesis
(<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>In this research, we evaluated the IVM, IVF
and IVD rates of oocytes following cryopreservation
of whole ovaries on cryotops and
subsequent autotransplantation. During ovarian
dissection and oocyte retrieval, there was
an elevated rate of denuded oocytes in the
Vit-trans and Opp groups compared to the 7wfresh
group. The IVM rates of COCs retrieved
from Vit-trans and 7w-fresh groups were the
same, as was the IVF rate and developmental
competence of oocytes that reached the 8-cell
stage. The freezing protocol used during this
research contained EG. According to Salehnia
et al. the vitrification of whole mouse ovaries using EG was useful and had no harmful effects
on follicle morphology (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It has been
shown that vitrification of mouse ovarian tissue
on a cryotop could highly preserve the
viability of ovarian preantral follicles (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).
The current research confirmed those previous
findings. In a previous experiment, we observed
partial restoration of ovarian function
following freezing/thawing and heterotopic autotransplantation
of whole ovine ovaries. In that
research, the IVM of oocytes and subsequent
embryo development was successful (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Another
research on the transplantation of whole
ovine ovaries resulted in a live birth (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>During this research the whole ovary was
transplanted to the gluteal muscle. We have
previously demonstrated that the gluteal muscle
is suitable site for ovarian transplantation
(<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The same rates of IVM and IVF in both
the Vit-trans and 7w-fresh groups have shown
that cryopreservation of whole ovaries using
a cryotop with subsequent transplantation to
the gluteal muscle preserves ovarian function.
There were no significant differences in the
percentage of arrested oocytes at the GV stage.
However the rates of oocytes that reached the
GVBD and MII stages in denuded oocytes were
lower in the Vit-trans and Opp groups compared
to the 7w-fresh group. We did not observe
those differences in COCs, which could
be attributed to the role of cumulus cells for
IVM. It has been shown that the presence of
granolusa cells around the oocyte is necessary
for uptake of nutrients and essential factors for
oocyte development (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), therefore the IVM,
IVF and IVD rates of mouse immature oocytes
with cumulus cells are higher than denuded immature
oocytes (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>The lower percentage of GVBD and MII
oocytes, the higher percentage of degenerated
oocytes and lower IVF rates in the Opp group
in contrast to other groups might result from
the adverse effect of FSH and LH up regulation
during two weeks of vitrification and the few
days of transplantation followed by hormone
therapy in the absence of other ovary. Although
the fertilization rate in the Vit-trans group was
lower than 7w-fresh group, this difference was
not significant. It has been reported that the
presence of granolusa cells around the oocytes
caused a higher IVF rate (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore this difference
could be the result of a lower COCs/denuded
oocyte rate in the Vit-trans group. In the
Vit-trans group, embryo development reached
the 8-cell stage with no significant difference
in the embryo development rate compared to
the control group, however this development
did not proceed to the morula and blastocyst
stages. Possibly, with the use of sequential embryo
culture media, the 8-cell embryos might
continue IVD to the blastocyst stage. In previous
studies, we have shown that vitrification
was less deleterious to mouse ovarian tissue in
contrast with transplantation ischemia injuries
(<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In the present study the most concerning
result was the blockage of embryo development
at the 8-cell stage, which was possibly
the result of suboptimal <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. According
to the previous study which claimed
that vitrification caused less injuries in ovarian
tissue, it was more probable that this blockage
did not result from the vitrification method
(<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>); rather, transplantation injuries and/or in
vitro culture problems were more likely explanations.</p><p>Despite lower retrieval of COCs from Vittrans
ovaries, it seems that for <italic>in vitro</italic> procedures
COCs are more competent. Thus it is better
to use COCs for <italic>in vitro</italic> embryo production.
The main concern with autotransplantation of
ovarian tissue in cancer patients is the risk of
re-introducing cancer cells and metastasis. Although
follicle culture is an alternative, but
concerns about the formation and integrity of
imprints in oocytes growing and ripening in
vitro still remain, which could result in embryonic
death or unhealthy offspring (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>IVD of generated embryos from Vit-trans
ovaries was observed. The combination of cryopreservation
(cryotop) and subsequent transplantation
on gluteal muscle have been shown
to preserve ovarian function. Research is ongoing
for ovarian cryopreservation, transplantation
and subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> procedures. Thus,
more intensive research on ovarian transplantation
and the subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> procedures is
necessary in order to improve the efficiency of this process and its clinical applications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a Grant-in-Aid
