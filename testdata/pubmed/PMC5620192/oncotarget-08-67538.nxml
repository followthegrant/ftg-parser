KAI1/CD82 is a metastasis suppressor gene whose normal protecting activity is deficient in twelve different solid malignancies. Here we have identified and characterized a primarily nuclear non-polyadenylated, antisense (as)-lncRNA, initiating upstream of the KAI1 human metastasis suppressor gene transcription start site; and elongating in the opposite direction to KAI1 mRNA. We show that the KAI1 promoter is bi-directional giving rise to KAI1 mRNA and its as-lncRNA. Moreover, expression of this lncRNA transcript emerges to be inversely related to the KAI1 mRNA expression, and in direct relationship to the invasiveness level of human breast cancer derived cell lines. Importantly, knockdown of the KAI1 as-lncRNA in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 have led to increased KAI1 mRNA and protein expression, manifested in stronger adhesion to fibronectin, retardation of cell migration and reduced cell invasion <italic>in vitro</italic>. Accordingly we have named this lncRNA, SKAI1BC, standing for &#x0201c;Suppressor of KAI1 in Breast Cancer&#x0201d;. These results uncover a potential way to harness tumor metastasis via targeting SKAI1BC in human breast cancer, and perhaps also in other KAI1-deficient human malignancies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>metastasis suppressor genes</kwd><kwd>triple-negative breast cancer</kwd><kwd>epigenetic gene regulation</kwd><kwd>lncRNA and metastasis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTROUCTION</title><p>Curiously, only a small percentage of cancer causations are attributed to variations of protein coding sequences, while more frequent being changes in gene expression levels [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recently, growing evidence indicate that lncRNAs are involved in tumorigenesis by showing aberrant expression in cancer cells in comparison to healthy tissue cells [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Two early on examples has to do with the tumor suppressors p15 and p21 and their promoters&#x02019; spanning antisense lncRNAs (p15-as; p21-as). Ectopic expression of siRNAs against the natural promoter spanning antisense lncRNAs of p15 and p21, have re-activated these transcriptionally silenced tumor suppressor genes, which indicates oncogenic features of these antisense lncRNAs [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These latter results point toward the potential of promoter-directed shRNAs to activate gene expression of tumor/metastasis suppressor genes silenced by promoter spanning as-lncRNAs. Surprisingly, divergent transcription that results in a sense mRNA and an antisense lncRNA (as-lncRNA) has been observed in &#x0223c;50-80% of human protein coding gene promoters [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These bi-directional promoters are associated among others with neuronal functions, regulation of tumor suppressors and oncogenes [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The KAI1 metastasis suppressor gene (also known as CD82 or Tspan27), is located on human chromosome 11p11.2 and encodes for a 267 amino acid transmembrane protein that belongs to the tetraspanin family. According to the Ensembl gene browser, the KAI1 transcript can be found in 14 splice variants of which only the main variant leads to translation of the functional protein. Numerous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that KAI1 over-expression inhibits cell motility and invasion [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Tumor cells must detach from the cell mass in order to invade adjacent tissue. The ability to invade is associated with the transition of cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion molecules. It has been suggested that KAI1 has the ability to reorganize the assembly of membrane proteins and molecular concentration of integrins, which modulate the adhesive strength of the cell and promotes cell aggregation [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As a metastasis suppressor, KAI1 has not only the task to suppress cell motility but also to prevent invasion of tumor cells by inactivating proteases that degrade the extracellular matrix. KAI1 causes a redistribution of urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (uPAR) and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrins. This redistribution results in macromolecular assemblies that prevent uPAR from binding its ligand urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and subsequently in a reduced ECM proteolysis. KAI1 has been identified as a metastasis suppressor in human prostate, melanoma, sarcoma, pancreatic and breast cancer cell lines. A direct correlation of a good prognosis and KAI1 expression has been observed in the following solid tumors: melanoma, non-small cell lung, breast cancer [reviewed in ref. <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Noteworthy, in at least three solid tumors (gastric, cervical, and ovarian cancers) KAI1 affects not only tumor metastasis but also tumor proliferation. In the case of breast tumors, KAI1 expression is clearly significantly reduced during cancer progression [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. At the transcriptional level KAI1 is upregulated by several transcription factors such as AP2, p53, JunB, and &#x00394;Np63&#x003b1;. Post transcriptionally, in HCC cells KAI1 is negatively regulated via miR-197 interaction with its 3' UTR sequence (8). In several human melanoma cell lines, there is loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the 11p11.2 region which contains the KAI1 gene as well. However, LOH of KAI1 in human cancers is a rare event, and similarly no point mutations have been found in the KAI1 gene in human malignancies (8). Thus, it is being assumed that KAI1 expression in human tumors is being epigenetically silenced by additional mechanisms.</p><p>In this work, through careful RT-PCR analysis of candidate bidirectional promoters among human genes encoding tumor suppressors and metastasis suppressors known to affect breast cancer, we identified a novel lncRNA. Characterization of this nuclear antisense lncRNA, spanning the promoter/enhancer region of the KAI1/CD82 metastasis suppressor gene, has shown that it is a suppressor of the KAI1 gene. Expression of this lncRNA is inversely related to the KAI1 expression, and in direct relationship to the invasiveness level of human breast cancer derived cell lines. As KAI1 is a metastasis suppressor gene in at least 12 solid human tumors, it would be extremely desirable to target this suppressing lncRNA, in the hope to retard or halt cell metastasis all together.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Screening for promoter-spanning lncRNAs of metastasis/tumor suppressor genes in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines</title><p>In order to try identifying new breast cancer affecting lncRNA(s), we followed Morris [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Yu [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] example, by screening for promoter-spanning lncRNAs in metastasis- and/or tumor-suppressor genes, in which reduced transcript/s is the basis for the loss of their gene expression. To this end, the extent of mRNA expression in ten metastasis-/tumor-suppressor genes was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in three different triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines, namely MDA-MB 231, Hs578T and SUM149PT. Upon analysis of these three cell lines, expression of the genes FKBP4, KIF1A and OGDHL seemed to be high in all three. The high transcript levels are likely to indicate a lack of negative transcription regulation in TNBC cell lines and hence these genes were excluded from screening for promoter spanning lncRNA (which might have impeded their gene expression). Contrary, the expression of Cst6, MAL, VGF, RARbeta, Maspin, SYK and KAI1 genes varied, depending on the particular cell line examined. These differences in gene expression might indicate a cell line specific transcriptional regulation.</p><p>To identify lncRNAs, total cellular RNA/nuclear RNA (isolated as outlined in Materials and Methods), was subject to site/primer-specific RT-PCR. To prevent PCR amplification of genomic DNA, the breast cancer cell line extracted RNA was exhaustively treated with DNase. Also, in order to prevent the endogenous RNAs from serving as primers in the RT reaction, the RNA samples were treated with sodium periodate which blocked free 3' RNA ends from serving as endogenous primers in the RT reaction, as we described in Tzadok et al. [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The reverse transcription was performed at elevated temperatures (50-60&#x000b0;C) to prevent false priming. Moreover, the RT reactions were done in the presence of Actinomycin D to prevent the synthesis of the second DNA strand, which may falsely indicate the presence of antisense RNA [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, since Actinomycin D is also a DNA- Polymerase inhibitor, its concentration was diluted to an insignificant amount prior to the PCR reaction step. Noteworthy, out of these seven tested genes only one, KAI1, had an antisense lncRNA spanning its promoter in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>KAI1 as-lncRNA; analysis via RT-PCR</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Products obtained in the presence of actinomycin D in the RTase reaction.

The putative KAI1 as-lncRNA could be detected in RNA reverse transcribed with both RT-enzymes, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), increasing the level of certainty that the product is not based on a template switching event (DNA to RNA or RNA to RNA).</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Structural characterization and subcellular localization of the KAI1 as-lncRNA</title><p>As the KAI1 promoter spanning as-lncRNA proved itself as a <italic>bona fide</italic> long noncoding RNA, a further study concentrated on its physical and functional characterization. In order to determine the 3' end of this lncRNA transcript, RT-PCR &#x0201c;walks&#x0201d; on the KAI1 as-lncRNA transcript towards its 3' end were performed, as graphically presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>. The primer RT5 (CAACGGTGTGTTGTGAGAGG) anneals &#x02212;1180bp upstream of the KAI1 mRNA transcription start site (TSS), specifically, the major TSS, and is the furthest RT primer 5' of the TSS with which an antisense transcript was detected (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The amplified 705 bp product of the RT-PCR reaction with the primers pair RT5 and Promoter-3-R (ATTCCAGGGCGGGTGTAT) is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>.</p><p>The 5' end of the KAI1 as-lncRNA was then determined by performing a 5'-RACE reaction (See M &#x00026; M). Here, a specific oligomer (TCAGCGCTTGGCATAGAG) primed the reverse transcription of the KAI1 as-lncRNA. Afterwards, the generated cDNA was tailed with poly(dT) by a terminal transferase, which enabled the PCR primer with a poly-A leader sequence to anneal, thereby allowing the transcript to be amplified. Next, the products of a Nested-PCR have been cloned and sequenced. The sequencing revealed that the 5'-end of the transcript is located at position &#x02212;386 of the KAI1 mRNA TSS. Interestingly, the detected 5' end, as well as the rest of the sequence are identical to the sequence of a 792 bp long RNA transcript (UCSC Accession wgEncodeEH000148), found through sequencing of the GM12878 whole cell PolyA minus RNA fraction (contig_343318). A product downstream of The 3'-end of the indicated 792bp transcript was not detected by RT-PCR, or by priming the transcript with oligo dT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), thus suggesting absence of a poly-A tail. Therefore, the RNA transcript UCSC Accession wgEncodeEH000148 and the KAI1 as-lncRNA transcript which was identified herein are the same. However, no other information beside the sequence was known/published about this RNA transcript.</p><p>It has been reported that only 17.8% of the human lncRNAs are polyadenylated. In order to test whether the antisense transcript of the KAI1 (spanning the promoter and enhancer regions identified herein) is polyadenylated or not, polyadenylated MDA-MB-231 RNA was pulled down with Oligo (dT)<sub>25</sub> - biotinylated Dynabeads <sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (as outlined in M &#x00026; M), and RT-PCR was performed on the PolyA plus as well as on the flow through (PolyA minus) fraction. The KAI1 as-lncRNA transcript could only be detected in the PolyA minus flow through fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). This implies that the transcript is not polyadenylated.</p><p>In order to estimate the subcellular distribution of the KAI1 as-lncRNA, a semi-quantitative analysis of the RT-PCR product has been performed. Accordingly, 2 &#x003bc;g of nuclear RNA and 2 &#x003bc;g of total RNA have been reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR. The signal in the total RNA sample was much weaker than in the nuclear sample (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), suggesting an enriched KAI1 as-lncRNA fraction in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Human KAI1 as-lncRNA: transcript sequence homology in mammalian species</title><p>An extensive search of homologous transcripts in other species turned out to be fruitful. In the transcriptome shotgun sequencing database, three mammalian transcripts from Equus asinus, Equus przewalskii and Bubalus bubalis have shown high homology to the KAI1 as-lncRNA transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). When superimposing these top 3 homologous transcripts with the KAI1 as-lncRNA sequence, a 78 bp long sequence, which is mutual to all four transcripts, can be identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Its complementary sense sequence has been reported to be a regulatory region (enhancer) of the KAI1 gene, and contains binding motifs for three transcription proteins, AP1, AP2 and p53 [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the triple-negative cell lines which we use are deficient in wt. p53 expression. The finding of this partial homology fits the observations that contrary to short ncRNAs, lncRNAs are not always highly conserved but can be enriched in conserved sequence motifs [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>The KAI1 bi-directional promoter</title><p>As outlined above, the 5' end of the KAI1 as-lncRNA has been identified by 5' RACE and is located in proximity to the canonical KAI1 mRNA TSS. Since the transcript also spans the enhancer region of the KAI1 gene, and might be involved in transcription regulation of the KAI1 mRNA, it was examined whether a coordinately expressed gene pair transcripts, composed of the KAI1 mRNA and KAI1 as-lncRNA are present. In other words, it was examined whether this TATA- less promoter initiates transcription in both directions.</p><p>Toward this goal the pGL3-basic Vector (Promega) was digested with SmaI and blunt-end ligated with the PCR amplified (Q5 polymerase) 1198 bp KAI1 promoter-enhancer region (according to Marreiros et al., in ref. <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); having nucleic acid sequences bounded by the upstream sense sequence GTCAGCTGCACAGCTGAATG, and the downstream antisense sequence ACAGCCCGGGGCTCAGTCAC, respectively, as schematically shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>. The model cells HEK293T were co-transfected by pGL3-firefly luciferase-1198 bp promoter-sense or -antisense orientation, and pTK-Renilla luciferase DNA as an internal normalizing control (see M &#x00026; M). Importantly, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> the promoter in the antisense orientation initiated firefly luciferase transcription, albeit at a &#x0223c;4.7 fold weaker level than the promoter in the sense orientation (i.e. orientation of the KAI1 mRNA). The dual-luciferase assay was also performed in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, which showed as expected a poorer transfection rate, but still indicated a bidirectional activity of the KAI1 promoter (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). In MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells the promoter activity in the sense orientation is only about twice as high as in the antisense orientation. These results indicated that the KAI1 promoter is active in both orientations, manifesting a bidirectional regulation of the KAI1 mRNA and KAI1 as-lncRNA. This finding is not surprising in view of the fact that the KAI1 promoter is known to be GC-rich and to lack a TATA-box. The latter are very common among bidirectional promoters, since the TATA-box usually regulates the directionality of the transcription [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Testing KAI1 for having a bidirectional promoter via dual-luciferase assay</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> 1198 bp test region relative to the KAI1 gene map. <bold>(B)</bold> pGL3-firefly luciferase constructs.

To make sure on this phenotypic important point, the KAI1 open reading frame cDNA was amplified and cloned into the doxycycline-inducible lentiviral expression vector TRIPZ in sense or antisense orientation, as outlined in M &#x00026; M. The inducible expression of both exogenous KAI1 transcripts, in sense (KAI1<sup>OE</sup>) and antisense (KAI1<sup>OE-AS</sup>) orientation in MDA-MB-231 cells was demonstrated by qRT-PCR. Both exogenous transcripts were expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, the sense orientated KAI1 ORF RNA about 3.9 fold, the antisense orientated ORF RNA even 6.8 fold more than the endogenous wild type KAI1 mRNA, leading to &#x0223c;2.2 fold more KAI1 protein and knockdown of the KAI1 polypeptide, respectively (data not shown). Following, TRIPZ (comprising the sense or antisense ORF encoding fragment) infected MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 48 wells and their doubling time was measured every 24 hours, for 4 days.

Since the KAI1 as-lncRNA overlaps the enhancer region of the KAI1 promoter, perhaps this transcript is involved in mediation/inhibition of the transcription factor-DNA interaction, leading to decreased expression of the sense KAI1 mRNA transcript. This might indicate a regulatory role of the KAI1 as-lncRNA.</p><p>Moreover, these results suggest an oncogenic like activity of the KAI1 as-lncRNA as we have demonstrated how shRNA mediated knockdown of the KAI1 as-lncRNA elevates the expression of the silenced KAI1 gene, which in turn rescues the metastatic suppressive attributes of KAI1.

Amplification conditions were as follows (if not stated differently): Initial incubation at 50&#x000b0;C for 2 min. and 95&#x000b0;C for 3min., followed by 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds, 60-61&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds and a final dissociation stage (2 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C 15 sec. and 60&#x000b0;C 1 min.). Calibration curves were performed for every product and primer efficiency was determined, tolerating a range of 95%-105%. Ct values were monitored and analyzed by the 7300 fast Sequence Detection System Software (Applied Biosystems). All reactions were performed in triplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s3_11"><title>Samples preparation for western blot analysis and SDS-PAGE followed by electro-blotting</title><p>This part was carried out according to Gallagher&#x02019;s laboratory [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3_12"><title>Imaging</title><p>The Nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 60 minutes with Odyssey<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Blocking Buffer PBS (LI-COR) at room temperature under constant shaking. After blocking, an overnight incubation with the primary antibody at 4&#x000b0;C followed. The primary polyclonal antibody C-16 (Santa Cruz) raised in rabbits against human CD82 (KAI1) was diluted 1:200 in Odyssey<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Blocking Buffer. On the next day, the membrane was washed three times with PBS-Tween before incubation with the DyLight 800 (KPL) secondary antibody (goat anti rabbit) for 60 minutes at room temperature, diluted 1:10,000 in Odyssey<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Blocking Buffer. After three washes with PBS-tween, the membrane was exposed to infrared detection with the Odyssey<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Infrared Imager (LI-COR). Similarly, immuno-staining with endogenous control antibody FL-335 (rabbit anti human GAPDH; 1: 1,000, Santa Cruz) was for two hours at room temperature followed by secondary antibody DyLight680 (KPL), washing and exposure as outlined above.</p></sec><sec id="s3_13"><title>Cell growth assay</title><p>Cells were seeded at various concentrations in a 96-well plate in four respective triplicates. On day 0 the cells of the first triplicate series were exposed to Resazurin Cell Viability Assay. Cell Viability was determined 24, 48 and 72 hours later with the respective next series. Doubling time was calculated by comparing cell viability at day 1 to day 0, day 2 to day 1, etc.</p></sec><sec id="s3_14"><title>Wound healing assay</title><p>Monolayer cells were grown to 100% confluency and deprived from serum 24 hours prior to the assay. With a plastic pipette tip a scratch was inflicted to the monolayer. Cells were carefully washed with TS and serum free RPMI 1640 medium was added. Random fields of the scratch wound were marked and photographed with a light microscope camera at time 0 and after 24 hours incubation at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s3_15"><title>Migration assay</title><p>To study cell migration, ThinCert&#x02122; (Greiner Bio-One) cell culture inserts were placed in a multi well cell culture plate. The insert contains a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane at the bottom with a pore size of 8 &#x003bc;m that separates the upper from the lower compartment. Then 100,000 serum-starved cells were seeded at the top of the insert in 200 &#x003bc;l serum free media, while the lower compartment contained 10% FBS DMEM media as a chemoattractant that may induce active migration of the seeded cells through the PET membrane. Adherent cells that migrate through the pores remain attached to the under-side of the PET-membrane. After 24 hours, the medium in the inserts and lower compartment was removed, the inserts washed with TS and incubated with Trypsin-EDTA for 10 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C to detach the migrated cells from the under-side of the insert. The migrated cells were seeded in 48-well plate. To estimate the percentage of migrated cells, a Resazurin Cell Viability Assay was performed and compared to the mock control cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3_16"><title>Fibronectin adhesion assay</title><p>Cells grown in 10% FBS containing DMEM were deprived from serum 24 hours prior to the adhesion assay. Forty eight well plates were coated with 10 &#x003bc;g/cm<sup>2</sup> fibronectin diluted in HANK's Balanced Salt Solution and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. On the next day fibronectin coated 48-well plates were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 10mg/ml heated BSA in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then collected, washed twice in PBS and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. Then 50,000, 100,000 or 200,000 cells were seeded in fibronectin coated and uncoated wells, respectively, and incubated for 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. After 30 minutes, unattached cells were washed away. On the next day, cell viability was determined by Resazurin Cell Viability Assay and percent of adherent cells was calculated relative to control wells.</p></sec><sec id="s3_17"><title>Invasion assay</title><p>The ability of cells to invade through extracellular matrix was studied in an invasion assay (29, 30). Therefore, the same method of the ThinCert<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Migration assay was applied with the only difference being that the ThinCert<sup>&#x02122;</sup> inserts had to be coated with basement membrane matrix (Matrigel, Sigma). For coating, Matrigel had to be thawed on ice and diluted in serum free media to 1&#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l and pipetted to the center of the PET-membrane. The coated membrane was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 hours and air dried under sterile conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3_18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was evaluated using the one sample t-test against the null hypothesis that the expectation is 1.
