However, the function of MMP1 expression from host cells, especially tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and cells in the lung parenchyma remains to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that <italic>in vitro</italic> macrophages co-cultured with tumor cells drastically enhance MMP1 expression, which is further exacerbated upon cigarette smoke exposure. In addition, <italic>in vivo</italic>, macrophage specific MMP1 was found to have a causative role in primary tumor development and lung metastasis, which was enhanced under smoke exposure as demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model that expressed human MMP1 specifically in macrophages (Mac-MMP1). In contrast, MMP1 from lung cells (Lung-MMP1) reduced colonization to the lung despite the fact that collagen deposition decreased in the Lung-MMP1 mouse tumors. These results demonstrate that the varying cellular source of MMP1 in tumors leads to the complexity observed in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, macrophage-specific inhibition of MMP1 secretion may be a potential therapy to aid in the reduction of lung metastasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Metalloproteinase</kwd><kwd>Macrophages</kwd><kwd>Metastasis</kwd><kwd>MMP1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Metastatic tumor spread to secondary anatomic sites facilitated by invasion of cancerous cells into the circulatory system is typically the primary cause of mortality in solid tumor disease [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This process beings with destruction of the local tissue architecture by the primary tumor and is subsequently followed by invasion of tumor cells into the surrounding vasculature [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These cancerous cells are then free to establish secondary tumors throughout the body. Tumor induced extracellular matrix (ECM) destruction is critical to the development of a primary tumor and its metastatic progeny [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent endopeptide proteases, are prominently associated with ECM destruction in tumorigenesis and cancer progression [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Of these, MMP-1 is a member of the lung metastatic gene signature (LMS) and is secreted from cancer cells. Notably, evidence also supports MMP secretion from tumor associated fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, inflammatory cells and endothelial cells [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Interestingly, MMP-1 derived from fibroblasts cleaves protease-activated receptor1 (PAR1) resulting in PAR1 dependent migration, this same activity is not observed in tumor derived MMP-1 [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These data suggest stromal-derived MMP-1 mediates tumor invasion via mechanisms independent of its role in ECM destruction. Nevertheless, the precise role for MMP1 in tumor metastasis has not been adequately defined and the specific interactions between various cell types expressing MMP1 in the tumor microenvironment needs further characterization.</p><p id="P3">Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute the majority of tumor-infiltrating immune cells [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with multiple studies suggesting their presence is a poor prognostic indicator for cancer progression [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Macrophages are thought to display different functional phenotypes dependent on their response to the microenvironment [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Mantovani et al. demonstrated two distinct phenotypes characterized by differential expression of macrophage surface markers in response to specific chemical stimuli; M1cells resulted from treatment with IFN-&#x003b3; combined with LPS or TNF while M2 cells where created following exposure to IL-4, IL-10, and glucocorticoids [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. TAMs exhibit an M2 phenotype and promote tumor invasion through high scavenging ability, promotion of angiogenesis, and matrix remodeling [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The TAMs express antigens specific for macrophages including high levels of scavenger receptor-A when compared to macrophages with the M1 phenotype [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and once activated the M2 macrophages interact with cancer cells further up-regulating scavenger receptor-A expression [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Cigarette smoke stimulates the recruitment of inflammatory cells, cell death, and protease production within lung tissue [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recent evidence demonstrates that cigarette smoke induces an M2 phenotype in macrophages via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. MMP-1 is detected in alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells, especially type II pneumocytes, in patients with emphysema [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, increased serum levels of MMP-1 are observed in smokers [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and studies have shown that patients with COPD have an increased risk of cancer [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Previously, our group reported that cigarette smoke induces MMP-1 expression by signaling through the TLR4 receptor [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and promotes phosphorylation of ERK in lung epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages in humans and animal smoke exposure models [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Little is known regarding the mechanisms of cigarette smoke induced MMP-1 expression in primary tumor cells or the lung during cancer metastasis, although studies in humans have shown that cigarette smoke increases the risk of lung metastasis in esophageal cancer patients [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In the present study, we examined the effect of MMP-1 overexpressing TAMs on tumor progression and metastasis compared to tissue derived MMP-1 expression. To achieve these aims, transgenic mice expressing human MMP-1 in macrophages using a scavenger-enhancer receptor A promoter [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] were compared to lung cell-derived MMP-1 expression in various pre-metastatic and metastatic tumor models. These studies provide novel insight into the relationship between MMP-1, lung metastasis and cigarette smoke.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P6">The Lewis lung carcinoma cell line (LLC) (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in Dulbecco&#x02019;s minimal essential medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing penicillin (10,000IU/ mL) and streptomycin (10,000&#x003bc;g/mL). Monocytes were isolated by centrifugation of donated peripheral human blood with Ficoll.

Five slides were randomly selected from the sections at each 200 micrometer interval for microscopic examination. Sections were dewaxed, hydrated through graded alcohols, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H.E.), dehydrated, and mounted with cover slips.

Macrophage MMP-1 expression levels increased significantly after 48 hours of co-culture with the most striking increase observed in CSE exposed M2 macrophages cultured with A549 cells. MMP-1 expression increased 40-fold in comparison to controls with significant increases in expression also observed in comparison to M2 macrophages and the A549 co-cultured cells without CSE (<italic>P=0.0149</italic>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Interestingly, the increase was MMP-1 specific since other collagenases, such as MMP-8 and MMP-13, were not increased in the A549 co-culture with CSE (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).

Notably, this effect was not observed in M1 macrophages (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).

Consistent with our previous data, MMP-1 mRNA expression from smoke exposed lungs displaying metastatic lesions was significantly higher than that observed in room air controls (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, the lungs of smoke exposed Mac-MMP-1 mice were characterized by significantly greater tumor burden as assessed by total number of tumor nodules/clusters and tumor area as compared to room air controls and smoke exposed wild type mice (*P=0.029,*P=0.018, respectively, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Next the localization of MMP-1 expression was examined via immunohistochemistry.

Interestingly, MMP-1 was mainly expressed at the edge or surrounding metastatic tumors in the Mac-MMP-1 transgenic mice, this was most prominent in large tumors (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistent with the notion that MMP-1 was associated with metastatic spread it was detected only in the proximity of these lesions and was primarily expressed around the terminal bronchiole and pulmonary vessels transgenic mice without smoke exposure (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Lesions from smoke exposed Mac-MMP-1 transgenic mice were also characterized by the presence of MMP-1 expression however, additional MMP-1 was detected only at the periphery of the lung (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). These data demonstrate that smoking induces an additional macrophage inflammatory response that exacerbates the up-regulation of MMP1 in TAMs, hence increasing the susceptibility to further metastasis.</p><p id="P24">Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cells stably expressing GFP were implanted subcutaneously in the mice to induce primary tumors and increase circulatory TAMs in the pre-metastatic phase (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

In addition, GFP positive cells were detected as a mosaic pattern in the metastatic lesions of Mac-MMP-1 mice by immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). These results suggest that MMP-1 derived from macrophages and the stimulus of smoking synergistically induced lung localization of the cancer cells within a 1&#x02013;3 week time frame.

Furthermore, mRNA transcripts of the MMP-1 inhibitors <italic>Timp2</italic> and <italic>Timp3</italic> were decreased in both smoke exposed Mac-MMP-1 and Lung-MMP-1 mice as compared to room air controls, consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data. Masson Trichrome Stain (specific for collagen) revealed a diffuse decrease in collagen deposition, including within metastatic tumors, in Lung-MMP-1 mice that was exacerbated by smoke exposure. Notably, decreased collagen deposition was not observed in metastatic lung tumors of Mac-MMP-1 mice even with smoke exposure however, it was observed within the primary tumors (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, B</xref>). Taken together, the above data suggest that MMP-1 derived from lung host cells does not facilitate colonization and metastasis of cancer cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) despite being upregulated and cleaving collagen within the tumor in response to cigarette smoke (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, B</xref>), rather it appears to be protective in nature. In contrast, TAM specific MMP-1 expression is increased following exposure to cigarette smoke with a simultaneous decrease in TIMP expression thereby enhancing MMP-1 activity and promoting tumor growth and metastatic spread (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A, B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">In the present study, our data indicate that TAM derived MMP-1 plays a significant role in primary tumor development and lung metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the observed effects are amplified by exposure to cigarette smoke. In contrast, lung cell derived MMP-1 reduced colonization of the lung by cancer cells; this effect was enhanced by exposure of mice to cigarette smoke. These results suggest a complex interplay between the source of MMP-1 production and its physiological effects on lung tumor growth and metastasis.</p><p id="P28">Due to their involvement in cancer growth and metastasis, MMPs were considered a promising therapeutic target. However, clinical trials were largely disappointing with questionable benefit only observed in patients with early stage disease [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This observation maybe explained by a lack of understanding of temporal and source specific effects of MMP expression throughout the tumor life cycle. Consistent with this finding, our data demonstrate early MMP-1 expression significantly influences early primary tumor growth.</p><p id="P29">Supporting the hypothesis that site specific expression of MMP-1 differentially influences tumor signaling pathways, our data indicate TAM specific expression of MMP-1 facilitated primary tumor growth and metastasis without effecting collagen deposition while MMP-1 derived from host lung inhibited colonization and reduced collagen deposition. These data are in agreement with several studies demonstrating variable effects of MMP expression on cancer growth depending on location and type of MMP expressed. For instance, a study by Gupta et al. demonstrated breast cancer specific expression of MMP &#x02212;1 and &#x02212;2 enhanced primary tumor growth and metastatic potential [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] while several other studies report protective effects of various MMPs when expressed by host tissue in murine cancer models [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, the observation that TAM specific expression of MMP-1 did not influence collagen deposition supports prior studies demonstrating that fibrillar collagen types I and III accumulate and facilitate metastasis of cancer cells to remote sites [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that MMP-1 expression exerts specific effects on cancer development that are determined by the cell type and location of enzyme productions. MMP-1 expressed by native lung cells results in collagen cleavage induces a protective effect against invasion of cancer cells, while its expression by TAMs at the primary tumor periphery promotes cancer cell invasion into the stroma and subsequent metastasis to distant sites.</p><p id="P30">Although prior studies report that MMP-1 secreted primarily from cancer cells induces invasion and tumor development [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we propose that MMP-1 produced by the stroma, and specifically TAMs, also plays a prominent role in the process of lung invasion and metastasis. Macrophages are released from bone marrow as monocytes, circulate throughout the blood stream, and migrate into tissues where they differentiate into tissue macrophages [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and are subsequently recruited to tumors by growth factors and chemokines released by cancer cells [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This process is enhanced by smoking which stimulates secretion of additional cytokines and pro-inflammatory compounds. Recruitment of macrophages by a tumor results in their conversion to an M2 phenotype and is characterized by their congregation at the invasive front of the tumor where they are shed along with cancer cells into the venous blood supply [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Data from the present study support the concept that MMP-1 expression by M2 macrophages is a distinguishing feature of TAM activated by cancer cells and cigarette smoke. This is exemplified by our <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrating a synergistic induction of MMP-1 production following exposure of M2 macrophage to adenocarcinoma cells and cigarette smoke extract. In agreement with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, similar increases in MMP-1 activity were detected in Mac-MMP-1 mice <italic>in vivo</italic> and, furthermore, they displayed increased number and size of lung metastasis with smoking. Unlike in lung-MMP-1 mice, a global decrease in collagen deposition was not observed in metastatic lung of Mac-MMP-1 mice. Since TAMs in these mice were detected at the tumor periphery (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), this observation suggests the tissue and site-specific expression of MMP-1 by TAMs may serve to restrict collagen degradation to the invading tumor front and facilitate cancerous invasion of the stroma. In fact, this finding is consistent with the observation that overexpression of MMP-1 by breast cancer cells results in enhanced tumor invasiveness and metastatic spread (8).</p><p id="P31">In the present study, smoke exposure increased MMP-1 expression and activation in the lungs and TAMs of transgenic mice. Critically, the presence of cancer cells and smoke exposure had a synergistic effect on TAM specific production of MMP-1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In prior studies from our laboratory and others, it has been shown that MMP-1 was increased in the lungs of smokers [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These studies proposed that cigarette smoke allowed the activation of MMP-1 through increased expression of activating enzymes via activation of the ERK1/2 signal transduction pathways in human small airway epithelial cells [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This pathway has been additionally confirmed in subsequent studies utilizing human breast cancer cell lines [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This up-regulation may stem from two sources: increased activation of macrophages to secrete more MMP-1 or increased MMP-1 expression from lung epithelial cells [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Several studies show that increased expression of MMP-1 in the tumor stroma correlates with aggressiveness in several cancers [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Altogether, our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data provide direct evidence that MMP-1 secreted from macrophages contributes to lung metastasis and are consistent with correlative clinical data. Furthermore, these studies suggest that macrophage MMP-1 is a possible therapeutic target to decrease the dissemination and metastasis of cancer.</p><p id="P32">In summary, the present study demonstrates the importance of smoke induced macrophage-specific MMP-1 expression in promoting the ability of cancer cells to invade into the stroma adjacent to the primary tumor and the subsequent establishment of lung metastasis. Conversely, when MMP1 is produced by lung cells at the site of metastasis and disrupts the collagen network, lung colonization is inhibited. Through the cell specific expression of MMP-1 in these transgenic models we have documented the long understood concept that MMPs are neither &#x0201c;bad nor good&#x0201d; players in cancer. What is most important in MMP pathogenesis is the cell type of expression and the condition under which the MMP is produced. The enzymes serve to protect the organism from damage or alternatively contribute to the pathology depending on the where and how they are produced. Therefore, tumor metastasis may be reduced through inhibition of the macrophage-specific secretion of MMP-1, but therapy would need to directly target this specific cell type as MMP-1 inhibition within the lung would potentially worsen metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Data</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS1006716-supplement-Supplemental_Data.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e650" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P33">Support for the present study was provided by grants from the Columbia University LAM Center and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), contracts R01-HL086936 and RC1HL100384 (JMD).
