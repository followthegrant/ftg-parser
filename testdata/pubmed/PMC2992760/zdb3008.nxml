Visceral adiposity is associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and this relationship persists even in nonobese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Similarly in rodents, increased adiposity in epididymal, mesenteric, and perinephric depots induces insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). There are several differences between visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) that could account for the link between VAT and insulin resistance, the most obvious being anatomical location. VAT is particularly sensitive to lipolytic stimuli and partly drains into the liver via the portal vein. Increased flux of free fatty acids from VAT to liver may increase hepatic gluconeogenesis and hepatic insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Data in both humans and rodents argue against this &#x0201c;portal hypothesis.&#x0201d; Removal of gonadal (nonportal) adipose tissue in obese mice improves insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In humans, some studies show a stronger association between subcutaneous abdominal fat and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Thus, the role of anatomical location in mediating the deleterious effects of VAT remains unresolved.</p><p>These divergent metabolic effects may be due to intrinsic, cell-autonomous differences between VAT and SAT. VAT displays higher rates of fatty acid uptake and release with reduced antilipolytic response to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), increased lipolytic response to catecholamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), increased response to glucocorticoids with increased lipoprotein lipase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and higher glucocorticoid receptor levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Studies of gene expression have found major differences between adipocytes and preadipocytes from VAT and SAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). These data suggest intrinsic differences between cells in VAT and SAT.</p><p>Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ secreting numerous proteins (adipokines) with potent metabolic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Metabolically beneficial adipokines including leptin and adiponectin are secreted in higher amounts from SAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), whereas proinflammatory adipokines such as RBP4, TNF-&#x003b1;, MCP-1, IL-8, and IL-6 are increased in VAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). It has been suggested that this differential secretion of adipokines may account for the differing metabolic consequences of visceral and subcutaneous adiposity. However, it is unclear if these factors are secreted from adipocytes or other cells resident in adipose tissue such as macrophages. Whereas leptin and adiponectin are secreted by adipocytes, other factors including resistin, visfatin, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and MCP-1 are principally secreted by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Therefore, the adipocyte may not be the principal secretory component of adipose tissue.</p><p>We sought to accurately characterize the secretome of adipose tissue and quantitatively compare the secretomes from VAT and SAT explants. Previous studies identified adipocyte secretory factors using 3T3-L1 cell-lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) or primary adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). These studies have several limitations. Immortalized cell lines are unable to provide depot specificity, and by isolating adipocytes from nonadipose cells within adipose tissue, cross-talk between these cells is lost. Using whole adipose tissue explants avoids these issues but introduces the presence of nonadipose-derived contaminating serum proteins. To circumvent this problem, we used comparison of isotope-labeled amino acid incorporation rates (CILAIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Cells or tissues are incubated with isotopically labeled amino acids, which become incorporated into newly synthesized proteins. This method allows quantitative assessment of differences in protein secretion as a protein with a higher incorporation of isotope is synthesized at a greater rate or in greater abundance.</p><p>The quality of the secretome sample can also be diminished by contamination with cytosolic, nonsecretory proteins released from damaged cells. Secreted proteins commonly undergo N-glycosylation, whereas cytosolic proteins do not. We exploited differential N-glycosylation, using lectin affinity chromatography (LAC) to selectively enrich proteins targeted for secretion.</p><p>We used LAC followed by CILAIR (LAC-CILAIR) to quantitate relative differences in the secretomes of murine VAT and SAT. Because adipose tissue is composed of multiple cell types, which may contribute to depot-specific differences in secretion, we isolated preadipocytes and microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) and compared their secretomes to that from whole adipose tissue. Although we did not observe any discrete differences in secretion profile between each depot, VAT exhibited an overall higher level of protein secretion than SAT, for whole adipose tissue, preadipocytes, and MVECS. Interestingly, a large proportion of the adipose tissue secretome was factors that play a role in angiogenesis. The increased production of these factors from VAT leads to the inescapable speculation that VAT represents a more readily expandable adipose tissue depot than SAT.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials and buffers.</title><p>All tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies unless otherwise stated.</p></sec><sec><title>Transfer medium.</title><p>Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM)/Ham's F-12 1:1 containing 1% BSA and supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 &#x003bc;g/ml amphotericin B (antibiotic&#x02013;antimycotic, Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>SILAC medium.</title><p>Low-glucose DMEM without leucine, lysine, and arginine (Sigma Aldrich) was supplemented with 0.105 g/l leucine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.0159 g/l phenol red, and 100 nmol/l insulin (DMEM/K-/R-).

A total of 145 proteins were identified, of which 86 (60%) were predicted to contain an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal signal peptide using SignalP. Of these, 51 proteins (59%) were present at &#x0003e;2-fold higher abundance in conditioned medium from VAT than SAT, whereas only 18 proteins (21%) were at &#x0003e;2-fold higher abundance in conditioned medium from SAT than VAT. The frequency distribution of the visceral-to-subcutaneous ratio for detected proteins is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>. Proteins without a signal peptide are nonspecifically released, newly synthesized cytosolic proteins. The distribution for these background proteins with no signal peptide resembles a normal distribution, whereas the distribution for proteins with a signal peptide is skewed to the right. This indicates that release of true secretory proteins into conditioned medium is increased from VAT relative to SAT.

In addition, we examined whether depot-specific differences in protein secretion observed from whole adipose tissue explants persisted in cells from the stromovascular fraction.</p><p>First we isolated preadipocytes from paired VAT and SAT biopsies. Visceral and subcutaneous preadipocytes were cultured in vitro for at least one week before incubation in medium containing isotopic amino acids. Conditioned medium was analyzed as before (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and supplementary data). Preadipocytes secreted a more limited set of proteins than minced adipose tissue. Of 23 proteins detected, 22 were secretory proteins. Of these, 15 were upregulated &#x0003e;2-fold from visceral compared with subcutaneous preadipocytes. Not one protein was upregulated &#x0003e;2-fold from subcutaneous as compared with visceral preadipocytes. The frequency distribution of the visceral-to-subcutaneous ratio for detected proteins is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic> and is again skewed to the right. This indicates that the release of secretory proteins into conditioned medium is increased from visceral relative to subcutaneous preadipocytes.

To date the secretome of endothelial cells has not been determined. In addition, it is unknown whether MVECs display depot-specific differences. We isolated MVECs using CD31 magnetic bead separation and cultured these cells in vitro. Conditioned media from cells incubated in isotopic amino acids were collected and analyzed as before (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> and supplementary data). Of 66 detected proteins, 34 (52%) displayed an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal signal peptide. Of these, 21 (62%) were increased &#x0003e;2-fold from visceral MVECs and only 5 were increased &#x0003e;2-fold from subcutaneous MVECs. The frequency distribution of the visceral to subcutaneous ratio for detected proteins is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>. Once again, these data are skewed toward increased protein secretion from visceral MVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). This is consistent with the enhanced secretory capacity of VAT we have observed in both whole adipose tissue and isolated preadipocytes. The proteins identified include a number of proteins known to be secreted from endothelial cells, including thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2, and extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and collagens. Additionally, several proteins not previously known to be secreted from adipose tissue MVECs were identified. These include the most abundantly detected protein, adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1). This protein influences inflammation in macrophages via a direct interaction with PXR and PPAR&#x003b3; sites. Multiple members of the complement pathway were also identified. Cluster analysis showed proteins more abundantly secreted from visceral MVECs were involved in extracellular matrix formation, including collagen and fibronectins, and endopeptidase inhibition, including members of the Serpin family. There were no defined clusters for the five secretory proteins more abundantly secreted from subcutaneous MVECs.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>TABLE 3</label><caption><p>Comparative

These shared proteins included proteins involved in extracellular matrix formation, such as collagen and fibronectin, and other known adipocyte proteins known such as osteonectin. Interestingly, these data suggest the majority of proteins in the whole adipose tissue secretome are secreted either by adipocytes themselves or by other cells in the stromovascular fraction such as macrophages and neurons. To interrogate this further, we compared the secretome of whole adipose tissue explants to the secretomes of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and isolated rat adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Of the 86 proteins identified in the whole adipose tissue secretome, 26 were shared with the 3T3-L1 adipocyte secretome and 21 were shared with the isolated rat adipocyte secretome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These data confirm that adipocytes alone are not the principal source of secreted proteins. It is possible that other cells types in the stromovascular fraction such as macrophages and neurons are the source of secreted proteins. To interrogate this further, we compared the secretome of whole adipose tissue explants to the secretome of human macrophages, and only three common proteins were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIG. 3.</label><caption><p>Venn diagram showing overlapping proteins detected from samples.

First, the overall secretory capacity of VAT is considerably higher than SAT, and second, this enhanced secretory capacity of VAT extends to cells of the stromovascular fraction&#x02014;preadipocytes and MVECs. Third, adipose tissue as a whole secretes more proteins than its individual component parts, suggesting the adipocyte is not the principal secretory component of adipose tissue. The secretome of adipose tissue is likely due to the complex interplay between its component cell types.</p><p>To interrogate the adipose tissue secretome, we combined two techniques, CILAIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and LAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Using this streamlined method excluded contaminating proteins from entrapped serum and intracellular contents from damaged cells. Metabolic labeling identifies proteins that are newly synthesized during the culture period. Proteins already in the secretory pathway will remain unlabeled as will contaminants from serum and cell debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). LAC selectively enriches for proteins targeted for secretion, thus overcoming contamination from dead or damaged cells. Abundant serum proteins, such as albumin, that are nonglycosylated are removed. This obviates the need for multiple washing steps to dilute these contaminating serum proteins, decreasing sample processing time and the negative impact of prolonged tissue handing. Despite these measures, unlabeled proteins will remain in the medium. As conditioned media from visceral and subcutaneous samples are mixed, nonlabeled (&#x0201c;light&#x0201d;) proteins form a &#x0201c;common denominator&#x0201d; that both isotopes are measured against. This eliminates any potential confounding from unlabeled contaminants differentially distributed between the two depots. The technique of LAC&#x02013;CILAIR is a useful and valid tool for interrogation of the adipose tissue secretome, indicated by the detection of well-known adipokines including adiponectin, adipsin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).</p><p>First, we compared rates of protein secretion from VAT and SAT explants. VAT explants secreted quantitatively more proteins than SAT. Of proteins secreted in &#x0003e;2-fold abundance, 59% were from VAT explants compared with 21% from SAT explants. This upregulation of protein secretion from VAT was consistent across cells of the stromovascular fraction with 68% of proteins secreted in &#x0003e;2-fold abundance from VAT preadipocytes compared with 0% from SAT and 62% of proteins secreted in &#x0003e;2-fold abundance from VAT MVECs compared with 15% from SAT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Preadipocytes and MVECs were cultured in vitro for at least one week prior to application of labeled media so were no longer subject to paracrine influences from their depot of origin. This suggests increased protein secretion is an intrinsic characteristic of components of VAT. The detection of a small number of proteins secreted in twofold greater abundance from subcutaneous depots provides evidence that our technique does not selectively detect enhanced protein secretion from the visceral depot.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>TABLE 4</label><caption><p>Summary of numbers of proteins detected and relative abundance between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WAT explants</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Endothelial cells</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Preadipocytes</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Incorporated label</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">145</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">66</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">23</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Signal peptide</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">86</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">34</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Signal peptide, visceral/subcutaneous ratio &#x0003e; 2</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">51</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">21</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Signal peptide, subcutaneous/visceral ratio &#x0003e; 2</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No signal peptide, visceral/subcutaneous ratio &#x0003e; 2</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">23</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No signal peptide, subcutaneous/visceral ratio &#x0003e; 2</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">% of proteins identified with signal peptide</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">59</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">52</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">96</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">% of total ion score from signal peptide containing proteins</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">88</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">76</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">99</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Cluster analysis of proteins secreted in greater abundance from VAT revealed members of the acute phase response and innate immune system. These data raise two interesting hypotheses. The first is that VAT is more pro-angiogenic than SAT, as many members of the acute phase response, for example, haptoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), and innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) are involved in angiogenesis. The capacity for angiogenesis is a crucial requirement for adipose tissue expansion, and cells of the adipose tissue stromovascular fraction are able to differentiate into adipocytes and endothelial cells and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Anti-angiogenic agents have been proposed as novel therapeutic options in obesity as they induce weight loss in obese mouse models without adverse effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, cluster analysis of the 14 proteins secreted more abundantly from visceral preadipocytes revealed proteins involved in extracellular matrix production. This, together with our finding that VAT secretes pro-angiogenic factors, suggests that visceral preadipocytes are better adapted for rapid adipose tissue expansion than subcutaneous preadipocytes. The second hypothesis is that VAT secretes proinflammatory cytokines. This is consistent with recent data that VAT, particularly in obesity, develops chronic low-grade inflammation with macrophage infiltration. This is associated with insulin resistance. Proteins involved in macrophage recruitment were secreted in greater abundance from visceral MVECs. This suggests that adipose tissue MVECs play a pivotal role in enticing circulating macrophages into adipose tissue. However, adipose tissue used for this study was derived from young, lean animals. In this setting, the upregulation of these cytokines is more likely targeted for angiogenesis and adipose tissue proliferation rather than a proinflammatory milieu. Furthermore, recruitment of macrophages into adipose tissue is not always associated with inflammation as macrophages in adipose tissue from lean mice express IL-10, which protects adipocytes from insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>This study represents the first survey of the endothelial cell secretome. In comparing MVECs from VAT and SAT, significant differences in protein secretion were demonstrated. Among the endothelial secretome were thrombospondins 1, 2, and 3, known to be secreted by endothelial cells, as well as a number of proteins not previously documented as endothelial secreted factors. Surprisingly, many were known adipocyte secretory proteins, including growth arrest specific 6, PAI-1, periostin, pentraxin-related protein 3, and SPARC. Of particular interest was identification of AEBP1, a secreted protein proposed to act as a transcriptional repression factor through binding of the enhancer sequence of the aP2/FABP4 gene in adipocytes, as well as PPAR&#x003b3; and LXR sites in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) Preadipocytes deficient in AEBP1 are hyperproliferative, with enhanced adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). AEBP1 can be detected in whole adipose tissue samples, but not when adipocytes are purified from adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Given our discovery of AEBP1 secretion from endothelial cells, we consider it likely that the source of AEBP1 in adipose tissue is endothelial cells. In this study, we found that MVECs from VAT secreted far more AEBP1 than MVECs from SAT. This observation could be important for explaining the deleterious effects of visceral adipose tissue.</p><p>In this study, we interrogated the secretome of whole adipose tissue and subsequently cells of the stromovascular fraction, preadipocytes and MVECs, to determine which component of adipose tissue was principally responsible for adipokine secretion. A total of 115 proteins were identified from these three samples, of which 67 were unique to adipose tissue explants, 16 were unique to MVECs, and 7 were unique to preadipocytes. Eight proteins were identified in all samples, including members of the collagen family, osteonectin, metalloproteinase inhibitor 1, C1 esterase inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and cathepsin B. These data suggest adipocytes themselves or other cells in the stromovascular fraction not interrogated in this study, including macrophages and neurons, are the key secretory cells within adipose tissue. When the secretome of whole adipose tissue was compared with the secretomes of both differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and primary rat adipocytes, only 26 (29%) and 20 (22%) common proteins, respectively, were identified. These data infer that adipocytes alone are not the principal source of secreted proteins in adipose tissue. As the adipose tissue came from lean animals, the expected number of macrophages should be low and in fact only three secreted proteins common to the secretomes of whole adipose tissue and human macrophages were found. This leads to the important conclusion that the secretome of whole adipose tissue is not simply the sum of each of its component parts but is the result of a paracrine interaction between the multiple cell types within adipose tissue.</p></sec>
