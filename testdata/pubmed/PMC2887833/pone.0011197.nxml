The invasion of land from the aquatic realm requires dramatic structural and physiological modifications to permit survival in a gravity-dominated, aerial environment. Most fishes are obligatorily aquatic, with amphibious fishes typically making slow-moving and short forays on to land.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here I describe the behaviors and movements of a little known marine fish that moves extraordinarily rapidly on land. I found that the Pacific leaping blenny, <italic>Alticus arnoldorum</italic>, employs a tail-twisting movement on land, previously unreported in fishes. Focal point behavioral observations of <italic>Alticus</italic> show that they have largely abandoned the marine realm, feed and reproduce on land, and even defend terrestrial territories. Comparisons of these blennies' terrestrial kinematic and kinetic (i.e., force) measurements with those of less terrestrial sister genera show <italic>A. arnoldorum</italic> move with greater stability and locomotor control, and can move away more rapidly from impending threats.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>My results demonstrate that axial tail twisting serves as a key innovation enabling invasion of a novel marine niche.

The far fewer examples of subtle novelties (e.g. directional asymmetry in the feeding apparatus of snail-eating snakes <xref rid="pone.0011197-Hoso1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> or the stabilized jaw articulation in New World jays to withstand cracking acorns, is likely due to the difficulty of their identification and discovery.</p><p>Moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial niche is challenging due to the dramatically different demands each environment places on the physiology and structure of an organism; yet this transition was a necessary step in tetrapod evolution. Moving on to land requires numerous innovations <xref rid="pone.0011197-Daeschler1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> to accommodate respiratory, structural, and locomotor challenges absent in a buoyant, aqueous environment. While there are numerous paleontological examples of morphological innovations enabling a major ecological transition <xref rid="pone.0011197-Daeschler1" ref-type="bibr">[e.g.]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Shubin1" ref-type="bibr">[ 13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Coates1" ref-type="bibr">[14,15]</xref>, their value is limited to inferences based only on preserved, hard structures. Detailed examination of extant organisms would thus facilitate a better understanding for the selective pressures and challenges associated with major niche or habitat shifts.</p><p>The highly-speciose ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), comprise more than 25,000 species. Although fishes ancestrally are obligatorily aquatic, air-breathing capabilities and amphibious behaviors are surprisingly widespread in this group <xref rid="pone.0011197-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. On land, amphibious fishes typically are from freshwater environments and tend to move very slowly <xref rid="pone.0011197-Swanson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0011197-Schoenfuss1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>; yet two (of 53) genera of comb-toothed blennies (Blenniidae) regularly move about with great agility and rapidity on land <xref rid="pone.0011197-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Found above the waterline in the intertidal zone, they have been the focus of respiratory <xref rid="pone.0011197-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and behavioral studies <xref rid="pone.0011197-Bhikajee1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Bhikajee2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These fishes feed on algae they scrape off of rocks above the water line, migrate with tidal patterns <xref rid="pone.0011197-Bhikajee2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and even reproduce on land <xref rid="pone.0011197-Bhikajee2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Sazima1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The Pacific leaping blenny, <italic>Alticus arnoldorum</italic>, has such terrestrial habits that it actively defends a terrestrial territory, and will retreat into moist burrows in the rocks when the tide recedes, to await its return. If threatened on land, these blennies slip into crevices above the water line or porpoise across the water surface to other rocky outcrops, and have never been observed to escape into the water.</p><p>Six of the most closely-related genera to <italic>Alticus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0011197-Springer1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> exhibit different degrees of amphibious behavior. For ease of analysis, I have divided the genera into &#x02018;aquatic,&#x02019; &#x02018;amphibious,&#x02019; or &#x02018;terrestrial&#x02019; groups based on field observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011197-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Although all of these genera can breathe air, aquatic blennies are seldom found out of water. When on land, they remain immobile until submerged by the next wave, or will flip about, seemingly randomly, until they return to water. Amphibious blennies can be periodically found feeding on land during low tide, close to the water line. However, they readily return to the water when disturbed and only make short forays on to land. The terrestrial blennies are extremely active on land, seldom submerge themselves under water, and move about actively dodging waves, feeding, and defending territories.</p><fig id="pone-0011197-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0011197.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Tail twisting capability and ecological groupings of blenny genera examined in this study.</title><p>Field observations showed that <italic>Alticus</italic> and <italic>Andamia</italic> are on land during both low and high tide.

Initial high-speed videos showed that the terrestrial blennies perform an unusual axial tail twisting movement, not previously observed in any other known fish. By examining the kinematics and kinetics of terrestrial locomotion in these blennies and their non-terrestrial sister genera, I tested the hypotheses that this tail twisting motion (1) is uniquely derived in the terrestrial blennies; and (2) has facilitated their invasion of a terrestrial niche by conferring greater jump performance in comparison to their amphibious and aquatic sister genera. Results from comparative kinematics of terrestrial jumps advance a theory for how tail twisting evolved. Furthermore, these results present <italic>Alticus</italic> as a potential living model for understanding structural and functional challenges associated with a major environmental transition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>Blenny species examined in this study include <italic>Alticus arnoldorum</italic>, <italic>Andamia reyi</italic>, <italic>An. tetradactyla</italic>, <italic>Blenniella caudolineata</italic>, <italic>Entomacrodus niuafooensis</italic>, <italic>E. striatus, Istiblennius lineatus</italic>, and <italic>Praealticus labrovittatus</italic>. Only <italic>Andamia spp</italic>. were collected in Taiwan. All of the remaining species are from Guam. Data for <italic>Entomacrodus</italic> and <italic>Andamia</italic> were pooled within each genus because I was interested in differences among the blennies at the generic level. Intraspecific locomotor performance comparisons and quantification of locomotor kinematics were conducted in field marine laboratories in Guam (University of Guam Marine Lab) and Taiwan (Sun Yet Sen University, Kenting National Park), and at Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA). All experiments for this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Harvard University. All animal collection was conducted in accordance to permit no. C00-008-04 issued by the Department of Agriculture in Guam and a permit issued by the Taiwan Council of Agriculture.</p><p>For the experiments at Harvard University (i.e., detailed kinematic and kinetics measurements), twenty live individuals each of <italic>Alticus arnoldorum</italic>, <italic>P. labrovittatus</italic>, and <italic>B. gibbifrons</italic> were shipped back to the laboratory. None of the other species were imported because their conditions rapidly deteriorate in captivity, or permits for live import were unavailable (i.e., <italic>Andamia spp.</italic> from Taiwan). In the lab, blennies were housed in groups of three in plastic shoeboxes modified to accommodate an airstone, a water inlet, and drain. Boxes were fit with a drain opposite the inlet to ensure cross-aquarium water flow. Fishes were fed twice daily with a spirulina and marine flake fish food mix. Full spectrum lights were set on a 12 hour light-dark cycle.</p><p>All locomotor trials were filmed at 250&#x02013;1000 fps using one or two high speed video cameras.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>
<italic>Alticus</italic> Terrestrial Kinematics</title><p>Since <italic>Alticus</italic> exhibited the most extreme terrestrial behavior, detailed description of this species' movements on land were completed. Kinematics of <italic>Alticus</italic> locomotor modes were quantified in three dimensions as individuals were induced to climb a vertical piece of Plexiglas and hop or jump along a horizontal surface. Each locomotor bout was divided into three phases based on body position and kinematics (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> for a description of phases). Fish body midlines were manually digitized, then reconstructed into three-dimensional coordinates using custom software in MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc., USA). A fixed point on the body was used for locomotor velocity calculations.</p><p>To determine whether <italic>Alticus</italic> moved on land using distinct locomotor modes, 11 kinematic variables were quantified. These variables included take-off angle, duration of each locomotor phase as a percent of total bout duration, maximum body velocity (i.e., &#x0201c;maximum velocity&#x0201d;), and average three-dimensional body velocity (i.e., &#x0201c;average velocity&#x0201d;) and curling velocity for each phase. Take-off angle was measured as the angle formed by a straight line connecting the snout tip to the base of the tail and the horizontal plane. Curling velocity was defined as the speed with which the tail and snout moved with respect to one another. Positive velocities indicated that they were moving away from each other, representing speed of body extension. Linear regressions of variables against body length yielded no size effects. All variables were log-transformed before statistical analyses to satisfy assumptions of normality.</p><p>A principal components analysis (PCA) was first run to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to determine which variables were responsible for the greatest amount of variance in the data. A 90&#x00025; trace criterion <xref rid="pone.0011197-Deluzio1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> was used to select the principal components (PC) to be used for further analyses. Individual variable loadings (i.e., the eigenvalues) and scatterplots of the principal components (PC) facilitated interpretation of PCA results.</p><p>The selected PCs were then analyzed with a descriptive discriminatory analysis (DDA) to examine categorical separations <xref rid="pone.0011197-Deluzio1" ref-type="bibr">[e.g.]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Huberty1" ref-type="bibr">[ 29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[30,31]</xref>.

For each jump, qualitative parameters (i.e., presence or absence of tail twisting and slipping) were recorded. Jumps were pooled according to blenny ecotype (i.e., terrestrial, amphibious, or aquatic). A total of 156 jump trials (i.e., 59 terrestrial, 49 amphibious, and 48 aquatic) were included in the final analysis. Differences in jump stability (i.e., slipping frequency) among ecotypes were assessed with a contingency analysis, followed by a Pearson's Chi-squared test.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Comparative Jump Kinetics</title><p>Comparative jump force production among <italic>A. arnoldorum, P. labrovittatus</italic>, and <italic>B. gibbifrons</italic> &#x02013; representing a terrestrial, amphibious, and aquatic blenny &#x02013; was assessed using a novel, tri-axial optical force plate designed for these experiments <xref rid="pone.0011197-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Analog force plate response data were sampled at 1000 Hz and converted to digital form using an analog-digital converter (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA). All force data were filtered with a ninth-order, low-pass Butterworth filter set at a 20 Hz cut-off frequency, in the forward and reverse directions to eliminate filter-introduced time shifts. Force axes were assigned according to the right-hand rule: &#x0002b;X pointed opposite the direction of motion (aft), &#x0002b;Y pointed to the left of the jump, and &#x0002b;Z pointed down. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011197.s001">Figure S1</xref> shows a representative, filtered force trace from a jump by the terrestrial blenny, <italic>Alticus arnoldorum</italic>.

Activation of a trigger simultaneously terminated high-speed video filming and added a step change in electrical signal along a channel dedicated to recording trigger response.</p><p>A total of 43 trials were recorded from the terrestrial <italic>A. arnoldorum</italic> (10 individuals), 13 trials from the amphibious <italic>P. labrovittatus</italic> (2 individuals), and 12 trials from the aquatic <italic>B. caudolineata</italic> (3 individuals). Only those trials in which the blenny jumped from the center of the force plate, without touching the sides of the enclosure or the prod used to elicit the jump, were accepted for analysis.

Although hopping is similar to jumping in its positional characteristics, jumping is used for escaping threats and when fighting while defending territories, representing a much faster locomotor mode (peak velocity: 1.58&#x000b1;0.08 m/s; range: 1.39&#x02013;1.87 m/s).</p><fig id="pone-0011197-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0011197.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Three terrestrial locomotor modes performed by <italic>Alticus arnoldorum</italic>.</title><p>

I present below some general observations of their territorial behavior, to emphasize the necessity of a mechanism for rapid and effective movements on land.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Terrestrial blennies are highly territorial</title><p>Territories consisted of rock faces containing numerous short tunnels (usually less than 3 cm depth), holding a shallow volume of fluid accumulated during high tide. Whereas non-territorial blennies regularly moved over the entire rock face during high tide and disappeared during low tide, presumably migrating with the tide cycle, territorial individuals remained inside an exposed burrow during low tide. Blennies were not observed leaving the tunnels during low tide, suggesting the accumulated water within the tunnels is sufficient for keeping the fish moist &#x02013; facilitating cutaneous respiration <xref rid="pone.0011197-Bhikajee1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> &#x02013; until the tide returned.</p><p>The highly terrestrial Pacific leaping blennies (<italic>Alticus arnoldorum</italic>) rely on rapid and acrobatic maneuvers to aggressively defend their terrestrial territories.

Escalation of conflict led to emergence of the defender followed by tensing of the body, flaring of the dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins, and lateral posturing towards the offender. Physical combat was common, rapid, and acrobatic, sometimes resulting in one or both of the blennies being knocked into the water. Blennies knocked off a rock immediately re-emerged on to land. None of the blennies were observed voluntarily entering the water during low or high tide.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Greater performance on land among terrestrial blennies</title><p>The combination of living in the wave-swept intertidal and aggressive defense of terrestrial territories necessitates an effective means of moving about on land.

Among all ecotypes, movements were initiated by bringing the tail towards the head, curling their body into a C-shape then straightening the body to move forward. Using such stereotyped movements, detailed kinematic analyses showed that the terrestrial <italic>Alticus</italic> performed two to three distinct locomotor modes: hopping, jumping, and climbing. Hops and jumps were indistinguishable in both principal components models, but were differentiated in the discriminant analysis with 93.7&#x00025; accuracy, suggesting that these two locomotor modes are distinct despite being very similar kinematically. It is nevertheless possible that jumping and hopping represent opposite extremes of a velocity continuum that is behaviorally modulated. While additional focal point studies are necessary to formalize when each locomotor mode is used, initial observations indicate that the diversity of locomotor modes facilitates slow, stable locomotion when feeding and fast, acrobatic locomotion when escaping large waves or competing for resources.</p><p>Comparisons among six closely-related genera showed that axial tail twisting is a kinematic innovation unique to the two terrestrial genera, and that these blennies are furthermore characterized by significantly greater jump performance on land. On average, terrestrial blennies jumped nearly seven times farther than aquatic blennies, and over twice as far as amphibious blennies. Greater jump performance in terrestrial blennies is likely due to the greater stability and traction afforded by planting the lateral aspect of the tail against the substrate, rather than the narrow, ventral surface. On identical substrata terrestrial blennies never slipped when jumping in comparison to both aquatic and amphibious blennies. Furthermore, if terrestrial blennies roll when airborne, they display a remarkable ability to correct body position, which permits landing upright and launching into the next jump almost immediately. Amphibious and aquatic blennies land on their side if they roll mid-air.</p><p>The kinetic data are consistent with greater jump performance among terrestrial blennies, showing that these blennies generated greater fore-aft force impulses, facilitating increased jump distance. In contrast, when considering their shorter jump distances, amphibious and aquatic blennies tended to generate proportionately greater vertical and medio-lateral force impulses. These forces contribute less to increasing jump distance <xref rid="pone.0011197-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Marsh1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and can be destabilizing <xref rid="pone.0011197-Jindrich1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Schmitt1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, by causing yawing and rolling about the center of mass.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Evolutionary Implications</title><p>The stereotyped body movements when moving on land for all blenny genera studied here suggest a derivation from the C-start escape, an evasion maneuver common to most aquatic fishes <xref rid="pone.0011197-Domenici1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. A C-start is a reflexive, Mauthner cell-initiated response that involves curling the head towards the tail into a tight C-shape and rapidly straightening the body for propulsion [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011197-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0011197-Hale1" ref-type="bibr">[; 42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Tytell1" ref-type="bibr">[43]]</xref>. When startled on land, the aquatic blenny kinematic response closely resembled an aquatic C-start (12 of 48 jumps; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011197-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>); although the opposite kinematic sequence, in which the tail is curled towards the head, was also used. Amphibious blennies reacted similarly in response to a stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011197-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>), but would also frequently roll their body onto the side of their tail to jump. This resulted in a similar tail position as that achieved by axial tail twisting in terrestrial blennies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011197-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>) without actually twisting the tail. Whereas terrestrial blennies always jumped farther and generated greater propulsive forces than aquatic blennies, amphibious blennies were intermediate to these two ecotypes. This jump performance &#x02018;enhancement&#x02019; in terrestrial and amphibious blennies, as compared to aquatic blennies, supports the interpretation that pushing with the lateral surface of the tail promotes terrestrial locomotor performance.</p><p>Similar locomotor strategies, when employed both underwater and on land, may lead to a decrement in locomotor performance. For example, Gillis <xref rid="pone.0011197-Gillis1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> showed that American eels utilize a lateral undulatory motion when swimming and when on land. The dramatic decrement in locomotor performance (i.e., lower velocity) on land was accompanied by significantly higher amplitude body undulations and higher-intensity electromyographic bursts in the axial musculature <xref rid="pone.0011197-Gillis2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast, whereas mudskippers (<italic>Periophthalmus sp.</italic>, Family Gobiidae or &#x0201c;gobies&#x0201d;) rely on a combination of lateral undulations and pectoral fin locomotion underwater <xref rid="pone.0011197-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, they perform at least two distinct types of locomotion on land: crutching and jumping <xref rid="pone.0011197-Swanson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Pace1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Crutching involves using the pectoral fins and tail as a tripod, providing stabilization while planting the pectoral fins to lift the body off the ground to move forward <xref rid="pone.0011197-Pace1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. While crutching tends to be slow, jumping is employed as a rapid, terrestrial escape response, remarkably similar to the terrestrial kinematics observed among the aquatic blennies studied here. When jumping, mudskippers simultaneously bring their head and tail together before rapidly extending the body to propel the fish away from a threat <xref rid="pone.0011197-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Timing characteristics of water <italic>versus</italic> terrestrial escapes indicate that the maneuvers performed underwater may be Mauthner-mediated, whereas those on land are not &#x02013; suggesting the use of a novel motor pathway for land-based escape behaviors <xref rid="pone.0011197-Swanson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Key innovations afford enhanced performance <xref rid="pone.0011197-Hoso1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Aubret1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Eckhart1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, promoting ecological opportunity. These innovations are sometimes credited with subsequent species diversification <xref rid="pone.0011197-Liem1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Ritter1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> and radiation into new environmental niches <xref rid="pone.0011197-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011197-Prum1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Although the terrestrial blennies studied here do not represent a case of dramatic species diversification, the large populations and widespread occurrence of these terrestrial blennies in the tropical Pacific Ocean is a testament to their remarkable success occupying a new niche on land. The axial tail twisting behavior serves as a kinematic innovation in this group of fishes <xref rid="pone.0011197-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, occurring simultaneous with a level of stability and maneuverability when moving on the intertidal coastline that other known fishes have yet to achieve. Initial preliminary analyses of axial skeleton (pers. observ.) and myosepta morphology (pers. comm., S. Gemballa) have yielded no obvious morphological modification enabling tail twisting. Yet, the kinematic trends of jump behavior among non-terrestrial and terrestrial blennies suggest potential morphological or neuromuscular modifications, warranting further study. The similarity in the preparatory curling motions in genera distributed among two largely aquatic fish families (i.e., blennies and gobies) suggests that these basic terrestrial movements have an ancestral origin preceding amphibious behavior, and may be more broadly observed among other amphibious genera. It furthermore suggests a case of convergent evolution of motor patterns, facilitating terrestrial locomotion. Active axial tail twisting remains unreported in any other genus of which I am aware. Therefore, future studies comparing tail use and muscle function during aquatic and terrestrial locomotion in the terrestrial blennies may provide greater insight into whether axial tail twisting is an adaptation for land locomotion, or if it was co-opted from another aquatic function. This lineage of fishes thus provides a unique glimpse of an evolutionary pathway by which a group of aquatic vertebrates has moved on to land, serving also as an appropriate system for understanding the evolution of locomotor control mechanisms enabling effective locomotion in two distinct environments.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0011197.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>A representative force trace recorded from a jumping terrestrial blenny, <italic>Alticus arnoldorum</italic>.
