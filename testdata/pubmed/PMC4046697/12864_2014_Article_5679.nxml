Although many statistical and computational methods have been proposed for GSEA, the issue of a concordant integrative GSEA of multiple expression data sets has not been well addressed. Among different related data sets collected for the same or similar study purposes, it is important to identify pathways or gene sets with concordant enrichment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We categorize the underlying true states of differential expression into three representative categories: no change, positive change and negative change. Due to data noise, what we observe from experiments may not indicate the underlying truth. Although these categories are not observed in practice, they can be considered in a mixture model framework. Then, we define the mathematical concept of concordant gene set enrichment and calculate its related probability based on a three-component multivariate normal mixture model. The related false discovery rate can be calculated and used to rank different gene sets.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We used three published lung cancer microarray gene expression data sets to illustrate our proposed method. One analysis based on the first two data sets was conducted to compare our result with a previous published result based on a GSEA conducted separately for each individual data set. This comparison illustrates the advantage of our proposed concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis. Then, with a relatively new and larger pathway collection, we used our method to conduct an integrative analysis of the first two data sets and also all three data sets. Both results showed that many gene sets could be identified with low false discovery rates. A consistency between both results was also observed. A further exploration based on the KEGG cancer pathway collection showed that a majority of these pathways could be identified by our proposed method.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study illustrates that we can improve detection power and discovery consistency through a concordant integrative analysis of multiple large-scale two-sample gene expression data sets.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The recent large-scale technologies like microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] allow us to collect genome-wide expression profiles for biomedical studies. Genes showing significant differential expression are potentially important biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, a gene set enrichment analysis enables us to identify groups of genes (e.g. pathways) showing coordinate differential expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For some disease studies, multiple gene expression data sets have been collected and the related integrative analysis of multiple data sets has been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Since microarray and sequencing based genome-wide expression data sets have been increasingly collected, it is necessary to further develop the computational and statistical methods for integrative data analysis studies.</p><p>Genes and gene sets showing consistent behavior among multiple related studies can be of great biological interest. However, since the sample sizes are usually small but the numbers of genes are large, it is difficult to identify truly differentially expressed genes and determine whether a gene or a gene set behaves concordantly among different related studies. Although the integrative analysis of multiple gene expression data sets has been well studied in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the genome-wide concordance has not been well considered. Misleading results may be generated if the concordance among different data sets is not considered in an integrative analysis. Our purpose is to identify pathways or gene sets with concordant enrichment. Recently, there are several methods published for meta gene set enrichment analysis of expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, these methods have not been specifically developed for our study purpose. Statistically, we need analysis methods that are consistent with the study purpose. There is still a lack of methods and software for the concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis.</p><p>For a gene set enrichment analysis, an enriched gene set in one data set may also be enriched in another data set. However, this gene set is not necessarily concordantly enriched in both data sets. For an illustration, let us consider a simple artificial example: gene set <italic>S</italic> contains five genes with the first three genes strongly up-regulated in the first data set (the last two genes non-differentially expressed) and the last three genes strongly up-regulated in the second data set (the first two genes non-differentially expressed). Then, in general, gene set <italic>S</italic> is enriched in up-regulated differential expression in both data sets. However, there is only one gene up-regulated in both data sets; the remaining genes are showing inconsistent behavior. Therefore, unless the proportions of differentially expressed genes are small, there is a lack of evidence to conclude that gene set <italic>S</italic> is concordantly enriched in both data sets. Since a gene set concordantly enriched in several similar studies may be of great importance, it is necessary to develop statistical methods for detecting these gene sets.</p><p>It has been shown that a mixture model based approach can be an efficient approach to the differential expression analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated the usefulness of mixture models in concordant analysis of differential expression among large-scale expression data sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The advantage of the mixture model based approach is that the probability of a particular behavior (up-regulated or down-regulated) can be modeled and estimated for a given gene. Thus, it is feasible to address how likely this gene shows a concordant behavior. In this study, we develop a mixture model based method for a concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Concordant gene set enrichment</title><p>In this study, we consider multiple large-scale two-sample gene expression data sets. We use <italic>K</italic> to denote the number of these data sets and <italic>m</italic> to denote the number of common genes in these data sets. For each of these data sets, we usually use a <italic>t</italic>-type test to evaluate the differential expression of each gene and a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method to evaluate the enrichment level of a given gene set. In order to define and evaluate a concordant gene set enrichment when an integrative analysis is conducted for all <italic>K</italic> data sets, we categorize differential expression in each data set into three underlying (unobserved) representative categories: no change, positive change (or up-regulated differential expression) and negative change (or down-regulated differential expression). Due to data noise, what we observe from experiments may not indicate the underlying truth. (For example, a gene with slight down-regulated differential expression may show a small positive <italic>t</italic>-type test value.) Although these categories are not observed in practice, they can be considered in a mixture model framework.</p><p>To understand the concept of concordant gene set enrichment, let us consider an artificial example. Given a pathway with 30 genes, we know all the underlying behavior of these genes: 20 genes have positive changes consistently among all different data sets. Furthermore, if we randomly select 30 genes, we also know that the expected number of genes with consistent positive changes among different data sets is just 5. In this case, we would conclude that the given gene set is concordantly enriched in up-regulated differential expression (because 30 is clearly larger than 5). However, in practice, all the underlying differential expression categories are not observed. Instead, they can be considered in a mixture model framework. Then, we need to develop a mathematical formula for the probability of concordant enrichment score (CES) of a given gene set <italic>S</italic> that contains <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> genes:<disp-formula id="Equa"><graphic xlink:href="12864_2014_5679_Equa_HTML.gif" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p><p>which can be useful for prioritizing different gene sets in practice.</p><p>Before we derive the mathematical formula for the above probability, we need to explain the term "enriched". As suggested by Efron and Tibshirani [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], unless the test statistic for a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) considers the genome-wide background patterns (e.g. the statistics proposed in the original GSEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]), it is necessary to consider the "row randomization" for genes in addition to the "column permutation" for samples. Therefore, the term "enriched" means "higher/better than expected".</p><p>Although many test statistics have been developed for GSEA with one large-scale expression data set, we still need to develop a new approach for this study. The motivation is: we need to address the component information of the genes in a gene set. The component information is whether a gene is up-regulated, down-regulated or non-differentially expressed. Most existing test statistics for the gene set enrichment analysis are either nonparametric or functions of <italic>z</italic>-score. But it is difficult to analyze the component information with these test statistics. Therefore, based on the above discussion for the term "enriched", we propose the following probability for measuring concordant gene set enrichment:<disp-formula id="Equb"><graphic xlink:href="12864_2014_5679_Equb_HTML.gif" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p><p>For a gene in a given gene set <italic>S</italic>, an event of interest can be: (1) the gene is concordantly up-regulated; (2) the gene is concordantly down-regulated; or (3) the gene is concordantly differentially expressed (either up-regulated or down-regulated). Our analysis methods for these different types of enrichment analysis are almost mathematically identical. For a mathematical notation of the above CES, we denote <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> the indicator that the <italic>i</italic>-th gene in gene set <italic>S</italic> satisfies the event of interest. Let <bold>D</bold> be the observed data and <italic>&#x003c0;</italic> be the probability of event of interest if the gene is randomly sampled. Then, we have<disp-formula id="Equc"><graphic xlink:href="12864_2014_5679_Equc_HTML.gif" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p><p>In order to calculate CES practically, we propose a three-component multivariate mixture model. In the model, each component is a normal distribution. The model configuration for these three components is consistent with the differential expression categories as described above. This model is conceptually analog to a simple normal mixture approach to differential expression analysis proposed by McLachlan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The special feature of our model is that we focus on some specific combination of components from different dimensions. A bivariate version of this model has been used by us to evaluate the concordance and discordance between two large-scale experiments with two sample groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and to integrate two microarray data sets in differential expression analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Before the model description, we need to describe the related data preprocessing and differential expression test scores as follows.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data preprocessing</title><p>Because our proposed statistical method is developed based on the differential expression test scores, we assume that the given gene expression data sets have been preprocessed appropriately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For a concordant integrative analysis of multiple data sets, we also need to select genes shared commonly by different data sets. This can be achieved using the genes' unique identifiers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Differential expression test scores</title><p>For each of the two-sample gene expression data sets, we screen individual genes with the traditional two-sample Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. Several modified <italic>t</italic>-tests, such as SAM <italic>t</italic>-test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and the moderated <italic>t</italic>-test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], have been widely used in the differential expression analysis of microarray data. These test statistics can generally improve the control of false positives by "softly" filtering out genes with relatively small expression variance. However, we intend to consider all the genes equally important in the concordant integrative analysis of multiple data sets. Furthermore, a given gene can show different levels of variance in different data sets, which may make it difficult to use these modified <italic>t</italic>-tests. Therefore, we still recommend the traditional two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test as the differential expression test statistic. (In practice, other test statistics like SAM <italic>t</italic>-test or the moderated <italic>t</italic>-test can still be considered when there is a strong reason to do so.) Because the sample size of a high-throughput study is usually not large, it is generally difficult to validate the normal distribution assumptions for the <italic>t</italic>-test. Therefore, instead of the theoretical <italic>t</italic>-distribution, we use the permutation procedure to compute the <italic>p</italic>-value of an observed <italic>t</italic>-test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This approach has been widely adopted in the analysis of gene expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>For <italic>K</italic> two-sample gene expression data sets with <italic>m</italic> common genes, we compute the one-sided upper-tailed <italic>p</italic>-value <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i,k</italic></sub> for gene <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> in the <italic>k</italic>-th data set, <italic>i</italic> = 1, 2<italic>, . . . , m</italic> and <italic>k</italic> = 1, 2<italic>, . . . , K</italic>. Then, we perform an inverse normal transformation to obtain a <italic>z</italic>-score: <italic>z</italic><sub><italic>i,k</italic></sub> = &#x003a6;<sup><italic>-</italic>1</sup>(1 <italic>- p</italic><sub><italic>i,k</italic></sub>), where &#x003a6;(<italic>&#x000b7;</italic>) is the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the standard normal distribution. This transformation has been widely used to improve the fitting of a mixture model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Our proposed statistical methods for the concordant integrative analyses of multiple data sets are developed based on these sets of <italic>z</italic>-scores.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>A mixture model</title><p>For each individual data set, we assume that a mixture of three normal distributions can well fit the <italic>z</italic>-scores.

This configuration has been suggested in the analysis of gene expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] although more components can be considered to improve the data fitting. Mathematically, we have the following density function:<disp-formula id="Equd"><graphic xlink:href="12864_2014_5679_Equd_HTML.gif" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p><p>which is a type of well-known simple normal mixture model.</p><p>When the above simple model is extended to accommodate the analysis of multiple data sets, we need to consider the combination of components from different dimensions (data sets).

Based on our observation, most gene sets contain more than 20 genes. Since different genes have different probabilities of being concordantly up-regulated and/or down-regulated differentially expressed, we cannot further simplify the formula (we need to calculate a tail probability for a heterogeneous Bernoulli process). However, we can consider a simulation based approach to the approximation of CES given in Equation (2).</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Monte Carlo approximation</title><p>Recall that the probability of event of interest <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>S,i</italic></sub> can be calculated for a gene <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>S,i</italic></sub> in a given gene set <italic>S</italic> = {<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>S,i</italic></sub><italic>, i</italic> = 1, 2<italic>, . . . , m</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>}.

As we have discussed above, the concordant enrichment score (CES) is closely related to the false discovery rate (FDR). Then, it is reasonable to require its accuracy around the 1% level for the 95% CES level (e.g. a 95% normally approximated binomial confidence interval 0.95 <italic>&#x000b1;</italic> 0.01) and <italic>B</italic> = 2000 is adequate. Therefore, the Monte Carlo approximation is a feasible approach in practice. (In general, if we do not have a specific CES level, we can simply use an upper bound <italic>B</italic> = 10000 calculated based on the 95% normally approximated binomial confidence interval. Then, the related computing burden is still practically feasible.)</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Application #1: an integrative analysis of two data sets</title><p>To illustrate our method, we first considered two microarray gene expression data sets collected for lung cancer studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The first one was collected by a research group in Boston (referred to as Boston data) and the second one was collected by a research group in Michigan (referred to as Michigan data). For an application of their Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method, Subramanian, Tamayo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] reorganized these two data sets, which were made freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea</ext-link>. There were 62 and 86 patients for the Boston and Michigan data sets, respectively. These patients were classified as either "good" or "poor" outcomes. Expression profiles were available for 5216 genes that were common for both data sets. To compare our analysis results with the results reported by Subramanian, Tamayo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], we used an early version of gene set collection that was used by them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Subramanian, Tamayo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] also suggested a moderate range of 15-500 genes for the sizes of gene sets that were analyzed in their gene set analysis. A gene set was not analyzed if its number of genes was out of this range. This range was used in our analysis. To demonstrate the advantage of their GSEA, Subramanian, Tamayo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] observed several commonly significantly enriched gene sets from the analysis of each data set although no individual genes with significantly differential expression were identified.</p><p>Since no concordant integrative analysis has been conducted before for these two data sets, it is necessary to investigate whether more significant results can be achieved by such an analysis. Lai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and Lai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] have discussed that it is necessary to evaluate the genome-wide concordance before an integrative analysis to be conducted. Based on a likelihood ratio test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we obtained <italic>p</italic>-values <italic>&#x0003c;</italic> 0.01 and <italic>&#x0003e;</italic> 0.3 for testing hypothesis complete discordance (CD) model vs. partial concordance/discordance (PCD) model and complete concordance (CC) model vs. PCD model, respectively. This result suggested that the expression profiles of both data sets were overall concordant at a genome-wide level. To avoid any possible selection bias, we still conducted our integrative analysis based on the general PCD model. (When the simplified CC model was used, we still observed similar results [not shown].) As shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the gene sets identified by Subramanian, Tamayo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] were also identified by our method. Furthermore, the resulting false discovery rates (FDRs) were even more significant (all below 0.08 and most of them below 0.001) by our method.

Proteasome degradation is a well-known pathway in cancer studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitors are being used clinically in lung cancer treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] has also demonstrated that proteasome regulates the key survival factors for cells. However, this gene set had not been identified in the study by Subramanian, Tamayo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the majority of <italic>z</italic>-scores from both data sets were positive for the gene set proteasome pathway. Because most of these <italic>z</italic>-scores were relatively close to zero, it was difficult to identify this pathway by an analysis based on individual data sets. However, the concordant enrichment of up-regulation of this gene set was identified by our integrative analysis approach (CES &#x0003e; 0.999 and FDR &#x0003c; 0.001 for the up-regulation enrichment). The B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway has been shown to be important in immune disease and cancer studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the majority of <italic>z</italic>-scores from both data sets were negative for this gene set although these <italic>z</italic>-scores were also relatively close to zero. For the down-regulation enrichment, the CES and FDR for this gene set was <italic>&#x0003e;</italic> 0.9 and ~ 0.05, respectively. For a comparison, we also randomly selected 30 genes as a random gene set. As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the paired <italic>z</italic>-score pattern of this random gene set was consistent with the genome-wide paired <italic>z</italic>-score distribution. Therefore, this random gene set was not significantly concordantly enriched. (The corresponding up-regulation and down-regulation based CES were both in the range of 0.4 ~ 0.6.)<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Since the introduction of gene set enrichment analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the collections of gene sets have been updated to version 3.0 (at the time of our study). Therefore, based on the Boston and Michigan data, we have performed a concordant integrative analysis for this updated version of the C2 canonical pathway collection. Among 880 gene sets in the collection, there are 700 gene sets with gene number range from 15 to 500. We have also compared our results with the results calculated separately for individual data sets based on the gene set analysis (GSA) method proposed by Efron and Tibshirani [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although certain statistical assumptions are required for the GSA method, Maciejewski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] have still suggested in a recent comparison study that this method is one of the preferred methods for a gene set enrichment analysis. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows that the false discovery rate (FDR) curve based on our method is clearly lower than these two FDR curves based on GSA (one for Boston data and the other for Michigan data).

Our method was first applied to two published lung cancer microarray gene expression data sets. As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, gene sets like the proteasome and BCR signaling pathways were identified by our method. These gene sets were not identified in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] since the differential gene expression among these gene sets were relatively weak. However, the concordant enrichment of these gene sets was detected by our method. This comparison illustrated the advantage of our proposed concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis. The analysis results from our second application (a concordant integrative analysis of three data sets) also showed that many gene sets could be identified with low false discovery rates. A consistency between both results was also observed. A further exploration based on the KEGG cancer pathway collection demonstrated the practical usefulness of our proposed method. Overall, this study illustrates that we can improve detection power and discovery consistency through a concordant integrative analysis of multiple large-scale two-sample gene expression data sets.</p><p>There are several advantages for our proposed method. The genome-wide concordance can be statistically tested before the integrative analysis. The mixture model is estimated based on the maximum likelihood estimation procedure. Furthermore, our integrative analysis of gene sets is based on a probabilistic framework, which can be conveniently used for the calculation of false discovery rates. However, there are also limitations. Our proposed mixture model is simple and it contains only three components. Normal distributions are assumed for these components. Furthermore, we assume that different genes behave independently (Gold et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] have showed that the independence assumption can be acceptable in practice). These limitations should be considered when our method is used in practice.</p><p>For our future research, it will be useful to extend our proposed method for an integrative analysis of data with multiple sample groups. This will be particularly useful for studying diseases with different progression stages. Although a major proportion of gene expression data have been collected for binary outcomes (e.g. normal vs. abnormal), data with other types of responses (e.g. survival data) have also been collected. It will also be useful to extend our method for these data. Furthermore, when our proposed method is used for an integrative analysis of more than 3 data sets, it is desirable to simplify the mixture model so that the number of model parameters (particularly for <inline-formula id="IEq14"><inline-graphic xlink:href="12864_2014_5679_IEq14_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula>) can be reduced to achieve statistical efficiency. Furthermore, we would also like to consider more robust approaches (e.g. a nonparametric method) to the concordant integrative gene set enrichment analysis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors' contributions</bold></p><p>Y.Lai conceived of the study, developed the methods, performed the statistical analysis, and drafted the manuscript; F.Zhang developed the methods, performed the statistical analysis, and helped to draft the manuscript; T.K.Nayak, R.Modarres, N.H.Lee and T.A.McCaffrey helped to draft the manuscript.
