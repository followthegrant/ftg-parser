Introduction </title><p>Wound healing process is divided into four phases classified as vasoconstriction and coagulation, acute inflammation, cellular proliferation, and wound remodeling [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Briefly, coagulation causes the development of platelet thrombosis and fibrin clot leading to the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages which leads to inflammatory response. Growth factors and proinflammatory cytokines are then released to activate cells which involve antimicrobial process such as keratinocyte, endothelial, and fibroblast. During inflammatory response, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced to defend cells against bacteria and microorganism invasion. Histamine and other factors leading to an increase in vasodilatation are also released. Cellular proliferation phase is started by the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), including collagen and fibronectin which are produced from fibroblasts. The proliferation of endothelial cells stimulated by vascular-promoting growth factors leads to an increasing amount of blood vessels. Finally, reepithelializing mechanism and tissue remodeling are then started. At this process, fibroblasts are activated by keratinocytes to synthesize growth factors to regulate their proliferation. A noncellular scar, and cross-linked collagen matrix will substitute fibroblast-rich granulation tissue and provide scar tensile strength or intact skin. During the tissue remodeling phase, a decrease in cellularity from the apoptosis of myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells will lead to the process of impaired wound healing. This impairment may be caused by uncontrolled inflammatory, infection, and overproduction of ROS. Excessive ROS production could damage ECM protein and cellular function of fibroblasts and keratinocytes, resulting in slow wound healing process [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The plant extracts with potential for skin protection from its antioxidant property might be useful for the acceleration of tissue wound healing [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Grammatophyllum speciosum</italic> Blume is a plant in Orchidaceae family mostly found in Southeast Asia. The pseudobulb extract of<italic> G. speciosum</italic> was used for relieving pains from scorpion venom (<italic>Heterometrus laoticus</italic>). In addition,<italic> G. speciosum</italic> ethanolic extract (GSE) was reported to have potential for an increase in stem cell phenotypes of human keratinocytes [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, the extract also had an ability to protect the cells against superoxide anion-induced cell death [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].<italic> G. speciosum</italic> contains various phytochemical compounds such as glucosyloxybenzyl derivatives, grammatophyllosides, cronupapine, vandateroside II, gastodin, vanilloloside, orcinol glucoside, and isovitexin [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Due to their benefits, these phytochemicals in this plant may be used as medicine; however, the effect of<italic> G. speciosum</italic> on tissue wound healing has never been investigated.</p><p>This study examined the potential wound healing effects of GSE in human primary skin fibroblast cells. Also, the in vitro antioxidant activity of GSE was evaluated for its ability to scavenge DPPH, ABTS, and superoxide anion radicals.

Crude herb of<italic> G. speciosum</italic> were ground and extracted according to the extraction process to obtain herb-to-extract ratio (HER) of 1:9. The<italic> G. speciosum</italic> extract obtained was highly viscous with a dark-brown color.

Determination of Gastrodin Content by HPLC</title><p>The determination of gastrodin content which is a major compound of<italic> G. speciosum</italic> extract was performed using a rapid high-performance liquid chromatography method under the conditions using gradient elution with a mobile phase of acetonitrile&#x02013;water. The retention time of<italic> G. speciosum</italic> extract samples and standard solutions were found to elute at 6.483 and 6.494&#x02009;min, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The amount of gastrodin in 3 different batches of GSE was analyzed.

Total Phenolic Contents and Antioxidant Activity of the GSE</title><p>Phenolic compounds may directly play a role in the antioxidant effect. The GSE was determined for the total phenolic content using Folin-Ciocalteu assay compared to the standard compound EGCG.

In line with that, this phenomenon was studied by treating GSE on human primary fibroblast cells to analyze its potential on wound healing.</p><p>Cell migration is an important process in the tissue formation phase of wound healing [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The wound healing assay is the method imitating a wound in vitro and investigating a cell migration rate. After a cell monolayer is destroyed by scratching, a loss of cell-cell interaction occurs, resulting in the initiation of cell migration and proliferation. In this study, GSE is able to increase a cell migration rate, indicating the wound healing enhancement.</p><p>The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), superoxide anion (&#x000b7;O2&#x02212;), hydroxyl radical (&#x000b7;OH), lipid peroxides (LOOH), and their radicals (LOO&#x000b7;) occurred and accumulated in skin cells that expose to UVA and UVB (290&#x02013;320&#x02009;nm and 320&#x02013;400&#x02009;nm respectively). These ROS could break down cell membranes and induce skin inflammation, aging, and phototoxicity. Excessive amounts of these ROS might impair the skin wound healing process. In this sense, the plant extracts with antioxidant activity might be beneficial for the enhancement of the wound healing process [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This study found that GSE has antioxidant activity, as determined by its ability to scavenge DPPH, ABTS and superoxide anion radicals.</p><p>Gastrodin, a phenolic glycoside [p-hydroxymethylphenyl-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-D-glucopyranoside], is found as a major active component in<italic> G. Speciosum</italic>. This study selected gastrodin as an active marker to control the quality of GSE due to its presence in significant amount, thereby facilitating detection and analysis. It was also used as an analytical marker for quantitative evaluation of<italic> Rhizoma Gastrodiae</italic> (Tianma) extracts using HPLC [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Gastrodin is a potent antioxidant, which showed protective effects against osteoporosis linking to a reduction in ROS [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The antioxidant effect of GSE might be exerted from the ability of gastrodin in scavenging of ROS.</p><p>Bhat et al. and Pitz et al. found the enhancement of wound healing effects of<italic> Caesalpinia mimosoides</italic> extract and Jaboticaba fruit peel extract, respectively, probably caused by their phenolic contents [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Likewise, the wound healing property of GSE might be from its phenolic compound.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion </title><p>GSE has a potential to enhance the wound healing process of human primary fibroblast cells. Besides, in relation to the increase in wound healing property, the extract is able to scavenge DPPH, ABTS, and superoxide anion radicals.
