Here, we examined SDC1 expression in datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus. Elevated SDC1 expression in glioma was closely associated with increases in tumor progression and shorter survival. We also examined SDC1 expression and evaluated the effects of stable SDC1 knockdown in glioma cell lines. SDC1 knockdown attenuated proliferation and invasion by glioma cells and markedly decreased PCNA and MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression. In a xenograft model, SDC1 knockdown suppressed the tumorigenic effects of U87 cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. SDC1 knockdown decreased phosphorylation of the c-Src/FAK complex and its downstream signaling molecules, Erk, Akt and p38 MAPK.

Despite extensive research, therapies for GBM have not improved much; consequently, patient survival has increased only slightly [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although many studies have shown that various mechanisms are involved in the malignancy of glioma and its infiltration into other tissues, the regulatory factors involved remain largely unknown [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additional investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of human glioma are therefore urgently needed.</p><p>Syndecans are an evolutionarily conserved family of type I transmembrane proteins [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] which lack a common molecular structure and bind various ligands and receptors, including FGFs, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;), platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), integrin, and VEGFR. They also regulate various signaling events both inside and outside cells; for example, syndecans affect the organization of the ECM and cytoskeleton by binding to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and protein kinase C&#x003b1;(PKC&#x003b1;), the activation of which leads to the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. By binding to other molecules, syndecans play dual roles as both cell adhesion receptors and docking receptors and are involved in multiple pathologic processes, including cancer cell proliferation and invasion, angiogenesis, host defense mechanisms, and matrix remodeling [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Syndecan-1 (SDC1) is the most extensively studied member of the family. Studies indicate that SDC1 expression varies among cancer types and that differential expression in stromal compartments and carcinoma cells are strongly associated with tumor aggressiveness and clinical outcomes [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In particular, SDC1 expression is elevated in glioma compared with normal brain tissues [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and Xu <italic>et al</italic>. found that SDC1 expression in human glioma correlates with advanced tumor progression and poor prognosis, indicating that SDC1 might play a pivotal role in the progression of glioma [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the specific mechanisms by which SDC1 promotes glioma remain unknown.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed that syndecans cooperate with integrins to regulate adhesion to a variety of ECM ligands, and this cooperation is required for focal adhesion formation and signal transduction [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. One example of this cooperation is the close association between SDC1 and integrin [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors consisting of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits bound together noncovalently [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Integrins attach intracellular matrix receptors, such as the non-receptor tyrosine kinases focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and c-src, and other signaling proteins to the cytoskeleton; this recruitment and the subsequent activation of these proteins forms a focal adhesion [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Integrins also play a vital role in cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and proliferation in tumors [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous studies have also shown that integrins play a vital role in glioma tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and that c-src and FAK are closely associated with key biological processes in glioma [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we examined the functions of SDC1 and its relationship to the integrin-mediated signaling pathway in several human glioma cell lines. Our results demonstrate that knockdown of SDC1 expression inhibits glioma proliferation and invasion both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, SDC1 knockdown might inhibit integrin-mediated signaling by deregulating the c-src/FAK-associated signaling pathway and in turn attenuating the expression of PCNA and MMP-9.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Elevated SDC1 expression in glioma is closely associated with increased tumor grade and poor prognosis</title><p>To confirm the associations between elevated SDC1 expression in human glioma and increases in tumor progression and poor prognosis, combined data from TCGA for the LGG and GBM datasets and from the NCBI-GEO GSE4290 dataset were analyzed.

Moreover, analysis of TCGA patient survival after segregation by SDC1 expression revealed that elevated SDC1 expression predicted prognosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Glioma patients with SDC1 levels in the top third had dramatically decreased survival compared to those with SDC1 levels in the lowest third (Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival analysis, <italic>p</italic>=0 in both log-rank and Wilcoxon tests).

Our results revealed that SDC1 knockdown only weakly inhibited glioma cell growth in MTT assays and at the beginning of the growth curve. However, SDC1 knockdown markedly inhibited growth in both A172 and U87 cells after 9 and 12 days in colony formation assays. It is possible that these differences might result from differences between the assays in the microenvironment during cell growth. Growth curves and colony formation as measured in the MTT assay reflect the growth of a relatively small number of cells. At early time points in this assay, an unfavorable microenvironment might have slowed the growth of the few cells that were initially present. However, as the number of cells began to increase, the microenvironment might have become more favorable for cell growth, thereby accelerating the proliferation of glioma cells. In addition, we found that U87 cells had stronger migration ability and much stronger invasion ability than A172 cells. This finding might be due to an increased sensitivity to Matrigel, which might enhance invasive ability, in U87 cells compared to A172 cells. PCNA, the expression of which is elevated in proliferating cells and in most malignant tumor cells, is commonly used as a proliferative/malignancy biomarker in cancer [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, expression of MMP-9, which is associated with cell migration and extracellular matrix degradation, reflects the migration and invasion of tumor cells [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our data suggest that SDC1 knockdown inhibits the proliferation and invasion of A172 and U87 cells by inhibiting PCNA and MMP-9 expression.</p><p>We also determined the effects of SDC1 knockdown on tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> using a xenograft model. Tumors resulting from the injection of shSDC1 cells grew more slowly than those resulting from control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, 6B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>), as evidenced by both lower tumor weights and volumes. This result was consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data and confirmed that SDC1 knockdown also inhibited glioma cell growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, we examined SDC1 expression in cancer cells using immunohistochemistry and found that SDC1 expression was reduced in the SDC1 knockdown group compared to the control/scramble group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). These results further confirm that SDC1 might be a key signaling molecule in the regulation of glioma cell proliferation.</p><p>Upon integrin recruitment, FAK binds to c-src to form a dual-kinase complex at the sites of cell&#x02013;substratum focal adhesions [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and these c-src/FAK complexes coordinate cell behavior by regulating multiple downstream pathways and molecules, including Akt, p38-mapk, and Erk kinase [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Autophosphorylation of c-src/FAK complexes at either Tyr 397 in FAK or Tyr 416 in c-src is a critical event in integrin-mediated signaling. Notably, pY397FAK binds the SH2 domains of SFKs with high affinity, and this interaction up-regulates c-src kinase activity and, in turn, the phosphorylation of Tyr 416 in c-src. Activated c-src binds to pY397FAK and then phosphorylates additional sites on FAK to form c-src/FAK complexes [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In our study, SDC1 knockdown was also accompanied by a decrease in c-src Tyr 416 and FAK Tyr 397 phosphorylation, which is indicative of the disassembly of c-src/FAK complexes and is consistent with decreased proliferation and invasion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Concomitantly, phosphorylation of Erk, p38mapk, and Akt, which are involved in pathways downstream of c-src/FAK complexes and are closely associated with proliferation and invasion, also decreased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Because glioma cells express predominantly the &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits of integrin [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and SDC1 can interact with bothof these submits [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], SDC1 knockdown might inhibit integrin-mediated signaling by deregulating c-src/FAK-associated signaling pathways in glioma cells.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that angiogenic endothelial glioma tumor cells express integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>/&#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which plays a role in angiogenesis. Drugs that target integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>/&#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> and its ligands, including cilengitide, vitaxin, and CNTO 95 [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], have been evaluated in recent clinical trials. However, phase III trials show that Cilengitide, which specifically binds to integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>/&#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> receptors, in combination with temozolomide failed to improve survival in GBM patients [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-c-src complexes promote anchorage-independence and tumor progression [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], implying that integrin may play inconsistent roles in transducing extracellular signals after binding to different ligands. In addition, SDC1 regulates the activation of integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>/&#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> via its extracellular domain [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that SDC1 plays a vital role in the angiogenesis of glioma. Here, we detected a decrease in microvessel density as indicated by CD34, which is the most reproducible marker of endothelial cells in intratumoral microvessels, in the <italic>in vivo</italic> shSDC1 group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). However, the mechanism by which SDC1 knockdown inhibits angiogenesis in glioma remains unknown. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that SDC1 can be transferred between cells via exosomal release [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We hypothesize that SDC1 might be transferred from glioma cells to vascular cells via exosomal release and thereby regulate the activation of integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>/&#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> on vascular endothelial cells. Our current results might therefore support a new mechanism by which SDC1 contributes to the angiogenesis of glioma.</p><p>In summary, we found that high SDC1 expression in human glioma was strongly associated with more advanced tumor stages and shorter survival. Furthermore, SDC1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and invasion of human glioma cells at least in part by inhibiting integrin-mediated signaling via deregulation of the c-src/FAK-associated signaling pathway. Together, these results indicate that SDC1 might be a promising prognostic predictor and a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of GBM. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the specific mechanisms by which SDC1 regulates proliferation and invasion in glioma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Materials and reagents</title><p>The U251, SHG-44, A172, and U87 human glioma cell lines were purchased from the China Center for Type Culture Collection (Shanghai, China).
