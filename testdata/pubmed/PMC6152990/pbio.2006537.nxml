Vocal learning, even when occurring in adulthood, is thought to largely depend on a sensitive/critical period during postnatal development, and learned vocal patterns emerge gradually as the long-term consequence of vocal practice during this critical period. In this scenario, it is presumed that the effect of vocal practice is thus mainly limited by the intrinsic timing of age-dependent maturation factors that close the critical period and reduce neural plasticity. However, an alternative, as-yet untested hypothesis is that vocal practice itself, independently of age, regulates vocal learning plasticity. Here, we explicitly discriminate between the influences of age and vocal practice using a songbird model system. We prevented zebra finches from singing during the critical period of sensorimotor learning by reversible postural manipulation. This enabled to us to separate lifelong vocal experience from the effects of age. The singing-prevented birds produced juvenile-like immature song and retained sufficient ability to acquire a tutored song even at adulthood when allowed to sing freely. Genome-wide gene expression network analysis revealed that this adult vocal plasticity was accompanied by an intense induction of singing activity-dependent genes, similar to that observed in juvenile birds, rather than of age-dependent genes. The transcriptional changes of activity-dependent genes occurred in the vocal motor robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) projection neurons that play a critical role in the production of song phonology. These gene expression changes were accompanied by neuroanatomical changes: dendritic spine pruning in RA projection neurons. These results show that self-motivated practice itself changes the expression dynamics of activity-dependent genes associated with vocal learning plasticity and that this process is not tightly linked to age-dependent maturational factors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>How is plasticity associated with vocal learning regulated during a critical period? Although there are abundant studies on the critical period in sensory systems, which are passively regulated by the external environment, few studies have manipulated the sensorimotor experience through the entire critical period. Thus, it is a commonly held belief that age or intrinsic maturation is a crucial factor for the closure of the critical period of vocal learning. Contrary to this idea, our study using songbirds provides a new insight that self-motivated vocal practice, not age, regulates vocal learning plasticity during the critical period. To examine the effects of vocal practice on vocal learning, we prevented juvenile zebra finches from singing during the critical period by postural manipulation, which separated the contribution of lifelong vocal experience from that of age. When these birds were allowed to freely sing as adults, they generated highly plastic songs and maintained the ability to mimic tutored songs, as normal juveniles did. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that both juveniles and singing-prevented adults, but not normally reared adults, expressed a similar set of singing-dependent genes in a song nucleus in the brain that regulates syllable acoustics. However, age-dependent genes were still similarly expressed in both singing-prevented and normally reared adult birds. These results exhibit that vocal learning plasticity is actively controlled by self-motivated vocal practice.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>JSPS DC fellowship <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/">https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/</ext-link> (grant number JP26001737). to SH.

This learning process is achieved through sensory learning to memorize model sounds and sensorimotor learning based on matching auditory inputs and motor output to the model sounds by iterative self-motivated practice of vocalization. However, neither humans nor songbirds maintain their vocal learning ability equally well during all phases of life; the ability is circumscribed by critical/sensitive periods for vocal learning. Although there exist abundant studies on the critical period of sensory system development regulated by environmental stimuli [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the neural mechanisms underlying the critical period for sensorimotor learning, especially for vocal learning, are not well understood.</p><p>The songbird is highly advantageous for studying the neural substrate of vocal learning and its critical period. The critical period of song learning includes 2 phases, the sensory and sensorimotor learning phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In the sensory learning phase, juveniles acquire sensory memories of song by listening to adult birds&#x02019; songs, which serve as a template to imitate. The sensorimotor learning phase starts with the generation of soft and highly variable syllables, called &#x0201c;subsong.&#x0201d; Thereafter, birds start producing &#x0201c;plastic song,&#x0201d; characterized by the gradual inclusion of recognizable yet variable syllables. At the end of the learning process, the song is crystallized with acoustically and sequentially stable syllable patterns (&#x0201c;crystallized song&#x0201d;). In a closed-ended vocal learner songbird, like the zebra finch, the time window of the sensorimotor learning phase lasts 2 months, beginning in juveniles at 30&#x02013;45 post hatching day (phd) and ending in adulthood at 90&#x02013;100 phd with the production of crystallized motif song patterns that are then maintained throughout life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). During the sensorimotor learning phase, zebra finches produce approximately 1,000 song renditions in a day through self-motivated vocal practice [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><fig id="pbio.2006537.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.2006537.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Singing experience&#x02013;dependent regulation for the sensorimotor learning period of song acquisition in zebra finch.</title><p>(A) Critical period of vocal learning (upper panel) and song development (lower panels) in the zebra finch.

This age-independent sensorimotor learning was accompanied by significant changes in the expression of singing activity&#x02013;dependent genes&#x02014;but not age-related genes&#x02014;in the projection neurons of song nuclei RA. Furthermore, the number of dendritic spines of the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) was also affected by cumulative singing practice.

To elucidate the importance of self-motivated vocal practice to song development during the sensorimotor learning phase in contrast to age itself, we prevented juvenile zebra finches from singing before initiation of their first song (approximately 30 phd) until adulthood (91&#x02013;133 phd, mean = 101.6 phd) by postural manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The postural manipulation was performed by attaching a custom-made weight on the neck of juvenile birds only during daylight hours, based on a modified method that uses weights to manipulate singing [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The weight shifted their posture slightly toward an inferior position (approximately at 0.5&#x02013;1.5 cm lower than normal height); the weight was supported by the floor of the cage (i.e., not carried by the bird&#x02019;s neck). Although this manipulation prevented singing, the birds were exposed to a tutor song produced by their biological fathers and could still freely generate daily behaviors, such as drinking, eating, and producing non-song-related vocalization, like calls. The weight was detachable and daily adjusted for each bird (up to 16.5&#x02013;24.0 g) so that it was at the threshold of preventing singing without adversely affecting the bird&#x02019;s health or bodily growth. To account for the overall health of the animals, body weights were regularly monitored.

When the birds were released from singing prevention at adulthood, they produced &#x0201c;age-unmatched&#x0201d; immature songs with highly variable acoustics and sequence of syllables, i.e., subsong or early plastic-like song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To quantify the immaturity of song quality in SP birds, we calculated the values of pitch, pitch goodness, and amplitude modulation (AM) and the entropy variance of syllables as acoustic parameters [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and motif consistency as a parameter of song sequence [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In all parameters, songs of the SP birds were similar to the subsong/early plastic song produced by normal juveniles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Despite the manipulation, in 3 of 24 birds, the weight-based postural manipulation did not affect singing practice, i.e., the birds persistently continued singing (more than 10,000 bouts of total singing). Even under the postural manipulation condition, the persistent singers developed crystallized songs with the typical motif structure and copied song traits from their tutors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), indicating that iterative singing experience per se but not the experimental handling influences song development and learning.</p><p>In adult SP birds producing immature-like plastic songs, we investigated whether or not they also retained vocal learning plasticity to mimic the tutor songs that they had already memorized.

In addition, the SP adult birds did not only develop species-typical crystalized songs, but they also mimicked their tutor songs at the levels of both syllable acoustics and sequence (motif) features. Comparison between the songs produced at 1&#x02013;2 days after release (phd 101&#x02013;103) and ones after 3&#x02013;4 weeks (phd 120&#x02013;126) revealed a significant increase of syllable and motif similarity scores toward their tutor songs (paired <italic>t</italic> test: syllable, <italic>t</italic>(4) = 7.7, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0015; motif, <italic>t</italic>(4) = 5.8, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0044) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>).

In 12,156 genes expressed in the telencephalon of the zebra finch, 3,214 and 1,811 genes were identified in HVC and RA, respectively, as genes that were differentially regulated by age and/or singing. For these genes, a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified 5 and 4 &#x0201c;Gene Clusters&#x0201d; in HVC and RA, respectively, as the coexpressed genes correlated with singing experience, age, and/or singing induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2C&#x02013;2E</xref>). Only one of the gene clusters, RA Gene Cluster I, met criteria that were significantly regulated by cumulative singing experience instead of age. This gene cluster contained 119 genes, including a novel set of singing activity&#x02013;dependent genes (transcription factors/regulators: <italic>Atf3</italic>, <italic>Crem</italic>, <italic>Nr4a1</italic>, and <italic>Irf8</italic>; subunits of histone deacetylase complex: <italic>Fam60a</italic>; serine/threonine kinases: <italic>Sik1</italic> and <italic>Sgk1</italic>; and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatases: <italic>Dusp5</italic> and <italic>6</italic>).

However, the singing-driven induction response was gradually attenuated as singing experience accumulated over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>), suggesting that the long-term cumulative experience of vocal practice progressively dampens the expression of singing activity&#x02013;dependent genes as the sensorimotor learning phase progresses.</p><p>WGCNA further indicated that other gene clusters (Cluster II and III) were regulated by both singing experience and age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2C&#x02013;2E</xref>). However, when comparing each individual gene expression of the clusters in the expression heat map, most of the genes in Cluster II and III were similarly expressed in both normally reared and SP birds as age-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), indicating that SP birds normally retain the developmental expression dynamics of age-regulated genes. In line with this, a <italic>cis</italic>-enrichment analysis revealed that differentially unique sets of transcription factors presumably bound the promoter regions of the coexpressed genes between different clusters.

Therefore, separating the effects of age (intrinsic developmental maturation) and practice (self-motivated behavior) is crucial for precise understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the critical period of sensorimotor learning.</p><p>Compared with birds isolated from sensory learning (tutoring) or auditory feedback during the sensorimotor learning, SP birds produced immature subsong/early plastic songs when they were released from manipulations at adulthood (&#x0003e;100 phd). In contrast to SP birds, both nontutored and auditory feedback&#x02013;prevented birds can produce singing behavior during the sensorimotor learning phase and develop a certain degree of structured songs by adulthood even without referencing tutor song memories [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. When nontutored birds in social isolation first hear tutor songs at 120 phd, they thereafter change a few syllables of their own already existing song to mimic those from their tutor&#x02019;s song. However, they do not retain the vocal plasticity necessary to mimic their tutor&#x02019;s song structures [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This decreased song plasticity in early isolated birds could be caused by partial closing of sensory and sensorimotor learning ability in nontutored birds at adulthood. In parallel, birds prevented from hearing their own song production through noise exposure can change syllable acoustics but not copy the sequence order of memorized tutor songs when they are released from noise exposure as adults [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In contrast to adult birds prevented from matching their song output to memories, SP adult birds retain sufficient vocal learning plasticity to copy both the syllable acoustics and sequence order of memorized tutor songs. This suggests that singing practice itself, rather than other age-related factors, regulates the critical phase of sensorimotor learning. The high degree of vocal learning plasticity in SP birds was associated with producing structurally immature songs when they are allowed to sing freely. Therefore, although interruption of normal tutoring and hearing experiences can retain a certain degree of vocal plasticity until the adult stage, preventing cumulative singing experience induces a more intensive effect on vocal learning plasticity by almost stopping song maturation. This song immaturity could be a direct cause of the later vocal learning plasticity, and it enabled age-independent vocal learning after the sensitive period in the SP birds. However, because of the limited sample size in this study, we could not fully examine whether the amount of singing practice during the prevention period affects individual&#x02019;s song imitation accuracy after release.</p><p>We previously reported that early-deafened zebra finches produce a normal amount of singing during development and still maintain highly variable songs in terms of both syllable acoustics and sequence even as adults (140&#x02013;180 phd) [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, cumulative singing experience itself is not sufficient to decrease vocal plasticity. Rather, the cumulative experience of sensorimotor integration&#x02014;i.e., self-motivated vocalization with normal auditory feedback (tutoring)&#x02014;is an essential behavioral factor to promote song stabilization&#x02014;i.e., closing of the sensorimotor learning period. However, this study does not examine a potential contribution of cumulative singing experience to closing the sensory learning phase versus the sensorimotor learning phase. To elucidate this point, it would be necessary to track the song development of SP birds that are exposed to a tutor only in adulthood. In addition, singing prevention longer than the 100 days used in the present study would allow us to examine the time limitation of retaining sensorimotor learning plasticity, which might be genetically constrained.</p><p>RA has a crucial role in the song circuits as the telencephalic output nucleus receiving 2 premotor inputs: a motor exploration signal from the LMAN as the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit output and a time-locked sequence signal from HVC of the motor circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, the 2 circuits do not equally contribute to song production during the critical period of sensorimotor learning. Early in song development, vocal output is dominated by LMAN input to RA [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. With accumulation of singing experience, the LMAN&#x02019;s effectiveness is curtailed by pruning and strengthening of the HVC to RA synapses [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition, synaptic connectivity from interneurons to projection neurons in RA is initially dense and nonspecific and then pruned with specific reciprocal patterns during sensorimotor learning [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], suggesting that song development engages multiple processes to reduce shared synaptic inputs to RA projection neurons. If so, our finding that the SP birds retained higher density of dendritic spines in the RA projection neurons like juveniles may indicate a singing experience&#x02014;but not age-dependent mechanism for sculpting of functional connectivity of RA. Activity-dependent synaptic potentiation and depression are induced at the synapses of RA projection neurons [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Notably, zebra finch juveniles (45&#x02013;60 phd) possess distinct capacity for long-term depression (LTD) in RA neurons compared with adult birds [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. <italic>Arc</italic> is a critical regulator that modulates the synaptic plasticity underlying LTD induction [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This evidence supports a functional linkage between activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and activity-dependent gene induction in RA for regulation of vocal plasticity through the singing experience&#x02013;dependent sculpting of functional connectivity.</p><p>Most of the singing experience&#x02013;regulated genes were previously known as immediate-early genes, which regulate downstream effector proteins for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Singing behavior generates robust neuronal activity in the song system, including RA and other song nuclei, throughout a bird&#x02019;s life from juvenile to adult stages [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, some immediate-early genes are more highly induced by singing in the song nuclei (e.g., <italic>egr1</italic>[<italic>zenk</italic>] and <italic>Arc</italic> in RA and <italic>penk</italic> in HVC) in juvenile than adult stages, although the causal reason of the developmental different induction is not known [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this study, we found that RA shows a reduction of singing activity&#x02013;dependent gene induction during the accumulation of singing experience. Which region-selective neuronal mechanisms regulate change in the expression dynamics of singing activity&#x02013;dependent genes in RA? One possibility is neuronal activity&#x02013;mediated epigenetic regulation&#x02014;i.e., induction and activation of epigenetic regulators by neuronal firing to change epigenetic states at the regulatory regions of other activity-dependent genes [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In the RA Cluster I genes, we identified the epigenetic regulators that were induced by singing: a DNA methylation regulator <italic>Gadd45b</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], replacement histone <italic>H3</italic>.<italic>3b</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and a subunit of the Sin3&#x02013;histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) complex <italic>Fam60a</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These singing-driven epigenetic regulators could directly change the epigenetic state of the regulatory regions of other RA Cluster I genes, but this hypothesis remains to be fully evaluated.</p><p>Vocal learning has evolved convergently in a few lineages of birds and mammals. Recently, there is accumulating evidence that marmoset monkeys possess the ability for production-related vocal plasticity, especially to develop acoustic features via feedback from their parents [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Production-related vocal plasticity in marmosets could be a good mammalian model system to examine the cumulative vocal practice&#x02013;related expression dynamics of activity-dependent genes that we found in songbirds. Avian vocal learners (songbirds, parrots, and hummingbirds) and humans possess analogous neural networks connecting anatomically similar cortical and subcortical brain regions as a form of convergent neural circuit evolution [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, songbirds and humans share convergent transcriptional specializations in the brain regions for learned vocalization [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Therefore, language acquisition in humans could be mediated by the expression dynamics of neuronal activity&#x02013;dependent genes in specific neural populations, such as cortical layer V projection neurons in laryngeal motor regions, analogous to songbirds&#x02019; RA [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Although many challenges remain in elucidating the neural basis of vocal learning, insights from songbirds may lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying learned vocal communication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All experiments were conducted under the guidelines and approval of the Committee on Animal Experiments of Hokkaido University (Approved No. 13&#x02013;0061).

The weight was detachable and daily adjusted for each bird (up to 16.5&#x02013;24.0 g). Note that weight was usually supported by the floor, not carried by the bird&#x02019;s neck, during the days. Therefore, the birds could freely generate daily behaviors, such as drinking, eating, grooming, and calling. The weight was removed from birds during light-off time and for at least 1 hour during light-on time to reduce potential stress.

Frozen sections (12 &#x003bc;m thick) were cut in the sagittal plane. Brain sections for a given experiment were simultaneously fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/1&#x000d7; PBS (pH 7.4), washed in 1&#x000d7; PBS, acetylated, dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series, air dried, and processed for in situ hybridization with antisense <sup>35</sup>S-UTP-labeled riboprobes of genes. To generate the riboprobes, gene inserts in the pGEM-T Easy vector were PCR amplified with plasmid M13 forward and reverse primers and then gel purified. The amplified DNA fragments and SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase was used to transcribe the antisense <sup>35</sup>S-riboprobes. A total of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cpm of the <sup>35</sup>S-probe was added to a hybridization solution (50% formamide, 10% dextran, 1&#x000d7; Denhardt&#x02019;s solution, 12 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mg/mL yeast tRNA, and 10 mM dithiothreitol). Hybridization was performed at 65 &#x000b0;C for 12&#x02013;14 h. The slides were washed in 2&#x000d7; SSPE and 0.1% &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol at RT for 1 h, 2&#x000d7; SSPE, 50% formamide, and 0.1% &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol at 65 &#x000b0;C for 1 h, and 0.1&#x000d7; SSPE twice at 65 &#x000b0;C for 30 minutes each. Slides were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series and exposed to X-ray film (Biomax MR, Kodak) for 1&#x02013;14 days. We carefully attended not to overexpose X-ray films to S<sup>35</sup>-riboprobe hybridized brain sections. The slides were then dipped in an autoradiographic emulsion (NTB2, Kodak), incubated for 1&#x02013;8 weeks, and processed with D-19 developer (Kodak) and fixer (Kodak). Developed slides were Nissl-stained with a cresyl violet acetate solution (Sigma) for the capture of high-resolution images. For quantification of mRNA signal, exposed X-ray films of brain images were digitally scanned under a microscope (Leica, Z16 APO) connected to a CCD camera (Leica, DFC490) with Application Suite V3 imaging software (Leica), as previously described [<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2006537.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To minimize handling bias for signal detection among experimental groups, we performed in situ hybridization using multiple brain sections at once for each probe and exposed S<sup>35</sup>-riboprobe hybridized brain sections on the same sheet of X-ray films. The same light settings were used for all images. Photoshop (Adobe Systems) was used to measure the mean pixel intensities in the brain areas of interest from sections after conversion to 256 grayscale images. For statistical analysis of the expression of each gene, we performed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to examine the homoscedasticity from the regression line of the gene induction ratio between singing duration and expression level.</p><p>For fluorescence in situ hybridization, dinitrophenyl (DNP)&#x02014;and digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled riboprobes were used. A total of 100&#x02013;200 ng of the DNP/DIG-labeled riboprobe was mixed with the hybridization solution (50% formamide, 10% dextran, 1&#x000d7; Denhardt&#x02019;s solution, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 33 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 600 mM NaCl, 0.2 mg/mL yeast tRNA, 80 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine). Hybridization was performed at 68 &#x000b0;C for 6&#x02013;13 h. Washing steps were performed as follows: 5&#x000d7; SSC solution at 68 &#x000b0;C for 30 minutes, formamide-I solution (4&#x000d7; SSC, 50% formamide, and 0.005% Tween20) at 68 &#x000b0;C for 40 minutes, formamide-II solution (2&#x000d7; SSC, 50% formamide, and 0.005% Tween20) at 68 &#x000b0;C for 40 minutes, 0.1&#x000d7; SSC 68 &#x000b0;C 15 minutes &#x000d7; 3, NTE buffer at RT for 20 minutes, and TNT buffer &#x000d7; 3, and TNB buffer (0.5% blocking reagent [Perkin Elmer]/1&#x000d7; TNT buffer) at RT for 30 minutes. DNP-labeled probes were detected with an anti-DNP horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody using a TSA DNP system (Perkin Elmer) and anti-DNP KLH AlexaFluor488 (Molecular Probes, cat#A-11097). Following treatment with 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/1&#x000d7; PBS for 30 minutes, DIG-labeled probes were detected with anti-DIG HRP-conjugated antibody (Jackson Laboratory, cat#200-032-156) and a TSA Plus Cy3 system (Perkin Elmer).
