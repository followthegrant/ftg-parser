This study investigated the adjustment of hybridization stringency using formamide with the idea that sensitivity and specificity can be optimized during probe design if the hybridization efficiency of oligonucleotides with target and non-target molecules can be predicted as a function of formamide concentration. Sigmoidal denaturation profiles were obtained using fluorescently labeled and fragmented 16S rRNA gene amplicon of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as the target with increasing concentrations of formamide in the hybridization buffer. A linear free energy model (LFEM) was developed and microarray-specific nearest neighbor rules were derived. The model simulated formamide melting with a denaturant <italic>m</italic>-value that increased hybridization free energy (&#x00394;G&#x000b0;) by 0.173 kcal/mol per percent of formamide added (v/v). Using the LFEM and specific probe sets, free energy rules were systematically established to predict the stability of single and double mismatches, including bulged and tandem mismatches. The absolute error in predicting the position of experimental denaturation profiles was less than 5% formamide for more than 90 percent of probes, enabling a practical level of accuracy in probe design. The potential of the modeling approach for probe design and optimization is demonstrated using a dataset including the 16S rRNA gene of <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> as an additional target molecule. The LFEM and thermodynamic databases were incorporated into a computational tool (ProbeMelt) that is freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://DECIPHER.cee.wisc.edu">http://DECIPHER.cee.wisc.edu</ext-link>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by National Science Foundation grants CBET-0606894 to DRN and CBET-0636533 to DRN and LSY, the Austrian Science Fund (P20185-B17 to AL), and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research (GEN-AU III InflammoBiota to MW and AL).

To this end, microarrays can be quite effective in determining community composition as they allow the simultaneous capture of the different types of a marker molecule (typically a functional gene or rRNA) in complex target mixtures using a large set of organism- and group-specific single-stranded DNA probes <xref rid="pone.0043862-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Besides traditional low throughput techniques such as Sanger sequencing of clone libraries <xref rid="pone.0043862-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) <xref rid="pone.0043862-Wagner2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, as well as the recently established high throughput sequencing approaches <xref rid="pone.0043862-Sogin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, microarrays are an important component of the microbial ecologist&#x02019;s molecular toolbox. However, the routine use of microarrays for diagnostic applications is challenged by the difficulty of designing thousands of oligonucleotide probes with optimal sensitivity and specificity to phylogenetic markers.</p><p>Probe optimization is complicated by the overwhelming diversity of microorganisms as observed with the sequence databases of small subunit rRNA, the most commonly used phylogenetic marker <xref rid="pone.0043862-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Pruesse1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-DeSantis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. While probes in the longer range (&#x0003e;30 nucleotides) can generally assure sensitivity by efficient target capture, they cause specificity problems in two ways. First, due to within-group sequence variability, the longer the target site, the poorer the coverage of the probe over its targeted group of organisms (e.g., a species or a genus). Second, the higher affinity of long probes to their target molecules undermines their ability to discriminate the perfectly matching target sequences of interest from mismatching out-group sequences, thereby causing false positive identifications. Oligonucleotide probes on microarrays targeting rRNA (genes) are thus mostly in the shorter size range (&#x0003c;30 nucleotides). However, using shorter probes with lowered affinity can obviously cause sensitivity problems due to inefficient target capture, leading to false negatives. Therefore, in microbial ecology applications of microarrays, probe design and optimization of hybridization conditions require establishing a delicate balance between sensitivity and specificity in the oligonucleotide size range.</p><p>Since the accurate prediction of probe sensitivity and specificity is difficult <xref rid="pone.0043862-Pozhitkov1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, earlier studies with spotted microarrays relied on experimental evaluations of probes. Single targets from culture collections or clone libraries hybridized on separate microarrays were used as references to verify the relationship between probe response and organism identification in environmental samples <xref rid="pone.0043862-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Loy1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Loy2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Although tedious, empirical testing of almost every individual probe was feasible due to the small enough number of probes (tens to hundreds) on such microarrays. However, advanced high-density microarray technology currently allows the synthesis of thousands to millions of probe features on the same slide (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nimblegen.com/">http://www.nimblegen.com/</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.affymetrix.com">http://www.affymetrix.com</ext-link>). While this has brought the great advantage of using more comprehensive probe sets, as in the design of 16S rRNA-based microarrays for the identification of large numbers of different phylogenetic groups of microorganisms <xref rid="pone.0043862-Brodie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-RajilicStojanovic1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, experimental testing of all probes is no longer an option. Rather, in addition to using standard mismatch probes as in Affymetrix setups <xref rid="pone.0043862-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Binder1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, which are not necessarily adequate controls for cross hybridization <xref rid="pone.0043862-Pozhitkov2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, high-density microarray applications rely on the ability to design multiple probes for each taxonomic group to reduce the chance of misidentification. Certainly, it is still desirable to develop a robust strategy for the design of the individual probes with optimal sensitivity and specificity, thus increasing the accuracy of identifications based on organism-specific probe sets. We are therefore interested in establishing stringent and predictable hybridization conditions to maximize the confidence in the analyses of microbial communities.</p><p>In this study, we propose the methodical use of formamide during microarray hybridizations to develop design rules for the optimization of probe sensitivity and specificity. Formamide is a denaturant routinely used in hybridization techniques to adjust stringency <xref rid="pone.0043862-He1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Manz1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Stahl1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. As formamide concentration in the hybridization buffer is increased, probe/target duplexes denature, usually resulting in a sigmoidal decrease in signal response and generating a so-called melting curve <xref rid="pone.0043862-Yilmaz1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Yilmaz2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Since the denaturation proceeds more rapidly for mismatched duplexes than for perfect matches, there is generally an optimal range of formamide concentration that effectively eliminates signal response from mismatched non-target organisms while maintaining high signal for still non-denatured perfect match targets. Unlike other hybridization techniques, systematic evaluations of formamide denaturation are not available for microarrays, although preliminary formamide series during hybridization have been reported <xref rid="pone.0043862-Hesselsoe1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. We show here that sigmoidal formamide melting profiles can be obtained with microarray probes, as in FISH <xref rid="pone.0043862-Manz1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Yilmaz2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. For this approach to be effective in probe design, one needs to be able to predict formamide denaturation and determine the optimal concentration range for mismatch discrimination. Thus, we also use equilibrium thermodynamics to develop a linear free energy model (LFEM) of formamide melting <xref rid="pone.0043862-Yilmaz2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Schellman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and employ this model to systematically derive thermodynamic parameters that characterize the stability of both perfect match and mismatched duplexes. Our analysis shows that the predictive ability of microarray LFEM is much better than similar models devised for FISH <xref rid="pone.0043862-Yilmaz2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. When combined with the multiple-probe strategy in high-density arrays, the overall approach can potentially facilitate the optimization of probe sensitivity and specificity for the high-confidence identification of organisms in complex microbial communities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Targets and Target Labeling</title><p>Single 16S rRNA gene clones of <italic>Escherichia coli K-12</italic> and <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1</italic> were used as pure target templates. A small subunit rRNA gene clone library was developed and sequenced to determine the clones retrieved from the rRNA operons that encoded for the sequences used in probe design (see below). Briefly, plasmid inserts of clones were obtained from pure cultures by cell-PCR amplification with 27f <xref rid="pone.0043862-Giovannoni1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and 1492r <xref rid="pone.0043862-Lane1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> primers, followed by ligation and transformation with the TOPO10 cloning kit and TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The insert was amplified with M13 primers and purified using Ampure (Agencourt Bioscience Corporation, Beverly, MA). The purified product was sequenced (primed with 27f) at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology center using Sanger&#x02019;s method. Partial sequences (ca. 800 nucleotides) were used to match sequences to known rRNA operons and one clone that matched the design template was selected for each organism.</p><p>For target labeling, the cloned and purified 16S rRNA gene was first re-amplified with the 27f and 1492r primers, and the product was purified using a QIAquick spin column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and Cy3-labeled according to a previously published protocol <xref rid="pone.0043862-Loy1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Briefly, Cy3-dCTPs (Amersham, GE Healthcare; Little Chalfont; UK) were incorporated into 200 ng PCR product during random prime amplification with Klenow fragment and a decalabel DNA labeling kit (Fermentas, St Leon-Rot, Germany). The product of labeling was purified with a QIAquick spin column and the yield was measured using a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Products, Wilmington, DE). The target concentrations were in the range of 25&#x02013;35 ng/&#x000b5;L, with an incorporated dye concentration of 0.8&#x02013;1.2 ng/&#x000b5;L. The applied labeling procedure results in a fragmented target due to the linear random priming amplification. This was confirmed by measuring the labeled product length with an Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), which showed lengths ranging between 25 and 150 bases, with an average of 65 bases.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Microarrays and Probes</title><p>High-density 4-plex microarray slides were obtained from Nimblegen (Madison, WI). Each of the four subarrays accommodated 72,000 features. Most probes were replicated three times on the array, with a total of &#x0223c;24,000 independent probe sequences produced, of which, 15,394 were used in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t001">Table 1</xref>).

A poly-T chain of 20 bases was added to the 3&#x02032; end of the probe sequence, to provide an elevation above the slide surface in addition to the default linker of Nimblegen design. This was done to minimize the brush effect due to the surface-proximal tails of target molecules, which may reduce signal intensity in ways difficult to predict <xref rid="pone.0043862-Halperin1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Peplies1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Stedtfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. All Ts in the first three nucleotides (nearest to probe sequence) of the poly-T linker that matched an A or G in the target sequence were converted to As, to avoid the additional free energy of binding from dT-dA or dT-dG type interactions between the poly-T linker and target.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0043862-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043862.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Probe sets used in modeling.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0043862-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0043862.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Set</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">a</xref>

The slides were placed in a 12-bay NimbleGen Hybridization System for overnight (&#x0223c;20 hrs) hybridization at a controlled constant temperature of 42&#x000b0;C, and with active mixing of the hybridization buffer to improve mass transfer.</p><p>After hybridization, slides were washed in pairs, using a series of three wash buffers (I, II, and III) provided by Nimblegen and following Nimblegen guidelines. All buffers were amended with 0.1 mM dithiothreitol according to manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. Each slide was first submerged in 250 mL of pre-warmed (40&#x02013;45&#x000b0;C) wash buffer I to detach the mixer from slide surface and immediately taken through the wash series in buffers I (2 min), II (1 min), and III (15 secs) at room temperature with constant manual agitation. The slides were dried using Arrayit High-Speed Microarray Centrifuge (Telechem, Silicon Valley, CA) and subsequently stored in a dark and dry environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Scanning and Analysis</title><p>Microarrays were scanned with an Axon 4000B laser scanner and GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The wavelength and PMT gain were set at 532 nm and 430, respectively. Two lines were averaged during scanning. Fluorescence data was saved in TIFF files, which were processed with Nimblescan software (Nimblegen). Using the signal from the alignment oligomers a custom grid was aligned with the images to derive raw data for each feature. It should be noted that this procedure produces data in the form of pixel intensity values ranging from 0 to 65536, the latter representing a saturation point. Raw data was saved as pair files and analyzed using Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). For each probe, the average and standard deviation of the brightness of three replicate features were calculated. An outlier test was also performed, such that if one of the replicates gave a value that was more than three standard deviations (of the remaining two) away from the average of the remaining two it was eliminated. Then, the average of control (Nonsense) probes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t001">Table 1</xref>) was subtracted from all averages to obtain background-corrected results (standard deviations were calculated with error propagation).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Linear Free Energy Model (LFEM)</title><p>To simulate probe/target hybridization in the presence of formamide, the LFEM previously developed for FISH <xref rid="pone.0043862-Yilmaz2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> was reduced to a two-state hybridization system describing the local equilibrium at the probe&#x02019;s microenvironment (<italic>P</italic>+<italic>T</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>PT</italic>, where P, T, and PT denote probe, target, and hybrid, respectively).

After model development, retrospective analyses showed that 99%, 93%, and 56% of these filtered probes were predicted to have half denaturation points (see below) at or below 15%, 10%, and 5% (v/v) formamide, respectively.

For each target, this was achieved by parallel hybridizations with two slides (4 arrays per slide). Typical experimental profiles are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1A</xref> for selected perfectly matched and mismatched probes from the hybridization experiment with 5 ng of amplified, fragmented, and Cy3-labeled <italic>E. coli</italic> 16S rRNA gene used in model development. As expected, increasing formamide creates a sigmoid-like loss of signal as the efficiency of target capture decreases, and the melting occurs at lower concentrations when mismatches are inserted in the duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). For those probes with a full sigmoid trend, there is a general increase of signal with increasing formamide at lower formamide concentrations, as exemplified by the perfect match probe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, which may be due to the removal of structural kinetic limitations by formamide as in FISH <xref rid="pone.0043862-Yilmaz3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Gamper1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> or other unknown complications in microarray hybridizations. In any case, the gradual loss of signal at higher stringency creates a window of formamide concentrations (15&#x02013;25% in the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), where the signal from perfect match duplex is easily detectable, while the mismatched duplexes are close to the background, thereby allowing mismatch discrimination as desired. Thus, our modeling efforts aimed at predicting the observed melting behavior for probe design and optimization.</p><fig id="pone-0043862-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043862.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Characteristics of formamide denaturation profiles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example formamide curves with perfect match, one-mismatch, and two-mismatch probes targeting the same site on 16S rRNA gene of <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Amount of hybridized target was 5 ng.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0043862.g001"/></fig><p>Our mathematical framework depends on the estimation of the standard Gibbs free energy change (&#x00394;G&#x000b0;) of the hybridization reaction (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0043862.e001">Equation 1</xref>). Initially, we used UNAFold <xref rid="pone.0043862-Markham1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> to predict a &#x00394;G&#x000b0; value based on thermodynamic parameters from in-solution hybridizations (hence designated &#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>sln</sub>) and evaluated its correlation with the experimental observations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, this free energy value poorly correlated with maximum signal intensity of probes in a formamide series (<italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic>). The low correlation can be attributed to non-thermodynamic factors that may influence the signal intensity of individual probes, such as the biases introduced during the amplification and fragmentation of the target (e.g., fragment concentration and dye labeling efficiency). Indeed, <italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic> showed non-random positional dependence in the 16S rRNA gene with regions of peaks and sinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), which may presumably reflect these biases. It is noteworthy that, patterns as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1D</xref> have been reported before for single target molecules <xref rid="pone.0043862-Mei1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, but could be related to binding free energy unlike with our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). A more robust descriptor of thermodynamic stability would be the melting behavior, since positional and other non-thermodynamic factors for a given probe likely remain constant in a formamide series. Consistently, the point of half-denaturation ([FA]<sub>1/2,exp</sub>), defined as the formamide concentration where signal intensity decreased to half of <italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic>, was largely predictable by &#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>sln</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This term represents the melting point of the duplex when a nearly full sigmoidal profile is obtained as is the case for most perfect matches used in this analysis. In retrospect, [FA]<sub>1/2,exp</sub> also does not correlate with <italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic> itself (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.22; not shown), further pointing to the dependence of <italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic> on factors not related with stability. Thus, we focused our modeling strategy on the normalized melting profiles where thermodynamically irrelevant signal variations as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1D</xref> are mostly eliminated.</p><p>Our methodology is based on simulating the formamide-based denaturation of a probe/target duplex with the linear free energy model (LFEM) in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0043862.e001">Equation 1</xref>. This defines hybridization efficiency as a sigmoidally decreasing function with increasing formamide concentration, which takes values up to 1 at low formamide and 0 at full denaturation. The resulting theoretical curves are simultaneously fitted to large sets of experimental probe profiles normalized using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0043862.e003">Equation 3</xref> for each probe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g002">Figure 2</xref> for example fits). In what follows, we describe the stepwise use of LFEM for the systematic establishment of free energy rules and calibration of formamide denaturation models for perfect and mismatched duplexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0043862-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043862.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Formamide melting profiles of 12 arbitrarily selected perfect match probes and their mismatched versions.</title><p>All perfect matches are from the TileE set, since only this set has mismatched versions (for examples from the Length set, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043862.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).

This set was designed to have a wide variability of half denaturation points (range, 4&#x02013;30%; median, 18%) for a robust calibration of key modeling parameters. A randomly selected subset of 500 probes (N<sub>F</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;500, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>) was used for curve fitting, and the rest for model validation. In addition, signal intensity values that were to the left of <italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic> and less than 80% of <italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic> (e.g. the 0% formamide data point in the perfect match example of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) were discarded to prevent the influence of possible kinetic factors at lower formamide concentrations. Thus, a total of 3,630 data points were used in the fitting with 500 probes. Using this data set we compared three models (M1&#x02013;M3) with different degrees of complexity.</p><p>Initially, we evaluated the simplest model (M1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>) where &#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>sln</sub> obtained from UNAFold was used to predict the binding free energy. Therefore, the only general parameters of fitting were <italic>m</italic> and {<italic>P</italic>}<sub>o</sub>. The best-fitting <italic>m</italic>-value showed 0.522 kcal/mol free energy increase with every percent of formamide added, while the effective probe concentration was equivalent to 0.0025 nM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>). These parameters can be assumed to have converged to true values, as the average residual squares of 0.0207 units per data point agreed well with the average error squares in the validation set of 533 independent probes (<italic>&#x003b5;<sup>2</sup><sub>val</sub></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.021) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>). The residual squares translated into a significantly larger <italic>s<sup>2</sup></italic> value of 0.024 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>), since this statistic is based on a degree of freedom (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0043862.e005">Equation 5</xref>) that takes into account all individual <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> constants in addition to the two general fitting parameters and is therefore significantly smaller than the total number of formamide data points of 3,630 (i.e., <italic>&#x003bd;</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>n</italic>&#x02013;(500+2)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3128). Thus, the <italic>s<sup>2</sup></italic> value of the simple model was set as the reference point to test against the goodness of fit for the other models, in addition to the coefficient of determination (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>), which was 0.87 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we evaluated a slightly modified model, designated M2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>), which included dangling end effects in free energy calculations. Dangling ends, including terminal mismatches, have been shown to contribute significantly to duplex stability with in-solution hybridizations <xref rid="pone.0043862-Bommarito1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-SantaLucia2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. We therefore employed UNAFold to derive &#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>sln</sub> values with dangling parameters (&#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>sln,with dangling</sub>). The calibrated and validated model showed a higher <italic>s<sup>2</sup></italic> than M1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>), and therefore, we excluded dangling ends from our framework.</p><p>It has been shown that the establishment of specific nearest neighbor free energy rules for microarray hybridizations can improve predictive ability <xref rid="pone.0043862-Hooyberghs1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We therefore developed model M3 for better predictions of perfect matching duplexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>). The &#x00394;G&#x000b0; value (designated &#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>ma</sub>) was calculated for every probe using the free energies of ten DNA/DNA nearest neighbors, which were derived as part of the general fitting parameter set in addition to <italic>m</italic> and {<italic>P</italic>}<sub>o</sub>. To get the total free energy of binding, a constant initiation free energy penalty (&#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>ini</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.96 kcal/mol) was used rather than deriving it for microarrays. This was because &#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>ini</sub> and {<italic>P</italic>}<sub>o</sub> were interdependent by the constant multiplication exp(&#x02212;&#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>ini</sub>/RT){<italic>P</italic>}<sub>o</sub> because of the way free energy is summed and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0043862.e001">Equation 1</xref> is constructed. Between the two variables we selected {<italic>P</italic>}<sub>o</sub> to vary, since there was an in-solution based approximation available for &#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>ini</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0043862-SantaLucia1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The best-fitting parameters point to a constant value of 4.37&#x000b7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> for the term exp(&#x02212;&#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>ini</sub>/RT){<italic>P</italic>}<sub>o</sub>, and &#x00394;G&#x000b0;<sub>ini</sub> and {<italic>P</italic>}<sub>o</sub> values can be arbitrarily changed without affecting model fits as long as this constant is satisfied. The results with M3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>) showed significantly lower average residual squares (<italic>&#x003a3;r<sup>2</sup></italic>/<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0083) than M1, as confirmed with the error squares of the validation set (<italic>&#x003b5;<sup>2</sup><sub>val</sub></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0080). This was also reflected in an increase of the R<sup>2</sup> value from 0.87 to 0.95 and a significant reduction of 0.0144 units in the <italic>s<sup>2</sup></italic> statistic, which was more than twice the experimental variance calculated as 0.0061 based on the standard deviation of all data points (not shown), and therefore, the statistical difference between M1 and M3 was remarkable <xref rid="pone.0043862-Berthouex1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>Example predictions with M3 are shown for 12 perfect match probes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g002">Figure 2</xref> (biased sampling) and 100 more in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043862.s001">Figure S1A</xref> in Supporting Information (random sampling). The upper panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g002">Figure 2</xref> show better fits than the lower ones. To evaluate the global fitting quality, we calculated the distance between theoretical and experimental profiles based on half-denaturation points (|err[FA]<sub>1/2</sub>|), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. The theoretical half-denaturation point, [FA]<sub>1/2,pred</sub>, is defined the same as [FA]<sub>1/2,exp</sub> (see above and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), except that it is calculated for the continuous theoretical curve where the maximum value is always attained at 0% formamide. The resulting distribution of the predictive errors in formamide curve positioning is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. Most predictions were represented by the good fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g002">Figures 2A&#x02013;F</xref>, as can be seen from respective labelings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. In fact, average absolute distance between theoretical and experimental profiles was 2.1&#x000b1;1.7% in formamide concentration, with more than 93 percent of probes having &#x0003c;5% distance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t002">Table 2</xref>).

Importantly, this was not the case with the modeling datasets, since the highest probe signal intensity encountered was less than 40,000.

Accordingly, normalized curves could be matched only at higher formamide concentrations provided that the normalization was adjusted to offset the signal saturation effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g006">Figure 6</xref> represent the general case except for small deviations that can be explained by experiment-to-experiment variability.

In FISH, the optimization is generally carried out experimentally by establishing probe denaturation profiles (similar to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) with pure cultures or clones of target and non-target organisms, an option that is clearly not feasible for high density microarrays given the large number of probes. Therefore, we did not only show the proof of principle for formamide denaturation in microarrays, but also developed mathematical models for predicting the melting profiles of perfect and mismatched probe/target pairs. The predictive accuracy for the position of the melting curves is generally within 5% formamide of the half-denaturation point, remarkably better than what was previously achieved for FISH with a multi-state LFEM <xref rid="pone.0043862-Yilmaz2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. This must be in part due to the absence of a stable secondary structure in the fragmented DNA target of the microarray method studied, in comparison to the full length rRNA target in FISH. However, the derived nearest neighbor free energies in our current two-state model may be reflecting an averaged out partitioning of nearest neighbors between different states, including secondary interactions within or between target fragments. This is consistent with the fact that the scale of nearest neighbor parameters turned out to be lower in microarrays than in solution, while that of mismatch loops were consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Overall, we believe that the predictive power achieved by the two-state LFEM in this study can significantly improve probe design and optimization in microbial ecology applications of oligonucleotide microarrays, as will be discussed below.</p><p>The curve-fitting procedure used in this study was carefully devised to include probes with a large range of melting points.

Hence, an adjustment of the theoretical curve using <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>&#x02260;1 provides a better match of theoretical and experimental profiles. We tested three different approaches to calculate <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> factors. In our preferred approach, <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> factors were included as best-fitting parameters.

In addition to lacking a denaturation term (i.e., m-value and formamide concentration), Langmuir models differ from LFEM with the assumption that the target is in excess of probe. This assumes probes are saturated at a hybridization efficiency of 1, which was clearly not the case in our experiments as the fluorescence intensity at the plateaus of sigmoidal melting profiles (i.e., points of hybridization efficiency &#x0223c; 1) largely varied and was consistently elevated by increased target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g006">Figure 6</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, we encountered signal saturation with the highly concentrated target, but this is likely due to the sensitivity of the scanner as the signal always converged to the upper limit of the measurable signal scale (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043862.s002">Figure S2</xref>). At lower signal values, 10 times more target caused around 10 times higher signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043862.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, the data was more consistent with the depletion of the target rather than the probe, as was assumed in the derivation of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0043862.e001">Equation 1</xref>. When the Langmuir model is rejected, the competition for the limited target molecules may need to be addressed <xref rid="pone.0043862-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. However, this competition effect would be evidenced by a good correlation between predicted hybridization free energy and fluorescence intensity, which also was not the case in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The actual mechanism of surface hybridizations on microarrays is not well understood <xref rid="pone.0043862-Pozhitkov2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Halperin1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Peterson1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. It is beyond the scope of this study to justify the conceptual model behind our mathematical framework, except to show that the simulations with the equilibrium model adequately represented experimental denaturation profiles, thereby fulfilling our main goal.</p><p>Unlike most other models of oligonucleotide microarray hybridization <xref rid="pone.0043862-Held1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, the aim of the LFEM is not to find the concentration of the target molecules, but to predict the hybridization efficiency at a given formamide concentration, which produces the normalized melting profiles regardless of the concentration. Focusing the predictive power on target concentration is problematic for diagnostic applications in several ways. First of all, since most DNA-targeted protocols are end point PCR-dependent, the concentration in question is a biased quantity even if accurately predicted <xref rid="pone.0043862-Acinas1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Secondly, concentration predictors work on the signal intensity variation assuming it is a function of relative target concentration as well as binding free energy. However, if the target is labeled by the common random priming method as in this study, there will be significant differences in signal intensity over different fragments within the same target (e.g., the fluctuations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), which clearly undermines the ability to pick target to target differences. But most important for microbial ecology applications, a strong signal response that leads to the prediction of a concentration may be both from a target or a closely related non-target as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g007">Figure 7</xref> (e.g., at 0% formamide). Thus, detecting the absence/presence of organisms at high stringency (e.g., 20&#x02013;25% formamide, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g007">Figure 7</xref>), rather than measuring their concentration, seems to be a more feasible approach, which requires the calculation of melting curves.</p><fig id="pone-0043862-g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043862.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Formamide denaturation profiles with conventional target and highly abundant non-target.</title><p>The example probe, E751&#x02013;772, is a perfect match to the 16S rRNA gene of <italic>E. coli</italic> and has one mismatch to <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>.

Since the theoretical hybridization efficiency is close to 1 in the plateau of both perfect and mismatched duplexes, the LFEM cannot directly address this issue, although the model is unaffected by it because of the normalization by <italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic>. Arguably, mismatch stability (i.e., &#x00394;&#x00394;G&#x000b0;) can be quantified by the decrease in signal intensity level as another way of developing free energy rules for mismatch discrimination, as was done previously <xref rid="pone.0043862-Hooyberghs1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, the prediction of the change in plateau levels is also not a viable approach for applications in microbial ecology, because the moderate decrease in signal associated with a mismatch can be easily offset by the relative abundance of the non-target organism. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g007">Figure 7</xref> illustrates this phenomenon as well. Once again, a more realistic approach is to force the mismatched duplex to dissociate by applying stringent conditions, so that it counts as absent even when it is highly abundant (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g007">Figure 7</xref>, 20&#x02013;25% formamide).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the only other systematic use of denaturation trends for microarray optimization appears in the non-equilibrium thermal dissociation (NTD) approach <xref rid="pone.0043862-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Urakawa1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

In addition to the use of formamide rather than temperature for denaturation, an important difference that sets apart our methodology from NTD is the adjustment of stringency during the long hybridization period to achieve equilibrium-like conditions, whereas NTD is based on a kinetically-driven dissociation during the wash step <xref rid="pone.0043862-Pozhitkov3" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Thus, we took advantage of equilibrium thermodynamics and developed predictive algorithms to create a feasible alternative to the experimental testing of probes for optimization. Furthermore, we do not recommend the matching of predicted melting profiles to experimental ones, as not only would this require an even higher accuracy of predictions than what we have obtained, but also the possible superimposition of signals from perfectly matching and mismatched targets could undermine the curve-matching approach <xref rid="pone.0043862-Pozhitkov3" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.

To minimize the chance of false positive identification because of cross hybridizations, multiple probes with identical or nested coverage are designed per target group (i.e., operational taxonomic unit; OTU), and nearly all of these are demanded to be bright in order to call a target group as present (e.g. 9 out of 10 probes). This assumes the probes are designed with high enough sensitivity to avoid signal intensities below the threshold when the perfect match target is captured (e.g., if 2 out of 10 probes targeting an existing OTU fail to give bright signal, then it is a false negative identification). Therefore, the obvious target for our predictive denaturation approach is the design of optimal probes and hybridization conditions to obtain the highest possible hybridization efficiency with the targets while keeping the hybridization efficiency with the non-targets at the lowest possible level, thus minimizing the chance of false positive and false negative identification of OTUs.</p><p>For the demonstration of optimization, we did sensitivity and specificity analysis with the 16S rRNA gene of two organisms, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>, such that <italic>E. coli</italic> served as target for perfect-match <italic>E. coli</italic> probes (TileE and Length sets in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t001">Table 1</xref>) and non-target for <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> probes (TileR, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043862-t001">Table 1</xref>), and vice versa. It is important to note that probes that would be filtered due to poor signal intensity during model development (see Methods) were included in these tests to avoid biasing the results. The amount of <italic>E. coli</italic> target was 5 ng and it represented an organism of moderate abundance assuming total DNA used in an environmental application was 50&#x02013;100 ng. This number is consistent with our signal-optimized applications with real mixed communities where 70 ng of total target is used for hybridization without causing frequent signal saturation problems (not shown). The amount of <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> target was 50 ng, and therefore, it represented an unlikely abundance of a single organism in total DNA causing signal saturation with most probes and challenging specificity at the extreme levels. The optimization of probe sensitivity and specificity by predictive modeling follows two steps.</p><p>First, since microarray hybridizations are typically performed at a single level of stringency, it is important to be able to design probes with similar formamide-based stabilities (i.e., similar melting points), to achieve a consistent level of hybridization efficiency with target organisms over thousands of probes. We can do this with the ProbeMelt algorithm by predicting melting points. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, we show the mismatch discrimination potential for probes designed to have a narrow range of predicted melting points, between 18&#x02013;22% formamide. In the <italic>E. coli</italic> set there are 561 such probes that have one or more mismatches to <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>. We tested the mismatch discrimination ability of these probes against this extremely abundant non-target. The results show that, when formamide is not present, the discrimination for 1&#x02013;2 mismatches is not possible at all and about half of the probes with &#x0003e;2 mismatches give a bright signal. The situation changes radically at 20% formamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), which represents the targeted melting point in the design of these probes. However, there is about a 12% chance of poor target capture at this high level of stringency (i.e., the corresponding perfect match column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g008">Figure 8A</xref> shows only 88% above signal threshold) implying that sensitivity is not optimal. As a compromise, hybridization can be done at 15% formamide (i.e., &#x0223c;5% less than the predicted melting points), to decrease the rate of low signal from target to &#x0003c;2% and bring the rate of high signal from non-targets to about 72% for 1&#x02013;2 mismatches and 13% for more mismatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Although mismatch discrimination potential seems low for 1&#x02013;2 mismatches, it should be considered within the context of a multiple-probe strategy, which results in a false positive identification only when several non-target OTUs are captured by different probes. Since it is unlikely to have many such non-targets in the same environmental sample (i.e., total DNA is 50&#x02013;100 ng while the tested non-target was 50 ng), these results show that the predictive formamide denaturation strategy can be useful to avoid false positive identification of even extremely abundant non-targets. The second half of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g008">Figure 8A</xref> shows the experimental simulation with 378 <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> probes tested against 5 ng <italic>E. coli</italic> as the moderately abundant non-target. In this more likely scenario, using 15% formamide is enough to effectively suppress the signal intensity of mismatched probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Thus, 15% formamide can be an optimal point for the sensitivity and specificity of probes designed with a predicted melting point around 20% formamide.</p><fig id="pone-0043862-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043862.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Fraction of probes above an arbitrarily defined threshold of 1750 fluorescence units.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Probes designed to have a melting point of 18&#x02013;22% formamide and hybridized at 0% (red), 15% (green), and 20% (blue) formamide.

Therefore, an important question is whether problematic mismatches can be predicted beforehand. This brings us to the second step in optimization: the prediction of worst non-targets based on hybridization efficiency calculations during the design process. We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g008">Figure 8B</xref> the relationship between predicted hybridization efficiency and percent above threshold for all mismatched duplexes at four formamide concentrations. Consistent with our goals, the predicted efficiency of <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> probes hybridizing with the moderately abundant <italic>E. coli</italic> non-target dictates the frequency of false signal. An important result here is that more than 2 mismatches can also bind effectively, as captured by the thermodynamic model. On the other hand, the extremely abundant non-target <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> causes specificity problems with <italic>E. coli</italic>-targeted probes starting at &#x0223c;0.1 hybridization efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043862-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Nonetheless, probes predicted to have &#x0003c;0.05 hybridization efficiency, which are the majority of the population at all formamide points considered (e.g. 72% of the probes for 15% formamide), are still dim even when they have 1 or 2 mismatches. Thus, by defining probe specificity based on the hybridization efficiency with potential non-targets, probes with the best specificity scores can be selected during probe design with the help of the ProbeMelt algorithm.</p><p>In summary, we recommend the following steps for the systematic optimization of microarray protocols with LFEM: (i) prescribe a single formamide concentration for hybridization (e.g., 15% formamide), (ii) design multiple probes per target group (e.g., 10) to allow predictive errors without compromising identification, (iii) at every target site, adjust probe length to obtain a uniform probe stability throughout the array, such that the theoretical melting points are always slightly higher than the prescribed experimental formamide concentration (e.g., keep the probe melting points in the range of 18&#x02013;22% formamide), (iv) set a specificity score for each probe candidate by calculating the hybridization efficiency with mismatched non-targets and select for probes that have best specificity scores. Steps <italic>iii</italic> and <italic>iv</italic> are applicable for designs with large target datasets since the ProbeMelt algorithm can evaluate more than a million probes per second. Step <italic>iv</italic> is also a significant departure from traditional design approaches based on mismatch numbers or types <xref rid="pone.0043862-Sanguin1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Schonmann1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, since it takes advantage of the thermodynamic parameter sets that were rigorously developed in this study. In addition to helping with the design and optimization phase, we expect our models to be useful for the interpretation of signal patterns from hybridized microarrays. Advanced algorithms for organism detection from complex array data have been developed <xref rid="pone.0043862-Urisman1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, but they either lack predictive tools for the evaluation of probe hybridization with non-targets <xref rid="pone.0043862-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, or use in-solution free energy parameters as a preliminary approach <xref rid="pone.0043862-Urisman1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Therefore, it is not hard to imagine hybridization efficiency predictions improving the accuracy of interpretation algorithms for diagnostic microarrays.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Application to other Platforms</title><p>Because of platform- and protocol-specific variables such as probe density and fragment length, our model should be applied to other types of microarrays with care. Obviously, the modeling parameters are optimized for 4-Plex Nimblegen arrays hybridized at 42&#x000b0;C, and therefore, the ProbeMelt algorithm developed in this study should be directly applied only for these conditions. While we do not expect the free energy rules to differ significantly in other similar platforms (if the temperature and hybridization buffers are not changed), it is anticipated that the effective probe concentration ({P}<sub>o</sub>) may need to be re-optimized when probe concentration or configuration are altered. On the other hand, more significant adjustments may be necessary if the target labeling procedure is different. For instance, if long, unfragmented target nucleic acids are prepared <xref rid="pone.0043862-Shchepinov1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, significant competition with stable secondary structures may change the thermodynamics of binding. Thus, re-optimization may need to be extended to nearest neighbor rules or the <italic>m</italic>-value. In any case, probe sets similar to those used in this study can be included in a custom array design, so that the parameters can be re-optimized if necessary, following our modeling approach. Also, since our modeling framework is derived assuming the probes are not depleted by the local target the validity of this assumption needs to be verified as probe saturation has been clearly shown in some studies with other platforms <xref rid="pone.0043862-Burden1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. If probe depletion appears to be the case, the hybridization efficiency term of this study can be redefined based on the ratio of target-bound probes as in Langmuir models <xref rid="pone.0043862-Held1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043862-Burden1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and the same linear free energy approach can be applied. With the current technology of microarray fabrication allowing the placement of millions of probes on a slide, a set of &#x0223c;15,000 probes allocated for modeling can be a negligible amount. Extension of the specific formamide denaturation LFEM to other platforms could also be informative about the general applicability of the modeling framework, thereby helping with the efforts to understand the mechanisms of hybridization.</p><p>In conclusion, the thermodynamic modeling framework established to simulate formamide denaturation can be effectively used for the design and optimization of probes in microbial ecology analyses. For similar platforms and protocols obeying the assumptions of this work, the LFEM can be directly applied using the online ProbeMelt algorithm. For others, the systematic approach developed can be followed to customize the thermodynamic parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0043862.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
