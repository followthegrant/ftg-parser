Policies with actions targeting the harmful use of alcohol have been developed in Nigeria. This study is an in-depth analysis of alcohol-related policies in Nigeria and the utilization of WHO Best Buy interventions (BBIs) and multi-sectoral action (MSA) in the formulation of these policies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A descriptive case study design and the Walt and Gilson framework of policy analysis was utilized for the research. Components of the study included a scoping review consisting of electronic search of Google and three online databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct and PubMed) to identify articles and policy documents with no language and date restrictions. Government institution provided documents which were not online. Thirteen policy documents, reports or articles relevant to the policy formulation process were identified. Other components of the study included interviews with 44 key informants (<italic>Bureaucrats and Policy Makers</italic>) using a pretested guide.

Other factors which have potential to enhance MSA use were confirmed by some of the participants from the health and non-health sector such as empowerment through regulations and financial back-up, joint conference/workshops and training as reflected in the quotes below:<disp-quote><p id="Par50">&#x0201c;<italic>Government should empower them [Actors/government institution involved in implementing policy actions] with regulations and financial back-up</italic>&#x0201d; (Representative of Professional Body, code 018)</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p id="Par51">&#x02026;&#x02026; <italic>&#x0201c;should be having a joint conference or a summit whereby issues will be discussed to let them see the havoc or implications of the product or whatever they produce there are statistics to show the mortality rate coming out of the consumption of alcohol alright and the implication if they distribute or disseminate this information to people concerned and then they know when they sit themselves they will see the importance of what the government is saying or whatever the policy say about production&#x0201d;</italic> (Academic and medical sector code 025)</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par52">However, the significant challenges associated with MSA use include poor understanding by stakeholders of the roles and contributions of different sectors to NCD prevention as well as the tussle between government ministries on which anchor sector is to assume leadership of the process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Implementation monitoring and evaluation status</title><p id="Par53">Currently the status of alcohol policy implementation is extremely poor for both the FRSC Act and the 2015 National Policy on the Control and Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases. According to 32 out of the 44 respondents, one of the major barriers facing the implementation of strong legislations and regulations was the relevance of alcohol as a social substance. The quote below highlights these points.<disp-quote><p id="Par54">&#x0201c;<italic>Well, alcohol is a social substance and many cultures permit the usage&#x02026;&#x02026;&#x02026;.. so, it becomes a little bit difficult if there is no awareness about what to do and I think it had been the major factor limiting the implementation [of the FRSC act] which has been near zero</italic>&#x0201d; [Representative of the Academic and Medical Sector code 027)</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par55">Aside from the failure of the government to strengthen systems and structures for alcohol control, other challenges identified by 23 of the interviewees include funding limitations and poor literacy, poor deployment of the law enforcement and regulatory agencies and the lack of a legislation to regulate the alcohol industry. The quote below succinctly illustrates this:<disp-quote><p id="Par56">&#x0201c;... <italic>of course, [we have] a few acts of parliament prohibit for example drunken driving. Outside that, I don&#x02019;t know whether that act also prevents excessive alcohol use in public places &#x02026; but I know that of course, we have not even implemented that one in the sense that we don&#x02019;t have kits where we can check the blood levels of alcohol &#x02026;, we don&#x02019;t have them, Then of course for the alcoholic breweries in Nigeria that produce alcohol, I don&#x02019;t see a proactive way to try and enforce\government policies [among them]</italic>. <italic>Some of them [the labeling of alcoholic drinks content] are not laws such as having extra information on their label- For example, alcohol is dangerous to your health and all those things, .... I have really not seen that like the tobacco ones, you know. I am not satisfied really with policies regarding alcohol in Nigeria. It is an area we need to push forward&#x02026;.&#x0201d; [Member of the House of Representative code 011]</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par57">According to the views expressed by the respondents, many Nigerian cultures permit the use of alcohol thus constituting a limitation for the enforcement of the implementation of the FRSC act. Studies have also documented that the Alcohol Industry has leveraged on the influence of this permissive culture for alcohol consumption coupled with custom and traditions which permit its use as a promotion strategy in Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. An example is the advertisement of Seamans Schnapps as a libation drink. Also on a similar note, Orijin, an herbal alcoholic drink was introduced and launched across Nigeria in the palaces of traditional rulers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These findings reveal the significant challenge linked to the permissive cultural inclination for use of alcohol which has been identified as a challenge for the implementation of the 2007 FRSC act and a bane for the formulation of stronger legislation to curtail the unsafe use of alcohol in Nigeria.</p><p id="Par58">As detailed in the 2007 Federal Road Safety Act, subsidy for the implementation of the 2007 Act proceedings is expected to be through the Federal Road Safety Commission and consists of any subsidy or fiscal allocation, Loans from the federal government and monies realized by way of gifts, fines, testamentary disposition or grants-in-aid. However, in reality, funding for these actions has been minimal.</p><p id="Par59">According to interviewees from the health sector, the implementation of the alcohol component of the 2015 National Strategic Plan of Action on Prevention and Control of NCDs is yet to commence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Status of alcohol policy formulation in Nigeria</title><p id="Par60">The World Health Organization has delineated urgent actions to guide countries&#x02019; efforts to reduce harmful alcohol ue, its associated health, and social consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Unfortunately, Nigeria has not made much progress in articulating and implementing policies to decrease harmful alcohol use. According to the WHO Global status reports on health and alcohol, Nigeria has no comprehensive, stand-alone policy document to regulate the production, advertisement, availability and promotion of alcohol in line with WHO recommendations. Furthermore, there are no national and state level monitoring systems to track alcohol consumption and monitor its health and social consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] despite the country&#x02019;s contribution and approval of the declarations at the 2008 World Health Assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>WHO inclusion &#x0201c;best buy&#x0201d; interventions in existing health and non-health sector policies with components for alcohol control</title><p id="Par61">The alcohol component of the Strategic Plan and National Policy of Action on NCDs has been formulated and the only WHO &#x0201c;best buy&#x0201d; interventions addressed is &#x0201c;<italic>restricted access to retailed alcohol specifically the prevention of underage alcohol consumption</italic>&#x0201d;. Other best buy interventions such as prohibitions on alcohol marketing and tax increase were not addressed. Furthermore, the policy remains in limbo as the document, has not been published and disseminated. The actions proposed in the 2007 Federal Road Safety Act (<italic>a non-health &#x02013; sector legal act developed to reduce the occurrence of highway accident</italic>) only address one of the best buy interventions on <italic>limited access to alcohol</italic> but there are no legal actions to control the activities of the Alcohol industry. This is a major gap and underscores the low political priority for the control of harmful alcohol use. There remains an urgent need for Nigeria to develop a comprehensive alcohol policy in line with the 10 proposed targets of WHO 2010 global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol which also includes the WHO best buy intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This has to be addressed through intense advocacy by significant stakeholders including the civil society and academia organizations if the country is to achieve a significant reduction in the social and health burden linked with the harmful use of alcohol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Multi-sectoral action to prevent harmful alcohol use</title><p id="Par62">Th<italic>e Global action plan for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases 2013&#x02013;2020</italic> underscored the importance of a harmonized multi-stakeholder engagement for health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], as a core principle pertinent to the achievement of national and global targets to decrease the burden of non-communicable diseases. Despite of its significance, the level of MSA for the alcohol policy formulation process in the reviewed overarching NCD prevention and control policy document is low as several relevant sectors relevant to the achievement of the health and non-health sector policies were not involved in the formulation procedure. Besides, best buy interventions such as increasing taxes and controlling alcohol marketing are not well reflected in the policies probably as a result of its potential for accelerating implementation results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Barriers to the formulation of alcohol control policy</title><p id="Par63">Of note are the major barriers to the NCD policy development process especially the cultural milieu which permits alcohol use, low political priority for NCDs and poor understanding of MSA. The Nigerian cultural and traditional milieu is favorably inclined and perpetuates alcohol use and within this context, it is difficult for government agencies to formulate, implement and enforce strong alcohol control legislation. The alcohol industry leverages this favorable milieu by advertising alcohol in a cultural context; promoting it as a beverage associated with culture and celebration thus exacerbating the situation and unwittingly undermining the policy formulation and weakening the implementation processes. To address this, there is a need for a cultural re-orientation and strong policies that note the traditional and social relevance of alcohol but deformalize its harmful use.</p><p id="Par64">Furthermore, Nigeria is beleaguered with myriads of health and development challenges and alcohol control does not top the priority of policy imperatives. Unfortunately, the neglect of the alcohol policy has an extensive history; successive Nigerian governments continue to avoid the regulation of harmful alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. To surmount this challenge, there is need to learn lessons from the relatively successful tobacco control effort in Nigeria which was characterized by the high level of multi-sectoral action and activism by civil society organizations, government and professional organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">Other barriers documented were overdependence on financial assistance and grants from donor organizations to fund alcohol policy formulation and implementation activities coupled with the minimal or absent of government budgetary allocation to support the process. A typical initiative which reflects Nigeria is overdependence on donor organizations for funding its alcohol control initiatives is the &#x0201c;drink responsibly&#x0201d; campaign by brewers. This initiative is championed and funded by brewers, multi-national alcohol industries and the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (formerly the International Centre for Alcohol Policy [ICAP]). The initiative promotes moderate alcohol consumption rather than abstinence even among drivers. According to Dumbili et al, 2013, the intervention is a charade that distracts and undermines efforts at proposing stronger legislation for alcohol control in Nigeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">This is a fall-out of the low priority for alcohol control in Nigeria, unless the issue of poor government funding is addressed strongly and consistently, the possibility of the alcohol policy gaining the required thrust is doubtful. This should be an issue on the agenda at global and national meetings on alcohol control. Innovative funding system should be introduced where donor organizations, financial and government institutions jointly donate to a central fund for alcohol control. This will ensure the accessibility and availability of funds for alcohol control implementation and policy development.</p><p id="Par67">The team encountered some limitations during the conduct of this study. Firstly, all the policymakers especially those from donor organizations could not be reached due to the Ebola outbreak which occurred during the collection of the data. However, we were able to find stakeholders from the public and private sector as well as the health and non-health sector which presents an opportunity for a good mix of information collected. Secondly, the minutes of meetings could not be accessed which possibly will have supplied more helpful information on the scope of multi-sectoral action as well as the participation and involvement of actors in the policy processes. In addition, the interviewees had some challenges recalling all the issues which transpired during the policy formulation process. Thirdly, there is a limit to the use of the case-study method as the results obtained is not generalizable to other countries due to Nigeria&#x02019;s distinctive ethnicity and political situation which outlines the framework (Context and content) of the policies. More studies should investigate the use of explanatory policy process theoretical frameworks such as the Multiple Streams or Advocacy Coalition Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] which will ensure an in-depth analysis, evaluation and critique of the policy dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par68">There is presently no stand-alone, comprehensive policy to regulate the harmful use of alcohol. Low multi-sectoral action characterizes the alcohol-related policies formulated by the health and non-health sectors. Overdependence on donor funding and poor government budgetary allocation are major barriers to alcohol control in Nigeria.</p><p id="Par69">Recommendations: The policy actions on alcohol prevention and control in the existing NCD policies should be reviewed and updated by the NCD committee in line with global recommendations proposed by World Health Organization (2010) global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] with emphasis on best buy interventions using MSA.
