To alter gene expression specifically in podocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>, we took advantage of their active endocytotic machinery and developed a method for the targeted delivery of small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNA). We generated an anti-mouse podocyte antibody that binds to rat and mouse podocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>. The polyclonal IgG antibody was cleaved into monovalent fragments, while preserving the antigen recognition sites. One Neutravidin molecule was linked to each monovalent IgG via the available sulfohydryl group. Protamine, a polycationic nuclear protein and universal adaptor for anionic siRNA, was linked to the neutravidin via biotin. The delivery system was named <italic>shamporter</italic> (<bold><italic>s</italic></bold>

Injection of <italic>shamporter</italic> coupled with either nephrin siRNA or TRPC6 siRNA via tail vein into normal rats substantially reduced the protein levels of nephrin or TRPC6 respectively, measured by western blot analysis and immunostaining. The effect was target specific because other podocyte-specific genes remained unchanged. <italic>Shamporter &#x0002b;</italic> nephrin siRNA induced transient proteinuria in rats.

Together with the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and endothelial cells, they comprise the glomerular filtration barrier of the kidney. Podocytes are injured in a variety of acquired and congenital diseases by immune and non-immune mediated mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0009463-Durvasula1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009463-NIDDK1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Although genetic approaches have made enormous contributions to our understanding of podocyte disease, the generation of animals by specific gene engineering are typically limited to mice <xref rid="pone.0009463-Bronson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, although several groups have recently reported on gene manipulation in rats <xref rid="pone.0009463-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The genetic approach however, is time consuming and costly, and cannot be performed in man. Moreover, in contrast to several well defined and characterized experimental podocyte disease models in rats such as the passive Heymann nephritis, puromycin nephrosis, the remnant kidney model and others <xref rid="pone.0009463-Durvasula2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the number of mouse models available to study podocyte diseases are limited in number, and are also substantially less well defined.</p><p>Thus, from an investigational and potentially therapeutic standpoint, the ability to modify genes in established podocyte disease models as well as to have the ability to alter expression in man is desirable.</p><p>In order to address this goal, we employed the use of RNA interference (RNAi) <xref rid="pone.0009463-Fire1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009463-Meister1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. RNAi has advantages in that it can reduce the expression of genes that are either constitutively expressed in cells, or genes that are increased following a stimulus such as injury. The commonly used methods used to transfer RNAi molecules into cells in culture include electroporation, lipid-based transfection reagents or nanoparticles. Unfortunately, when employed <italic>in vivo</italic>, these methodologies are not cell specific, thus limiting their utility <italic>in vivo</italic> for delivering RNAi to target specific organs or specific cell types within that organ. Recent evidence has emerged that podocytes have a robust machinery for endocytosis <xref rid="pone.0009463-Yoshikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which may be statin dependent <xref rid="pone.0009463-Eyre1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. It has also been shown that podocytes utilize an IgG and albumin transport mechanism to remove IgG from the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) <xref rid="pone.0009463-Akilesh1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In this study, we took advantage of podocyte endocytosis to devise a novel method for podocyte specific uptake of siRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, allowing specific modulation of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Construction of the Delivery Antibody</title><p>Central to this technique is an anti mouse podocyte antibody generated in sheep.

As a result, side effects occur due to the delivery of these agents to organs beyond the intended target. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> to deliver therapeutics or experimental drugs can broadly be divided into methods for systemic delivery and organ or tissue specific. Extensive work has been undertaken to deliver genes to the kidney, most recently very successful using podocyte-specific promoter constructs <xref rid="pone.0009463-Isaka1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009463-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009463-Sever1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, hydrodynamic gene delivery via tail vein requires large volumes and high speed injection that is not readily achievable in humans. In this manuscript we present a novel strategy to deliver siRNA to podocytes to modulate specific gene expression by packaging siRNA on an antibody that binds podocyte membranes and is internalized by endocytosis.</p><p>The rationale for the study design was based in part on the recent observation that podocytes have an active endocytic machinery <xref rid="pone.0009463-Yoshikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009463-Eyre1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Podocytes use a receptor mediated uptake mechanism to internalize IgG. Akilesh S <italic>et al</italic>. showed that podocytes express FcRn, an IgG and albumin transport receptor; mice deficient for FcRn accumulated IgG in the GBM as they age <xref rid="pone.0009463-Akilesh1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We therefore reasoned that the binding of antibody to the surface of podocytes would favour internalization of the antibody. Moreover, if the antibody could be used as a delivery system, one could then specifically deliver a drug or other substance such as siRNA to podocytes. The immunogold and immunofluorescent staining, as well as western blot analysis presented in this manuscript showed that the antibody we generated did indeed bind predominantly to podocytes.</p><p>The major findings in this study were <italic>shamporter</italic> efficiently piggybacks siRNA into podocytes both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> as evidence by a decrease in protein levels and immunostaining. The decrease in nephrin levels by siRNA lead to proteinuria and increased foot process width was consistent with other studies, where a mutation (and hence function) in one or more amino acids of nephrin were shown <xref rid="pone.0009463-Patrakka1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009463-Done1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Moreover, administering an antibody specific to nephrin also induces proteinuria <xref rid="pone.0009463-Kawachi1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We were able to confirm the utility of this delivery system by targeting and decreasing levels of a second slit diaphragm protein found in the podocyte, transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6) <xref rid="pone.0009463-Reiser1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Because protamine sulfate is used to induce transient foot process effacement and proteinuria, a particular concern would be that the protamine used as a nucleic acid carrier in the <italic>shamporter</italic> construct might cause changes in the podocyte itself. The mechanism by which protamine induces changes in the podocyte is its cationic charge. However, studies have shown that exposing protamine to negatively charged nucleic acids in fact changes the surface charge of protamine from cationic to anionic <xref rid="pone.0009463-Junghans1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009463-Junghans2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Given the lack of a cationic charge, it is unlikely that the protamine itself is inducing changes itself. Furthermore, we actually looked at foot processes in our studies and showed no changes in the rats that received <italic>shamporter</italic> &#x0002b; control siRNA.</p><p>The use of antibodies to direct siRNA to specific target cells or organs has been shown to be a useful approach in other cells <xref rid="pone.0009463-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The antibody used in these studies targeted podocytes; however the antigen(s) recognized by the IgG are unknown. While of potential interest, defining these antigens is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Moreover, in its current form, the novelty of effectively delivering siRNA to the glomerulus is itself a huge undertaking and the results are not dampened by the antibody specificity. The data presented here is meant to serve as proof-of-concept that an antibody system can be effective and fairly specific at targeting podocytes. Indeed, this study shows that it is technically feasible, and that others in the future can use this methodology with currently available podocyte specific antibodies. Identifying the antigen(s) and improving specificity of delivery are goals of future studies.</p><p>The authors note that parietal epithelial cells (PECs) within the glomerulus have recently been shown to likely serve as progenitors to podocytes and share some common antigens as do the parietal podocyte lining parts of Bowman's basement membrane <xref rid="pone.0009463-Ronconi1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0009463-Bariety1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Indeed, we have a manuscript in press adding to this literature <xref rid="pone.0009463-Ohse1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. These recent studies have dramatically changed previous notions of &#x0201c;podocyte specificity&#x0201d; using current standard techniques. To this end, the authors believe that no antibody is therefore completely podocyte specific as long as PECs and podocyte gene expression overlaps.</p><p>This observation therefore also opens the possibility that PECs serving as progenitors may also be targeted by our delivery system. Thus, care needs to be taken when designing the targets with this system, so as not to interfere with the natural repair system these progenitors may provide in replacing damaged or lost podocytes. Likewise, while we did test for binding of the antibody in several organs as discussed in the manuscript, there is the possibility that the unidentified antigen(s) may be present within other organs and this could lead to off target effects. This is true of many antibody delivery systems.</p><p>While we have only demonstrated a transient knockdown of the targeted genes, we believe that repeated injections of <italic>shamporter</italic> may enable longer-term knockdown and studies are ongoing to test this.</p><p>One might ask why the delivery of the modified antibody does not induce disease. Studies have shown that a monovalent antibody is not complement activating, which is one of the reasons for the lack of host response and disease induction <xref rid="pone.0009463-Wiedermann1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Our results were consistent with this observation. Furthermore, in a recently published collaborative study utilizing this antibody, it was shown DAF-deficient T cells are required for induction of disease with the intact version of this antibody <xref rid="pone.0009463-Bao1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>While gene knock-down in animals are typically performed at the genomic level by introducing mutations. These mutations lead to either a permanent or conditional mutant phenotype. In the conditional variant, the phenotype will occur only in a temporary or spatial manner, for example only during certain stages of development or only in the kidney <xref rid="pone.0009463-Gawlik1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0009463-Grippo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. While these gene knock-downs are valuable and helpful in our understanding of the function of specific genes, there are problems associated with these models. Mutations in essential genes can result in lethality or a renal phenotype that is non-functioning. Additionally, while inducible systems are being developed <xref rid="pone.0009463-ONeal1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, traditionally mutations can not be switched on and off and therefore the influence of specific genes on the progression of ongoing disease can only be studied within limits. Likewise there is substantial cost in developing these models. A study by the NIH found that generating a transgenic mouse typically takes about one year and costs between one and two hundred thousand dollars <xref rid="pone.0009463-Rusk1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that use of a modified antibody to deliver siRNA to podocytes is an effective methodology <italic>in vivo</italic>, without systemic effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Immortalized Mouse Podocyte Culture</title><p>Immortalized mouse podocytes in culture were utilized as both the antigen to produce an antibody and to test the utility of our siRNA delivery system <italic>in vitro</italic>.
