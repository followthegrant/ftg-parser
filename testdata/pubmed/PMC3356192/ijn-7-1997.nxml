PVA-ALA nanofibers were properly coated onto the stents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-7-1997">Figure 1B</xref>). The diameter of the coated fibrous matter varied, but was always less than 1000 nm. To test its biological activity and phototoxicity, ALA-PVA nanofiber was suspended in PBS.</p></sec><sec><title>Dark toxicity</title><p>Before investigating the effect of ALA-PVA nanofiber with PDT, we studied the intrinsic toxicities of ALA and ALA-PVA, using HuCC-T1 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-7-1997">Figure 2</xref>, various concentrations of ALA and ALA-PVA (drug/polymer ratio: 1/9) were used to treat HuCC-T1 cells for 24 hours, in the absence of irradiation. ALA itself was only marginally toxic; survival exceeded 70%, even at ALA concentrations less than 100 &#x003bc;g/mL; ALA-PVA was even less cytotoxic. Interestingly, PVA appeared to reduce the intrinsic toxicity of ALA. 90% survival of tumor cells was noted in ALA concentrations that exceeded 200 &#x003bc;g/mL. These results indicate that PVA, and PVA nanofibers, did not appreciably affect the viability of HuCC-T1 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>PpIX generation in HuCC-T1 cells and phototoxicity</title><p>PpIX generation in HuCC-T1 CC cells treated with ALA or ALA-PVA nanofiber is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-7-1997">Figure 3</xref>. The extent of PpIX generation was not significantly different between ALA-only and ALA-PVA nanofiber treatment. PVA itself did not generate PpIX in tumor cells. Interestingly, at ALA concentrations greater than 50 &#x003bc;g/mL, PpIX generation, under treatment with ALA-PVA nanofiber, was slightly greater than for ALA only. PpIX generation in HuCC-T1 cells was confimed by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-7-1997">Figure 4</xref>), which indicated that ALA-PVA nanofiber produced PpIX in tumor cells as avidly as did ALA alone. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-7-1997">Figure 5</xref> summarizes data concerning the phototoxicity of ALA and ALA-PVA nanofiber towards HuCC-T1 cells. Tumor cells were irradiated 24 hours after treatment with ALA or ALA-PVA nanofiber. The decrease in cell viability caused by ALA-PVA nanofiber treatment was very similar to that caused by ALA alone, whereas PVA alone did not induce death in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-7-1997">Figure 5</xref>). Tumor cell viability decreased dose-dependently until ALA concentration reached 100 &#x003bc;g/mL, and remained constant with increased concentration. These results indicate that PpIX was generated in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with ALA or ALA-PVA nanofiber, which induced PDT-mediated cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>Apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells</title><p>To investigate the mechanism of tumor cell death, HuCC-T1 cells, treated with ALA or ALA-PVA nanofiber, were stained with FITC annexin V, to detect apoptotic cells, and with PI, to detect necrotic cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-7-1997">Figure 6</xref>, the number of necrotic and apoptotic cells gradually increased until an ALA concentration of 25 &#x003bc;g/mL was reached. At 100 &#x003bc;g/mL ALA, the number of necrotic cells significantly increased, while that of apoptotic cells slightly decreased, indicating that these results are a reflection of cell death. Necrosis of tumor cells was dominant at ALA concentrations exceeding 100 &#x003bc;g/mL.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>CC is an incurable adenocarcinoma, arising from cholangiocytes.

PVA nanofiber itself did not affect the viability of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-7-1997">Figure 2</xref>). Since PpIX generation was slightly increased at high ALA concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-7-1997">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-7-1997">4</xref>), ALA-PVA nanofiber coating of metal stents is a promising method for delivery of ALA to tumor cells. We previously reported that nonionic surfactants, such as Pluronic<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> F68 or Tween<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 80 (Sigma-Aldrich), effectively enhance ALA uptake by tumor cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijn-7-1997">33</xref> We suggest that PVA nanofibers are also effective vehicles for delivery of ALA.</p><p>The present study combined PDT with stent placement, for palliative therapy for CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-7-1997">Figure 7</xref>). Cheon et al reported that PDT with stenting resulted in longer survival than stenting alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijn-7-1997">34</xref> They observed longer survivability in patients after PDT treatment and subsequent placement of a metal stent. Local administration of a photosensitizer, combined with a metal stent, can be considered a more feasible treatment option than that of systemic administration, in the case of bile duct cancer, because local treatment provides better accumulation and more favorable biodistribution of photosensitizer in tumor tissue, leading to selective tumor cell death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijn-7-1997">35</xref> We prepared ALA-PVA nanofiber to coat metal stents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-7-1997">Figure 1</xref>). As far as we know, this is the first use of this suggestion for palliative therapy for unresectable CC; it was suggested that PDT and stent placement offer hope for such treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijn-7-1997">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijn-7-1997">26</xref> As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-7-1997">Figure 7</xref>, combined treatment, with PDT and ALA-PVA nanofiber-coated metal stent, involved only two steps. In the first step, the nanofiber-coated stent is placed in the bile duct compromised by CC. At this stage, PpIX is generated after uptake of ALA by tumor cells. In the second step, irradiation is perfomed. PDT inhibits the growth or spread of the tumor. For this purpose, we selected ALA as a photosensitizing agent, because ALA is less cytotoxic towards normal cells in the absence of irradiation, compared with other photosensiting agents. Furthermore, PpIX accumulation in ALA-treated tumor cells is greater than in normal cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijn-7-1997">7</xref> In general, the method for PDT treatment is a two-step process, involving (1) accumulation of the photosensitizing agent in tumor cells, and (2) subsequent lethal activation of the agent by irradiation at a specific wavelength.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijn-7-1997">7</xref> Irradiation induces an injurious photochemical reaction, in which the activated agent transfers energy to molecular oxygen, generating reactive oxygen species,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijn-7-1997">7</xref> which oxidize lipids, amino acids, and proteins, inducing necrosis and apoptosis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-7-1997">Figure 5</xref>, ALA-PVA nanofiber maintained a PDT effect similar to that of ALA alone. In the absence of irradiation, reduced cytotoxicity was observed with ALA-PVA nanofiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-7-1997">Figure 2</xref>). PpIX generation increased with greater ALA concentration. PVA itself did not influence the interconversion between ALA and PpIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-7-1997">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-7-1997">4</xref>). Even though the extent of apoptosis and necrosis changed slightly, ALA-PVA nanofiber treatment showed a similar cell death mechanism to ALA alone, in the apoptosis and necrosis analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-7-1997">Figure 6</xref>). Necrosis predominated at ALA concentrations greater than 100 &#x003bc;g/mL. Apoptosis resulting from treatment with ALA-PVA nanofiber was slightly greater than that resulting from ALA alone. These results indicate that that ALA-PVA nanofiber has anti-tumor activity, and can generate a PDT effect on HuCC-T1 CC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>ALA-PVA nanofiber was coated onto metal stents for combined PDT and stent placement for palliative therapy of unresectable CC.
