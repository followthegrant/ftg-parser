In contrast, we identified copy number abnormalities present in only some regions in addition to homogeneously present changes, suggesting ongoing genetic evolution following metastatic spread. Copy number heterogeneity from a tumor was represented in matched cell line clones, which also varied in their clonogenicity and drug sensitivity. Minor clones were identified based on dissimilarity to the parental cell line, and these clones were the most clonogenic and least sensitive to drugs. Finally, treatment of a polyclonal cell line with paclitaxel to enrich for drug-resistant cells resulted in the adoption of a gene expression profile with features of one of the minor clones, supporting the idea that these populations can mediate disease relapse.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results support the hypothesis that minor clones might have major consequences for patient outcomes in melanoma.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Melanoma</kwd><kwd>Microarray</kwd><kwd>Heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>Mutation profiling</kwd><kwd>Copy number</kwd><kwd>Clonal</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cancer is caused by successive genetic change that disrupts regulatory processes and endows cells with survival and growth advantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Ongoing mutation provides a substrate on which selection operates, with aberrations yielding increased fitness leading to an increasing proportion of affected cells and their progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Clonal genetic diversity of cancer cells has been correlated with poor prognosis for cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In pancreatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and renal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], exome sequencing of different regions of primary and metastatic tumors has identified heterogeneity in sequence mutations. These findings are of particular interest given the current focus in oncology on using drugs that target specific mutant proteins and downstream signaling nodes.</p><p>Melanomas can contain tens of thousands of mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. While metastases can be genetically divergent from primary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], heterogeneous <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status has also been demonstrated between individual circulating melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In primary and metastatic lesions, Takata et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] demonstrated different clonal heterogeneity using microsatellite markers mapping to chromosomes 6q, 9p, 10q and 18q to assess LOH. Recently, a heterogeneously present <italic>NRAS</italic> mutation was reported in a progressing lesion following treatment with vemurafenib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, there has been no genome wide characterization of genetic heterogeneity within metastatic melanoma lesions to date. Likewise it is unknown whether cell lines retain genetic heterogeneity representative of the original tumor.</p><p>In this study we assessed genetic heterogeneity in metastatic melanomas and derived cell lines at the level of copy number abnormalities and sequence mutations in a cancer-focused panel of genes. We found significant copy number heterogeneity in tumors and cell lines, and went on to demonstrate that much of the functional heterogeneity we observed could be attributed to relatively minor clones.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Regional DNA copy number heterogeneity in metastatic melanoma</title><p>Eight regions of lymph node metastasis Tumor 1 were assessed for the presence of chromosomal amplifications and deletions. DNA extracted from cores taken from three separate FFPE tissue blocks was analyzed using the Affymetrix Oncoscan 2.0 platform. H&#x00026;E staining was used to identify regions composed primarily of tumor cells prior to coring, with sections taken from immediately below analyzed fragments to control for contaminating normal tissue (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Figure S1). Hierarchical clustering of DNA copy number profiles separated the samples into two groups, with visual inspection of the heatmap showing that cores taken from the same tissue block often demonstrated very different patterns of amplifications and deletions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Statistically significant regions of amplification and deletion were next defined using a segmentation algorithm, and the occurrence of specific aberrations compared across the tumor regions. The sampled tumor regions harbored between 44 and 133 significant regions of copy number changes (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A), encompassing between 23 and 59 percent of the genome (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). The greatest proportion of changes was present in all regions; however, many aberrations were present in only one or two cores (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). Heterogeneity was observed in genomic regions containing genes with demonstrated potential to impact melanoma biology, such as the high level amplification (greater than 5 copies) of chromosome band 1q21 observed in Core 2 from Block 1&#x02013;2. This region encompasses the gene for histone methyltransferase SETDB1, recently identified as an oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and a candidate susceptibility gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] in melanoma.

Despite the presence of mutation-specific probes with highly heterogeneous intensity, no heterogeneous mutations could be validated by capillary sequencing. Similar results were obtained following Ion Torrent sequencing of amplicons covering a similar panel of cancer genes, which was performed in regions from two additional melanomas (Tumors 2 and 3).

All cell line-derived samples clearly shared many common copy number changes with the original tumor, such as gain of 6p (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). The clones harbored between 55 and 69 copy number changes, which represents significantly less variation than was observed in the different regions of Tumor 1 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Nevertheless, the cell clones were also heterogeneous for many of the detected aberrations (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C), and the LM-MEL-62 clones displayed heterogeneity at chromosome regions similarly affected in the archival FFPE tumor material (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A and B).

Clones with copy number profiles that did not cluster with the parental line (presumably less prevalent in the pooled population) were those that demonstrated the strongest behaviors. For example, Clone 3 was the most clonogenic, and Clones 1 and 10 were the least sensitive to cytotoxic drugs. Clone 2 was not assessed for drug sensitivity, and Clone 10 was not assessed in soft-agar assays, as they ceased proliferating before the assays could be performed.

This demonstrates that a phenotype that was present in only a minority of cells has the potential to play an important role in survival and re-growth during and after drug treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Excision of localized primary melanomas provides a curative treatment for most patients; however, survival for patients with disseminated disease treated with systematic therapies remains poor. Clonal diversity has been associated with poor prognosis and treatment resistance in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and we therefore examined genetic diversity in melanoma metastases.</p><p>We found that presumed disease drivers, such as MAPK activating mutations, were homogeneously present in metastatic lesions. In contrast we identified significant heterogeneity in chromosomal aberrations in different regions of a lymph node metastasis, and in clones from several cell lines, suggesting that genetic evolution continues in metastases. The clones from LM-MEL-62 contained chromosomal heterogeneity at regions similar to those in the original tumor, and were additionally heterogeneous in their gene expression profile and cellular behaviors.</p><p>This intratumoral heterogeneity becomes significant if it provides populations of cells capable of surviving and proliferating following changes in selective pressures, such as during drug treatments. As a model of this possibility, we selected for a population of cells resistant to paclitaxel, and observed the outgrowth of cells with an interferon-inducible gene expression signature originally found in only a minor population of paclitaxel-insensitive cells in the parental cell line. A recent study in which clonal populations of colorectal cancer cells were tracked in xenografts likewise found that clones that were initially rare went on to become the dominant cell population following treatment with chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Likewise our results complement a recent report stating that based on the number of cells in established tumors and a conservative mutation rate, clones containing mutations conferring drug resistance will inevitably be present pre-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In our study other minor clones expressed genes related to the PI3K and MET pathways, which have been associated with resistance to vemurafenib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The presence of minor clones with higher baseline activity of these pathways could contribute to targeted therapy resistance, much as we observed with paclitaxel treatment.</p><p>Finally it is important to note that despite using two independent technologies to profile somatic mutations, both of which were designed for use with DNA from formalin fixed tissues, we encountered many false positives. Although this issue might be avoided by using frozen tissue, formalin fixation will remain a favored way to preserve samples due to ease of storage and other advantages. We therefore urge caution when using these samples with platforms like the Ion Ampliseq panels, as fixation-related artifacts may will likely lead to false positive variants calls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Metastatic melanomas feature significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, with the potential to confound the success of many therapies. Genetic heterogeneity represents an obstacle for mutation-directed personalized cancer medicine, albeit one which might be compensated for by analyzing multiple biopsies at sufficient depth to identify rare variants. However, drug resistance can have its basis in genetic, epigenetic, and stochastic variation, and the transcriptomic and functional variation we identified in this study suggests that these mechanisms are relevant in metastatic melanoma. As accounting for these additional levels of regulation in multiple biopsies would be exceedingly challenging, targeting multiple tumor clones might best be accomplished using immunotherapy approaches such as tumor-lysate stimulated adoptive cell transfer or immune regulatory check point blockade agents such as ipilimumab. These therapies have intrinsic potential to induce responses against a broad range of antigens specific to a patient&#x02019;s tumor, which would circumvent the type of sampling error caused by intratumor heterogeneity that must be confronted in attempting to choose appropriate drugs based on the analysis of biopsies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tumor material and cell lines</title><p>Melanoma lymph node metastases and derived early passage cells lines from three patients were analyzed for regional and clonal differences in this study.
