At diagnosis, ~70% of new BC cases are superficial non-muscle-invasive tumours. Moreover, up to 50&#x02013;70% of those cases will recur, and 10&#x02013;20% of recurrent tumours will progress into deep tissue layers. The extent of tumour invasion is closely correlated with the clinical treatment of BC, and muscle-invasive BC can progress to life-threatening metastasis and result in BC-related mortality [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, elucidating the pathological mechanisms underlying BC invasion and metastasis may facilitate the prevention of the development of BC and improve its prognosis.</p><p id="p0030">Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays key roles in cancer cells with respect to promoting migration, invasion, and subsequent dissemination [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple factors, including EMT transcription factors (EMT-TFs), may regulate the EMT process. EMT-TFs, which are activated and therefore promote the EMT programme, are necessary for the metastatic cascade in cancer [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Snail1, one of the principal EMT-TFs, has been demonstrated to induce EMT in various epithelial cancer cell lines and primary mammary tumour cells [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>]. Notably, Snail1 is a highly unstable protein with a short half-life (t1/2) of ~25&#x0202f;min. Snail1 mRNA bears multiple AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (3&#x02032; UTR) that are responsible for the stability of Snail1 mRNA [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNP-F) is an RNA-binding protein belonging to the hnRNP family that has been implicated in multiple steps of RNA metabolism and gene expression regulation, such as alternative splicing, mRNA stabilization, transcriptional regulation and posttranscriptional modification [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. HnRNP-F was found to be a cofactor in a subset of tristetraprolin proteins, which regulate the stabilities of mRNAs containing AREs [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Increased hnRNP-F levels have been observed in a number of cancers [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], suggesting its role in tumourigenesis. However, the potential oncogenic role and mechanism of hnRNP-F in BC remain poorly understood.</p><p id="p0040">In this study, hnRNP-F was first determined to exhibit enhanced expression in BC patients compared with controls using the proteomic technique of two-dimensional fluorescent differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Then, we examined the effects of aberrant hnRNP-F expression on the cellular biological behaviour of BC cells. Through our investigation of the contribution of hnRNP-F overexpression to EMT by regulating Snail1 expression, we present evidence of a role for hnRNP-F in regulating Snail1 mRNA stability in BC by binding to its 3&#x02032; UTR. Our findings suggest important new roles for hnRNP-F in BC pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target for BC.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0030"><label>2.1</label><title>Specimen collection and preparation</title><p id="p0045">For the proteomic analysis, a total of eight BC specimens and their adjacent normal tissues were obtained at Nanfang Hospital (Guangzhou, China) between January and April 2015.

Moreover, of the three 3&#x02032; UTR truncation fragments of Snail1 mRNA, only Snail1 &#x00394;2 and Snail1 &#x00394;3, which contained AREs, bound to the hnRNP-F antibody. Furthermore, the enrichment in Snail1 &#x00394;3 was approximately 4.65 times that in Snail1 &#x00394;2. By contrast, no apparent enrichment was observed for the Twist1 3&#x02032; UTR or Snail1 &#x00394;1.</p><p id="p0195">To further determine whether hnRNP-F could bind to the AREs in the 3&#x02032; UTR of Snail1 mRNA, we mutated AREs in the Snail1 &#x00394;2 and Snail1 &#x00394;3 truncations. The results demonstrated that the binding strength between hnRNP-F and Snail1 &#x00394;3 was reduced to ~58% and 47% (for Snail1 &#x00394;3-M1 and Snail1 &#x00394;3-M2, respectively). In addition, the binding between hnRNP-F and Snail1 &#x00394;2 and Snail1 &#x00394;3 almost disappeared (in Snail1 &#x00394;2-M and Snail1 &#x00394;3-M3) (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>e).</p><p id="p0200">To further verify above results, luciferase reporter gene assays were applied in our study. As shown in <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>f, the luciferase reporter analysis demonstrated that Snail1-WT but not Snail1-M-all had a significant effect on luciferase reporter activity compared to the hnRNP-F NC group, while Snail1-M1, Snail1-M2 and Snail1-M3 were downregulated relative to Snail1-WT in hnRNP-F overexpression group. This result indicates that the interaction between hnRNP-F and the Snail1 3&#x02032; UTR is impaired after mutating one ARE and is completely inhibited in the Snail1-M-all group. Briefly, the above results may indicate there is a dose-dependent relationship between AREs and hnRNP-F.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0150"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0205">There is growing interest in identifying pathological mechanisms to aid medical professionals in improving the prognosis of BC patients. In the past few years, proteomic approaches have emerged as a strategy for discovering diagnostic and prognostic protein biomarkers as well as novel therapeutic targets [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, we examined protein expression profiles in tissue samples from BC patients and controls by 2D-DIGE and MS. Fifteen differentially expressed proteins in BC patients were identified. Of these identified proteins, hnRNP-F, which belongs to the hnRNP family and is responsible for diverse cellular processes, such as modulating splicing, miRNA maturation, mRNA transport and mRNA stabilization, was upregulated in the BC group [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p id="p0210">A growing body of evidence has shown that the expression levels of hnRNPs are altered in many types of cancer and play important roles in tumourigenesis [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. HnRNP A2/B1 is involved in MDA-MB-231 cells, wherein the knockdown of its expression inhibits cell invasion and thereby the proliferation of tumour cells [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similarly, hnRNP C may act as a key regulator that controls the metastatic potential of breast cancer [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. HnRNP-H was reported to be associated with poor differentiation in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and colorectal cancer node metastasis [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It was also reported to be an oncogene that promotes prostate cancer cell growth [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. HnRNP-F was demonstrated to have an oncogenic role in breast cancer [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], colorectal cancer [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and cervical cancer [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but its expression in liver cancer is significantly decreased [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of hnRNP-F in the development of BC remain unclear. Therefore, of those differentially expressed proteins in BC identified by the proteomic method, the hnRNP-F protein was chosen for further study.</p><p id="p0215">In our study, we first found that hnRNP-F was significantly upregulated in BC tissues via 2D-DIGE. Western blot and RT-qPCR analyses further confirmed our results. Furthermore, the findings of our IHC analysis, which was based on a cohort of 103 BC patients, demonstrated that high expression levels of hnRNP-F were significantly associated with an advanced clinical stage. The multivariate analysis showed that elevated hnRNP-F expression was associated with poor overall survival in BC patients, indicating that hnRNP-F expression may be a potential prognostic biomarker for BC patients. Moreover, we applied in vitro and in vivo methods to reveal the functions of hnRNP-F in BC tumourigenesis, which showed that hnRNP-F was necessary for tumour growth and metastasis in BC. Briefly, these data suggest that hnRNP-F plays a vital role in carcinogenesis, particularly in BC.</p><p id="p0220">Tissue invasion and metastasis are major problems in treating BC. EMT is a vital process that causes stationary epithelial cells to gain the ability to migrate and invade as single cells, which has a critical role in various human diseases, especially cancer [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. EMT also plays important roles in BC, enhancing cancer cells with invasive and metastatic properties that are closely related to the development and prognosis of BC [<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our results showed that hnRNP-F had the ability to downregulate epithelial marker expression, upregulate mesenchymal marker expression, promote cell invasion and induce EMT in human BC cells. The downstream targets of hnRNP-F are not fully known, and this issue was the main focus of our present investigation. In our investigation of the potential downstream regulator of hnRNP-F, Snail1, but not Twist1, expression was decreased at the mRNA and protein levels when hnRNP-F was silenced by a siRNA. In contrast, hnRNP-F overexpression led to an increase in both the RNA and protein levels of Snail1, suggesting that Snail1 is likely a target of hnRNP-F that mediates its effects on enhancing invasion, metastasis and EMT in BC.</p><p id="p0225">Furthermore, the effect of hnRNP-F on inducing EMT was blocked when Snail1 was silenced. In this context, the regulation of Snail1 by hnRNP-F is a novel mechanism identified in this report by which hnRNP-F may induce EMT in BC. Snail1 binds to the E-box sequences in the promoter of E-cadherin to repress transcription and trigger EMT, which could elicit associated pathological characteristics such as invasion, metastasis and stemness in cancer cells [<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Roth et al [<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] reported that silencing Snail1 completely blocked circulating tumour cell production and regional/distant metastasis in a BC xenograft model. The stability and activity of Snail1 protein expression are mainly regulated by various posttranslational modification factors. The regulation of mRNA stability is a vital element of gene expression, especially for a gene with an unstable mRNA, such as Snail1, with its short t1/2 of ~25&#x0202f;min. As previously reported, the AREs in the 3&#x02032; UTR are responsible for the stability of Snail1 mRNA [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p id="p0230">Many previous studies have implicated hnRNPs in the regulation of mRNA stability. It has also been demonstrated that hnRNP-F can interact with the tristetraprolin family of zinc finger proteins, leading to the stability of ARE-mRNAs, including cytokines, transcription factors and protooncogenes. Notably, the interaction of hnRNP-F with tristetraprolin proteins is not dependent on the extent of hnRNP-F binding to the mRNA but is mediated by a nuclear interaction [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Surprisingly, our RNA chip analysis revealed that hnRNP-F was able to bind to Snail1 mRNA. Interestingly, our findings also showed that the decay of Snail1 mRNA was significantly slower after treatment with actinomycin D in the hnRNP-F overexpression group than in the control group. This finding indicated that the stability of Snail1 mRNA was enhanced in the hnRNP-F overexpression group. Therefore, we speculate that hnRNP-F binds to the 3&#x02032; UTR of Snail1 mRNA, resulting in distinct consequences for mRNA stability and gene/protein expression. In support of this result, our experiments further revealed that hnRNP-F could directly bind to the 3&#x02032; UTR of Snail1 mRNA in the regions containing the AREs of Snail1 &#x00394;2 and Snail1 &#x00394;3, which stabilized Snail1 and promoted invasion, metastasis and EMT in BC. Undoubtedly, the 3&#x02032; UTR truncations into pcDNA.3 could reflect the specific binding relationship between AREs and hnRNP-F. Whereas the reporter transcripts with the mutated UTR could reflect binding relationship from the original and the whole angle compared with 3&#x02032; UTR truncations into pcDNA.3, which investigated a positive relationship between binding and AREs and would reinforce the conclusions of this part.</p><p id="p0235">Taken together, the results of our study show that hnRNP-F, identified by proteomic methods, is significantly upregulated in BC tissues. Its increased expression is a potentially powerful predictor of a poor prognosis for BC patients. HnRNP-F is critical for promoting BC cell invasion and metastasis and mediates the stabilization of Snail1 mRNA by binding to its 3&#x02032; UTR, subsequently regulating EMT. These findings may allow us to conclude that Snail1 is a mediator of hnRNP-F affecting EMT, which could lead to the development of a new approach for BC therapy in the future.</p><p id="p0240">The following are the supplementary data related to this article.<fig id="f0040"><label>Fig. S1</label><caption><p>a&#x02013;b.
