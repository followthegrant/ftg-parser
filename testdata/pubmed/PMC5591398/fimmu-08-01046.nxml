Furthermore, C3a contributes to liver regeneration but its role in intestinal stem cell function has not been studied. We hypothesized that C3a is important for intestinal repair and regeneration. Intestinal organoid formation, a measure of stem cell capacity, was significantly limited in C3-deficient and C3a receptor (C3aR) 1-deficient mice while C3a promoted the growth of organoids from normal mice by supporting Wnt-signaling but not from C3aR1-deficient mice. Similarly, the presence of C3a in media enhanced the expression of the intestinal stem cell marker leucine-rich repeat G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) and of the cell proliferation marker Ki67 in organoids formed from C3-deficient but not from C3aR1-deficient mice. Using <italic>Lgr5.egfp</italic> mice we showed significant expression of C3 in Lgr5<sup>+</sup> intestinal stem cells whereas C3aR1 was expressed on the surface of various intestinal cells. C3 and C3aR1 expression was induced in intestinal crypts in response to ischemia/reperfusion injury. Finally, C3aR1-deficient mice displayed ischemia/reperfusion injury comparable to control mice. These data suggest that C3a through interaction with C3aR1 enhances stem cell expansion and organoid formation and as such may have a role in intestinal regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>complement 3</kwd><kwd>intestinal organoid</kwd><kwd>intestinal stem cell</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>ischemia/reperfusion</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">Medical Research and Materiel Command<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000182</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">W81XWH-09-10530, W81XWH-09-10536</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="26"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="5812"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intestinal stem cells, also known as crypt base columnar cells, have been recognized as responsible for intestinal regeneration a vital process for the homeostatic self-renewal and the response to catastrophic exogenous insults, including irradiation, exposure to food toxins and ischemia/reperfusion (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The leucine-rich repeat G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) has been identified as a marker of intestinal stem cells through mouse engineering and cell lineage tracing studies (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Lgr5 is a target of the Wnt signaling pathway and Wnt agonists, like R-spondin 1, expand Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells and accelerate intestinal recovery after irradiation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). IL-22 supports intestinal regeneration by enhancing the phosphorylation of STAT3 (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), whereas it has been proposed that additional inflammatory signals may be involved in intestinal regeneration.</p><p>It has been shown that C3a and C5a are critical in liver tissue regeneration after exposure to carbon tetrachloride or partial hepatectomy by promoting hepatocyte proliferation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and in retina tissue regeneration (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).

Here, after we noticed that intestinal organoid formation is limited when crypt cells from C3- and C3aR1-deficient mice were used, we found that C3a is important in promoting intestinal stem cell growth and organoid formation only in mice which express C3aR1. Our data support the concept that C3a is involved in intestinal regeneration by a C3aR1-mediated mechanism and through the expansion of intestinal stem cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6J (B6) mice, C3-deficient mice (B6.129S4-<italic>C3<sup>tm1Crr</sup></italic>/J), C3aR1-deficient mice (C.129S4-<italic>C3ar1<sup>tm1Cge</sup></italic>/J), BALB/cJ mice (BALB/c), and <italic>Lgr5.egfp.IRES-CreERT2</italic> knock-in mice (B6.129P2-<italic>Lgr5<sup><italic>tm1(cre/ERT2)Cle</italic></sup></italic>/J) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory.

After flushing out the feces with ice-cold PBS, the small intestine was opened longitudinally and washed with PBS. The villi were scraped off with a cover slip, and the intestine was divided into pieces. After repeated PBS washings, the intestinal pieces were incubated in 2&#x02009;mM EDTA-PBS solution and gently rocked at 4&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;min. Subsequently, the EDTA solution was removed and the tissue fragments were vigorously suspended in PBS and filtered through a 70&#x02009;&#x000b5;m cell strainer.

To assess the involvement of C3a in intestinal regeneration, a &#x0201c;mini-gut&#x0201d; intestinal organoid assay was developed. The total number of organoids with multiple buds in each culture well was evaluated 7&#x02009;days after the initiation of the culture using intestinal crypt cells from wild-type or C3-deficient mice. The number of organoids in cultures originated from C3-deficient mice was significantly lower compared to the number of organoids generated from the wild-type (B6) mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A), suggesting a role for C3 in the robust formation of intestinal organoids. Because intestinal cells produce C3 which may be cleaved by endogenous cathepsins B and L to produce C3a (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) we asked whether C3a can enhance organoid formation. We noted that C3a added to the culture medium significantly enhanced organoid formation in cultures of crypt cells from wild-type mice in a dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). We observed a similarly statistically significant enhancing effect in organoid formation when we added C3a in cultures of crypt cells from C3-deficient mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A), indicating that extracellular C3a affects the growth of intestinal stem cells.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>C3a promotes organoid formation.

To demonstrate that the enhancing effect of C3a is canonical through the C3aR1, we set up organoid cultures using crypt cells from C3aR1-deficinet mice and their genetic background control BALB/c mice. Organoid formation from cells of C3aR1 KO mice was reduced when compared with that of BALB/c mice. Addition of C3a in culture media increased the organoid formation in BALB/c mice; however, we did not observe any changes in organoid formation in C3aR1 KO mice after the addition of C3a (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C).</p><p>Wnt signaling is one of the crucial pathways to maintain intestinal stem cell growth. The presence of the R-spondin 1, which stabilizes the Frizzled receptor for Wnt binding, in the organoid culture media is necessary for the generation of intestinal organoids (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). When the concentration of R-spondin 1 was limited to one-half of the standard concentration present in the organoid culture medium (0.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL), the number of organoids was significantly decreased compared to that observed in the medium containing R-spondin 1 at the standard concentration of 1&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL. Interestingly, the presence of C3a in the culture medium which contained one-half of the standard concentration of R-spondin 1 rescued the formation of organoids to normal levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). The presence of extrinsic C3a increased significantly organoid formation even when the concentration of R-spondin 1 was lowered in the culture medium to 0.2&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). When R-spondin 1 was completely excluded from the culture medium, the presence of C3a did not enable organoid formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). These findings suggest that C3a supports the function of R-spondin 1. Next, we blocked Wnt signaling with IWP-2, a Wnt inhibitor. The presence of IWP-2 in the culture medium decreased the number of organoids formed in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of C3a enhanced organoid formation only when IWP-2 was added at a low concentration (0.05&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) and the beneficial effect was readily abolished in the presence of IWP-2 at a higher concentration (0.1&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E). The Wnt signaling inhibition experiments provide further evidence that C3a supports Wnt signaling in the growth of intestinal stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="S3-2"><title>C3a Induces Ki67 and Lgr5 Expression in Intestinal Organoids</title><p>Next, we asked whether C3a alters the expression of proliferation (Ki67) and stemness (Lgr5) markers. C3-deficient organoids were formed in the presence or the absence of C3a (10&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL) in the culture medium and total RNA was isolated 7&#x02009;days later and analyzed by RT PCR. The expression of Ki67 mRNA was significantly upregulated in response to C3a administration in organoids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). Immunohistochemistry showed an increased number of Ki67-positive cycling cells in organoid culture in the presence of C3a (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B,C). Similarly, the presence of C3a in the culture medium significantly induced the expression of Lgr5 mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D). The population of Lgr5 positive cells increased impressively in the C3a-treated organoid cultures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E vs. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F). By contrast, the presence of C3a did not affect the expression of lysozyme 1 mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>G), a marker of Paneth cells that function to support the intestinal stem cell maintenance by supplying trophic factors such as Wnt (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Immunostaining for lysozyme did not show any difference between organoids cultured in the presence or absence of C3a (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>H,I). The addition of C3a significantly enhanced the expression of Ascl2 (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material), a transcription factor that is induced through Wnt stimulation and reinforces intestinal stem cell identity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). To explore whether the effect of C3a in proliferation and stemness involves C3aR1, we studied the expression of Ki67 and Lgr5 in organoids generated from C3 KO mice and their corresponding B6 control mice, as well as in organoids from C3aR1 KO mice and their corresponding control BALB/c mice. Our finding of increased expression of both Lgr5 and Ki67 in the organoids from the control and C3 KO mice but not from the C3aR1 KO mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>J) indicates that C3a promotes cell proliferation and stemness through C3aR1.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The expression of Ki67 and leucine-rich repeat G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) were enhanced in organoids in response to C3a. mRNA expression of Ki67 <bold>(A)</bold>, Lgr5 <bold>(D)</bold>, and Lysozyme <bold>(G)</bold> was compared in organoids in the absence or presence of C3a in the medium. *<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. n.s., not significant (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3 mice in each group).

Tissue injury is accompanied by inflammation and it is reasonable to consider that inflammation-defined molecules drive the regeneration machinery to maintain intestinal homeostasis (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This concept is supported by our results that demonstrate that C3a enhances mini-gut generation <italic>in vitro</italic> and C3 production is up-regulated in intestinal crypts as an immediate response to ischemia/reperfusion injury. We previously reported that intracellular C3a is produced by the epithelial cells lining the villi in response to intestinal ischemia and exacerbates intestinal epithelial loss (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that organoid formation from intestinal crypts of mice deficient in C3 was reduced. More importantly, organoid formation was reduced in mice deficient in C3aR1 and it did not increase even when the cultures were supplemented with C3a suggesting that C3a/C3aR1 signaling is important in stem cell proliferation. Organoid formation enhancement by C3a appeared to support Wnt signaling. Pharmaceutical inhibition of the Wnt signaling or the absence of R-spondin1 mitigated the enhancing effect of C3a.</p><p>When crypt cells from B6, C3 KO, and BALB/c mice were exposed to C3a <italic>in vitro</italic> they exhibited increased proliferative capacity, as demonstrated by increased expression of Ki67 and upregulated the stem cell indicator Lgr5. By contrast, Ki67 was not expressed and did not increase in the presence of C3a in crypt cells obtained from C3aR1 KO mice. This suggests that C3aR1 signaling is important for Lgr5 expression and crypt cell proliferation. Basak et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) reported that Lgr5<sup>High</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> stem cells are in continuous cell cycle and are efficient in forming organoids, while Lgr5<sup>Low</sup>Ki67<sup>&#x02212;</sup> are in a quiescent state having lost their stemness and clonogenic ability. Our finding that C3aR1 KO organoids express low levels of Lgr5 and no Ki67 in conjunction with our finding that C3a induces Lgr5 and Ki67 only in C3aR1-expressing organoids supports our hypothesis that C3a/C3aR1 signaling is important in stem cell cycling and villus regeneration.</p><p>Although C3-deficient mice develop limited ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion injury (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), we found that C3aR1-deficient mice develop ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion injury, as also noted by others (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Therefore, it appears that the complement system has a bidirectional effect on intestinal damage and repair. C3 is required for the activation of complement system and the pursuant destruction of cells through the formation of C5b-9 membrane attack complexes. By contrast, C3a is needed for the successful function of stem cells, which is important for intestinal regeneration and the absence of C3aR1 alone cannot mitigate injury. Local intracellular production and activation of complement has been noted recently and implicated in the regulation of cell function and in injury (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In this communication, we extend this concept by showing the intestinal stem cells produce C3 and express C3aR1.</p><p>Increased expression of C3, C3aR1, Lgr5, and Ki67 in our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in which crypts were isolated from B6 mice that underwent ischemia or ischemia followed by reperfusion indicates that C3a/C3aR1 signaling may be important in stem cell proliferation and tissue regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Increased expression of C3aR has also been reported in mice subjected to permanent cerebral ischemia (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) corroborating such an interpretation. On the other hand, upregulation of Lgr5 was similarly increased in crypts isolated from C3aR1 KO and C3 KO mice that underwent ischemia or ischemia followed by reperfusion suggesting that in addition to C3a, other factors may contribute to stem cell cycling necessary for villus repair (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). To conclude, our studies introduce an inflammatory molecule, C3a, as an important promoter of intestinal stem cell function and regeneration and a key contributor to the regenerative process.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All mice were maintained in the pathogen-free, AAALAC (Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International) accredited animal facility at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
