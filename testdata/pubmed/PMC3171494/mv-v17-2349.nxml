While most patients benefit from this treatment initially, within 5 years of surgery about 20%&#x02013;40% suffers a secondary loss of vision because of posterior capsule opacification (PCO), also known as after-cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>].</p><p>Because the residual lens epithelial cells at the equator and under the anterior lens capsule proliferate and migrate onto the posterior capsule and undergo epitheliale-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This results in the formation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, as well as the formation of extracellular cell matrix (ECM), and finally, the PCO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>].</p><p>Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a growth factor that plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation by binding to its receptor EGFR. The epidermal growth factor receptor is a member of the ErbB family of receptors, a subfamily of four closely related receptor tyrosine kinases: EGFR (ErbB-1), Her2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)/c-neu (ErbB-2), Her 3 (ErbB-3) and Her 4 (ErbB-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. Mutations that lead to EGFR overexpression or over activity have been associated with several cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Especially, mutations, amplifications or mis-regulations of EGFR or family members are implicated in about 30% of all epithelial cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Some factors such as injury may enhance the expression of EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>The present study was undertaken to investigate the hypothesis that EGFR exerts a critical role on PCO formation by promoting the survival of abnormal cells with PCO-like characteristics and the blockage of expression of <italic>EGFR</italic> in HLE cells may reduce the development of PCO.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HLE cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA), grown in RPMI-1640 culture medium, supplemented with 20% premium FBS, 50 U/ml of penicillin, 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin, and 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml gentamycin.

HLE cells (5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells per well) were seeded in a 24-well plate or 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells were seeded in 25&#x000a0;ml culture flask. After 16 h at about 60% confluence, the cells were transfected with <italic>EGFR</italic> siRNA (1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/well, 4 &#x000d7;g/flask). Four h after transfection, full culture medium, without antibiotics, was added.</p></sec><sec><title>MTT assay</title><p>HLE cells (8,000 cell/well) in logarithmic growth phase were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed plates in a triplicate pattern. Forty-eight h after transfection, 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution (5&#x000a0;mg/ml) was added to each well which have already contained 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l culture media and incubated for 4 h at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Then 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of DMSO was added to each well and the plate was vortexed for 10 min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Finally, the optical density value of each well was measured at 570 nm.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell growth curve assay</title><p>To determine the proliferative ability of cells, 3&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells were plated in 24-well plates (three replicates for each time point), and the number of cells was counted everyday after plating. The growth assay was performed over a period of 8 days, at which time the cells were confluent.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cycle assay</title><p>Cells (1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>) were plated in 60&#x000a0;mm culture dishes. After an overnight incubation for the cells to adhere, cells were treated with <italic>EGFR</italic> siRNA and non-silencing siRNA. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), detached with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and pelleted. The pellet was suspended in cold PBS and the cells were fixed in a final concentration of 70% ethanol for 1 h at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated with 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml RNase A for 15 min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Nuclei were stained with 50&#x000a0;mg/ml propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in the dark. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. For flow cytometric evaluation of cell cycle, 10,000 events corrected for debris and aggregate were analyzed for each sample. The proliferation index (PI) was calculated as follows: PI=(S+G<sub>2</sub>)/G<sub>1</sub>.The assay was performed in three replicates.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>Forty-eight h after transfection, total RNA was extracted. Total mRNAs were reverse transcribed by oligodT primers. The housekeeping gene &#x003b2;-actin (<italic>ACTB</italic>) was considered as an endogenous control target gene and controls were treated with the same conditions and analyzed by real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was performed as described in the method of SYBR pre-Mix kits (TakaRa, Dalian, China).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>Forty-eight h after transfection, HLE cells were treated with radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer containing 1% protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and proteins were harvested. Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel and then electro transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 2&#x000a0;h. Then the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-human EGFR (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or GAPDH antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 5% nonfat milk overnight, respectively. The membranes were incubated by a goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 90&#x000a0;min at room temperature. Protein expression was assessed by enhanced chemiluminescence and exposure to chemiluminescent film.</p></sec><sec><title>Aminal experiment, siRNA transfection in vivo</title><p>Forty-eight Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were provided by Tianjin medical university, Tianjin, China, animal center. All studies were performed in accordance with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and all animal research protocols were approved by the Tianjin Medical University for Comparative Medicine. The right eye of each rat was operated for extracapsluar cataract extraction in all the animals and the rats were divided into 2 groups at random. Abdominal injection of Aminazine (25&#x000a0;mg/kg) and Ketamine (50&#x000a0;mg/kg) was used for general anesthesia. After routine preoperation preparation, make a incision in the clear cornea with 15&#x000b0; paracentesis knife. After injecting Healon, make a 3&#x02013;3.5&#x000a0;mm anterior continue circular capsulotomy with discission needle, then enlarge the corneal incision to 120&#x000b0; parallel corneal limbus, revolve lens nucleus into anterior chamber after water separation with BSS (balanced salt solution) and extract it, then aspirate the residual cortex and irrigate anterior chamber with BSS. Close the incision with 10&#x02013;0 nylon. Then injected 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l transfection mixture into each capsule bag. The control group was given plasmid pSilencer 2.1 (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g), and the siRNA group was treated with pSilencer-EGFR (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g).

The incidence of PCO is 30%&#x02013;50% in adult, and 100% in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Though the reason of PCO has been known for some time, the mechanism of it is yet not clearly understood. A large number of studies have been taken to explore an efficient way for getting rid of this complication.</p><p>The EGFR signaling pathway has an important role in cell proliferation, especially epithelial cells. Many diseases have been reported to be closely related with the deregulation of EGFR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p><p>After activated by binding of its specific ligands, including epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor &#x003b1; (TGF-&#x003b1;), EGFR can stimulate the intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. The tyrosine kinase activity, in turn, initiates a signal transduction cascade that results in a variety of biochemical changes within the cell &#x02013; a rise in intracellular calcium levels, increased glycolysis and protein synthesis, and increases in the expression of certain genes including <italic>EGFR</italic> &#x02013; that ultimately lead to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we hypothesized that <italic>EGFR</italic> has a vital role in the process of PCO. The morphological and immune properties of eyes make it suitable for RNAi treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. So we used RNAi and designed a series of experiments in vitro or in vivo to test our assumption.</p><p>The results of MTT and cells growth curve assay is surprisingly similar in that <italic>EGFR</italic> siRNA can stably suppress the proliferation of HLE cells, with or without the stimulus of EGF. And in vivo experiments, we directly gave a transfection mixture to the capsular bag of rats immediately after surgery. Maybe transfection efficiency was much lower than in vitro, but even so, the proliferation of HLE cells in the bag was significantly inhibited by siRNA. Based on these results, we probably can make such a conclusion that <italic>EGFR</italic> is an effective target of PCO, and siRNA of <italic>EGFR</italic> can be a potential drug for preventing it.</p><p>However, this study may not completely remove the problem of PCO. First of all, HLE cells also express other various kinds of growth factors and receptors in the cell membrane, and these growth factor and its receptors composing signaling pathway can enhance the proliferation, differentiation, and collagen fiber excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. For example, TGF-&#x003b2; was reported in many articles to be closely related with HLE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>].</p><p>Second, as we can see from the data of our studies, the efficiency of siRNA in vivo is not as high as in vitro experiments. So, if we can enhance the transfection efficiency of siRNA in vivo, we believe that a much satisfying result could be obtained. Perhaps the Lentiviral expression system could be applied to infect HLE cells in capsular bag to get desirable results.</p><p>In summary, siRNA of <italic>EGFR</italic> seems to be a potential therapy of PCO which might be developed into a drug in the future. And due to the instability of transient transfection, a virus expression system may provide an effective solving solution.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the Life Science Center of TianJin medical university for technical help.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schaumberg</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Dana</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Christen</surname><given-names>WG</given-names></name><name><surname>Glynn</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A systematic overview of the incidence of posterior capsule opacification.</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>1998</year><volume>105</volume><fpage>1213</fpage><lpage>21</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9663224</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Awasthi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Posterior capsular opacification: a problem reduced but not yet eradicated.</article-title><source>Arch Ophthalmol</source><year>2009</year><volume>127</volume><fpage>555</fpage><lpage>62</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19365040</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="r3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wormstone</surname><given-names>IM</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Posterior capsule opacification.</article-title><source>Exp Eye Res</source><year>2009</year><volume>88</volume><fpage>257</fpage><lpage>69</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19013456</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="r4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kappelhof</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Vrensen</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The pathology of after-cataract.
