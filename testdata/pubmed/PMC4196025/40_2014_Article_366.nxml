To behavioural ecologists, the question itself may seem perplexing: finding flowers is just what bees do. That bees are well designed to exploit floral resources is so self-evident that at first glance it may seem as if there is nothing to explain. Indeed, much of the research on foraging behaviour concerns what bees do, and how they do it, after they have had their first rewarded experience on flowers (see reviews by Gould, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1990</xref>; Bitterman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1996</xref>; Chittka and Thomson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2001</xref>; Menzel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2001</xref>; Raine et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2006</xref>; Benard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>; Giurfa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>; Dukas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>; Goulson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>; Avargu&#x000e8;s-Weber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>; Dyer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>). There is comparatively less research on what they do before: when workers leave their colony for the first time, having never yet encountered a flower, how do they identify candidate food sources? This review is centred on how bees are directed to their first floral contact where pollen and nectar rewards begin to shape their motor responses into efficient food-directed behavioural sequences: how bees get to the start line of their foraging careers.</p><p>If workers in eusocial species fail to find food, especially at the beginning of colony cycle, not only are a few individuals placed at risk, but the whole colony could fail to thrive or die out altogether. This review focuses on honeybees (<italic>Apis</italic> spp. L., 1758) and bumblebees (<italic>Bombus</italic> spp. Latreille, 1802). They are central place foragers that contribute to the nutrition of the entire colony. In addition, the visual processing in these Hymenopterans has been exceptionally well documented (Dyer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>)&#x02014;there is a substantial body of literature to use in eventual comparisons in future research between behaviours before and after the first floral reward.</p><p>The question of what draws bees to potential sources of nectar and pollen may be of interest not only to insect behaviourists but also to pollination ecologists: this paper approaches the problem from the perspectives of the problems faced by insects and those faced by the plants they visit. Plants &#x0201c;advertise&#x0201d; themselves (Dafni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>) and incur high costs in doing so (Primack and Hall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">1990</xref>) but are, nonetheless, frequently subject to pollination deficits. Growers of insect-pollinated field crops such as blueberries and cranberries routinely pay for commercial pollination services to improve crop quality and yield (Free, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1993</xref>; Velthuis and van Doorn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2005</xref>). Given the worldwide declines in bumblebees (Goulson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2008</xref>; Williams and Osborne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2009</xref>), the competition amongst flower species to attract pollinators may be on the rise. As noted by Buchmann and Nabhan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>, p. 258): &#x0201c;Fewer pollinators ultimately mean fewer plants&#x0201d;, and understanding their pollination ecology will be critical to protect them from extinction.</p><p>The terminology regarding our subject area is fraught with difficulties in interpretation. The term &#x0201c;innate&#x0201d; (or a synonym, &#x0201c;instinctive&#x0201d;), though it persists in the biological literature, is problematic (Bateson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1984</xref>; Oyama, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2000</xref>; Scholz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2002</xref>; Bateson and Mameli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2007</xref>; Mameli and Bateson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2011</xref>) because it can take on several non-interchangeable meanings (e.g. adaptive, unmodifiable, inborn, hardwired, unlearned, species-specific, etc.). What is worse, evidence for one meaning can too easily be mistaken as entailing evidence for the other (Bateson and Gluckman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>). One possible solution is to use the term &#x0201c;pre-functional&#x0201d; (Hogan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1994</xref>)&#x02014;in our case, the behaviour that occurs prior to functional experience with flowers. A similar tack is to characterize the bees themselves as &#x0201c;flower-na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; (Giurfa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1995</xref>) or &#x0201c;foraging-na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; (Milet-Pinheiro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2012</xref>). We will adopt these expressions because they have the advantage that they avoid any implication that no experience whatsoever is necessary for the development of behaviour.</p><p>This review focuses only on visual cues that are attractive to flower-na&#x000ef;ve honeybees and bumblebees though in nature, odour cues are almost certainly important as well. In bumblebees, workers take advantage of floral odours that are brought into the colony by others (Dornhaus and Chittka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>). The role of odour cues in isolation of, and in combination with, visual cues has been documented for solitary bee species (<italic>Chelostoma rapunculi</italic> (Lepeletier, 1841)): the relative importance of these cues changes with experience (Milet-Pinheiro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2012</xref>). The use of various cues also depends on availability: bumblebees (<italic>Bombus impatiens</italic> Cresson, 1863) can forage in complete darkness (Chittka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</xref>). The olfactory preferences of honeybees are reviewed by Riffell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2011</xref>). The chemical ecology and evolution of bee&#x02013;flower interactions are reviewed by D&#x000f6;tterl and Vereecken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>). Multi-sensory integration in bees is reviewed by Leonard and Masek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2014</xref>).</p><p>The overriding question in this paper is not new. It can be traced to the writings of Manning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">1956</xref>, p. 198) (&#x02026;&#x0201c;it is necessary for a plant to attract bees in the first place, before they are &#x02018;aware&#x02019; of the food supply&#x02026;&#x0201d;) and Free and Butler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1959</xref>, p. 106) (&#x0201c;Little work has been done to discover those features of flowers to which bees react on their very first foraging flights, and such an investigation would be well worth undertaking&#x0201d;). Giurfa et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1995</xref>) trace the question back to none other than Charles Darwin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1876</xref>). What is new is that now there are some answers. We begin with methodological considerations, follow with an examination of the role of various visual cues that have been investigated and conclude with suggestions for future research. We draw on the literature from perception, neuroscience, ecology and computational science. The benefits of a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates functional questions from biology with mechanistic questions from psychology have been delineated by Dukas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>), Chittka and Thomson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2001</xref>), Dukas and Ratcliffe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>) and Shettleworth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodological issues</title><p>Though bees can be tracked in the field over long distances using harmonic radar (Osborne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">1999</xref>), it remains, as noted by Lunau and Maier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1995</xref>), methodologically intractable to determine the first flower choice of bees that are known to be flower-na&#x000ef;ve. Accordingly, most of the research is conducted in the lab where the history of individual workers is known and the floral options can be controlled. Below we describe some of the standard procedures that have been used to investigate floral preferences of flower-na&#x000ef;ve bees and highlight some of the methodological pitfalls. This section is intended as a guide to navigating the literature and as a list of experimental design considerations for use in future research.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pre-training</title><p>Workers that have had foraging experience in the lab typically fly directly to the source of food and return reliably. In contrast, the flight paths of flower-na&#x000ef;ve bumblebees are typically meandering and it can take hours and even days before they alight on any artificial patterns. Indeed, on their first flights, the task of learning landmarks and the characteristics of their nest entrance (Hempel de Ibarra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2009</xref>) may possibly take precedence over foraging. Even in greenhouses where there is little else but rows of tomato flowers, bumblebees can take 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;days before foraging reliably on the flowers (Asada and Ono, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1996</xref>). In a flight cage in our lab, the times in between first leaving a colony and landing on one of two artificial flowers for a sample of almost 200 bumblebees were distributed with a mode of within 1&#x000a0;day, but a median of 11&#x000a0;days (Orb&#x000e1;n, 2013, unpubl. data). To circumvent this problem, bees are sometimes trained to ostensibly neutral patterns such as black discs, white discs (Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2004</xref>) or checkerboards (Lehrer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1995</xref>) and subsequently tested for their preferences of new unrewarded patterns. This practice may be innocuous when studying colour preferences: bees do not generalize their experience from pre-training with one colour to testing on others, as long as the colours seem very different to them (Gumbert, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2000</xref>). Nonetheless, explicit tests of the effects of pre-training on subsequent pattern choice have shown differences in the behaviour of untrained (flower-na&#x000ef;ve) and pre-trained (not-so-na&#x000ef;ve) bumblebees (S&#x000e9;guin and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2008</xref>; Plowright et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2011</xref>). Hence, the untested assumption that pre-training is neutral or unrelated to the test of floral preferences is tenuous.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Choices</title><p>Strictly speaking, a bee is flower-na&#x000ef;ve for its first choice, but not for its second. It is an empirical matter, however, whether the first few unrewarded choices differ from the first. There is habituation of unlearned preferences: preferences wane between testing sessions in the face of repeated exposure to patterns that offer no reward (Simonds and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2004</xref>), but resurface again after time (Plowright et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2006</xref>). Over periods of prolonged testing on unrewarding patterns, where bees are free to return to and from the flight cage and their colony, increases and decreases in preferences oscillate (Orb&#x000e1;n and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2013</xref>). Within a testing session consisting of a series of unrewarded choices made upon the first trip away from the colony, however, we have found little or no change within short sessions of 16&#x02013;20 choices (Plowright et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2011</xref>, 2013).</p><p>One issue that remains unresolved is the effect of the number of floral options presented. Even with a single flower, there is a choice to accept or reject it. With two flowers, an apparent preference for one flower can be the result of an avoidance of the other: preferences are relative. Offering three options would further complicate the situation. In the animal behaviour literature, the preference of one stimulus over the other can be affected in non-trivial ways by the introduction of a third option (Bateson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>). That this may be a real concern in our area is suggested by the work of Shafir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">1994</xref>) who demonstrated intransitive preferences in honeybees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic> L., 1758): in a series of binary choices that varied in the depth and volume of sucrose-water delivered, honeybees preferred A to B, B to C, C to D, but D to A.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measures of preference</title><p>Choice behaviour can be measured in multiple ways, differing in the level of apparent commitment to a floral stimulus by the bee: approach within a specified distance (e.g. 2&#x000a0;cm; Goulson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2007</xref>); entering a corridor, in which a pattern is contained, in a maze (Simonds and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2004</xref>; S&#x000e9;guin and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2008</xref>); antennal contact with a test pattern (Pohl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2008</xref>; Lunau et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2009</xref>)&#x02014;see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for an illustration with honeybees and bumblebees; landing on a test pattern (Leonard and Papaj, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2011</xref>); floral exploration as defined by walking into an artificial flower (Orb&#x000e1;n and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2013</xref>); or probing (Daumer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1958</xref>). Even finer gradations can be achieved&#x02014;see Evangelista et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2010</xref>) for details on the moments before touchdown in honeybees. Some of these different behaviours are sometimes lumped together and discussed as &#x02018;preference&#x02019; even though floral choice consists of a series of sequential decisions that are not necessarily governed by the same parameters (Lunau, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1992</xref>; Lunau et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2006</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Antennal reactions towards floral guides (<italic>two dots</italic>) by <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> (<italic>above</italic>) and <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> (<italic>below</italic>).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Individual differences</title><p>Individual differences in the behaviour of eusocial insects are pronounced and their origins are beginning to be understood (Jeanne, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1988</xref>; Jeanson and Weidenm&#x000fc;ller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2013</xref>). For instance, task specialization is seen in honeybees, and a colony even comprises both &#x0201c;employed&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;unemployed&#x0201d; foragers (Seeley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">1995</xref>). In bumblebees, there is some division of labour with smaller bees tending to the nest and larger bees devoting themselves more to foraging (Goulson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2002</xref>). Foraging effort is anything but evenly shared (Free, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1955</xref>). Individual differences are not especially problematic in procedures where the number of unrewarded choices of stimuli is fixed. When bees are given unrestricted access to a flight cage, however, some bees will invariably make considerably more choices than others, and the issue arises as to their representativeness. A sample of undifferentiated &#x02018;bee-choices&#x02019; (e.g. Lehrer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1995</xref>) gives little guide as to whether the results might reflect the behaviour of only a few particularly active bees. Individual differences (e.g. Orb&#x000e1;n and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2013</xref>), colony differences (Plowright et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2011</xref>) and population differences (Skorupski et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2007</xref>; Ings et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2009</xref>) have been reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Automation</title><p>Concerns over observer bias are common to many areas in the study of insect behaviour (D&#x000f6;ring and Chittka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2011</xref>), as are concerns over cost-effectiveness. The problems associated with human monitoring of flower-na&#x000ef;ve bee behaviour, in real time, are compounded here because the occurrence of rare events over long observation periods almost inevitably leads to decreases in vigilance (Warm et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2009</xref>).</p><p>Two low-cost technological advances are now available: (1) while video recordings are commonplace (Leonard and Papaj, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2011</xref>), motion-sensitive camcorders (Lihoreau et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2012</xref>; Orb&#x000e1;n and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2013</xref>) have the added advantage of recording a specified length clip only when a specific pattern of movement is detected in the viewfinder. This feature is particularly well suited to this area of investigation because it filters out much of the time during which there is no activity around the stimuli. (2) Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is analogous to the bar-coding system that was pioneered by Buchmann for the identification of honeybees (the unpublished method is described by Reynolds and Riley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2002</xref>)). A metallic identification tag is glued to the thorax (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and detected by a reader placed at strategic locations (Streit et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2003</xref>; Sumner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2007</xref>; Ohashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2010</xref>; Stelzer and Chittka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2010</xref>; Decourtye et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>; Silcox et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2011</xref>; Nachev et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2012</xref>; Katzenberger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2013</xref>). We have recently adapted the technology to detect flower-na&#x000ef;ve bumblebees exploring unrewarding flowers (Orb&#x000e1;n and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2013</xref>). A video illustration of the procedure is shown by Orb&#x000e1;n and Plowright (in press). One limitation of the method is the detection distance being restricted to a few millimetres (for other design considerations, see Carbunar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>). Electro-magnetic sensors to detect approach of flowers (Heuschen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2005</xref>), used in conjunction with RFID, would be helpful in tracking behavioural sequences.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>

A compelling demonstration is provided by Chittka and Walker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2006</xref>): bumblebees (<italic>Bombus terrestris</italic>) spontaneously land preferentially on Van Gogh&#x02019;s <italic>Sunflowers</italic> rather than Caulfield&#x02019;s <italic>Pottery</italic>. In our lab, we have seen a flower-na&#x000ef;ve bumblebee probe a photograph of a flower (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

There are no receptors with peak sensitivity near red, which likely accounts for poor learning of red (Chittka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>; Lunau et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2011</xref>), even in species (e.g. <italic>Bombus dahlbomii</italic> Gu&#x000e9;rin-M&#x000e9;neville, 1835) that are known to visit red flowers (Mart&#x000ed;nez-Harms et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2010</xref>). Colour vision functions only, however, at relatively short distances: up to 10&#x000a0;cm for a grating with a spatial period of 2&#x000a0;cm, or subtending an angle of 15&#x000b0; in honeybees, but only 2.7&#x000b0; in bumblebees (Lehrer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1988</xref>; Land, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">1997</xref>; Macuda et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2001</xref>; Chittka and Raine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>). Honeybees use green-contrast (i.e., grayscale vision) to an angle subtending up to 5&#x000b0; (2.3&#x000b0; for bumblebees) but beyond this point, the shapes of objects become indistinguishable (Dyer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2008</xref>). The evolution of insect colour vision is reviewed by Briscoe and Chittka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2001</xref>).</p><p>The fact that bees have sensitivity in the UV range of the spectrum is particularly important for plant&#x02013;pollinator interactions. Ultraviolet absorbing &#x0201c;floral guides&#x0201d; that are invisible to humans are perceptible to pollinators. Not only do they serve to orient bees at close range towards the source of reward, but they also affect visitation rates (Horth et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2014</xref>). The appearance of flowers revealed by UV photography is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. In a manipulation of UV properties, Koski and Ashman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2014</xref>) have demonstrated that it is not the UV reflectance or absorbance alone but the patterns created on flowers that are attractive to pollinators.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>

</p><p>The colour of nectar guides was studied on four spectral frequencies of 41 flower species: wavelengths of 360&#x000a0;nm (ultraviolet), 450&#x000a0;nm (blue), 520&#x000a0;nm (green) and 680&#x000a0;nm (red) (Penny, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">1983</xref>). Flowers displayed nectar guides with better colour contrast on the insect visible spectrum (360 and 450&#x000a0;nm) when compared with the human visible spectrum (520 and 680&#x000a0;nm). The colour contrast effect was weaker when only UV was considered, suggesting that UV does not have a disproportionate contribution to preference: bees will choose yellow, and violet as well as UV. This behavioural finding about bee&#x02019;s preference for several distinct colours is consistent with a study that showed non-UV flower colours are more common than UV flowers (Chittka et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1994</xref>), and another study that highlights the absence of pure UV flowers (Menzel and Shmida, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1993</xref>). Indeed, there is general agreement that the salience of floral UV patterns is comparable to the salience of other colours visible to bees (Kevan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Floral colours</title><p>The colour preferences of both honeybees and bumblebees prior to any experience with flowers have been reviewed by Lunau and Maier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1995</xref>). While bumblebees and honeybees have similar colour vision (Peitsch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">1992</xref>), they differ in that honeybees have a highly developed communication system: experienced honeybees communicate the location of food sources to inexperienced bees (von Frisch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">1967</xref>). Nonetheless, honeybees (<italic>A. mellifera</italic>) with controlled prior experience (&#x0201c;neutral pre-training&#x0201d;) do have colour preferences (Giurfa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1995</xref>) for wavelengths of 410&#x000a0;nm (&#x0201c;bee-uv-blue&#x0201d;) and 530&#x000a0;nm (&#x0201c;bee-green&#x0201d;): the same colours that are learned most easily (Menzel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1967</xref>). Bumblebees have, at most, a primitive communication system (Dornhaus and Chittka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2001</xref>) and individuals rely much more on their own efforts to find food.</p><p>The key dimension in triggering approach by untrained bumblebees and honeybees is not so much the dominant wavelength (giving rise to the perception of hue) of the corolla of a flower, but its spectral purity (giving rise to the perception of saturation), i.e. the degree to which there is one dominant vs. a mix of wavelengths (Lunau, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1992</xref>; Papiorek et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2013</xref>; Rohde et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2013</xref>). Corollas with high spectral purity are approached from afar (Lunau et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">1996</xref>). Flowers incite inspection (<italic>Bombus lucorum</italic> (L., 1761) and <italic>B. terrestris</italic> (L., 1758)) with a gradient of spectral purity: low in the background, high at the corolla and highest at floral guides such as stamens. Spectral purity acts as a releaser for action patterns such as antennal reactions (Lunau, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">1991</xref>) and other optical signals of stamens, such as size of the thecae and distance between them, elicit final landing (Lunau, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">1991</xref>). Most flowers are not single-coloured, and indeed two-coloured flowers are preferred (Heuschen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2005</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Floral size</title><p>Under the principle that the evolution of floral signals is tied to pollinator perception, and that in nature floral size is possibly predictive of reward, Blarer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>) considered the possibility that there might be a preference for large flowers over smaller ones on the very first visit by bumblebees (<italic>B. terrestris</italic>). If such a preference were found, it would be important in terms of the evolution of floral displays: plants that honestly signalled their reward availability (see Armbruster et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2005</xref>) would be invasible by cheaters. Such a preference was not found, though with experience, bees were capable of associating floral size with reward (Blarer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>). In a more recent study, we used artificial flowers that consisted of two blue perpendicular acrylic sheets perched on top of a container that trapped bees that entered. The design of these flowers was based on traps used in the field to census insect populations (Stephen and Rao, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2005</xref>). We manipulated the size of the flowers, but no effect on the choices of flower-na&#x000ef;ve bumblebees (<italic>B. impatiens</italic>) was detected (Hudon and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2011</xref>). The usual cautions in interpreting failures to reject the null hypothesis apply.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Patterning</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Floral guides</title><p>The suggestion that floral markings function to guide pollinators towards the nectary likely originated with Sprengel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">1793</xref>). When patterns are presented at the ends of corridors in a maze, selective approach of radial patterns (i.e. &#x02018;sunburst&#x02019; patterns: alternating black and white pie shaped segments, all pointing to the centre) over concentric patterns (i.e. &#x02018;bull&#x02019;s eye&#x02019; patterns: alternating black and white circles within each other) has been well documented for honeybees (Lehrer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1995</xref>) and bumblebees (Simonds and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2004</xref>; Plowright et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2006</xref>; S&#x000e9;guin and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2008</xref>). Selective landing on radial patterns by free flying bumblebees has also been reported (Orb&#x000e1;n and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2013</xref>). Whether flowers have petals or not seems comparatively unimportant: it is the presence of radial lines on artificial flowers that causes bumblebees not only to make their first landing but also to locate food more quickly after landing (Leonard and Papaj, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2011</xref>). These lines are beneficial for the plants: they discourage nectar robbing (Leonard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2013</xref>). Experimental removal of &#x0201c;floral signposts&#x0201d; has a detrimental effect on plant fitness (Hansen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2012</xref>; Whitney et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2013</xref>).</p><p>While the evidence above shows that &#x0201c;X marks the spot&#x0201d; (Leonard and Papaj, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2011</xref>), other shapes also seem to be used as floral guides. Flowers with a dot or pair of dots at the centre of flower (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) are more likely to be approached and antennated by flower-na&#x000ef;ve bumblebees (Heuschen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2005</xref>), with bigger dots eliciting stronger responses by both honeybees and bumblebees (Lunau et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Pattern location</title><p>The case for special markings functioning as guides to the nectary or to the anthers is bolstered by a recent experiment where the presence of the food source was dissociated from the place indicated by the guide. When the position of the nectary conflicted with the &#x02018;directions&#x02019; given by an off-centre guide, unsuccessful novice bumblebee foragers spent significantly more time searching for nectar than when the nectar guides surrounded the nectary (Goodale et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>). Using a similar experimental strategy of dissociating two variables, pattern type (radial vs. concentric) and location of the pattern elements (central vs. peripheral), we showed that both concentric elements and radial elements caused bumblebees to enter an artificial flower, as long as the elements were centrally located: both &#x02018;X&#x02019; and &#x02018;O&#x02019; marked the spot. Concentric elements at the periphery of the flower put bumblebees that had landed on the flower on a circular path that steered them clear of the centre. Landing was more likely on artificial flowers displaying radial elements, regardless of whether they were positioned centrally or peripherally (Orb&#x000e1;n and Plowright, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Spatial frequency</title><p>In nature, some plants make themselves detectable not by their particularly large floral structures, but by their inflorescences consisting of clusters of small flowers (Lehrer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1995</xref>): spatial frequency (i.e. the &#x0201c;busyness&#x0201d;) of the visual input may be a key variable. Honeybees show a gradient of strong to weak preference for clusters consisting of four, three, two or one radiating patterns. In comparisons of various spatial frequencies for each of several patterns (horizontal gratings, vertical gratings, radial patterns and concentric circles), however, a consistent preference for comparatively low frequencies was obtained, even though the most disrupted patterns were resolvable&#x02014;i.e. the lines were not perceived as blurred together (Lehrer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1995</xref>). Preferences for relatively high spatial frequency patterns have also been reported (Dafni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>; Plowright et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2011</xref>). Several possible explanations might account for the discrepancies across studies: (1) the absolute values for spatial frequencies likely differ across studies, with &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; being relative terms. (2) It is not so much the spatial frequency per se that is important, as it is the associated contrast with the background, as suggested by Lehrer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1995</xref>)&#x02014;indeed, even colour preferences of bumblebees are affected by background complexity (Forrest and Thomson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2009</xref>). (3) As suggested below, the effect of spatial frequency may depend on another variable: symmetry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Symmetry</title><p>An important consideration with regard to what draws bees to flowers for the first time is how easy it is to encode and remember a floral pattern should it turn out to be rewarding. In other words, perceptibility, learnability and memorability of the pattern may turn out to be important aspects of what makes flowers attractive to bees. Indeed, Nachev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2014</xref>) has recently made the case for &#x0201c;cognition mediated evolution&#x0201d;. This consideration puts the study of floral preferences squarely in the domain of psychology. Cognition, perception, neuroscience and computational modelling are here at centre stage.</p><p>The evolution of floral symmetry has been reviewed by Neal et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">1998</xref>). Preferences for floral symmetry have been documented in the field. Naturally occurring symmetric flowers of fireweed (<italic>Epilobium angustifolium</italic>) were preferentially visited by <italic>B. terrestris</italic>, and this was also true of experimentally manipulated flowers that affected symmetry (M&#x000f8;ller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">1995</xref>; see also M&#x000f8;ller and Sorci, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">1998</xref>). In the lab, honeybees perceive symmetry, as evidenced by their ability to learn discriminations between symmetric and asymmetric patterns and to generalize this learning to novel patterns (Giurfa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1996</xref>). The evidence on a preference for symmetry by flower-na&#x000ef;ve bees, however, is mixed. No such preference was reported by West and Laverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">1998</xref>), though bumblebees could learn that symmetric flowers were rewarding just as easily as they could learn that asymmetric flowers were rewarding. An &#x0201c;innate&#x0201d; preference for symmetry about the vertical axis (i.e. bilateral symmetry) on vertically presented flowers (so the line of approach was perpendicular to the plane on which the pattern was presented) by bumblebees was reported by Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2004</xref>). It seems, however, to have been the product of pre-training on rewarding discs (Plowright et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2011</xref>): truly flower-na&#x000ef;ve bumblebees showed no preference for bilateral symmetry in vertically presented flowers. More recently, however, a preference for symmetry was found by increasing the strength of the manipulation: patterns for which there were four axes of symmetry, and not just one, were indeed chosen over asymmetric patterns (Orb&#x000e1;n, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2014</xref>).</p><p>Symmetry in flowers may well be an index of floral reward (M&#x000f8;ller and Eriksson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">1995</xref>). Symmetry also affords considerable savings in terms of information processing since part of the pattern (half or even more, depending on the number of axes of symmetry) can be discarded without losing any information to be remembered. The cost of information processing may translate into metabolic costs (Laughlin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1998</xref>) and bees may act to minimize these costs as they search for flowers. A key point is that symmetry simplifies the processing of a complex pattern, and low spatial frequency simplifies the processing of an asymmetric pattern: the effect of one variable should depend on another. This notion of computational savings was captured in a mathematical model of pattern reconstruction (ICA: Independent Component Analysis; Orb&#x000e1;n and Chartier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2013</xref>). The essence of ICA is that the visual system completes a process akin to a dimensionality reduction process whereby the raw visual input is reduced to a small set of descriptive features. The model made novel predictions that were borne out empirically. For instance, a preference for low spatial frequency patterns over high-frequency patterns was found, but this preference was only detected when the patterns were &#x02018;cumbersome&#x02019; by virtue of being asymmetric (Orb&#x000e1;n, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Social cues</title><p>Up to now we have been considering aspects of flowers that elicit initial choice. Recent research has addressed the question of whether the presence of foragers on flowers functions the same way as floral properties: perhaps an individual on a flower attracts other bees towards it. From a mechanistic point of view, local enhancement or stimulus enhancement, whereby one individual attracts another to a particular location or stimulus, is commonplace in animal behaviour (Shettleworth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2010</xref>). From a functional point of view, however, such a possibility is only one of other plausible scenarios. Perhaps in nature floral characteristics are such strong predictors of reward that additional social cues carry little additional informational value. Another possibility is that while the presence of a forager signals that a flower has indeed been discovered, it also signals that the flower is empty or on its way to being depleted. In other words, other foragers may act as informers or as competitors (Baude et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>). In view of these considerations, it might be expected that the predictive value of the presence of other foragers on flowers might depend on local environmental conditions and might only be learned from experience. We turn now to the evidence on this point.</p><p>Recent reports have shown that a preference for &#x0201c;occupied&#x0201d; flowers is not only modified by rewarded experience (Leadbeater and Chittka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2009</xref>; Avargu&#x000e8;s-Weber and Chittka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2014</xref>), but is also apparent as soon as bees first begin to search for food. Inexperienced bumblebees given a choice between two rewarding artificial flowers, one of which was occupied by a dead pinned bee and the other not, first landed on the occupied flower more frequently than chance (Kawaguchi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2006</xref>). Similarly, inexperienced bumblebees given a choice amongst 12 unrewarding artificial flowers, four of which were occupied by a dead pinned bee and eight of which were not, first landed on an occupied flower more frequently than chance (Leadbeater and Chittka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2009</xref>). A preference for occupied stimuli was also found by Plowright et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2013</xref>), but only under a restricted set of conditions: when the occupied flowers were comparatively rare, and in addition, the ratio of the size of the occupier relative to the size of the flower was comparatively large. Otherwise, choice proportions did not differ from chance.</p><p>Little is known about how the presence of other foragers is perceived by bees making floral choices. They may be possibly perceived as being parts of the flowers such as nectar guides (Baude et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>), or they may be perceived as other inanimate objects such as a coin or a plastic disc (Dawson and Chittka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>). There is evidence that flowers have adapted their visual appearance to exploit the salience provided by the presence of other foragers. For example, a South-African daisy species (<italic>Gorteria diffusa</italic>) displays insect-mimicking petal spots (Thomas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2009</xref>; Whitney et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bees discover all kinds of flowers that have few similarities. Lilacs (<italic>Syringa vulgaris</italic>), comfrey (<italic>Symphytum officinale</italic>), monkshood (<italic>Aconitum</italic> spp.), thistles (<italic>Cirsium</italic> spp.), blueberry and cranberry flowers (<italic>Vaccinium</italic> spp.), sunflowers (<italic>Helianthus annus</italic>) and tomato flowers (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) do not share all the same colour, contrast, symmetry, spatial frequency or size properties. Moreover, these flowers do share at least some features with other objects that are not flowers (e.g., leaves are usually symmetric; some insects reflect UV). This review has shown that several floral properties are attractive to honeybees and bumblebees with no previous foraging experience, but there seems to be no single set of essential features that define the category of &#x0201c;food source&#x0201d; or even &#x0201c;possibly a food source&#x0201d;.</p><p>There is no shortage of problems and unanswered questions to address, of which we enumerate a few here for consideration in future research:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The question of the nature of experience, i.e. how the bee sees the world, remains open.

For instance, floral &#x0201c;salience&#x0201d;, which is a function of the intensity of several floral stimuli, turns out to be a parsimonious explanatory variable (Katzenberger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2013</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our purpose here was most certainly not to dissect behaviour into categories. It was to put the focus on the precursors of behaviour learned from experience with flowers: the scaffolding on which learning is built. These behaviours are likely to be important from a conservation point of view: though possible disruptions in how bees first find food may turn out to be inconsequential, it seems an unlikely scenario. Ultimately, however, the goal is to understand the development of functional behaviour. Future research should be aimed at linking what we know about the behaviours of comparatively inexperienced workers with what we know about experienced workers. Several recent studies have investigated the fate of the preferences that guide bees to their first floral contact: How easily are they forgotten (Milet-Pinheiro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2012</xref>)? Are they distracting (Morawetz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2013</xref>)? Can they be associated with consequences such as rewards or punishers (Pohl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2008</xref>)? Given the current research effort aimed at protecting pollinators in general, at protecting bees in particular, and especially at understanding &#x02018;the plight of the bumblebee&#x02019;, none of these questions are idle.</p></list-item></list>
