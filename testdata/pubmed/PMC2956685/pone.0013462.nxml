L1 acts as a mediator of signaling events through its intracellular domain, which comprises a putative binding site for 14-3-3 proteins. These regulators of diverse cellular processes are abundant in the brain and preferentially expressed by neurons. In this study, we investigated whether L1 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, how this interaction is mediated, and whether 14-3-3 proteins influence the function of L1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>By immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that 14-3-3 proteins are associated with L1 in mouse brain. The site of 14-3-3 interaction in the L1 intracellular domain (L1ICD), which was identified by site-directed mutagenesis and direct binding assays, is phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII), and CKII phosphorylation of the L1ICD enhances binding of the 14-3-3 zeta isoform (14-3-3&#x003b6;). Interestingly, in an <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation assay, 14-3-3&#x003b6; promoted CKII-dependent phosphorylation of the L1ICD. Given that L1 phosphorylation by CKII has been implicated in L1-triggered axonal elongation, we investigated the influence of 14-3-3&#x003b6; on L1-dependent neurite outgrowth. We found that expression of a mutated form of 14-3-3&#x003b6;, which impairs interactions of 14-3-3&#x003b6; with its binding partners, stimulated neurite elongation from cultured rat hippocampal neurons, supporting a functional connection between L1 and 14-3-3&#x003b6;.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our results suggest that 14-3-3&#x003b6;, a novel direct binding partner of the L1ICD, promotes L1 phosphorylation by CKII in the central nervous system, and regulates neurite outgrowth, an important biological process triggered by L1.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>L1 is a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily which is essential for normal development of the mammalian nervous system. Constitutively L1-deficient mice display severe brain malformations, in particular hydrocephalus and agenesis of the corpus callosum <xref rid="pone.0013462-Dahme1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Demyanenko1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Similar deficits have been discovered in humans carrying mutations in their <italic>L1CAM</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0013462-Kenwrick1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It has been demonstrated that cell recognition via L1 is important both for axon outgrowth and for neuronal migration (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0013462-Schmid1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Maness1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>). These processes are likely to require dynamic control of L1-mediated cell adhesion, for instance by internalization of L1, regulating the availability of L1 on the cell surface. In support of this assumption, endocytotic trafficking of L1 has proved to be important for axon elongation <xref rid="pone.0013462-Kamiguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Regulated L1 internalization depends on interactions of its intracellular domain with signaling, cytoskeletal, and adaptor molecules <xref rid="pone.0013462-Long1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In particular, the tyrosine-based sorting motif Y<sup>1176</sup>RSL, which interacts with the adaptor protein AP-2, is necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of L1 <xref rid="pone.0013462-Kamiguchi2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Phosphorylation of Y<sup>1176</sup> by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase p60src prevents L1 binding to AP-2 <xref rid="pone.0013462-Schaefer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This motif overlaps with the RSLE sequence, encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 28 <xref rid="pone.0013462-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The RSLE sequence is present only in L1 from neurons, but not in L1 expressed by non-neuronal cells such as Schwann cells <xref rid="pone.0013462-Takeda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Ser<sup>1181</sup>, the second serine residue of the YRSLESDNEE sequence in the L1ICD, can be phosphorylated by CKII <xref rid="pone.0013462-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This posttranslational modification most probably plays a critical role in endocytotic trafficking and L1-stimulated axon elongation <xref rid="pone.0013462-Nakata1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, molecular mechanisms by which CKII&#x02013;mediated phosphorylation could influence L1 function have not been investigated so far. Notably, the resulting RSLEpS sequence is a potential binding motif for 14-3-3 proteins <xref rid="pone.0013462-Tzivion1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and analysis of transgenic mice ectopically expressing L1 in astrocytes (GFAP/L1 mice) <xref rid="pone.0013462-Mohajeri1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> revealed an overexpression of 14-3-3&#x003b2; and &#x003b6; (T. Tilling et al., unpublished data).</p><p>The 14-3-3 family of protein-binding proteins was first discovered in brain, where it comprises &#x0223c;1&#x00025; of total soluble protein <xref rid="pone.0013462-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. 14-3-3 proteins are preferentially localized in neurons, but also expressed in a wide range of other cells and tissues <xref rid="pone.0013462-Baxter1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The broad spectrum of 14-3-3 functions includes activation of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases <xref rid="pone.0013462-Ichimura1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, regulation of the Raf-1 oncogene <xref rid="pone.0013462-Tzivion2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0013462-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and modulation of apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0013462-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Zha1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Consistent with their abundance in the brain, several studies point to an important role of 14-3-3 proteins in the nervous system. Genetic knock-out of 14-3-3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> revealed an impairment of learning and synaptic plasticity <xref rid="pone.0013462-Skoulakis1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In support of a similar function in mammals, Simsek-Duran et al. (2004) <xref rid="pone.0013462-SimsekDuran1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> have shown that 14-3-3 proteins are required for a presynaptic form of long-term potentiation in the mouse cerebellum. Moreover, members of the 14-3-3 family are involved in neuronal migration during vertebrate development <xref rid="pone.0013462-Toyooka1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, regulation of cerebellar NMDA receptor surface localization <xref rid="pone.0013462-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and in neurotrophin-stimulated growth of neurites <xref rid="pone.0013462-Gehler1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Rong1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>The multitude of functions exerted by 14-3-3 proteins is achieved through their ability to bind to phosphoserine/phosphothreonine&#x02013;containing motifs of their ligands in a sequence specific manner. Two of the best known 14-3-3 consensus binding motifs are RSXpSXP and RXXXpSXP (pS represents the phosphorylated serine residue) <xref rid="pone.0013462-Yaffe1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, 14-3-3 proteins not only recognize these classical motifs, but also other phosphorylated sites and nonphosphorylated motifs <xref rid="pone.0013462-Tzivion1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Shikano1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Owing to the versatility of binding sites in other proteins and to their ability to dimerize, 14-3-3 proteins act as adaptor proteins, chaperones and scaffolds <xref rid="pone.0013462-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>For a better understanding of L1-mediated cell-cell interactions, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms of interaction between L1 and its intracellular binding partners <xref rid="pone.0013462-Schmid1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Maness1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Based on the presence of a potential 14-3-3 binding motif in a functionally important part of the L1ICD, we posited that 14-3-3 proteins interact with the L1ICD and thereby play a role in L1 function. We show that 14-3-3 is indeed associated with L1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, our results demonstrate that, on the one hand, CKII supports binding of 14-3-3 to L1 and, on the other hand, 14-3-3 binding to L1 enhances L1 phosphorylation by CKII. Finally, expression of the mutated form of 14-3-3&#x003b6;, which impairs interactions of 14-3-3 with its binding partners, stimulated neurite elongation on an L1 substrate. Taken together, our data indicate that 14-3-3 proteins regulate biological functions of L1.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>14-3-3 is associated with L1</title><p>To investigate a possible association between L1 and 14-3-3 proteins in mouse brain, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed.

Based on our finding that 14-3-3 proteins associate with L1, we hypothesized that 14-3-3&#x003b6; may bind to the L1ICD. To test this idea, an Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)-based direct binding assay was performed. Recombinantly expressed L1ICD was immobilized on microtiter plate wells, and its ability to bind 14-3-3&#x003b6; was measured.

The central part of the L1ICD contains the amino acid sequence RSLESD. The second serine within this sequence, Ser<sup>1181</sup>, can be phosphorylated by CKII <xref rid="pone.0013462-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and RX<sub>2-3</sub>pS is a potential 14-3-3-binding motif <xref rid="pone.0013462-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Therefore, two L1ICD mutants were generated: L1ICD &#x00394;RSLESD, in which the RSLESD had been removed, and L1ICD S1181A, in which Ser<sup>1181</sup> was replaced by Ala to prevent L1 phosphorylation by CKII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013462-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Purified L1ICD mutants were analyzed by Western blot analysis with an anti-L1 antibody, which recognizes the unmutated form of L1ICD.

Phosphorylation of L1ICD was evident by the appearance of a second protein band, presumed to be phosphorylated L1, with slightly lower mobility in SDS-PAGE relative to non-phosphorylated L1ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013462-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). An increase in band intensities of phosphorylated L1 was observed over time (particularly from t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0 min to t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;60 min) when L1ICD was preincubated with GST-14-3-3&#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013462-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). When L1ICD was preincubated with GST alone, there was a less pronounced increase in the respective band intensities from t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0 min to t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;30 min. A densitometric comparison of band intensities at time points 0 and 180 min indicated that at the latter time point, L1ICD phosphorylation was &#x0223c;3 times stronger in the presence of 14-3-3&#x003b6; than in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013462-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). To confirm that the upper band represents phospho-L1ICD, the S1181A L1ICD mutant, in which Ser1181 is replaced by Ala to inhibit CKII&#x02013;mediated L1 phosphorylation, was investigated in the same manner as wild-type L1ICD. In contrast to the non-mutated protein, no second band appeared over time with the S1181A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013462-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), demonstrating that the upper band observed in the experiments with wild-type L1ICD (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013462-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) is indeed phosphorylated L1ICD and that the lower band represents non-phosphorylated L1ICD. To conclusively support this interpretation, we treated CKII-phosphorylated L1ICD with lambda protein phosphatase 1 (&#x003bb;PP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0013462-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). &#x003bb;PP1 treatment caused a shift towards the lower band, further confirming that the upper band represents phosphorylated L1ICD. In conclusion, these results indicate that 14-3-3&#x003b6; supports phosphorylation of L1ICD by CKII.</p><fig id="pone-0013462-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0013462.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>14-3-3&#x003b6; supports CKII-catalyzed L1ICD phosphorylation.</title><p>

ELISA and pull-down experiments confirmed a direct interaction between 14-3-3&#x003b6; and the intracellular domain of L1 (L1ICD). We have also observed binding of recombinant 14-3-3&#x003b2; to L1ICD <italic>in vitro</italic> (E.M. Ramser et al., unpublished observations). However, the binding intensity was lower, suggesting that L1 may preferentially interact with specific 14-3-3 molecules. In the present study, we focused on the interaction between 14-3-3&#x003b6; and L1ICD. This interaction is enhanced by CKII-mediated phosphorylation of L1ICD. Notably, we found that 14-3-3&#x003b6; interacts not only with phosphorylated L1, but also with nonphosphorylated L1. Although most known 14-3-3-ligands possess phosphoserine- or phosphothreonine-based motifs, several interactions between 14-3-3 and nonphosphorylated motifs within ligand proteins have been described. Examples include the sequences VTPEER of the amyloid protein precursor (APP) ICD fragment <xref rid="pone.0013462-Sumioka1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, and WLDLE of the synthetic peptide R18 <xref rid="pone.0013462-Petosa1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. It is generally accepted that phosphorylation-independent interactions between 14-3-3 and its binding partners occur in a manner similar to that of the binding partner pS-RAF. This assumption is based on the finding that R18 was co-crystallized with 14-3-3 in a position similar to that of phosphorylated pS-RAF-259 <xref rid="pone.0013462-Petosa1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In the complex structure of 14-3-3&#x003b6; with R18, the aspartate (D) and glutamate (E) side chains generated a negative charge density comparable to that of phosphoserine of pS-RAF-259 <xref rid="pone.0013462-Petosa1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>The RSLESD sequence in the central part of the L1ICD, which, as discussed below, is the likely site of interaction for 14-3-3&#x003b6;, contains two acidic residues. These residues might mimic a phosphoryl group of consensus motifs and help to mediate the interaction of 14-3-3&#x003b6; with non-phosphorylated L1. Mutation of these two residues may be a suitable approach to clarify the mechanism of phospho-independent 14-3-3 binding to L1 in the future. The RSLESD sequence contains a RX2-3pS motif, which is a potential 14-3-3-binding site <xref rid="pone.0013462-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We therefore focused on this sequence for further analysis, particularly the second Ser residue that is known to be phosphorylated by CKII <xref rid="pone.0013462-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This CKII phosphorylation site is evolutionarily well-conserved among L1 orthologs and L1 family CAMs <xref rid="pone.0013462-Hortsch1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and, therefore, is likely to be required for subsequent interactions of L1 proteins in signaling cascades and to serve a significant role in L1 function. Mutation analysis showed that the RSLESD sequence is indeed the site of 14-3-3 interaction and confirmed that phosphorylation by CKII occurs at Ser<sup>1181</sup>. Moreover, we found that Ser<sup>1181</sup> is indispensable for the interaction of 14-3-3&#x003b6; with L1, as 14-3-3 failed to bind an S1181A L1ICD mutant in pull-down assays. This finding suggests that Ser<sup>1181</sup> is also crucial for the interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and non-CKII-phosphorylated L1. At present we cannot completely exclude that additional phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated 14-3-3 binding sites exist in the L1ICD. Based on the &#x0201c;gatekeeper phosphorylation&#x0201d; concept <xref rid="pone.0013462-Yaffe2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, one could speculate that high-affinity binding of one monomeric subunit of a 14-3-3&#x003b6; dimer to the RSLESD motif in L1 could be the prerequisite for binding of a second 14-3-3 monomeric subunit to a second, lower-affinity site in L1. However, our mutagenesis data strongly indicate that the RSLESD motif identified in this study is the principal site of interaction with 14-3-3&#x003b6;. Moreover, the &#x0201c;gatekeeper concept&#x0201d; is based on phosphorylation of the primary interaction site, whereas our data show that 14-3-3&#x003b6; also interacts with non-phosphorylated L1.</p><p>As 14-3-3&#x003b6; interacts with nonphosphorylated and CKII-phosphorylated L1ICD, the question arose whether 14-3-3&#x003b6; utilizes the identified binding site (RSLESD) for phosphorylation-dependent and &#x02013;independent interaction with L1. Notably, two previous studies showed that 14-3-3&#x003b6; interacts with phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated Tau protein and that two distinct 14-3-3 binding sites mediate these interactions <xref rid="pone.0013462-Hashiguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Sadik1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Both of these studies also showed that phosphorylation of the Tau protein by PKA increased its affinity for 14-3-3&#x003b6;. In line with this finding, we observed that CKII phosphorylation enhances binding of 14-3-3&#x003b6; to L1ICD. These observations suggest a two-step mechanism for the 14-3-3 &#x02013; L1 interaction: in a first step, 14-3-3 binds to its non-phosphorylated L1 with relatively low affinity. Subsequent serine phosphorylation of L1, e.g. as a consequence of a physiological stimulus, then tightens the 14-3-3 &#x02013; L1 interaction. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 1176 (Tyr<sup>1176</sup>), a residue adjacent to the RSLESD sequence essential for 14-3-3 binding, has been shown to prevent binding of L1 to the AP-2 adaptor protein, thereby blocking L1 endocytosis <xref rid="pone.0013462-Schaefer2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Initial binding of 14-3-3 to L1 prior to CKII phosphorylation might thus also be controlled by the phosphorylation status of Tyr<sup>1176</sup>, which could act as a regulatory signal. However, binding of L1 to CKII-phosphorylated 14-3-3&#x003b6; <italic>in vitro</italic> is not altered in the presence of AP-2 (E.M. Ramser, unpublished observations).</p><p>The above-mentioned study on 14-3-3 - Tau interaction <xref rid="pone.0013462-Hashiguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> showed that association of 14-3-3 with the microtubule binding region of Tau stimulates phosphorylation of serine residues within this region. We thus investigated whether 14-3-3 proteins have a similar effect on CKII-mediated L1 phosphorylation. Notably, phosphorylation of L1ICD at Ser<sup>1181</sup> by CKII was profoundly enhanced by 14-3-3&#x003b6;. One explanation is that L1 phosphorylation is promoted by initial interactions between 14-3-3&#x003b6; and (non-phosphorylated) L1ICD, resulting in L1ICD conformational changes and, consequently, increased susceptibility for CKII phosphorylation. It is known that 14-3-3 behaves like a molecular anvil, deforming its bound ligands while undergoing only minimal structural alterations itself <xref rid="pone.0013462-Yaffe2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. For example, in the case of serotonin N-acetyl transferase, and presumably also exoenzyme S, 14-3-3 binding deforms the catalytic residues, resulting in enhanced substrate binding and product formation <xref rid="pone.0013462-Obsil1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Henriksson1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. For other proteins, 14-3-3-mediated conformational changes might facilitate the interaction with their binding partners, leading for example to enhanced phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0013462-Yaffe2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Another possible explanation for 14-3-3-enhanced phosphorylation of L1 by CKII is that 14-3-3&#x003b6; acts as a scaffolding protein by recruiting CKII to L1ICD. Even though there is no direct evidence at present for an association between 14-3-3&#x003b6; and CKII, other studies have shown that 14-3-3&#x003b6; forms homo- or heterodimers, a prerequisite for acting as a scaffolding protein <xref rid="pone.0013462-Sumioka1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Therefore, further experiments investigating the CKII-catalyzed phosphorylation of L1 in the presence of a 14-3-3&#x003b6; dimer and a dimerization-deficient 14-3-3&#x003b6; mutant could help to further elucidate how the dimeric structure of 14-3-3&#x003b6; may influence L1 phosphorylation. Finally, considering the time course of CKII-mediated L1 phosphorylation in our study, it is plausible to assume that 14-3-3 stabilizes the CKII-phosphorylated form of L1. Dent et al. showed that 14-3-3-bound proteins are resistant to phosphoprotein phosphatases <xref rid="pone.0013462-Dent1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In our case, binding of 14-3-3 to L1 might thus protect pSer1181 from dephosphorylation.</p><p>Nakata and Kamiguchi <xref rid="pone.0013462-Nakata1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> have suggested that CKII regulates endocytotic L1 trafficking in the axonal growth cone via phosphorylation of the L1ICD. Considering our data on L1, 14-3-3&#x003b6; and CKII, 14-3-3&#x003b6; might play a role in controlling L1 sorting and trafficking between endosomes and plasma membranes. We therefore investigated whether L1 and 14-3-3&#x003b6; interact in vesicle fractions from mouse brain. We could show that 14-3-3&#x003b6; associates with L1 in early and late endosome-enriched fractions, which further supports an involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in L1 sorting and trafficking.</p><p>Given the importance of L1 trafficking for neurite extension, we also tested the influence of neuronally expressed 14-3-3&#x003b6; <xref rid="pone.0013462-Baxter1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> on L1-mediated neurite growth. We observed that expression of 14-3-3&#x003b6; K49E in hippocampal neurons led to an increase in neurite elongation on an L1 substrate. Only cells grown on an L1-Fc substrate, but not on Fc responded to 14-3-3&#x003b6; K49E expression, suggesting that 14-3-3&#x003b6; is a specific regulator of L1-dependent neurite extension. This effect depended on the amphipathic groove shared by all 14-3-3 isoforms <xref rid="pone.0013462-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, as the K49E mutant of 14-3-3 worked as a dominant-negative protein promoting L1-triggered neurite outgrowth, presumably by competing with the 14-3-3&#x003b6; wild-type form in the growth cones. The K49E mutation abolishes binding of 14-3-3&#x003b6; to various ligands, as has been shown in several studies <xref rid="pone.0013462-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Ku1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0013462-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. As an alternative approach, it would be possible to knockdown 14-3-3&#x003b6; by RNA interference and test the effect of this knockdown on L1-mediated neurite outgrowth. However, given the high degree of conservation between 14-3-3 isoforms, other isoforms than zeta are likely to compensate for its function in such a situation. We therefore opted for the dominant-negative approach.</p><p>Based on our biochemical data, it is intriguing to speculate that expression of dominant-negative 14-3-3&#x003b6; K49E causes a decrease in L1 phosphorylation by CKII on Ser<sup>1181</sup>. This, in turn, could inhibit targeting of L1 to late endosomes and lysosomes, resulting in an increased amount of L1 molecules on the cell surface. If more L1 molecules are available on the cell surface, this will stimulate the neuron's homophilic response to an L1 substrate, in accordance with our results. In line with such a model, an involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of the subcellular localization of target proteins and the stabilization of targets at the cell surface has been demonstrated by several studies (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0013462-OKelly1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>; see <xref rid="pone.0013462-Mrowiec1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0013462-Morrison1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> for reviews). In this context, one might argue that 14-3-3 could also act on molecules downstream of L1, like the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (p90rsk). p90rsk is bound by 14-3-3, which negatively regulates its activity <xref rid="pone.0013462-Cavet1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. As p90rsk-mediated phosphorylation of L1 appears to be involved in L1-dependent neurite growth <xref rid="pone.0013462-Wong2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, an increased p90rsk activity caused by 14-3-3&#x003b6; K49E expression might also promote neurite extension on L1.</p><p>Summarizing, our study not only characterizes a novel interaction between a neural cell adhesion molecule L1 and the family of 14-3-3 intracellular signaling proteins, but also demonstrates the importance of this interaction for CKII-mediated phosphorylation of L1. Moreover, our cell culture experiments identify 14-3-3&#x003b6; as a putative modulator of L1-dependent neurite growth. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the crucial role L1 plays in nervous system development, regeneration and plasticity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Italian and European Community laws on protection of experimental animals, and the procedures used were approved by the Office of Animal Welfare at the Department of Veterinary Public Health, Nutrition and Food Safety in Rome (permit number: 223).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Constructs and mutagenesis</title><p>pDEST15-14-3-3&#x003b6;, pDEST26-14-3-3&#x003b6;, and pDEST26-14-3-3&#x003b6; K49E were kindly provided by Dr. H.
