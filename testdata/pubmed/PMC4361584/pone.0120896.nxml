Here, we show that the recombinant protein <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> GAPDH (rTcGAPDH) binds single-stranded telomeric DNA. We demonstrate that the binding of GAPDH to telomeric DNA correlates with the balance between oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH). We observed that GAPDH-telomere association and NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH balance changed throughout the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> life cycle. For example, in replicative epimastigote forms of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>, which show similar intracellular concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH, GAPDH binds to telomeric DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> and this binding activity is inhibited by exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, in the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> non-proliferative trypomastigote forms, which show higher NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration, GAPDH was absent from telomeres. In addition, NAD<sup>+</sup> abolishes physical interaction between recombinant GAPDH and synthetic telomere oligonucleotide in a cell free system, mimicking exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup> that reduces GAPDH-telomere interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. We propose that the balance in the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> life cycle homeostatically regulates GAPDH telomere association, suggesting that in trypanosomes redox status locally modulates GAPDH association with telomeric DNA.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Support was provided by FAPESP Nr. 05/00154-1 to MCE, Nr. 2013/07467-1 to MCE and HAA and Nr 11/50631-1 to AMS.

This class of proteins includes multitasking proteins that follow the paradigm of one protein performing multiple functions. In mammalian cells, GAPDH displays distinct membrane, cytosolic and nuclear localization patterns [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and the DNA binding protein of GAPDH was described around 30 years ago [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With respect to its nuclear function, it has been shown that a nuclear form of GAPDH (p38/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) is a key component of the OCA-S complex, which is a transcription cofactor complex that directly stimulates the transcription of the human H2B gene during S-phase [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, it has also been shown that intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratios determine the rate of H2B transcription [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], since, p38/GAPDH (OCA-S) disengaged from the H2B promoter upon redox perturbation [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Nuclear GAPDH is also involved in the regulation of telomere structure in mammalian cells. Partial inhibition of GAPDH expression in mammalian cells by small interference RNA resulted in the rapid shortening of telomeres [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], whereas the overexpression of nuclear GAPDH resulted in the protection of telomeric DNA in response to anti-cancer drugs [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mammalian GAPDH is thought to bind telomeric DNA via its NAD<sup>+</sup> binding site because mutations in this site almost completely abolish GAPDH-telomere interactions [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is a pathogenic protozoan that is the causative agent of Chagas&#x02019; disease, whose infection rates estimated at between 8&#x02013;11 million people [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This protozoan parasite appeared early during the evolution of eukaryotes and exhibits peculiar characteristics such as gene transcription by polycistronic units that are processed by a trans-splicing reaction [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, we first examined whether GAPDH is a multitasking protein in these early divergent eukaryotes and tested its ability to associate with telomeric DNA. In addition, because this parasite is exposed to environmental changes during its life cycle and exhibits flexible metabolic activity, we tested GAPDH-telomeric DNA associations in parasite cells maintained in different cellular redox state. We show that GAPDH-telomere interaction occurs in trypanosomes and that their redox state is related to the level of GAPDH-telomere association in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>. We demonstrate that the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH balance and the ability of GAPDH to associate with telomeric DNA changes during the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> life cycle. Moreover, NAD<sup>+</sup> abolishes physical interaction between recombinant-GAPDH and synthetic telomere-oligonucleotide in a cell-free system, mimicking exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup> that reduces GAPDH-telomere interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, these data suggest that the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH balance may control the association between GAPDH and telomeric DNA in trypanosomes so that telomere maintenance and metabolic control are coupled and occurred early during evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture</title><p>

<italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> GAPDH binds telomeres <italic>in vitro</italic>
</title><p>Trypanosomes are very early divergent eukaryotes; therefore, we can make inferences regarding the ancestral characteristics of eukaryotic cells by studying the biology of these parasites. Because GAPDH is a classical metabolic enzyme, we asked whether other recently described GAPDH functions could be detected in trypanosomes, such as the protection of chromosomal ends via its interactions with telomeric DNA.</p><p>We tested whether the recombinant <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> GAPDH enzyme (X52898) was able to bind to telomeres using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). In these assays, we used a ss oligonucleotide G-rich strand or a ds telomeric DNA both containing six TTAGGG telomeric repeats. rTcGAPDH was able to bind the ss (TTAGGG)<sub>6</sub> oligonucleotide but was unable to bind the double stranded telomeric DNA (<xref rid="pone.0120896.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The results of the super shift assay corroborate the conclusion that the shift shown in <xref rid="pone.0120896.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> was due to the interaction between GAPDH and the ss telomere, since anti-GAPDH serum induced a supershift of the complex (<xref rid="pone.0120896.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and the anti-GAPDH antibody does not bind the ss telomeric oligonucleotide (<xref rid="pone.0120896.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Also, rTcGAPDH-telomeric/oligonucleotide interaction is not through his-tag fused to rTcGAPDH, because it was already demonstrated that his-tag does not associate with telomere sequence TTAGGG [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0120896.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0120896.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Trypanosome GAPDH interacts with telomeric DNA.</title><p>(A) Oligos are labeled ss TTAGGG (ss) or ds TTAGGG (ds), both of which contain six tandem sequence repeat copies.

First, we performed a differential extraction previously established in our lab [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to discriminate between soluble proteins and proteins bound to DNA by treating cells twice with detergent in order to get the soluble fraction. Then, the non-soluble fraction was digested with DNase I twice in order to get the DNA-bound proteins. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0120896.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, GAPDH was present in the soluble fraction as expected and also in the DNA bound proteins fraction. As controls, heat shock protein (hsp70) and histone were used to discriminate between soluble and DNA bound proteins fractions. Because GAPDH was bound to DNA, we then tested whether it was associated with telomeric DNA using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.

Three independent experiments yielded closely estimated figures.

It has already been demonstrated that the parasite has multifunctional proteins [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The evolution of multifunctional proteins may represent a mechanism by which cells expand their genomic repertoire. For an organism that few examples of alternative splicing have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], this course of action could be an effective cellular resource to expand the use of information present in its DNA sequences. As previously shown, in mammalian cells, GAPDH-telomere interactions are involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity because GAPDH protects chromosomal ends from degradation [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>, GAPDH binds single-stranded DNA, and one repeat of the TTAGGG sequence is enough to establish the GAPDH-telomere interaction. Telomeric sequences are exactly the same in mammals and trypanosomes, and therefore trypanosome GAPDH might bind to telomeres through the NAD<sup>+</sup> binding domain of tetrameric GAPDH as demonstrated for mammalian GAPDH [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and suggested by our results. The mechanism by which telomeric structure is protected in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> is poorly understood. Until recently, only the gene encoding for a putative TTAGGG repeat-binding factor (TRF) protein, essential for telomere protection in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was found in the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> genome database. Consequently, a deeply investigation is needed to precisely determine the role of GAPDH in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> telomere protection. Although it has been established that GAPDH is involved in multiple cellular pathways [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the mechanism by which cells regulate its subcellular localization is still under investigation. Also, the mechanism involved in GAPDH cytosolic to nuclear translocation in trypanosomes remains unclear.</p><p>Throughout <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> life cycle, this parasite is exposed to different environmental, shifts in temperature and glucose source, and as a consequence, different life cycle stages support differences in metabolic pathway activation [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio is an important component of the redox state of a cell, which is a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Accordingly, we have shown here that the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio changes during the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> life cycle. Moreover, we have shown that GAPDH associates with telomeric DNA in epimastigotes but not in trypomastigotes by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Analysis of chromatin binding proteins by mass spectrometry also showed GAPDH present in epimastigote, but not in trypomastigote fractions (manuscript in preparation). Because these forms are distinguished by their ability to replicate, it is possible that the telomeric protection is necessary only during the replicative epimastigote stage. To determine whether the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox ratio controlled GAPDH-telomere interactions, we altered the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH balance by treating epimastigote cells with exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup> or NADH. It has previously been demonstrated that addition of exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup> increases the intracellular levels of NAD<sup>+</sup>, indicating that extracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> can cross the intact plasma membrane [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Accordingly, we showed that the addition of exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup> altered the internal balance of NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> cells. Previous reports have indicated that cytosolic and nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox ratios are similar [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, we inferred that the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox ratio we observed while measuring intracellular [NAD<sup>+</sup>] and [NADH] was the nuclear redox state. We also observed that the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio was able to control GAPDH-telomere interactions in epimastigote form of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>, suggesting that GAPDH can sense the redox state, which subsequently controls whether it associates with telomeric DNA. The involvement of NAD<sup>+</sup> in a chromosomal end protection mechanism was also observed in yeast [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our data also suggests that treatment with exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup> trigger translocation of GAPDH to nucleolus. The molecular base of this mechanism might be further investigated, but it has been already showed that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> nucleolus is able to sequester key factors of RNA metabolism in response to transcriptional stress [<xref rid="pone.0120896.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and therefore GAPDH translocation to nucleolus could be a kind of response to redox status alterations.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that throughout its life cycle, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> exhibits different redox states. These states might be involved with the association between GAPDH and telomeres, and this association is most likely involved in the protection of chromosomal ends. Because <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> is constantly exposed to different environmental stressors, it is important to explore the involvement of redox status in the control of physiological functions in this organism, the effects of which are clearly distinct during different stages of growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120896.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>System of differential equations that describes the kinetics of the chemical reactions presented in <xref rid="pone.0120896.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0120896.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120896.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>System of differential equations that describes the kinetics of the chemical reactions presented in <xref rid="pone.0120896.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0120896.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0120896.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Mathematical simulation of association between 1 telomere with tetramer GAPDH.</title><p>Graph that describes the fraction of 1 telomere bound to tetramer GAPDH as a function of the concentration levels of NAD+.
