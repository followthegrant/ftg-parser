Commensal bacteria constitute an important component of resident microbiome and are intricately linked to skin health. Recent studies describe an association between altered skin microbial community and epidemiology of diseases, like psoriasis, atopic dermatitis etc. In this study, we compare the differences in bacterial community of lesional and non-lesional skin of vitiligo subjects. Our study reveals dysbiosis in the diversity of microbial community structure in lesional skin of vitiligo subjects. Although individual specific signature is dominant over the vitiligo-specific microbiota, a clear decrease in taxonomic richness and evenness can be noted in lesional patches. Investigation of community specific correlation networks reveals distinctive pattern of interactions between resident bacterial populations of the two sites (lesional and non-lesional). While Actinobacterial species constitute the central regulatory nodes (w.r.t. degree of interaction) in non-lesional skin, species belonging to Firmicutes dominate on lesional sites. We propose that the changes in taxonomic characteristics of vitiligo lesions, as revealed by our study, could play a crucial role in altering the maintenance and severity of disease. Future studies would elucidate mechanistic relevance of these microbial dynamics that can provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Human skin surface provides favourable microenvironment for a myriad of microbial communities to flourish that constitute cutaneous microbiome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Skin gets colonized by microbes at time of birth whose composition gets altered after subsequent exposure to the environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Host-microbe interactions have been shown to play a key role in human physiology, with commensal microbial population forming an essential component of biological processes like immunity and metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Characterization of cutaneous bacterial populations has revealed a remarkable difference in community composition based on body site sampled, suggesting that localised skin physiology plays a key role in dictating associated bacterial profiles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The resident microbial community, in turn, influences localized responses to injury, infection and autoimmunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Besides having a symbiotic relationship with the tissue where they harbour, microbes are also believed to influence, in part, the course of associated disease. Increasingly various dermatological disorders like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are being linked to changes in the structure of skin microbiome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>Vitiligo is a chronic skin disorder that is characterized as patchy loss of skin pigmentation due to melanocyte death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The inability of melanocytes to repigment lesional skin suggests localised active mechanisms preventing remigration of melanocytes. Exact cause of the disease remains an enigma as mechanisms underlying melanocyte disappearance are still not known. However, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of vitiligo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Autoimmune attack of melanocytes is thought to be a major factor driving skin depigmentation, and existing treatment strategies are therefore focussed on ameliorating excessive immune activity. However, limited success of current treatment strategies poses a question on autoimmune mechanism of melanocyte loss. None of the current hypotheses can thus independently address the clinical and phenotypic progression of disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Vitiligo can be considered as a complex multifactorial syndrome where multiple disorders can result in the same phenotype, i.e. loss of melanocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have also associated alterations in skin physiology with loss of pigmentation in Vitiligo. For instance, lesional keratinocytes have been shown to possess altered growth and functional patterns under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Redox perturbations in the affected regions, with millimolar levels of hydrogen peroxide, have also been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. To understand the association of localized alterations in Vitiligo skin with cutaneous microbiota, we have explored the microbial community profiles of the lesional and non-lesional skin patches of vitiligo subjects using 16S rRNA phylotyping. Our analysis suggests dysbiosis to be associated with vitiligo lesions, with decreased diversity of cutaneous microbiota. Altered network topology is observed between the two microbial communities, indicating a drastic change in community dynamics. Our study is the first attempt to delineate &#x0201c;Vitiligo-specific microbiota&#x0201d; and provides a conceptual framework for understanding relevance of microbe interactions in diseased state that could play a crucial role in determining the pathophysiological state.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Community composition of lesional and non-lesional skin of Vitiligo subjects</title><p>To assess core taxonomic characteristics of lesional and non-lesional skin, we have generated profiles of V1-V2 hypervariable region of 16s rRNA gene from 10 different vitiligo subjects (20 paired sites). Pre-processing of raw sequence data yielded a total of 869,583 high-quality sequences. RDP taxonomic analysis indicated presence of 21 distinct phyla. Rarefaction plot revealed curves that did level off but did not reach an ideal asymptote (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). However, Good&#x02019;s coverage of &#x0003e;97%, indicated reasonable sequencing coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p><p>The bacterial communities in both skin types are dominated by four phyla, with around 85% of sequences assigned to them. These include: Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and are consistent with previous observations of composition of healthy skin microbiota<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, inset). The phylum Actinobacteria, with median abundance of greater than 45%, is observed as the most abundant phylum in both sample classes. Of the 702 unique microbial genera with varying abundance proportions, 173 in non-lesional and 160 in lesional skin are observed to have non-zero median abundance. Greater than one-third of taxonomic assignments belong to eight major genera: Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Propionibacterium, Micrococcus, Kocuria, Acinetobacter, Streptococcus and Paracoccus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Alpha diversity metrices for richness (Chao-1, Fisher), evenness (Simpson) and diversity (Shannon) were calculated for two skin types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). While differences in Shannon and Simpson indices are statistically insignificant, average Chao-1 and Fisher indices indicate higher (p &#x0003c;0.1) species richness in non-lesional samples as compared to their lesional counterparts. The evenness pattern was further analysed by comparing &#x02018;relative contribution&#x02019; values as a metric<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Genera having atleast 1% relative contribution in both lesional and non-lesional samples were identified and sorted (in a descending order) in terms of their relative contributions. Differences between successive relative contribution values were then computed and plotted. Slope of the curve obtained by plotting these successive differences would serve as an indicator of any abundance skew in the population, with a steep slope indicative of presence of one or more dominant genera in the population. Logarithmic trend lines for the two skin types clearly indicate presence of a few dominating genera in non-lesional samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In contrast, lesional skin possesses a fairly even distribution of various genera. To validate the above observations, the number of taxa having at least 0.01%, 0.1%, and 1% relative contributions were calculated in individual sample classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). A sample class having an even distribution of taxa would have a higher number (and percentage) of taxa. In line with the previously indicated trend, results of this analysis also indicate a higher number of taxa in lesional samples at all thresholds.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Core microbiota comparison between lesional and non-lesional skin of vitiligo subjects</title><p>A core skin microbiome of OTUs and RDP abundance data for both skin types was identified. RDP abundance data indicate presence of 23 core genera in non-lesional skin as opposed to 19 in lesional, with 18 genera in common (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2a</xref>). While Methylobacterium constitutes the core genus exclusive to lesional skin, Anaerococcus, Microbacterium, Streptophyta and Nocardiodes constitute core genera exclusive to non-lesional samples. Similar analysis performed using OTU abundance data indicate 14 OTUs as common to both skin types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2b</xref>). Two OTUs belonging to genera Janibacter and Brevundimonas were however observed to be exclusive to non-lesional samples. The OTUs belonging to Enhydrobacter, Paracoccus and Staphylococcus constitute the core genera exclusive to lesional samples.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Vitiligo-specific microbiota analysis</title><p>To stratify lesion specific microbiota, we identified (RDP-derived) microbial taxa having significantly different abundances as mentioned in the methods section. Overall, 39 taxa (21 genera, 9 families, 5 orders and 4 classes) are observed to have a statistically significant difference in their relative abundance between the two skin types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Except for Corynebacterium, all significantly different bacterial genera are observed to have median percentage abundance less than 1%. Amongst the significantly differentiating taxa with a median (%) abundance&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;=1, Corynebacterium (genus) and Corynebacteriaceae (family) are observed to have higher abundance in non-lesional samples, whereas Flavobacteriales (order), Gammaproteobacteria (class) and Flavobacteria (class) have significantly higher abundance in lesional samples.</p><p>Similar analysis on OTU level abundance data resulted in identification of 27 significantly differentiating OTUs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). The OTU corresponding to Propionibacterium (OTU_32), constituting a major proportion of bacterial abundance in both sample classes (&#x0003e;5%), is a significantly differentiating OTU. Interestingly, significance tests on RDP data did not identify Propionibacterium as a significantly differentiating taxon. This observation may be attributed to the resolution of sequences belonging to Propionibacterium into multiple OTUs, signifying multiple species/strains under this genus. Only 9 significantly differentiating OTUs have median (%) abundance greater than 0.1%, suggesting that the key differences between the lesional and non-lesional samples are contributed by sparsely abundant bacteria.</p><p>Differentiating features between the two skin types were also identified using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)-based LefSe approach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Results of this approach (using RDP abundance data) indicate 11 differentiating features at a p-value cut-off of less than or equal to 0.1 for Kruskal-Wallis, and pairwise Wilcoxon test between lesional and non-lesional samples with an absolute LDA score &#x0003e;2. The differentiating taxa obtained were observed to share a noticeable consensus with results obtained through independently performed Wilcoxon signed rank test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Seven taxa, namely, Skermanella, Novosphingobium, Roseomonas, Cellvibrio, Turicibacter, Erysipelotrichaceae and Erysipelotrichales are the common set of differentiating taxa. Given that final graphical representation of significantly differentiating taxa identified using LefSe&#x02019;s LDA approach is based on comparison of the mean abundance values, taxon Skermenalla is depicted as having higher abundance in lesional samples. In contrast, results depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, indicate an opposite trend. This is due to the use of median (%) abundance as the criterion for comparison. LefSe approach was utilized for differential taxa analysis using OTU level abundance data as well. Results of the analysis are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> indicating differentially abundant taxa with an absolute LDA score &#x0003e; 2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>, represents a cladogram highlighting the lineage of the deduced differentiating features.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ordination Analysis of cutaneous microbiome of lesional and non-lesional skin</title><p>To identify patterns of variation across the two skin types, ordination analysis was performed. Clustering of samples is observed according to subjects, rather than disease status, suggesting individual-specific microbiome signatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref>). In 7 out of 10 subjects, greater than 75% of samples belonging to individual subjects are observed to belong to one cluster. Interestingly, the four major clusters (1, 2, 3 and 5) are also observed to contain a majority of samples from similar body locations i.e. Cluster 1: Waist; Cluster 2: Hands; Cluster 3 &#x00026; 5: Legs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3b</xref>). However, there appears to be a lack of pattern as per disease status of samples.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Comparison between lesional and non-lesional bacterial composition using Intra-community network analysis</title><p>To evaluate correlation between individual members of the microbial community and assess associations between them, we performed intra-community network analysis. The resulting networks were analysed for various network properties (nodes, edges, density, diameter etc.,) and centrality measures (degree and betweenness) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Our results show that the correlation network generated using abundance data of non-lesional skin is enriched both in terms of number of nodes as well as edges indicating greater diversity as well as higher number of interactions between various members of the community (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4a,b</xref>). Interestingly, maximum degree in the network of non-lesional samples is observed to be significantly higher than that obtained with lesional samples. The common set of interactions (core-interactions) is observed to be sparse, indicating a drastic change in the community dynamics.</p><p>We further analysed if nodes with higher degree (in either network) share any correlation with respect to their phylogenetic affiliation and phenotypic features like Gram nature, Sporulation, Oxygen requirement and Cell shape. For this purpose, a &#x02018;degree threshold&#x02019; was defined in the following manner. Nodes having a degree that is at-least N% of the highest degree node were considered. The value of N was varied between 60&#x02013;90% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4a,b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a,b</xref> indicate circular layouts of both the networks wherein nodes are sorted and sized based on their degree (larger size for higher degree nodes). While taxa belonging to Actinobacterial lineages predominate the network of non-lesional skin, Firmicutes forms the dominant lineage of high degree nodes in lesional samples. Also, the contribution of taxa belonging to Proteobacterial lineages towards high degree nodes is higher in non-lesional sites as compared to lesional sites. These results maintain a consistent pattern at various degree thresholds. Interestingly, within the phylum Proteobacteria, while the majority of high degree nodes in non-lesional samples belong to class alpha-proteobacteria, the lesional samples were observed to be dominated by beta-proteobacteria and gamma-proteobacteria. Analysis at various phenotypic levels did not indicate any marked differences between pair of sample environments.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Skin forms an important ecosystem by providing conditions for microbial communities to flourish. The structure of cutaneous microbiome is dictated by localized topography of skin and is generally observed to remain relatively stable over time. Symbiotic interactions between the complex microflora and skin shape and modulate the innate immune response of the host<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Maintenance of the right kind of microflora is thus essential for healthy skin. Several studies have indeed catalogued modulation of cuataneous microbiome with allergic and inflammatory skin diseases, like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. It is therefore tempting to speculate that altered interaction between microbiota and host could play a critical role in deciding disease outcome.</p><p>The depigmenting disorder Vitiligo is characterized by loss of epidermal melanocytes in patches. This is coupled with high oxidative stress conditions in the lesional site that alters local skin physiology. Though the clinically unaffected skin appears normal, unpredictable spread of depigmentation indicates substantial instability of peripheral skin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Further, it remains unclear if the modified skin biology and localized immune modulation in lesional patches has any association with the resident microflora. In the current study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of cutaneous microbial community profiles of vitiligo subjects. We observe a trend of decreasing diversity from non-lesional to lesional sites, with not much difference in evenness. This trend is conserved in lesional and non-lesional samples, irrespective of their anatomical environments. We have also identified disease-specific microbial taxa by comparing abundance profiles. We find a positive association of 13 specific OTU&#x02019;s and inverse correlation of 12 OTU&#x02019;s with lesional patches. Interestingly, most of the differentiating OTU&#x02019;s belong to the low abundance taxa. Further, our ordination analysis suggests that individual-specific skin microbiome signatures predominate over disease specific changes, suggesting that the global microbial landscape remains unaltered in lesional skin and there appears to be a lack of pattern as per the disease status.</p><p>Although our initial analysis suggests that the association of microbial taxa with lesional skin in vitiligo is not robust, we have performed network analysis to obtain a heuristic picture of microbial diversity of non-lesional and lesional skin samples from vitiligo subjects. Surprisingly, the microbial communities associated with non-lesional and lesional skin show different network profiles, with higher number of interactions (as indicated by more number of edges) between the different members of bacterial community of non-lesional skin as compared to lesional skin sites. Interestingly, the microbial interaction network of lesional sites is completely different from that of non-lesional sites, which again signifies altered community dynamics at the lesional site. Our correlation network approach has revealed that microbes belonging to Actinobacterial lineages that have the highest degree of interactions in the non-lesional skin network are replaced by microbes belonging to phylum Firmicutes in the network generated using samples from lesional skin sites. Our network analysis thus suggests strong niche-specific co-occurrence patterns with specific hub organisms associated with non-lesional and lesional skin sites.</p><p>Topological differences in skin sites can give rise to microbial changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. We have taken into account this criterion for most of the samplings. However, under rare circumstances where lesional patch was bigger in size, we have obtained samples from different sites. To ensure that site-specific variations do not contribute to the above results, we also performed detailed analysis on paired sites with similar anatomical environment (excluding <italic>X1N1</italic>, <italic>X1N4</italic>, <italic>Y1N1</italic>, <italic>C1N1</italic>, <italic>Z1N1</italic> pairs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Our results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S7 to S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 8 and 9</xref>) suggest that the microbial abundances observed in the subset of samples (15 pairs) from anatomically similar skin sites are similar to that observed during analysis of the whole sample set (20 paired samples).</p><p>In conclusion, our studies indicate differences in microbial community dynamics of the lesional and non-lesional sites of Vitiligo subjects, with greater diversity and higher association between microbial communities of the unaffected site. A key aspect of our study is analysis between matched sites from the same individual. This eliminates likelihood of variations arising from interpersonal differences and adds robustness to the analysis. However, it remains unclear if modulated microbiome reflects a cause or effect of altered skin physiology of the depigmented patches. This is the first study of microbial analysis from vitiliginous subjects and provides insights into the alterations and adaptations of bacterial networks in diseased state. This study is expected to aid in understanding the potential role of microbial community in vitiligo pathophysiology and is of potential therapeutic and diagnostic significance.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Subject recruitment and selection criteria</title><p>The study protocol was approved by Human ethics review committee of CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrated Biology.

Thermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 94&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, annealing at 59&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 50 seconds, and extension at 72&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 45 seconds, with a final extension of 10 minutes at 72&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Purified amplicons were combined in equimolar ratios and emulsion PCR followed by pyrosequencing was carried out using primer A and reagents for 454 GS FLX on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX Plus instrument (Roche) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S6,S7</xref> represents the tabulated summary of MID sequences used for primer designing and primers used for each sample, respectively.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pre-processing of sequencing data</title><p>In-house scripts (designed at TCS Innovation Labs) were employed for segregating and filtering sequence data.
