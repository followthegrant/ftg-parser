As such, endothelial cells comprise, a critical metabolic organ involved in the generation and regulation of multiple physiological and pathological processes such as coagulation, hemostasis of local vascular pressure, inflammation, atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the context of the current model of tumoral dissemination, glycoproteins including cell adhesion molecules are expressed on the apical endothelial membrane, interacting with counter-receptors on circulating cancer cells, facilitating the spread of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Glycoproteins are prominent constituents of biological membranes, and are involved in various biological functions, including immunological protection, enzymatic catalysis, hormonal control, ion transport, structural support, molecular recognition, and cell adhesion. Structurally, glycoproteins are comprised of a peptide backbone, with carbohydrate chains covalently attached to asparagine (<italic>N</italic>-glycan) or serine/threonine (<italic>O</italic>-glycan) residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The immunoglobulin super family of cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs) constitutes a large group of cell surface glycoproteins that are specialized for cell-cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recently, these molecules have been reported to play an important role in pathological processes, including tumor invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In particular, vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on the apical membrane of endothelial cells activated by cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Two isoforms of VCAM-1 have been reported, a full length protein (a) and a smaller version (b) lacking exon 5. Their expression occurs in response to inflammatory mediators and is dependent on the translocation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. VCAM-1 interacts with its integrin counter receptor very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), to mediate the recruitment of leukocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The adhesion of tumor cells to the apical endothelial membrane resembles their interaction with leukocytes when endothelial cells have been activated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNF is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, principally derived from mononuclear phagocytes, that induces transient phenotypic changes in the endothelial cells, transforming their apical membrane from a quiescent non-adhesive to an activated pro-adhesive surface amenable for cell-cell interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>We have previously reported that the tumoral soluble factors (TSF's) with a very low to none TNF content can induce a strong pro-adhesive phenotype similar to the one induced by TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Here we analyzed changes in the content of VCAM-1 in endothelial cells under experimental treatments with TNF or TFS's that led to an increase in tumor cell adhesion. We combined enhanced chemi-luminescent sensitive (ECL) detection with the high resolving power of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE), using these techniques and the aid of tunicamycin were able to identify undescribed isoforms of VCAM-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Tumoral soluble factors (TSF's) secreted by human breast cancer cell lines induced adhesion of U937 myelomae cells to HUVECs</title><p>Using an <italic>in vitro </italic>cell adhesion assay, we found that tumor soluble factors (TSF's) induced an activated phenotype of HUVECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Then, the medium containing TNF or TSF's was removed, and the HUVECs were coincubated for 3 more h with previously radio-labeled U937 cells as was described in methods. Compared to untreated control cells, HUVECs treated with TNF presented a 2.6 fold increase in cell adhesion, while those treated with TSFZR75.30 had a 1.5 induction. The soluble factors secreted by the other breast cancer cell line (TSFMCF-7) did not show any adhesive effects. These results indicate that TSFZR75.30 induced a pro-adhesive phenotype similar to that induced by TNF.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Tumoral soluble factors derived from breast cancer cell line ZR75.30 increase adhesion</bold>.

The results are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. TSFZR75.30 contained four cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, MCP-1) that were present at levels above the maximum measured limit. Nine cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-5, IL-7, IL-9, IP-10, MIP-1&#x003b1;, RANTES) were below the minimum measurable limit, and thirteen were present at low levels within the detectable range, TNF was present in this group. In comparison with the amount used (10 ng/ml), TNF was 50 times less abundant (0.22 ng/ml) in the mixture of TSFZR75.30. Taken together, these results suggest that TSFZR75.30 contain cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that are able to induce a proadhesive phenotype in endothelial cells.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Elements contained (pg/ml) in TSFZR75.30 examined by Bio-Plex array.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="center"><italic>TSFZR75.30</italic></th><th align="center"><italic>Maximum detected</italic></th><th align="center"><italic>Minimum detected</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">IL-2</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;1.3</td><td align="center">21517</td><td align="center">1.3</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-4</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;0.2</td><td align="center">3854</td><td align="center">0.2</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-6</td><td align="center"><bold>&#x0003e;33053</bold></td><td align="center">33053</td><td align="center">2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-8</td><td align="center"><bold>&#x0003e;24800</bold></td><td align="center">24800</td><td align="center">1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-10</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;1.9</td><td align="center">30108</td><td align="center">1.9</td></tr><tr><td align="center">GM-CSF</td><td align="center">354</td><td align="center">10791</td><td align="center">0.6</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IFN&#x003b3;</td><td align="center">112.5</td><td align="center">40543</td><td align="center">2.5</td></tr><tr><td align="center">TNF</td><td align="center">22.5</td><td align="center">70463</td><td align="center">4.3</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-1&#x003b2;</td><td align="center">49.9</td><td align="center">37082</td><td align="center">2.3</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-5</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;2.4</td><td align="center">39452</td><td align="center">2.4</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-7</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;2.7</td><td align="center">44339</td><td align="center">2.7</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-12</td><td align="center">12.5</td><td align="center">41843</td><td align="center">2.5</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-13</td><td align="center">29.5</td><td align="center">33114</td><td align="center">2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-17</td><td align="center">13</td><td align="center">26740</td><td align="center">1.6</td></tr><tr><td align="center">G-CSF</td><td align="center"><bold>&#x0003e;28728</bold></td><td align="center">28728</td><td align="center">1.7</td></tr><tr><td align="center">MCP-1</td><td align="center"><bold>&#x0003e;27978</bold></td><td align="center">27978</td><td align="center">1.7</td></tr><tr><td align="center">MIP-1&#x003b2;</td><td align="center">15.5</td><td align="center">37041</td><td align="center">2.2</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-1r&#x003b1;</td><td align="center">130.5</td><td align="center">42658</td><td align="center">2.6</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-9</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;1.6</td><td align="center">27064</td><td align="center">1.6</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IL-15</td><td align="center">13</td><td align="center">26368</td><td align="center">1.6</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Eotaxin</td><td align="center">8.5</td><td align="center">24294</td><td align="center">1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="center">FGF-basic</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">18355</td><td align="center">1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="center">IP-10</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;4.3</td><td align="center">69784</td><td align="center">4.3</td></tr><tr><td align="center">MIP-1&#x003b1;</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;1.1</td><td align="center">18493</td><td align="center">1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="center">PDGF-BB</td><td align="center">14.5</td><td align="center">32062</td><td align="center">1.9</td></tr><tr><td align="center">RANTES</td><td align="center">&#x0003c;1.5</td><td align="center">24678</td><td align="center">1.5</td></tr><tr><td align="center">VEGF</td><td align="center"><bold>11590.5</bold></td><td align="center">39592</td><td align="center">2.4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>TSFZR75.30 induced the expression of VCAM-1 isoforms in HUVECs that disappeared when the cells were pre-treated with tunicamycin</title><p>VCAM-1 is a classic cell adhesion molecule, with a Mr ~80-110, that is expressed during the inflammatory response and has also been associated with tumoral dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. VCAM-1 is a surface molecule reported to have two isoforms: i) the complete form (a), composed of 739 amino acid residues encoded by nine exons and containing six N-glycosylation sites that are indispensable for protein function during molecular recognition with integrins, and ii) the small form (b), which is composed of 647 residues and results from an alternative splicing event that removes exon 5, eliminating the second N-glycosylation site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The changes in the cellular content of VCAM-1 were evaluated by western blots analysis from total extracts of HUVECs treated with either TNF or TSFZR75.30 for 6 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The content of VCAM-1 in cells treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) and TSFZR75.30 (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) was increased. The two reported isoforms appeared as a tight doublet (VCAM-1a, Mr ~90-95 kDa and VCAM-1b ~80-83 kDa) (lanes 3 and 5). Compared to the control, VCAM-1a isoform increased 41 and 60 fold, while isoform VCAM1b increased 10 and 15 fold. However, when we pre-treated cells for 3 h with tunicamycin (1 &#x003bc;g/ml), an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, only the band corresponding to isoform "a" was visible in TNF-treated HUVECs (lane 4). In the case of treatment with the TSFZR75.30, a new isoform was revealed, with a Mr ~77 kDa, in addition to isoform "a" (lane 6). In both cases isoform "b" was absent. Expression of isoform "a" and the new isoform, labeled as "x", was increased 17 and 15 fold respectively, to the control. It is clear that tunicamycin had a differential effect on the glycosylation state and the content level of VCAM-1 isoforms, leading to the disappearance of isoform "b" and the emergence of a undescribed VCAM-1 isoform in cells treated with TSFZR75.30, labeled here as isoform "x". When we performed a cell adhesion assay similar to the one describe in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, on cell that had been pretreated with tunicamycin (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 3 h. The fold increase in cell adhesion induced by TSFZR75.30 fell from 3.1 &#x000b1; 0.5 to 1.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 in control HUVECs compared to cells pretreated with tunicamycin. These results indicate that 50% of the observed cell adhesion is dependent from N-glycosylations.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of VCAM-1 cell content is increased when HUVECs are treated with TSFZR75.30 and decreased when cells are pre-treated with tunicamycin</bold>.

We have previously reported that HUVECs treated with soluble factors secreted by tumoral cells (TSF's), can adhere U937 cells and that this response is linked to the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and the expression of cell adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Since Jaffe established the methodology for the culture in 1973, HUVECs had been the principal model to the studies of physiological and pathological process involved endothelial cells. For instance, previous studies have investigated functional differences between HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and HDMECs (human dermal microvascular endothelial cells) with respect to, upregulation of adhesion molecules in response to cytokines, stimulation and expression of surface antigens or mechanical properties of leukocytes rolling. However, at the moment does not exist clear functional differences. Histological studies of the expression of adhesion molecules, as such as VCAM-1 in primary vascular tumoral tissue, can serve to compare endothelial models with the behavior of cells <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Our current working hypothesis is that the tumor cells can use adhesion molecules, such as VCAM-1, to interact with and adhere to the endothelial monolayers, essentially emulating leukocytes during the inflammatory reaction. In this work, we compared the increase in adhesive capacity of HUVEC's with the increased expression of different VCAM-1 isoforms.</p><p>A cell adhesion assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was used to compare the pro-adhesive phenotype of HUVECs induced by TSF's. Since different tumor cell lines present variable adhesion to unstimulated endothelial cells, we used the promyelocytic human cell line U937 as a probe of the induction of pro-adhesive phenotype in response to the different TSF's. This assay showed that the factors derived from the cell line ZR75.30 (TSFZR75.30) were as effective as TNF in activating the endothelial phenotype, using the concentration of TSF's in which the percentage of adhesion (1 &#x003bc;g/ml-50%), was the highest and did not have differences statistically significatives, with respect to another concentrations (0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml-38%, 0.25 &#x003bc;g/ml-24%, 0.125 &#x003bc;g/ml-19%, 0.0625 &#x003bc;g/ml-18%). TSF's by other three breast cancer cell lines were prepared and tested in the same cell adhesion assay (T47D, MDA MB 435 and MDA MB 231). Addition of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of TSF's from either induced different fold increase of adhesion: 1.3 &#x000b1; 0, 1.6 &#x000b1; 0.2, 2.2 &#x000b1; 0.1 respectively.</p><p>TNF is recognized as the most important physiological stimulus for the activation of signaling pathways that lead to the translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B into the nucleus, for several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In HUVECs, TNF and TSFZR75.30 both induced the translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B to the nucleus, although the TSF's only stimulated the system by about 50% in comparison with TNF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, the amount of VCAM-1 expressed was slightly higher in TSFZR75.30 treated cells, suggesting that expression of this adhesion molecule could result from the recruitment of other transcription factors activated by the mixture of elements present in the TSF's. The analysis of the mixture of TSFZR75.30 revealed very low levels of TNF, along with an abundance of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 that could be responsible for NF-&#x003ba;B activation.</p><p>The expression of adhesion molecules, such as VCAM-1, in response to chemokines and cytokines is essential in the acute inflammatory response and represents a clear sign of an activated endothelial phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Unidimensional and bidimensional western blots analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] revealed that TSFZR75.30 was able to induce the expression of VCAM-1a (Mr 81 kDa/p<italic>I </italic>5.1) [NCBI access number NP_001069] and VCAM-1b (Mr 71 kDa/p<italic>I </italic>5.0) [NCBI access number NP_542413] in HUVECs in a similar magnitude as TNF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the westerns showed four new isoforms: isoform x in uni-dimensional gels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and isoforms c, d, and e in bi-dimensional gels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Isoforms c, d and e were present both, in cells treated with TNF as well as in those treated with TSFZR75.30, although isoform d was bearly visible in cells treated with TNF. We conclude that TSFZR75.30 promote a stronger expression of all isoforms compared to the induction mediated by TNF. In an attempt to determine if the isoforms contained N-glycosylations, we interfered with the formation of dolicholpyrophosphate <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine, the first step in the synthesis of N-linked glycoproteins, by using tunicamycin. Under this condition, the protein portion of glycoproteins will be synthesized completely devoid of N-glycosylations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. VCAM-1a has six N-glycosylation sites, whereas removal of exon 5 in VCAM-1b eliminates the second of these sites. Proteins lacking N-glycosylation have been reported to have decreased stability in the endoplasmic reticulum and hence, are more easily exported and degraded in the cytoplasm by the proteasome. This is a likely explanation for the decreased cellular content of isoform "a" (40% and 70% decrease with TNF or TSFZR75.30 respectively) and the disappearance of isoform "b" in the presence of tunicamycin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>The isoform "x" (Mr ~75-77 kDa) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), became visible only in the presence of tunicamycin. Considering that one N-glycosylation modification corresponds to an added weight of 3 kDa and that VCAM1a (90-95 kDa) has six N-glycosylation sites, tunicamycin treatment could lead to isoforms that are up to 18 kDa smaller. Hence, isoform "x" could correspond to the full length core protein (9 exons) lacking all N-glycosylation modifications. At this point we cannot discard that the TSFZR75.30 induce altered glycosylation compared to that indicated by TNF. The fact that tunicamycin pretreatment abolished 50% of the cell adhesion induced by TSFZR75.30 indicates that N-glycosylated proteins such as VCAM-1 play an important rol in cell adhesion, other cell adhesion molecules such as E-selectin and ICAM-1 are likely involved in this process.</p><p>We assigned VCAM-1b to the spot with a Mr ~80 kDa/p<italic>I </italic>4.6, the spot with Mr ~83 kDa/p<italic>I </italic>5.1-5.2 we labeled as isoform "c", which could correspond to the core protein of isoform "b", with different pI resulting from differential states of sialo-glycosylation at any of the five remaining N-glycosylation sites. Alternatively, isoform "c" could also result from the loss of exons 2 or 8, leading to a protein with a similar Mr as "b", but with an increase in the density of charge due to the preservation of all the reported glycosylations sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><p>The appearance of isoform "d", which was overexpressed in cells treated with TSFZR75.30, could be of potential clinical use as a biological marker for indicating the abnormal activation of endothelial cells by tumoral factors. Isoform "d" had the lowest molecular weight, which was suggestive of a smaller protein generated by alternative splicing or proteolytic processing. Interestingly when we interfered the process of N-glycosylation, isoform "d" disappeared, and a new isoform "e" (Mr ~77 kDa/p<italic>I </italic>6.0) appeared. The fact that these two isoforms ("d" and "e") have the same apparent Mr suggests that they both correspond to the same core protein. It is likely, that the isoform "x", identified in the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2-B</xref>, corresponds to isoform e, since both were visible only in the presence of tunicamycin. According to the reported exon structure of VCAM-1, we evaluated the possibilities for the expected proteins when exons 2 (92 amino acids), 3 (107 amino acids), or 8 (89 amino acids) were eliminated. The predicted proteins had the following Mr/p<italic>I </italic>values: 68928 kDa/5.13, 66997 kDa/5.14, and 69376 kDa/5.01, indicating that none of them could produce the observed "e" isoform, which had a Mr/p<italic>I </italic>value of ~77 kDa/6.0. This analysis further supports the idea that isoform "e", is encoded by all nine exons but lacks all N-glycosylation modifications. In addition, although we cannot discard other types of posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation that could also explain the differences in pI of the different isoforms, these modifications have not been previously described for VCAM-1. Expression of VCAM-1 isoforms in tumors has not been well studied. In the past half-century, numerous studies have dealt with the effects of TSF's on endothelial cells. These studies have demonstrated that malignant cells produce a host of factors, most notably VEGF, that favor growth and vascular permeability, facilitating the spread of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In addition to cytokines and chemokines, our study also detected significant amounts of VEGF secreted by the breast cancer cell line ZR75.30. The complex mixture of soluble factors secreted by these cells reflects the multifactorial nature of signals emitted by tumor cells that can influence endothelial behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The specific combination of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, observed in the TSF's could serve as a signature to distinguish between tumor cells with different metastatic or invasive potentials in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although it has been known for some time that altered glycosylation patterns of cell surface proteins, in particular increased sialylation, are associated with cancer cell adhesion, mobility, and invasion, only recently the functional significance of these changes has begun to be understood.

Following incubation, the samples and standards were removed by vacuum, and the beads were filter-washed three times with Bio-Plex wash buffer. Afterwards, a 1:50 dilution of biotinylated detection antibody was added to the beads, followed by incubation in the dark on a platform shaker for 30 min. The beads were washed three times and reacted with a 1:100 dilution of streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE) for 10 min. The beads were washed three times as described above, re-suspended in Bio-Plex assay buffer, and analyzed on a Bio-Plex plate reader [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatic tools</title><p>Sequences of VCAM-1 were taken from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with the identification numbers: NP_001069 (VCAM-1a) and NP_542413 (VCAM-1b).
