Intriguingly, dengue virus (DEN), the most prevalent mosquito-borne virus that infects up to 100 million people each year, fuses only in late endosomes, while activation of DEN protein fusogen glycoprotein E is triggered already at pH characteristic for early endosomes. Are there any cofactors that time DEN fusion to virion entry into late endosomes? Here we show that DEN utilizes bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, a lipid specific to late endosomes, as a co-factor for its endosomal acidification-dependent fusion machinery. Effective virus fusion to plasma- and intracellular- membranes, as well as to protein-free liposomes, requires the target membrane to contain anionic lipids such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate and phosphatidylserine. Anionic lipids act downstream of low-pH-dependent fusion stages and promote the advance from the earliest hemifusion intermediates to the fusion pore opening. To reach anionic lipid-enriched late endosomes, DEN travels through acidified early endosomes, but we found that low pH-dependent loss of fusogenic properties of DEN is relatively slow in the presence of anionic lipid-free target membranes. We propose that anionic lipid-dependence of DEN fusion machinery protects it against premature irreversible restructuring and inactivation and ensures viral fusion in late endosomes, where the virus encounters anionic lipids for the first time during entry. Currently there are neither vaccines nor effective therapies for DEN, and the essential role of the newly identified DEN-bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate interactions in viral genome escape from the endosome suggests a novel target for drug design.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Dengue virus infection is a growing public health problem with up to 100 million cases annually, and neither vaccines nor effective therapies are available. To search for the ways of preventing and treating dengue infections we need to better understand their molecular mechanisms. As with many other viruses, dengue virus enters cells by fusion between the viral membrane and the membrane of intracellular vesicles (endosomes). In this work we explored the fusion stage of dengue virus entry in different experimental systems ranging from virus fusion to artificial lipid membranes to fusion inside the cells. While earlier work on dengue virus entry has focused on viral protein that mediates fusion, we found that effective action of this protein requires specific lipid composition of the membrane the virus fuses to. In effect, this lipid dependence allows virus to control intracellular location of the fusion event and, thus, the place of its RNA release by exploiting cell-controlled differences between lipid compositions of different organelles the virus travels through. The essential role of the interactions between dengue virus and its lipid cofactors during viral entry suggests that these interactions may be targeted in drug design.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>With almost half of the world's population at risk for dengue infections, including life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Kyle1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, the lack of vaccines and effective therapies lends urgency to the search for new targets for antiviral drugs.

Acidification of endosomal content triggers a fusogenic restructuring of protein fusogens and fusion in flaviviruses and alvaviruses. DEN E undergoes a major conformational change that starts with the dissociation of the homodimeric form of E.

E monomers interact with the target membrane via their hydrophobic fusion loops and assemble into homotrimers that bridge the viral and target membranes. Subsequent refolding of the E trimer into its final hairpin structure, with the transmembrane domains and fusion loops at the same end of the rodlike molecules, bends the target and viral membranes towards each other and primes them for fusion <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Kielian1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1001131-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Several observations have suggested that DEN fusion, in addition to low pH dependence, may involve as-yet-unidentified cofactors.

Furthermore, during viral entry into mammalian cells most DEN particles fuse only when they get to late endosomes/lysosomes <xref rid="ppat.1001131-vanderSchaar1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1001131-Panyasrivanit1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and, thus, they neither fuse nor become inactivated in early endosomes, which are expected to have pH low enough to trigger conformational changes in DEN E and induce DEN-mediated fusion between mosquito cells <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Guirakhoo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We suggested that in analogy to alphavirus fusion dependence on lipid cofactors (namely, cholesterol and sphyngomyelin) <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Kielian2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1001131-Umashankar1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, the apparent differences in fusogenic properties of DEN towards different target membranes may reflect differences in their lipid composition. In contrast to the outer leaflets of plasma membranes of mammalian cells and to the inner leaflets of membranes of early endosomes, the outer leaflets of the plasma membranes of mosquito cells and the membranes of late endosomes of mammalian cells have high concentrations of the anionic lipids (AL) phosphatidylserine (PS) <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Coil1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, respectively.</p><p>In this work, we explored the dependence of fusion of DEN, serotype 2, strain TH-36 (below referred to as &#x0201c;DEN&#x0201d;) on the lipid composition of the target membranes and found this fusion reaction to require the presence of AL. Liposomal, plasma, and intracellular membranes that did not support DEN fusion became fusion-competent upon addition of AL such as BMP and PS. The discovered dependence on AL was also observed for dengue virus serotype 2, strain New Guinea C and for dengue virus, serotype 4, strain H241. AL acted downstream of low pH-dependent stages of DEN fusion and promoted an advance of the fusion process beyond the earliest hemifusion intermediates. Endocytosed viral particles are acidified, and thus the restructuring of DEN E towards its fusogenic conformations is expected to be triggered before DEN comes into contact with the AL-containing membranes of late endosomes. For many viruses, including influenza virus <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Stegmann1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and SIN <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Smit1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, premature activation of the viral fusion machinery by an acidic medium in the absence of a target membrane results in a quick inactivation of the machinery. In contrast, we found that DEN particles treated with a low-pH medium in the presence of AL-free target membranes retain their fusogenic properties for a relatively long time (&#x0003e;30 min). This unusually slow inactivation may explain the preservation of fusogenic properties of DEN for the duration of viral trafficking from early to late endosomes. We propose that the AL dependence and the delayed inactivation of the fusion machinery of DEN play an important role in defining the timing and location of the fusion stage of viral entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DEN does not fuse plasma membranes of mammalian cells</title><p>The fusogenic activity of diverse enveloped viruses is often characterized by measuring fusion between adjacent cells that is mediated by viral particles associated with the cell surface either through non-specific binding or through virus&#x02013;receptor docking.

Syncytium formation involves both the fusogen-dependent opening of fusion pores and their cell-machinery-dependent expansion, yielding a cell-size lumen <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We found that the absence of DEN-induced syncytia for mammalian cells reflects the inability of DEN to form fusion pores large enough to pass GFP and mRedFP, as evidenced by the lack of double-labeled cells (shown for Vero cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001131-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p>In parallel experiments, we contrasted the fusogenic activity of DEN with the well-characterized fusogenic activity of SIN, a virus that utilizes similar fusion machinery <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Kielian1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

To evaluate the binding (including non-specific receptor-independent binding), we incubated Vero cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001131-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>) or CHO-K1 cells (not shown) with mildly biotinylated DEN or SIN particles, applied fluorescence-tagged streptavidin, and then carried out flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001131-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). We found virus&#x02013;cell binding for DEN to be somewhat higher than for SIN, the virus that effectively fuses the cells indicating that cell fusion for DEN is blocked downstream of cell-surface binding.</p><p>This conclusion was further substantiated by comparing DEN binding to C6/36 cells that were readily fusable by the virus with DEN binding to mammalian cells (MA104 cells) that did not fuse in the presence of DEN. In these experiments, we blocked internalization of DEN virions labeled with a fluorescent lipid DiD by low temperature (10&#x000b0;C) and quantified viral binding by measuring DiD fluorescence associated with the cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001131.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). To take into account the very different sizes of C6/36 and MA104 cells, we normalized the amount of DiD fluorescence associated with the plasma membrane of the cells to the fluorescence of membrane probe NBD-tagged phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PC). This normalization is based on the assumption that NBD-PC similarly partitions into the outer leaflets of plasma membrane bilayers of C6/36 and MA104 cells and, thus, the cell-associated NBD fluorescence is proportional to the total area of plasma membranes. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1001131.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, under the conditions of our cell-to-cell fusion experiments on C6/36 cells and on MA104 cells, the ratios of DiD- and NBD- fluorescences, and thus the surface densities of DEN virions at plasma membrane, were very close. This finding argues against the hypothesis that DEN fuses C6/36 cells but does not fuse mammalian cells because of a large difference in the amounts of cell-bound virions.</p><p>To summarize, while DEN binds to and effectively infects both mosquito and mammalian cells, in our experiments it fused mosquito but not mammalian cells. The inability of DEN to fuse the plasma membranes of the virus-permissive mammalian cells indicated that the fusogenic activity of DEN depends on the target membrane.

We found the application of this fusion-infection assay (FIA) to DEN and mammalian cells (MA104, Vero and BHK21) to require a very high concentration of virions: 300 infectious units/cell (at least 10 times higher than the number of infectious viral particles per cell we had to use in FIA for mosquito C6/36 cells, data not shown). In this setting, FIA, while indirect, may be a very sensitive assay for fusion since fusion of a single virion out of hundreds may result in infection. As for DEN-mediated cell-to-cell fusion, the anionic lipids (PS or PG)-supplemented MA104 cells demonstrated much higher (15-fold) levels of fusion in FIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001131-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

When cells with pre-bound DEN were treated with AL (5-min, 4&#x000b0;C) before warming up to 37&#x000b0;C, we observed a dramatic increase in the average cell fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001131-g004">Fig. 4A,B</xref>).

Some dependencies are conserved among fusion processes driven by very diverse fusogens <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Chernomordik1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In contrast, the essential role of AL for DEN fusion is not conserved even within the same class (II) of viral protein fusogens. In spite of similarities between the structures of the fusogens utilized, another flavivirus, TBE, and alphaviruses such as SIN effectively fuse with AL-free target membranes <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Corver1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1001131-Fritz1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.

To start with, the local pH near a membrane containing AL is lower than the pH in the bulk of the solution because of the accumulation of protons near the negatively charged lipid headgroups. The changes in ion concentration at a charged surface are described by the Gouy-Chapman theory that yields the relation between the surface charge density, the electrostatic potential, the ionic strength of the solution and ion distributions near charged membranes <xref rid="ppat.1001131-McLaughlin1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. An estimate based on the Gouy Chapman theory suggests that for a bilayer containing 30 mol&#x00025; AL in 100 mM NaCl buffer, the apparent pH dependence of fusion may be shifted to a less acidic pH by up to 0.7 units. However, while DEN fusion with liposomes containing 30 mol&#x00025; PS was already observed at pH 6.8, there was almost no lipid mixing for AL-free PC liposomes even at pH 4.5 (not shown). Thus, the AL-induced shift of local pH does not fully explain the role of AL as a prerequisite for DEN fusion. Note that pH dependences of fusion observed for dengue virus in different assays somewhat differ (see for instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001131-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001131-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). These differences likely reflect different numbers of activated fusion proteins required to reach detectable fusion stages for different target membranes.</p><p>In the fusion pathway mediated by several viruses, RH is followed by more-energy intensive stages that culminate in opening of an expanding fusion pore <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Chernomordik1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Zaitseva1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. While DEN forms the RH intermediates in the absence of AL, the later stages of DEN fusion require interactions between E protein and AL.

For many viruses, including DEN, which utilize low pH-dependent fusogen proteins, these proteins are synthesized in an inactive form and then are converted to a mature fusion-competent form by proteolytic cleavage of the fusogen itself or an accessory protein <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Harrison1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1001131-Mukhopadhyay1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Weissenhorn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, viral fusogens such as DEN E that can be activated at pH values close to neutral may need additional mechanisms for avoiding premature release of the conformational energy stored in the proteins. Our finding that DEN neither fuses nor rapidly inactivates in the absence of AL-containing target membranes suggests that AL dependence of DEN prevents functional inactivation of the virus until it reaches AL-enriched late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1001131-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). RH connections provide an additional receptor-independent docking mechanism that holds viral and endosomal membranes in tight contact. Within multivesicular endosomes, the virus can fuse either to the limiting membrane or to the internal vesicles that contain the highest concentration of AL BMP <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In the latter case, viral RNA release requires an additional fusion event: BMP-dependent but likely DEN E-independent back-fusion between the internal vesicle and the limiting membrane. Back-fusion has been proposed as a mechanism for endosome-to-cytosol transport of RNA of vesicular stomatatis virus (<xref rid="ppat.1001131-LeBlanc1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, but see <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Johannsdottir1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>).</p><p>Our work concentrates on fusion mediated by DEN serotype 2, strain TH-36.

Future research will clarify the applicability of the AL-dependent mechanism of timing viral fusion to the entry into late endosomes for different serotypes/strains of DEN.</p><p>To summarize, the AL dependence of DEN fusion identified in our work suggests a novel mechanism allowing viruses to exploit cell-controlled changes in membrane lipid composition. In this mechanism, internalized virus uses the specific lipid composition of late endosomes highly enriched in AL as a way of timing fusion to deliver viral RNA to its translation-replication sites effectively. We hope the assays developed in this study to directly characterize DEN fusion will help in developing antivirals including those targeting DEN-AL interactions to block or prematurely activate DEN E refolding. Furthermore, interactions between DEN E and AL may have implications for the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is characterized by activation of endothelial cells and extracellular exposure of PS.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells</title><p>Vero, MA104, BHK21, BS-C-1, CHO-K1, RAW 264.7, U967, and NIH3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA), and HAb2 cells (a kind gift of Dr. Judith White, University of Virginia), a line of NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing A/Japan/305/57 influenza hemagglutinin (HA) in the immature fusion-incompetent HA0 form <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Doxsey1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> were grown in Advanced DMEM medium (ADMEM) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM glutamine, and antibiotics (complete medium) at 37&#x000b0;C and 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>. <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in the complete medium at 28&#x000b0;C and 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.

After removal of unbound virions, we incubated the cells with 50 &#x000b5;g/ml recombinant annexin V (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) for 30 min at 10&#x000b0;C, washed the cells from unbound annexin, and then triggered fusion by applying an acidic pH medium. We verified that annexin V treatment had no effect on virus&#x02013;cell binding using DiD-labeled virions.</p><p>To compare PS expression at the surfaces of different cells, we used R-phycoerythrin -tagged annexin V (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), as recommended by the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec id="s4n"><title>Lysosomotropic agents</title><p>In some experiments on intracellular fusion, to block endosomal acidification we treated the cells with the lysosomotropic agents chloroquine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; 50 &#x000b5;M, 30 min, 37&#x000b0;C) or bafilomycin-A1 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; 2 &#x000b5;M, 30 min, 37&#x000b0;C) prior to applying viral inoculum.</p></sec><sec id="s4o"><title>Dominant-negative Rab7</title><p>Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with a EGFP-Rab7a S22N plasmid <xref rid="ppat.1001131-Naslavsky1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, a kind gift from Julie Donaldson, NIH, on Lab-tek II 4-well chambered coverglass (Nalge Nunc). 18 hours later, DiD-labeled viral particles were allowed to bind to the cell surfaces at 10&#x000b0;C for 60 min.
