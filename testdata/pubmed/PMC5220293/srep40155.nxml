MN excitability is modulated by cholinergic inputs through C-type synaptic boutons, which display an endoplasmic reticulum-related subsurface cistern (SSC) adjacent to the postsynaptic membrane. Besides cholinergic molecules, a constellation of proteins involved in different signal-transduction pathways are clustered at C-type synaptic sites (M2 muscarinic receptors, Kv2.1 potassium channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated K<sup>+</sup> [SK] channels, and sigma-1 receptors [S1R]), but their collective functional significance so far remains unknown. We have previously suggested that neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/ErbBs-based retrograde signalling occurs at this synapse. To better understand signalling through C-boutons, we performed an analysis of the distribution of C-bouton-associated signalling proteins. We show that within SSC, S1R, Kv2.1 and NRG1 are clustered in highly specific, non-overlapping, microdomains, whereas ErbB2 and ErbB4 are present in the adjacent presynaptic compartment. This organization may define highly ordered and spatially restricted sites for different signal-transduction pathways. SSC associated proteins are disrupted in axotomised MNs together with the activation of microglia, which display a positive chemotactism to C-bouton sites. This indicates that C-bouton associated molecules are also involved in neuroinflammatory signalling in diseased MNs, emerging as new potential therapeutic targets.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Skeletal muscle contractions mediating motor behaviour involves the coordinated activity of distinct brain stem and spinal cord motor neuron (MN) populations. The firing rates of individual MNs results from the integration of a variety of excitatory and inhibitory MN synaptic inputs, which involve a range of different neurotransmitter systems. During rhythmic motor behaviour (e. g. locomotion), the highly organized pattern of MN activity is modulated by cholinergic inputs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. These are delivered through C-type synaptic boutons originating from spinal interneurons. C-boutons are intriguing synaptic structures that are present in &#x003b1;- (but not in &#x003b3;-) MNs, and that were first morphologically identified over 45 years ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. C-boutons are unusually large nerve terminals (3&#x02013;5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m long) which contain a high number of densely packed, round clear synaptic vesicles. In the postsynaptic region, C-terminals display a unique structure, consisting of a subsurface cistern (SSC) immediately adjacent (at 10&#x02013;20&#x02009;nm distance) to the MN membrane, and associated with a stack of underlying lamellae of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). There has recently been increased interest in C-boutons. After recognizing the cholinergic phenotype of C-boutons and their association with M2 muscarinic receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, other molecular aspects of these synapses, such as the expression of: voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels Kv2.1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP-2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and sigma-1 receptors (S1Rs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, have been described. The gap junction protein connexin 32 has also been localized postsynaptically at the SSC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The neuronal origin of C-bouton inputs was recently identified as a small cluster of cholinergic interneurons (VOc interneurons) located near the central canal of the spinal cord, which modulate MN activity during locomotor behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Metabotropic M2 transmission in C-type synapses may inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels, reducing the spike afterhyperpolarization, instead of after hyperpolarization and enhancing MN firing frequency through a local intermediary effect of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>The neuregulin-1 (NRG1) family includes more than 15 membrane-associated and secreted growth factors generated by alternative RNA splicing that interact with ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases. All NRG1 isoforms share an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like signalling domain, and control many aspects of development. In the nervous system, the most abundant forms of NRG1 are types I and III. These, have been detected in MNs, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and, in particular in glia. NRG1 is involved in glia-axon interactions (myelination), the development of motor endplates, neuronal migration, synaptogenesis and plasticity in the CNS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. NRG1 is also involved in psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In a study examining the expression of NRG1 in phrenic spinal cord MNs, it was reported that this trophic protein is expressed in nearly all cholinergic nerve terminals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>; however, its precise subcellular localization was not addressed by these investigators. We have recently examined this issue and found that NRG1 is associated with C-boutons, concentrated in postsynaptic sites within the ER at the SSC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. We have also demonstrated that ErbB2 and ErbB4 receptors are present in the presynaptic compartment, suggesting that NRG1 acts as a retrograde signalling molecule in C-type synapses. C-boutons are scarcely investigated structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, which have been reported to suffer plastic changes in sick MNs after spinal cord injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, peripheral nerve lesion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In addition, mutations in S1R are considered risk factors for familial ALS, and abnormal accumulations of this protein in C-terminals have also been observed in patients with sporadic ALS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Altered SSCs also appear to be present in ALS-linked mutations of vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB, ALS8), which is abnormally targeted to C boutons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p><p>The relevance of the NRG1/ErbB pathway in MN diseases has been further underlined by the discovery of a new type of familial ALS caused by a loss of function mutation of ErbB4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, and by the reported neuroprotective effects of NRG1 supplementation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and/or altered NRG1 expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> in ALS mice. MNs in oculomotor nuclei, which are spared in ALS, lack both C-boutons and SSC-associated NRG1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>Thus, at C-type synaptic sites, in addition to the presence of cholinergic molecules, a constellation of proteins involved in different signal-transduction pathways are specifically clustered, although their functional significance remains largely unknown. In order to better understand synaptic signalling though C-boutons, we undertook a structural analysis of the spatial organization of distinct C-bouton-associated signalling proteins, and especially the NRG1-ErbBs module, in different MN populations. We also examined changes in NRG1-ErbB expression during development and following peripheral nerve injury.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ultrastructure of C-bouton synapse in mouse spinal cord MNs</title><p>C-boutons can be morphologically distinguished from other afferent synaptic terminals contacting MN soma or dendrites in the spinal cord ventral horn. The C-bouton presynaptic element contains spherical and electron lucent synaptic vesicles, some endosome-like bodies and mitochondria. In the postsynaptic compartment, and in close apposition with the postsynaptic membrane, the ER-related SSC is the main structural hallmark of C-boutons. The distance between the SSC and postsynaptic membrane is about 10&#x02013;15&#x02009;nm. C-boutons with large SSCs were also observed in MNs of newborn (P1) animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref>). Our observations are consistent with the classical description of C-boutons in cat spinal cord<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The NRG1-ErbB module is found in C-boutons and is differentially compartmentalised with other signalling proteins</title><p>Using several specific antibodies we analysed the precise distribution of several proteins that are known to be clustered at the C-type synapse. C-bouton sites were identified by labelling presynaptic terminals with vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>). In close association with VAChT-positive spots, we confirmed the presence of NRG1, M2-type muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M2 AChRs), S1Rs, the Kv2.1 delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel (Kv2.1), and the postsynaptic SK channel SK3. All of these were present in oval patches distributed throughout the soma and in proximal dendrites of large spinal cord MNs, representing the postsynaptic compartment of C-bouton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref>). In agreement with our previous work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, non-cholinergic (i.e. glutamatergic, serotoninergic and GABAergic) afferent synapses on MNs did not express the particular assembly of postsynaptic molecules seen in cholinergic terminals (not shown). In addition, ultrastructural immunolabelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>) followed by the stereological analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> of gold nanoparticles distribution confirmed that, within C-bouton, NRG1 was accumulated postsynaptically in the SSC (for total Chi-square&#x02009;=&#x02009;19,337.8 and df&#x02009;=&#x02009;4, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, there is a preferential labelling in SSC, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20 C-bouton synapses; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p>C-bouton-associated protein molecules were assembled in a highly ordered manner and segregated into specific microdomains. This was clearly shown after confocal imaging of multi-labelled C-boutons using the highest resolution settings. Our results complement those reported by Deardorff <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Postsynaptic sites enriched in M2 cholinergic receptors were precisely aligned with the strongest signal for VAChT, indicating the areas with the maximum concentration of cholinergic vesicles at the presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a&#x02013;f</xref>). The areas most enriched in NRG1 were intercalated with microdomains displaying the maximal intensity for Kv2.1 or S1R immunolabelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g&#x02013;p</xref>). In orthogonal projections of C-boutons, the S1R signal was usually detected in the form of a central saccule-like structure surrounded by smaller NRG1-containing spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g&#x02013;i</xref>). In addition, in some MNs, Kv2.1 immunoreactivity formed an additional bell-like line, externally surrounding the whole C-bouton area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2q&#x02013;s</xref>). This is in agreement with observations made in hippocampal neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The segregated localization of NRG1 and Kv2.1 in C-type synapses was further assessed after double immunolabelling. This analysis suggested that Kv2.1 subunits were located both in the postsynaptic membrane and in the SSC, although they were clustered in separate domains than NRG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2p</xref>). SK3 channel protein was also clustered in C-boutons from some, but not all, MNs; these, probably correspond to MNs innervating slow-twitch muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In our samples, SK3 and Kv2.1 potassium channels appear to be localized in separate domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2t&#x02013;y</xref>). All these results indicate that the postsynaptic machinery at C-boutons contains a unique mosaic of proteins that are spatially arranged in highly ordered, interdigitated, non-overlapping, microclusters. Using double immunogold labelling, the regions within the SSC enriched in NRG1 and S1R were clearly segregated; most of the particles were located at the SSC membrane. A minor proportion (9.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.59%, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14 synapses) of nanogold particles were seen associated with the postsynaptic membrane, suggesting that NRG1 may have been translocated from the SSC to the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;c</xref>). Double immunogold labelling was also applied to identify NRG1 in conjunction with Kv2.1; results confirmed that both proteins reside postsynaptically in separate regions, with Kv2.1 located at the periphery of clustered NRG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). These data extend previous observations on the ultrastructural localization of Kv2.1 channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. To improve C-bouton sampling in ultrathin cryosections, all these double labelling experiments were performed in hypoglossal MNs, as these are more densely packed than ventral horn MNs. We have already described that both morphological and immunocytochemical properties of C-boutons in hypoglossal MNs are virtually identical to those in spinal cord<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>By using several anti-ErbB2 or ErbB4 antibodies, positive immunolabelling in the presynaptic compartment of C-boutons was unambiguously observed in contrast to the postsynaptic localisation of NRG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>). Although this immunoreaction was sometimes faint and imprecise, it became more prominent when phosphospecific antibodies were used and, in particular, after performing tyramide signal amplification (TSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d&#x02013;f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The immunostaining obtained with the anti-phosphorylated ErbB2 or ErbB4 antibodies overlapped the presynaptic VAChT positivity in most, although not all, C-boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). However, unphosphorylated ErbB2 and ErbB3 were not detected in association with VAChT-positive puncta. The plot profile and co-localization analysis showed a high degree of coincidence between phospho-ErbB2 and VAChT signals (Pearson&#x02019;s R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4i,j</xref>). By contrast, the same analysis confined NRG1 to the postsynaptic compartment, and as being clearly distinct from the VAChT signal (Pearson&#x02019;s R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.33, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g,h</xref>). The intensity of ErbB immunoreactivity varied among the individual cholinergic terminals, ranging from negative or very weak to intense. In addition to the synaptic immunolabelling, ErbB2 and ErbB4 were also detected in MN cell bodies and neuropil, particularly when TSA was used. The association between either NRG1 or p-ErbB2 with VAChT immunolabelled C-boutons can be further appreciated after volume rendering imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4k,l</xref>).</p><p>This overall spatial distribution of C-bouton-associated proteins is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5(a,b)</xref>, based on a model that we proposed after examining 3D reconstructions of multi-labelled C-bouton synapses.</p><p>The total number of C-boutons per MN soma was calculated from 3D reconstructed squash preparations of thick (200&#x02009;&#x003bc;m) spinal cord slices from adult mice. After analysing 14 MNs, we found an average of 3.11&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.30 (in 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> of MN soma surface; C-type synapses were visualized by VAChT immunostaining). Similar numbers were found after evaluating clustered NRG1-positive particles (3.60&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.29/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> of MN soma surface) and synaptically-associated SR1-positive spots (2.92&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.28/100&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>). The average size of the synaptic area containing the distinct C-bouton markers was as follows: VAChT&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.87&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.25, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;184; NRG1&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.41&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.20 n&#x02009;=&#x02009;203; SR1&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.30&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.20, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;153 (all in &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>; with n corresponding to the number of C-bouton examined). We further determined whether these morphometric parameters differed when the analysis was specifically performed in MN subtypes innervating fast or slow muscles. MN pools were identified after retrograde tracing by injecting fluorescent cholera toxin B into either tibialis anterior (TA) or soleus muscles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The results indicated that NRG1-positive puncta were more abundant, although smaller, in fast type TA-innervating MNs than in slow type MNs contacting the soleus muscle.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Development of C-bouton-associated NRG1</title><p>Developmental changes in C-bouton associated proteins such, as Kv2.1 and M2 AChRs occur postnatally, together with the functional maturation of the motor system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. We analysed the developmental expression of NRG1 in the spinal cord in relation to the other C-bouton associated molecules, such as VAChT and SR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a&#x02013;f</xref>). Small (&#x0003c;1&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>), but abundant, NRG1 positive discrete puncta were detected prenatally at E18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). Many of these particles did not show any association with VAChT-positive presynaptic terminals. In addition, at this stage, large patches of NRG1 (&#x0003e;3&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>) were often seen adjacent to the MN surface, although they were not related to VAChT-labelled nerve terminals. These NRG1 clusters, underwent a conspicuous remodelling becoming virtually absent from P1 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c,e</xref>). During the postnatal period, the size of the NRG1 clusters increased progressively, reaching a plateau at P18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b,f</xref>). At this age, virtually all of the NRG1 clusters were associated with presynaptic cholinergic terminals. In agreement with Mavlyutov <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, C-bouton-associated S1R immunoreactivity began only after the second week of postnatal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). In the spinal cord MNs of aged mice, the density and size of the C-bouton presynaptic terminals were markedly reduced, whereas this did not occur for the postsynaptic proteins NRG1 and S1R.</p><p>In order to analyse NRG1 and C-bouton synapse formation in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model, we performed long-term cultures of dissociated spinal cord neurons. We assumed that the presence of a mixed neuronal population would be necessary to develop C-bouton-like cholinergic afferents and that the presence of glial cells would provide trophic support for promoting long-term MN survival and differentiation. In these cultures, highly branched and large MNs were identified after immunostaining with either SMI32 or anti-ChAT antibodies following 14&#x02013;28 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). These MNs exhibited neurite outgrowth over long distances and formed an interconnected network with abundant neuritic-neuritic and neuritic-somatic junctures, which displayed the synaptic marker synaptophysin (Syn) and appeared distributed in discrete puncta. Many of these were glutamatergic boutons because they also contained VGluT1 or VGluT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d&#x02013;f</xref>). Very few MNs showed VAChT-positive axo-somatic or axo-dendritic synaptic contacts adjacent to spots containing NRG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g,h</xref>). By contrast, a variable number of spots with a prominent NRG1 signal was observed in many MNs without any association with the presynaptic nerve terminal markers Syn and VAChT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7i&#x02013;j</xref>). These non-synaptic associated NRG1 patches were often in close proximity to GFAP-positive astroglial processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>).

In spinal cord sections, the pool of axotomised MNs was readily identifiable after IBA1 immunostaining due to the notable and early recruitment of microglia around lesioned MN somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b&#x02013;f</xref>, a progressive and transient disintegration of NRG1 clusters occurred in axotomised MNs associated with perisomatic microglial activation starting 24&#x02009;h after nerve injury. Although the reduction in size of NRG1 immunoreactive profiles reached its maximum 14 days following axotomy, the density of individual clusters was only slightly changed. By 30 days post-lesion, the size of the NRG1 profiles found in basal conditions showed a recovery, reaching similar values to controls. Correlative ultrastructural alterations have been reported in the SSC of axotomised MNs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. The size of the VAChT immunoreactive profiles present in the presynaptic compartment of afferent nerve terminals contacting axotomised MNs showed changes similar to those found for NRG1 (area of VAChT-delimitated C-bouton in &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>: control&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.80&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.20 [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;184], 14 days post-axotomy&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.08&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.14 [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;114], and 30 days post-axotomy&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.45&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.32 [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;153]; control <italic>vs.</italic> 14 days post-axotomy, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001; control <italic>vs.</italic> 30 days post-axotomy, non-significant; Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). By contrast, the number of VAChT positive terminals declined more markedly (&#x0003e;45%, 7 days after axotomy) than that of NRG1 clusters (number of VAChT positive profiles per 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>: control&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.19&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.3 [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14], 7 days post-axotomy&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.46&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.16 [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10]; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test). We observed that during microglial recruitment and activation around axotomised MNs, C-bouton sites exerted an apparent chemoattractant-like effect on microglial profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figs 8b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">9a&#x02013;c</xref>). When the proportion of distinct types of presynaptic terminals contacted by microglial profiles was measured in MN somata 7 days after axotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9d&#x02013;g</xref>), we found that more than 50% of VAChT-positive or VGluT1-positive terminals were intimately associated with microglial processes, whereas a much lower proportion of microglial profiles were in contact with GABAergic or serotoninergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9h</xref>); data concerning the relative density of the distinct types of afferents do not account for these differences (not shown). In addition to motor axons, peripheral nerve injury leads to the interruption of the sensory proprioceptive axons that establish monosynaptic VGluT1-positive afferent connections with MNs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. It would not be surprising if there were an association between microglia with degenerating and presumably chemoattractant VGluT1-containing terminals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Nevertheless, the C-bouton spatial specificity as a target for microglial migration is less expected, because the interneurons, from which these terminals originate, are not directly damaged by axotomy. This apparent chemotactic activity is probably related to the complex arrangement of molecules and signal-transduction pathways inherent to C-boutons. This may represent an early event in the inflammatory response to injured MNs that could contribute to the generation of a perisynaptic environment that could play a role in determining MN survival or degeneration. Further work is necessary to determine the molecular cues that attract microglial processes to C-type synapses following nerve injury.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>With the emergence of new data about the C-bouton structure and function, and its possible relevance to MN pathology, there has been considerable recent interest in this type of synapses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Here, we extend our previous report showing that the NRG1-ErbB2/3 signalling module is expressed at C-boutons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, by providing a more detailed analysis of the compartmentation of these molecules and their relation with other proteins that are known to be specifically clustered at this synaptic site. The SSC, the ER-related organelle that anatomically defines C-boutons, is the site at which some of these proteins accumulate. This is the case of SR1, Kv2.1 and NRG1. In addition, we show that, within the SSC, these proteins reside in segregated regions that probably represent distinct, highly specific spatial domains. This may define spatially-restricted fields for different signal-transduction pathways in the post-synaptic compartment, which are specifically arranged in relation to presynaptic proteins. This would be consistent with the emerging concept of &#x0201c;trans-synaptic nanocolumns&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. One so far unsolved question that deserves further attention is whether SSC-resident proteins can translocate and/or interact with the post-synaptic membrane, as appears to be the case for Kv2.1 and SR1. Kv2.1 is a major component of delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels which are involved in the modulation of neuronal excitability in various neuronal types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. In agreement with our findings, Kv2.1 channels have sometimes been identified in the most peripheral region of the SSC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. These data indicate that Kv2.1 clusters are strategically situated at specific somatic synapses in conjunction with other signalling proteins including S1R and NRG1. S1R is a highly dynamic chaperone-like protein present in the SSC, which is involved in ALS when mutated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. S1R may operate here in a similar way to that described for mitochondrion-associated ER membrane in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling via IP3 receptors, perhaps in collaboration with M2-receptor cholinergic activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Thus, by modulating spatiotemporal calcium signals, S1Rs may regulate either voltage-gated calcium channels or potassium channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, both of which have an impact on neuronal excitability through a mechanism that acts via either G-protein-dependent M2 receptor activation or channel phosphorylation. In addition, it should be taken into account that highly clustered Kv2.1 phosphorylated proteins may have non-conducting, as yet undefined, functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. It has been suggested that these Kv2.1 clusters could be sites for the delivery of membrane proteins to the cell surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Accordingly, Kv2.1 platforms may play a role as an organizer of the complex molecular assembly at the C-bouton postsynaptic site, regulating site-directed vesicle-membrane trafficking. This would perhaps explain the particular, belt-like, distribution of Kv2.1 protein, surrounding the whole oval-shaped C-bouton site.</p><p>The existence of NRG1 within the SSC facing ErbBs in association with cholinergic terminals is a recently described observation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> that we have extended on here. It has also been recently shown that NRG2 accumulates in the SSCs of cortical interneurons expressing ErbB4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In this case, NRG2/ErbB4 signalling appears to regulate NMDA receptors in an autocrine manner. Although our data indicate that the main pathway for NRG1-ErbBs signalling at C-boutons may be retrogradely directed from post- to pre-synaptic compartments, we cannot rule out the possibility of additional autocrine NRG1 mediated signalling in MNs, as ErbBs are also expressed in these cells. Although our results concerning the localization of ErbBs contrast with those reported by Lasiene <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> using non-phosphospecific anti-ErbBs antibodies, we are confident of our results since they were extensively replicated and analysed using several different antibodies. The strongest presynaptic ErbB signal was obtained when phosphospecific anti-ErbB2 and ErbB4 antibodies were used; this points to the activation of this pathway in a particular subset of C-boutons. Furthermore, the NRG1/ErbB signalling system is also involved in a variety of well-established roles within the neuromuscular system. For example the MN-derived NRG1 pathway is critical: (i) to the development of Schwann cells and myelination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, (ii) to the development and plasticity of neuromuscular junctions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> and, (iii) perhaps also, to the induction of local AChR synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. The anti-NRG1 antibody used in this work recognises a C-terminal epitope which is common within the different NRG-1 isoforms. The above mentioned actions are mainly mediated by the type III NRG1 (NRG1-III), which is the main isoform expressed in MNs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. It is therefore likely that the isoform we detected in C-boutons corresponds to NRG1-III, which is characterised by a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) determining a second N-terminal transmembrane domain. Signalling mediated by this membrane-anchored isoform may take place in a contact-dependent juxtacrine manner, through either the full length or truncated protein. Paracrine signalling via the proteolytic liberation of the EGF-like domain has also been described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. How post-synaptic NRG1 at C-boutons gains access to presynaptic ErbB receptors is not yet understood. Intercellular vesicular transmission mediated by exosomes may have a role in some forms of trans-synaptic communication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. We have observed intersynaptic multivesicular bodies at C-boutons with exosome-like vesicles containing NRG1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. It should be noted that the intersynaptic trafficking of large vesicles has already been documented in C-type synaptic terminals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. Another aspect that should be taken into account is the possibility of ErbBs-elicited NRG1 back signalling after the proteolytic release of the intracellular domain of NRG1, which may act as a transcriptional factor capable of regulating neuronal survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>.</p><p>Surface-associated NRG1 spots appeared in developing MNs on E18, at the same time as VAChT-positive perisomatic puncta. This is consistent with reported data on the development of cholinergic terminals in MNs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. However, the transient existence of large and un-innervated NRG1 spots in immature MNs suggests that SSC development is a cell autonomous process, which undergoes remodelling induced by nerve terminals during cholinergic synaptogenesis. In adults, SSC markers, including NRG1, are progressively lost after peripheral nerve section, together with microglial activation and synaptic loss. This is consistent with the decrease in NRG1-III expression found in the facial nucleus after axotomy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and also with the redistribution of C-bouton-associated Kv2.1 channels after peripheral nerve injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>Another interesting question that has derived from our study is whether C-bouton has a particular role in the orchestration of a neuroinflammatory response. Our results suggest that C-bouton associated molecules act as cues for the attraction of microglial processes which, in turn, remove the synaptic terminals. In addition to motor axons, peripheral nerve injury leads to the interruption of the sensory proprioceptive axons that establish monosynaptic VGluT1-positive afferent connections with MNs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. It would not be surprising if there were an association between microglia with degenerating and presumably chemoattractant VGluT1-containing terminals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Nevertheless, the C-bouton spatial specificity as a target for microglial migration is less expected, because the interneurons, from which these terminals originate, are not directly damaged by axotomy. This apparent chemotactic activity is probably related to the complex arrangement of molecules and signal-transduction pathways inherent to C-boutons. At the molecular level, one candidate for this action could be the NRG1/ErbBs signalling pathway. It has been shown that ErbB receptors are expressed in microglia and that NRG1 is a chemotactic factor for microglia <italic>in vitro;</italic> the NRG1/ErbBs module is specifically activated in spinal cord dorsal horn during microglial reaction following peripheral nerve injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. This may represent an early event in the inflammatory response to injured MNs that could contribute to the generation of a perisynaptic environment that could play a role in determining MN survival or degeneration. However, we did not observe ErbB positive immunostaining in activated microglia around axotomised MN somata (data not shown).</p><p>Our findings reveal the highly specific arrangement of C-bouton-associated proteins, their disruption in acutely lesioned MNs and their putative role in regulating the neuroinflammatory response, and emphasize the relevance of this hitherto poorly understood structure in the physiology and pathology of MNs. The significance of NRG1-ErbBs retrograde signalling in C-type synapse deserves particular attention in the future as a putative new target for therapy in ALS.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals, surgical procedures and tissue preparation</title><p>CD1 mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Castellar del Vall&#x000e8;s, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain).
