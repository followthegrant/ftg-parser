We developed genetically-encoded reagents for fluorescence-synapse labeling and connectivity analysis in brain tissue, using a fluorogen-activating protein (FAP)-coupled or YFP-coupled, postsynaptically-localized neuroligin-1 (NL-1) targeting sequence (FAP/YFPpost). FAPpost expression did not alter mEPSC or mIPSC properties. Sparse AAV-mediated expression of FAP/YFPpost with the cell-filling, red fluorophore dTomato (dTom) enabled high-throughput, compartment-specific detection of putative synapses across diverse neuron types in mouse somatosensory cortex. We took advantage of the bright, far-red emission of FAPpost puncta for multichannel fluorescence alignment of dendrites, FAPpost puncta, and presynaptic neurites in transgenic mice with saturated labeling of parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing neurons using Cre-reporter driven expression of YFP. Subtype-specific inhibitory connectivity onto layer 2/3 (L2/3) neocortical pyramidal (Pyr) neurons was assessed using automated puncta detection and neurite apposition. Quantitative and compartment-specific comparisons show that PV inputs are the predominant source of inhibition at both the soma and the dendrites and were particularly concentrated at the primary apical dendrite. SST inputs were interleaved with PV inputs at all secondary-order and higher-order dendritic branches. These fluorescence-based synapse labeling reagents can facilitate large-scale and cell-type specific quantitation of changes in synaptic connectivity across development, learning, and disease states.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>barrel cortex</kwd><kwd>PV</kwd><kwd>pyramidal cell</kwd><kwd>SST</kwd><kwd>VIP</kwd><kwd>anatomy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Kaufman Foundation</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source>NIH</funding-source><award-id>R21 NS092019</award-id><award-id>RF1 MH114103</award-id><award-id>T32 NS 086749</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="73"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="13774"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>September/October 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Significance Statement</title><p>High-throughput quantitation of synapse number and distribution can reveal principles of circuit function and their adaptive or pathologic alterations. Molecular genetic, fluorescence-based approaches targeted to discrete cell types can enable automated detection and quantification of input-specific synapses in complex brain tissues. In addition, these tools present a low barrier to use within the neuroscience community through volumetric confocal analysis of tissue specimens. Here we evaluate inhibitory synapse distribution across layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal (Pyr) neurons using postsynaptic expression of a previously characterized, neuroligin-based construct. We find that inhibitory inputs from fluorescently-labeled parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) neurons are intermingled across the proximal dendrites, and that inputs from vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons are rare for L2/3 Pyr neurons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>The organization, number, and input identity of synapses onto a cell are critical determinants of neuronal activity. Although electrophysiological analyses of synaptic properties have provided a rich framework to build and test hypotheses about neural computations during sensation and behavior, these analyses cannot reveal broader principles of synaptic distribution across the neuron. Since alterations to synaptic function in select circuits and cell types are associated with autism, intellectual disability, psychiatric, and neurologic disease (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bay&#x000e9;s et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000fc;dhof, 2017</xref>), quantitative metrics about synaptic location, size, and input specificity are likely to provide key insights into how neural circuits are related to disease pathology.</p><p>Electron microscopy (EM) provides nanometer resolution for ultrastructural identification of synaptic contacts and has been employed for brain-area and cell-type quantitative analysis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chandrasekaran et al., 2015</xref>); however, EM is hampered by technical demands of sample preparation, imaging time, data storage, and labor-intensive analysis that make comparisons across multiple individuals or conditions difficult. Recent studies have attempted to use EM for quantitative analysis of synapse organization between defined presynaptic and postsynaptic partners, but these computationally-intensive approaches are difficult to adopt and scale for broad use (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Kubota et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Glausier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kornfeld et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Vishwanathan et al., 2017</xref>). Fluorescence-based microscopy methods are an attractive alternative to EM, because light microscopy facilitates faster acquisition of larger tissue volumes and enables use of spectrally distinct, genetically encoded fluorophores for discrimination of molecularly diverse cells and synapse types.</p><p>There has been great interest in developing tools and methodologies for synapse labeling using molecular, genetic, or histochemical techniques for light microscopy, including GFP-tagging synaptic molecules, GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP), and array tomography (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Micheva and Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gross et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Fortin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Martell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Villa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kinoshita et al., 2019</xref>). Fluorescence-based, sparse labeling of postsynaptic neurons in intact brain tissue has been especially helpful in this regard, as it reduces the analysis bottleneck that arises from broadscale immunohistochemical labeling of synapses from neurons intermingled in the analysis volume. However, high-throughput/volumetric synaptic analysis for individual neurons has not yet become routine, possibly due to low signal-to-noise and synaptogenesis or abnormal synapse stabilization associated with overexpression of synaptic tags (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">El-Husseini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Tsetsenis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Martell et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We sought to develop molecular genetic tools for comprehensive fluorescence labeling of postsynaptic sites across an individual neuron, in a complex tissue environment. We employed fluorogen-activating protein (FAP), a modified antibody fragment that emits in the far red on binding of a small molecule ligand, a derivative of malachite green (MG; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Szent-Gyorgyi et al., 2013</xref>), targeted to postsynaptic sites using the well-validated postsynaptic tag derived from the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region of mouse neuroligin-1 (NL-1, FAPpost; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Druckmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Sparse, virus-mediated coexpression of FAPpost with the cell-filling fluorophore dTomato (dTom) showed broad, punctate labeling across distinct pyramidal (Pyr) cell compartments. Aided by automated image analysis, we quantitatively evaluated the distribution of inhibitory synapses identified from analysis of &#x0003e;90,000 synaptic puncta in neocortical Pyr neurons in superficial layers of somatosensory cortex. Using comprehensive fluorescence-labeling of cell type specific neurites in parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) Cre-driver transgenic mice allowed us to align FAPpost puncta to quantify inhibitory inputs for layer 2/3 (L2/3) Pyr neurons. This quantitative analysis revealed that PV inputs dominated the soma and the synapse-dense 1&#x000b0; apical dendrite, and that PV inputs had a moderately higher density than SST inputs across all L2/3 dendrites. VIP neurons only sparsely innervated L2/3 Pyr neurons. These studies help establish a framework for a high-throughput analysis of synapse organization in brain tissue during health and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Carnegie Mellon University.</p><sec id="s3A"><title>Construct design</title><sec id="s3A1"><title>FAPpost cloning</title><p>To make the plasmid for packaging into AAV, post-mGRASP from Addgene (#34912, paavCAG-post-mGRASP-2A-dTom) was modified by annealing oligos and inserting into BamHI and XhoI digested backbone to introduce an AgeI site (PostBamXhoF 5&#x02019;GATCC CTT <named-content content-type="gene">ACCGGT</named-content> ATC TTA C and PostBamXhoR 5&#x02019; TCGAG TAA GAT <named-content content-type="gene">ACCGGT</named-content> AAG G).

Pyr cells were identified using morphologic criteria, including the presence of a thick apical dendrite oriented toward the pial surface, Pyr-shaped cell body, laterally projecting basal dendrites, a descending axon identified by its narrow diameter, and the ubiquitous presence of dendritic spines, particularly on higher-order branches. Only isolated Pyr cells (typically at the edge of the viral transduction zone) that exhibited dendritic dTom as well as punctate FAP signal were selected for imaging and quantitation. FAPpost and dTom expression were not always positively correlated, an effect that was unexpected given the construct design. dTom-expressing neurons that did not exhibit membrane-localized FAP fluorescence, or showed diffuse and low-intensity signal were excluded from analysis. Analyzed cells showed no significant relationship between FAPpost puncta intensity and calculated puncta density along the dendrite. In almost all cases, selected cells included the entire soma in the image dataset. Because cortical dendrites are &#x0003e;200 &#x003bc;m long and could lie outside the imaged area, only a fraction of the dendritic arbor was collected and analyzed.</p><p>Sections were observed under a LSM 880 AxioObserver Microscope (Zeiss), using 63&#x000d7; oil-immersion objective lens (Plan-Apochromat, 1.40 Oil DIC M27) with the pinhole set at 1.0 Airy disk unit. Maximum image size was 1024 &#x000d7; 1024 pixels.

Optimal laser intensities for each channel were set for each cell independently, and images were collected to avoid pixel saturation. Well-isolated cells of interest were centered in the image frame and the Z-stack dimensions were set manually by tracking dTom-labeled dendrites. Z-stacks typically ranged from 30 to 40 &#x003bc;m for a given neuron.

Eyes were covered with ointment, hair was removed with Nair, and scalp was disinfected with povidone iodine. Scalp and periosteum were removed, and skull surface roughened by scraping with a slowly rotating dental drill. A thin layer of Krazyglue was applied to the skull before a custom-made head bracket was attached in the right hemisphere using Krazyglue and dental cement (Lang Dental, 1223PNK). The skull was carefully thinned around a 3-mm diameter circle centered above the left hemisphere S1BF using a dental drill (Dentsply, 780044). After extensive thinning, the loose bone flap was detached using a microforcep. A glass window composed of 3 mm diameter glass (Harvard Apparatus, 64-0720) attached to a 5 mm diameter glass (Harvard Apparatus, 64-0700) was mounted above the exposed brain immediately before acute imaging.

Coronal slices (350 &#x003bc;m thick) were prepared in regular ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) composed of the following: 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 mM glucose, 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> equilibrated with 95%/5% O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices recovered in the dark at room temperature for 60 min before transfer to an electrophysiology rig where they were perfused with ACSF containing 1 &#x003bc;M tetrodotoxin (Tocris) to silence spontaneous activity. The injection site was identified by dTom fluorescent cell bodies using an Olympus light microscope (BX51WI). Pyr-targeted recordings (four to five animals per group) were done in the absence of MG dye, since we were interested in whether <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of the FAPpost construct would influence synaptic function and MG was never applied before tissue fixation for anatomic analysis. Borosilicate glass electrode resistance was 4&#x02013;8 M&#x003a9;. Electrode internal solution was composed of the following: 130 mM cesium gluconate, 20 mM HEPES, 0.4 mM EGTA, 2.8 mM NaCl, 5 mM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl), 4 mM Mg-ATP, and 0.3 mM Na-GTP; pH 7.25&#x02013;7.30, 280&#x02013;290 mOsm. Trace amounts of Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen A10436) were included in the internal solution to confirm that targeted cells had Pyr-like morphologies. Electrophysiological data were acquired using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and a National Instruments acquisition interface (National Instruments). The data were filtered at 3 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz and collected by Igor Pro 6.0 (Wavemetrics). After forming a G&#x003a9; seal, negative pressure was applied to the cell to enter whole-cell mode, and following 2- to 3-min acclimation time, miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were collected at &#x02013;70 mV holding potential for 5 min. Holding potential was slowly raised to 0 mV over an additional minute, and following 1 min acclimation time, miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) were then collected. Traces were analyzed using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft Inc.), with a 7-pA minimal amplitude cutoff. One hundred randomly selected events for each cell (Pyr dTom&#x02013; and dTom+) were used to create cumulative probability histograms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3B"><title>Image analysis</title><sec id="s3B10"><title>Bassoon alignment</title><p>PV-Cre x Ai3 mouse brain tissue sections containing FAPpost-transduced cells were stained for bassoon, a presynaptic marker of vesicle-release active zones that localizes to both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al., 1999</xref>). Images of the four different fluorescence channels (bassoon, PV/YFP, dTom, FAPpost) were arranged side-by-side in series for all optical sections containing the target soma. Analysis was restricted to the surface of a tissue section (&#x0223c;5 &#x003bc;m from top) where bassoon antibody penetration was complete. In deeper regions of the tissue section, bassoon immunofluorescence was low to undetectable, making colocalization assessments unreliable.</p><p>First, bassoon puncta adjacent to the surface of a target dTom-expressing soma were identified by an experimenter. Bassoon puncta sometimes extended across multiple optical sections. Bassoon colocalization at PV/YFP neurites was assessed by direct overlap of signal from the two channels. FAPpost puncta at the soma surface were counted as being associated with bassoon when puncta were aligned with &#x0003c;0.25 &#x003bc;m distance. A minimum of 15 bassoon puncta was assessed for colocalization/alignment for each soma analyzed. We independently examined the rate of FAPpost alignment with bassoon (to identify putative false positives) and PV, as well as PV alignment with bassoon and FAPpost in the same manner.</p><p>To assess dendritic FAPpost alignment with synaptic immunofluorescence, spiny dendritic segments running parallel to imaging plane (&#x02265;10 &#x003bc;m in length) were manually assessed for alignment between FAPpost and bassoon across one to five flattened confocal sections. Most FAPpost puncta exhibited overlap with bassoon immunofluorescence within this sub-volume. Some FAPpost puncta without an apparent bassoon partner could extend beyond the thin volume assessed. In this minority of cases, additional adjacent optical sections at these specific locations were examined for bassoon signal to determine whether these FAPpost puncta were actual false positives.</p></sec><sec id="s3B11"><title>Imaris segmentation</title><p>Carl Zeiss image files were imported into Imaris version 8.4 equipped with the Filament Tracer plugin (Bitplane). The dTom cell fill was used to create a 3D cell-surface rendering using a combination of surface and filament objects. FAPpost puncta were first reconstructed as 3D structures using &#x0201c;surface objects&#x0201d; (to outline puncta borders) created using an estimated 0.5 &#x003bc;m diameter. Due to imaging limitations, only puncta larger than three voxels (&#x0223c;0.024 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>) were counted, potentially undercounting very small synapses below this detection threshold. Large puncta that potentially reflected smaller, adjacent synapses were separated into multiple objects using the &#x0201c;split touching objects&#x0201d; function with the same estimated 0.5-&#x003bc;m diameter. Thus, large puncta were potentially separated into multiple smaller synapses, a process that could increase the absolute number of detected synapses. Indeed, it is unclear for larger synapses whether these should be counted as a single synapse with multiple active sites and postsynaptic specializations (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2016</xref>), or combined into one large synapse (such as the giant synapses observed at the calyx of Held). Puncta were digitally associated with the plasma membrane if their edges lay within 0.5 &#x003bc;m from the soma surface or &#x0003c;1 &#x003bc;m for spiny dendritic regions. Puncta 0.5 &#x003bc;m below cell surface were attributed as cytosolic fluorescence and not included for analysis. Puncta &#x0201c;objects&#x0201d; were then converted into puncta &#x0201c;spots&#x0201d; (with automatic intensity max spot detection thresholds and a 0.5 &#x003bc;m estimated diameter) using surface object centroids in Imaris.</p></sec><sec id="s3B12"><title>Puncta quantification</title><p>Puncta densities were quantified for different branch orders. Pyr neurons had only one apical branch segment that was then divided into higher-order branches. The number and length of 2&#x000b0; and higher-order branches analyzed could vary across cells, depending on cell anatomy and image acquisition. For dendritic puncta density averages, values for the Pyr 1&#x000b0; apical dendrite were not included, because this compartment showed a significantly higher density and appeared to be a distinct compartment of the neuron that may be contiguous with the somatic compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s3B13"><title>Automated input assignment</title><p>Presynaptic neurite reconstructions were created using automatic background subtraction thresholding of the presynaptic (PV, SST, or VIP) YFP channel, a split-touching objects diameter threshold of 1 &#x003bc;m, and 6 voxel minimum area settings in Imaris. For confocal stacks where presynaptic neurite YFP signal exhibited <italic>z</italic>-axis related signal drop-off, neurite reconstructions using automatic settings were generated separately for superficial and deeper optical sections of the stack. In such cases, both sets of presynaptic neurite reconstructions were visually examined for comparable density and size profiles.</p><p>Puncta spots were assigned to a specific presynaptic input using a distance threshold of 0.15 &#x003bc;m from spot centroid to the presynaptic neurite 3D-reconstructions edge. Methods using presynaptic and postsynaptic neurite colocalization may be confounded by false positives (where neurites are near the soma but do not synapse onto it) and false negatives (where a given neurite is associated with two or more postsynaptic sites that are conflated into a single crossing point). Indeed, in many cases, neurites made extended contacts with the soma surface that might include a single or multiple postsynaptic sites. We found that using postsynaptic puncta to differentiate multiple synapses along a large presynaptic neurite enabled a more accurate estimate for the number of putative synaptic contacts.
</p><p>Because the distance parameters used to identify convergent signals could be digitally adjusted, we explored this space to establish a maximum distance for input detection of 0.15 &#x003bc;m. This was below the diffraction limit for our confocal images. As expected, use of larger distance thresholds for detecting inputs resulted in a substantial increase in the number of assigned puncta. These values were out of range for other published values for inhibitory synapse density and provided confirmation that smaller distance thresholds were more stringent and likely to be more accurate.</p></sec><sec id="s3B14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All reported values are mean &#x000b1; SEM, unless otherwise stated.

Within cells, all but two Pyr cells had normally distributed dendritic puncta densities. For these two cells, median dendritic puncta density was used to represent these cell&#x02019;s average dendritic puncta densities. Mean dendritic puncta density was used for all other cells.

We focused on FAPpost labeling at the soma, since synapses here were easily detected in confocal cross-sections. Bassoon immunohistochemistry was conducted in PV-Cre x Ai3 tissue (where PV neurites were labeled with YFP), and bassoon alignment to FAPpost-expressing Pyr neurons in L2/3 was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>A&#x02013;E</italic></xref>). More than 90% of bassoon puncta aligned with FAPpost puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>F</italic></xref>), where only 7 &#x000b1; 10% (mean &#x000b1; SD) of bassoon+ PV terminals lacked FAPpost signal. In 3/5 cells analyzed, we observed that all PV terminals showed both bassoon and FAPpost. This suggests that FAPpost labels the vast majority of synaptic contacts from PV neurons.

It remains possible that the L1 apical tuft of L2/3 Pyr neurons (that was not included in our analysis, due to sectioning artifacts) may show denser SST inputs.

Second, synaptically-targeted fluorophores can be sparsely expressed in brain tissue, not just cultured neurons, to reveal properties of synaptic and input organization in a complex neural circuit. Third, fluorescence imaging enables use of multiple, spectrally distinct channels for cell type-selective identification of axonal inputs and specific molecules that can differentiate synapses. Fourth, volumetric data collection is rapid and requires only a confocal microscope, and images can be used for high-throughput, automated analysis.

Synapse density has often been estimated indirectly from fluorescence images, using spines as a proxy for synapses. This is problematic, as spine detection will underestimate synapse number by excluding shaft synapses (typically inhibitory), dually-innervated spines (&#x0003e;10% by some estimates (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>)), spines that lie within the imaging plane, and will also undercount faintly labeled, filamentous spines.</p><p>Overall synapse densities for L2/3 Pyr neurons revealed an average of 2.5 synapses/&#x003bc;m dendrite, a density that is well within the range of prior estimates. For example, whole-cell EM reconstructions of CA1 hippocampal neurons have shown synapse densities of 0.7&#x02013;7 synapses/&#x003bc;m, depending on location within the dendrite (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Guly&#x000e1;s et al., 1999</xref>).

For isolated neurons, automated puncta assignment to the parent dendrite removes the requirement that dendritic spines be visible for synapse detection, reducing false-negative rates. For automated assignment, this rate will always be non-zero as the distance limit set for puncta assignment will exclude puncta that lie on longer dendritic spines, which can extend &#x0003e;5 &#x003bc;m in some cases (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>False-positive (non-synaptic puncta) errors are more difficult to estimate. Intracellular pools of the targeting construct may contribute. Although these were digitally excluded based on distance to the plasma membrane, this process that may not be effective for thin dendritic segments. It is possible that non-synaptic, plasma-membrane FAPpost accumulation may sometimes occur. In addition, puncta from nearby neurons may have been inadvertently misassigned to an analyzed dendritic segment. While fluorescence-based genetic methods have advantages, they are subject to variations in expression levels, both of the labeling construct and of protein trafficking to different synapses (for example, that may have a lower NL-1 content or are more distant from the soma). It remains possible that not all synapses, for example, neuromodulatory or peptidergic inputs, were uniformly labeled using this methodology.

Cells with higher synapse densities may represent &#x0201c;hub&#x0201d; cells that receive wide distribution of synaptic inputs, or more recurrent connections from the same presynaptic neuron(s). Notably, miniature postsynaptic current frequency data (both ours and others) shows a 10-fold range in values across Pyr neurons. Mini frequencies are typically interpreted as reflecting the number of synaptic connections on a given postsynaptic cell. Considering the electrophysiological correlate of synapse number shows a similar range in values to anatomic correlates of synapses on Pyr neurons, we may very well be capturing normal biological variability in synapse numbers.</p><p>Alternatively, observed variability may be a non-biological labeling artifact. To achieve complete synaptic labeling, expression of any synapse-tagging molecule must reach sufficient levels in an individual cell to label all synapses across its entire dendritic arbor. It is unlikely that this labeling occurs at the same time for all cells. One alternative explanation for the wide-range in synapse densities is that only a fraction of synapses was labeled in a particular cell. We attempted to control for this by only selecting well-labeled cells, but we cannot rule out this potential confound in the interpretation of our findings.</p></sec><sec id="s5D"><title>Volumetric imaging for high-throughput synaptic input assignment</title><p>A significant advance enabled by an all-fluorescence synaptic imaging platform is the automated assignment of cell type-specific synaptic inputs with a spectrally distinct fluorophore.

Although this may be incongruous with the simplified model that contrasts soma-targeting PV and dendrite-targeting SST inputs (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lazarus and Huang, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Pi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Higley, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>), prior experimental data are much less categorical than these schema suggest. For example, anatomic reconstructions from paired whole-cell recordings show that the majority of PV inputs to neocortical Pyr neurons are located &#x0003e;50 &#x003bc;m from the soma (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Kubota et al., 2015</xref>) and abundant SST contacts can be detected at both proximal and distal dendrites (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Di Cristo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2012</xref>). It remains possible that very distal dendrites, particularly in L1, have a disproportionate association of SST inputs. Based on the density of synaptic inputs, our data indicate that PV-mediated synaptic input will be the predominant source of inhibition across the somatodendritic compartments of L2/3 Pyr neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This analysis helps generate a framework for large-scale anatomic imaging to examine circuit- and brain-wide changes in synapse distribution in development, learning, and disease. Future efforts should leverage volumetric imaging in cleared or expanded tissue for complete and high-resolution capture of the entire dendritic apparatus, application of additional molecular markers to distinguish different synapse types, and employ new presynaptic constructs for improved synaptic discrimination. A critical challenge of these future possibilities will be the digital capture and storage of large anatomic datasets for computational analysis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list content-type="nameDate"><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">

I concur with the reviewers' comments expressing the interest of the study. However, they also expressed some concerns about several issues that need to be addressed and clarified. I also consider pertinent the concerns expressed.</p><p>Specific comments of the reviewers:</p><p>Reviewer 1.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors developed a method for labeling and analyzing synaptic connectivity by expressing fluorogen-activating protein (FAP) or YFP linked to postsynaptically-localized neuroligin-1 targeting sequence. They show that overexpressing FAP at postsynaptic sites (FAPpost) has minimum effects on mEPSC or mIPSC in pyramidal neurons. The expression of FAPpost or YFPpost allows better detection of putative synaptic sites based on postsynaptic markers, rather than simply morphological makers. Using an automated detection algorism in Imaris software, the method enables detection of synaptic connections between several types of inhibitory neurons and L2 pyramidal neurons. The authors demonstrate the usefulness of this method by showing that PV neurons make synaptic contacts on apical dendrites in addition to somas of L2 pyramidal neurons, whereas SST-expressing interneurons target both proximal and higher-order dendrites of pyramidal neurons. </p><p>The new method developed enables potentially more precise analysis of fluorescently-labeled synaptic connections in the brain. The results are clearly presented and properly discussed. With some further characterization, the method could be very effective for rapid and large scale analysis of synaptic connectivity. I only have few suggestions for improving the manuscript: </p><p>(1) The authors show FAPpost expression can be imaged after the addition of MG fluorogen to the fixed tissue but not in the living cortex. It is unclear whether this is purely due to rapid clearance of MG fluorogen in vivo or just the weak labeling intensity for two-photon imaging. Could the authors test whether immediately after adding MG fluorogen, FAPpost could be imaged in vivo with two-photon microscopy? </p><p>(2) As the authors acknowledged, the variability of spine density across different cells could be due to the level of FAPpost expression. Presumably, spine density could be independently measured with the cell-filling marker dTomato. If the dTomato expression is weak, the authors may consider using antibody staining to amplify the dTomato signal. If every spine identified by dTomato was also labeled by FAPpost, this would suggest that the variability of spine density is not due to the level of FAPpost expression. </p><p>(3) What level of FAPpost expression in cells is appropriate for imaging and data analysis? The authors should mention this in the method or the main text. Does the brightness of FAPpost correlate with spine density detected on pyramidal neurons? </p><p>(4) Does FAPpost label synapses in inhibitory neurons? The authors should at least comment on this issue.</p><p>Reviewer 2.</p><p>In the paper the authors developed a method for fluorescence-synapse and connectivity labeling and analysis using Fluorogen activating protein (FAP)- or YFP-tagged postsynaptic neuroligin-1. They show that this largely does not change mEPSC or mIPSC properties and they use the method to visualize synaptic sites of PV, SST and VIP interneurons onto L2 pyramidal neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex. </p><p>This is an overall nice study that could be further improved with a few more experiments on the validation of the observed FAP/YFP postsynaptic labeling. For example, the image in Fig 3A-E shows what appears to be a soma with examples of presynaptic bassoon colocalization for 3 putative synaptic sites, but this is not representative of the distribution on dendrites that is being quantified in the rest of the manuscript. Therefore it would be more appropriate to include example images of two to three dendrites with colocalization with bassoon colocalization along the dendritic branches. Could the authors also use some postsynaptic markers such as PSD-95 or homer 1A? This is an important point since the putative synapse distribution in Figs 4 - 6 looks rather dense and ectopic expression of the FAP/YFP-neuroligin recombinant protein would result in false positive synapse counts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="synthesis-author-response" id="s8"><title>Author Response</title><p>To the Editor:</p><p>We were pleased to hear that reviewers for our recent submission to eNeuro &#x0201c;Fluorescence-based quantitative synapse analysis for cell-type specific connectomics&#x0201d; found the work potentially suitable for publication. Reviewers recognized that the method could be effective for rapid and large-scale analysis of synaptic connectivity and requested minor clarifications or additional information, which we have now included in our revised manuscript.</p><p>Below we respond to specific questions and indicate where revisions have been made in the manuscript. We have added 5 new data panels to Figure 3, and present results from extensive antibody testing for the reviewers here. We hope that this revised version will be judged suitable for publication in eNeuro. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Authors</p><p>Response to specific comments</p><p>Reviewer 1</p><p>1. &#x0201c;...Could the authors test whether FAPpost could be imaged in vivo with two-photon microscopy?&#x0201d;</p><p>The possibility of using the FAPpost constructs for intravital imaging of connections in real-time is exciting and is an area of current investigation in the lab. Issues that we are addressing include MG-derivative dye selection, dose and route of administration, and customizing the optimal two photon imaging configuration for simultaneous detection and discrimination of the red dTomato fill and the far-red FAPpost synaptic marker. Pilot experiments to demonstrate the potential feasibility of this approach would not be able to systematically address these questions, nor to establish the impact (or lack thereof) of the MG in neural circuit dynamics. Thus we find that this experiment, while potentially interesting, is beyond the scope of this paper which focuses on the use of this tool in fixed brain slices. </p><p>2. The reviewer asked whether &#x0201c;the variability of spine density across different neurons could be due to the level of FAPpost expression,&#x0201d; suggesting that if weak red fluorescence was enhanced with anti-dTom immunohistochemistry we might be better able to determine whether spine variability was due to lack of detection of spines or poor cell filling. </p><p>We note that variability in spine density across putative cortical pyramidal neurons has been well-characterized in multiple prior studies, including both EM and Golgi staining (Peters and Kaiserman-Abramof, 1970; Holtmaat et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2006; Arellano et al., 2007), and appears to be a biological property of pyramidal neurons. Importantly, our analysis did not require that dTom-filled spines were detected, in order for FAPpost puncta to be assigned to a given neuron. Because neurons selected for analysis were well-isolated with respect to other labeled cells in the tissue section (see for example Figure 4-1C, we think it is unlikely that we are misassigning FAPpost puncta from another cell. Thus, variability in synapse density across cells is not coming from inadvertently misassignment (noise) in a densely labeled specimen.</p><p>Variability in puncta density could, as the reviewer suggests, come from a range of FAPpost expression levels across cells, so that weakly labeled cells might show misleadingly lower puncta densities or strongly labeled cells might show erroneous high puncta densities that do not correspond to synapses. To determine whether variability in detected puncta density was systematically related to levels of FAP/YFPpost expression, we analyzed mean puncta intensity versus detected puncta density across individual L2 Pyr neurons in our study (Figure R1). We observed no significant relationship between puncta intensity and puncta density across analyzed cells. This finding, together with the well-documented variability in spine density previously reported for cortical pyramidal neurons (Peters and Kaiserman-Abramof, 1970; Holtmaat et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2006; Arellano et al., 2007; Tjia et al., 2017), suggests that our analysis captures the real variance in synaptic density across cortical Pyr neurons.</p><p>For clarification of this point, the methods were amended on p. 8 and the following text was added on p.18:</p><p>&#x0201c;Analyzed cells showed no significant relationship between FAPpost puncta intensity and calculated puncta density along the dendrite.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;It is likely that the number of viral particles infecting individual neurons was not uniform, even in cells analyzed from the same animal, and may be an additional source of heterogeneity in analysis of puncta densities; however, we found no significant relationship between puncta intensity and puncta density across analyzed neurons.&#x0201d;</p><p>3. The reviewer asks for further clarification regarding how FAPpost expressing neurons were included for analysis. </p><p>We have elaborated the Methods to indicate this on p. 7-8:</p><p>&#x0201c;Only isolated Pyr cells (typically at the edge of the viral transduction zone) that exhibited dendritic dTom as well as punctate FAP signal were selected for imaging and quantitation. FAPpost and dTom expression were not always positively correlated, an effect that was unexpected given the construct design but may be related to viral transduction time or multiplicity of infection. dTom-expressing neurons that did not exhibit membrane-localized FAP fluorescence, or showed diffuse and low-intensity signal were excluded from analysis. Analyzed cells showed no significant relationship between FAPpost puncta intensity and calculated puncta density along the dendrite.&#x0201d; </p><p>4. &#x0201c;Does FAPpost label synapses in inhibitory neurons?&#x0201d;</p><p>This is an interesting question that we are actively pursuing in the lab. We have observed punctate somatic and dendritic labeling in multiple subtypes of inhibitory neurons using FAP/YFPpost. For clarity and precision, we have focused our validation and input assignment analysis on pyramidal neurons. Because there are a large variety of inhibitory neuron subtypes and because these subtypes may use different combinations of neuroligins and neurexins for cell-type specific inputs, it may be necessary to validate synaptic localization independently for each molecularly-defined pre- and postsynaptic target, something that is outside of the scope of the current study. </p><p>As suggested, we have added a sentence to the results that punctate FAPpost staining is observed in inhibitory neurons, suggesting that this tool might be broadly useful for studying a variety of cell-type specific inputs on p.19:</p><p>&#x0201c;Although we did not systematically evaluate FAPpost properties in inhibitory neurons, we observed punctate fluorescence in PV, SST, and VIP neurons that expressed this postsynaptic label. Thus, this tool may be useful for quantitative synapse analysis in multiple cell types.&#x0201d;</p><p>Reviewer 2</p><p>1. &#x0201c;...it would be more appropriate to use example images of two to three dendrites with ... bassoon colocalization along the dendritic branches. </p><p>Synapses are extraordinarily dense in neocortical tissue, and it is challenging to accurately detect and assign immunohistochemically labeled synapses in a volume of tissue. To counter this analytical challenge, we focused on FAPpost labeling at the soma (Figure 3), since synapses here were easily detected in confocal cross-sections and the image is effectively two-dimensional. </p><p>However, we agree that analysis of dendritic synapse colocalization would enhance the validation results presented. We identified some FAPpost-labeled spiny dendritic segments (from putative Pyr neurons) and assessed FAPpost puncta for adjacent immunolabeling of bassoon at both shaft and spine synapses. We have added 5 additional panels to Figure 3, where 143 FAPpost puncta across 11 dendritic segments were analyzed for associated bassoon signal. We provide additional examples of dendritic FAPpost-bassoon alignment here (Figure R2), which could be added to the manuscript as a supplemental figure if requested. </p><p>Overall, we find that &#x0003e;90% of FAPpost puncta on dendrites show associated bassoon immunofluorescence. </p><p>The following text has been added on p.17:</p><p>&#x0201c;We also carried out bassoon immunolocalization for FAPpost puncta along spiny dendrites from putative Pyr neurons. Analysis of 10 dendritic segments showed that &#x0003e;90% of FAPpost puncta were associated with bassoon (Figure 3I-M). Because synapses are densely distributed across a volume of brain tissue, and there are many synapses near a labeled segment that belong to an unlabeled pair of neurons, it was not possible to determine false negative rates from these experiments (i.e. bassoon signal without corresponding FAPpost in the region of given dendritic segment). Some FAPpost puncta had no detectable bassoon associated signal. This may result from either an inability to detect bassoon (low fluorescence signal or subthreshold levels of bassoon) or from a bona fide false positive, perhaps due to FAPpost signal that may not be synaptically localized. </p><p>This is explicitly noted in the manuscript on p. 26.</p><p>&#x0201c;Intracellular pools of the targeting construct may contribute. Although these were digitally excluded based upon distance to the plasma membrane, this process that may not be effective for thin dendritic segments. It is possible that non-synaptic, plasma-membrane FAPpost accumulation may sometimes occur.&#x0201d;</p><p>2. Could the authors also use some post-synaptic markers such as PSD-95 or homer1a?&#x0201d;</p><p>Unfortunately, despite great effort (6 animals with 12 viral injections and multiple sections per animal), we were unable to carry out reliable immunohistochemistry for other synaptic markers such as gephyrin and PSD-95 in virally transduced brain tissue. The PSD-95 antibody (NeuroMab, 75-028, RRID: AB_10698024) immunostaining required very light fixation of acute brain slices (350&#x003bc;m for 10 min in 2% PFA) followed by subsectioning (40&#x003bc;m) for immunohistochemistry (protocol Gasser et al., 2006; antibody application reference Zhu et al., 2018). This process introduces substantial tissue loss due to fragility of the specimen. Under these conditions, only the outermost 2-3&#x003bc;m of the confocally-imaged section showed punctate immunofluorescence signal. Even then, the PSD-95 immunostaining was not uniform across the surface, with patchy labeling across different areas of the brain section. This may be due to uneven penetration of the fixative in the subsectioned acute brain slice. We were thus restricted to analysis of dendritic segments with both dTom fill and punctate FAPpost that happened to lie within this outermost 2-3&#x003bc;m that was well-labeled. Despite multiple experimental repetitions, we were unable to find unambiguous examples of clearly spiny segments (representing L2 Pyr neurons) for analysis. Although we could find dendritic segments showing FAPpost puncta colocalized with PSD-95 immunofluorescence, they are not clearly spiny and may be dendrites from inhibitory neurons. Because our analysis and validation was focused on L2 Pyr neurons, we are reluctant to more broadly examine other cell types, as targeting may differ across cell types. We show examples of FAPpost and PSD-95 association here. Note that although some FAPpost puncta colocalize with PSD-95, others do not (Figure R3). It is possible that non-colocalized puncta are inhibitory synapses; we do not expect that all FAPpost puncta will colocalize.</p><p>We also attempted to use gephyrin antibodies to examine FAPpost colocalization at putative inhibitory synapses, also in virally transduced brain tissue. We used a gephyrin antibody directly conjugated to a red (oyster550) fluorophore (Synaptic Systems), since use of the non-conjugated antibody (same clone) showed no signal under any fixation conditions, despite multiple attempts. Unfortunately, the oyster550 fluorophore is spectrally indistinguishable from dTom. We thus contracted with Synaptic Systems to make two new directly-conjugated fluorescent gephyrin antibodies using the parent clone (oyster488 and oyster633), but neither of these conjugates effectively stained brain tissue. Thus, we could only look at dendritic segments with oyster550 staining where the dTom fill was very weak and would not interfere with the immunolabel (Figure R4). Although we could observe some cases where gephyrin puncta colocalized with a subset of FAPpost puncta on a given dendritic segment (as expected if some synapses were excitatory), we are reluctant to interpret these data because of the difficulty in unambiguously separating potential dTom from gephyrin-oyster550. After many months of work, we elected to use the bassoon antibody for validation studies. We note that the neuroligin-based tag has been used in multiple other studies (Kim et al., 2011; Druckmann et al., 2013; Jun-Hyeok et al., 2018), and we hope that those published data further support the efficacy of our analytical approach.</p><p>References</p><p>Arellano JI, Espinosa A, Fair&#x000e9;n A, Yuste R, DeFelipe J (2007) Non-synaptic dendritic spines in neocortex.
