Earlier studies reveal the importance of the hydrophobic carboxy-terminus of HO-1 for anchorage to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which facilitates the interaction with CPR. In addition, HO-1 has been shown to undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the carboxy-terminus during hypoxia and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Translocated nuclear HO-1 was demonstrated to alter binding of transcription factors and to alter gene expression. Little is known about the homologous membrane anchor of the HO-2 isoform. The current work is the first systematic analysis in a eukaryotic system that demonstrates the crucial role of the membrane anchor of HO-2 for localization at the endoplasmic reticulum, oligomerization and interaction with CPR. We show that although the carboxy-terminal deletion mutant of HO-2 is found in the nucleus, translocation of HO-2 to the nucleus does not occur under conditions of hypoxia. Thus, we demonstrate that proteolytic regulation and nuclear translocation under hypoxic conditions is specific for HO-1. In addition we show for the first time that CPR prevents this translocation and promotes oligomerization of HO-1. Based on these findings, CPR may modulate gene expression via the amount of nuclear HO-1. This is of particular relevance as CPR is a highly polymorphic gene and deficiency syndromes of CPR have been described in humans.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heme oxygenase (HO) is the only known enzyme degrading pro-oxidant heme to the antioxidant biliverdin, iron and carbon monoxide <xref rid="pone.0035483-Tenhunen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

The constitutive HO-2 (36 kDa) is mainly found in brain and testis <xref rid="pone.0035483-Trakshel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

So far expression of HOs with subsequent purification has only been done in <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria. For the study of full length HOs that are anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum with their carboxy-terminus such a prokaryotic expression system is not ideal. The current study is the first to address expression and purification of both HO isoforms and their carboxy-terminal deletion mutants using a eukaryotic expression system. This includes the study of their subcellular localization under normoxic and hypoxic conditions using fluorescent fusion proteins and their interaction with CPR by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and co-purification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>Unless stated otherwise, chemicals were purchased in highest purity from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany).

At first this is surprising because carboxy-terminal deletion of 23 amino acids of HO-1 has previously been shown not to negatively affect HO activity <xref rid="pone.0035483-Wilks1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and we fully confirm this finding in the current study. However, as emphasized by our current work the catalytic inactivity of the carboxy-terminally deleted enzyme described in <xref rid="pone.0035483-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> can be explained by a lack of CPR in the nucleus.</p><p>Nuclear HO-1 was demonstrated to alter binding of transcription factors involved in oxidative stress independent on degradation of heme or production of carbon monoxide <xref rid="pone.0035483-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035483-Lin2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Our work shows that CPR not only collaborates with HO-1 in its enzymatic function, but also influences the amount of nuclear HO-1 that alters gene expression in the nucleus. This is of particular relevance as CPR is a highly polymorphic gene <xref rid="pone.0035483-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035483-Gomes1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and deficiency syndromes of CPR have been described in humans <xref rid="pone.0035483-Fluck1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Mutations of CPR have recently been shown to differentially modulate HO-1 activity <xref rid="pone.0035483-Marohnic1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our paper suggests that mutations in the CPR promoter <xref rid="pone.0035483-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> or CPR deficiency could increase nuclear HO-1 and lead to subsequent alterations in gene expression.</p><p>Based on FRET experiments, it has recently been demonstrated that oligomerization is crucial for stability and function of HO-1 in the endoplasmic reticulum. This oligomerization was shown to be strongly dependent on the presence of the intact carboxy-terminus of HO-1 <xref rid="pone.0035483-Hwang1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. We fully confirm these findings for HO-1 using alternate methods in the current paper. In addition, we extend the findings to HO-2 and show that oligomerization of full length HO-2 is more complete than oligomerization of full length HO-1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035483-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Only when CPR is co-expressed, HO-1 reaches the oligomerization level of HO-2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035483-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These results obtained by gel filtration are in line with a recent report that CPR has an influence on HO-1 oligomerization based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) <xref rid="pone.0035483-Marohnic1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Because of the nature of BRET it could only be stated that &#x02018;CPR disrupted or otherwise influenced the conformation/configuration of the HO-1 multimers&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0035483-Marohnic1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our biochemical results using gel filtration support this notion and indicate that CPR increases HO-1 oligomerization.</p><p>It has been shown that oligomerization is crucial for the stability of HO-1 <xref rid="pone.0035483-Hwang1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Our observation that co-expression of CPR increases HO-1 oligomerization and prevents tryptic cleavage of HO-1 during hypoxia is consistent with this finding. The higher degree of oligomerization of HO-2 reported in the current study, is a plausible explanation for the greater stability of HO-2 versus HO-1. However, it is also conceivable that the carboxy-terminus of HO-2 is inherently more stable or that it does not contain the HO-1 specific recognition sequence for a tryptic protease that is induced by hypoxia. This would also be possible, because the sequence of the carboxy-termini of HO-1 and HO-2 are not highly conserved (&#x0223c;15&#x00025;). It is not ruled out that there exists a signal in the intact cell that leads to tryptic cleavage of the HO-2 carboxy-terminus and nuclear translocation of HO-2. In fact, the occurrence of a carboxy-terminally deleted tryptic fragment of HO-2 has been described after overexpression in <italic>E. coli</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0035483-Ishikawa2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, so far our experiments in eukaryotic cells indicate that HO-2 is quite stable and neither translocates in response to hypoxia nor in response to different hemin concentrations or hyperoxia (data not shown).</p><p>HO-2 has been suggested to function as an oxygen sensor for a calcium-sensitive potassium channel in glomus cells of the carotid and aortic bodies <xref rid="pone.0035483-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035483-Kemp1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035483-Adachi1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>: HO-2-derived CO maintains potassium channel activity in normoxia, while hypoxia leads to a reduction in CO formation, channel closure and depolarisation. While we demonstrate in the current paper that HO-2 does not translocate from the endoplasmic reticulum in response to hypoxia, HO-2 has recently been shown to be reversibly inactivated under hypoxic conditions by induction of the dithiol state of the carboxy-terminal heme regulatory motifs (see &#x0201c;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0035483.s001">Alignment S1</xref>&#x0201d;) and a subsequent increase of the K<sub>d</sub> for heme well above endogenous heme concentrations <xref rid="pone.0035483-Yi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0035483-Yi2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Thus, both HO-isoforms seem to have developed a mechanism of inactivation under conditions of hypoxia that fits their nature: The inducible HO-1 is inactivated by irreversible tryptic proteolysis and translocation away from the endoplasmic reticulum and away from CPR. The constitutive HO-2 is reversibly inactivated by the redox state of specific cysteines.</p><p>Besides the difference in reversibility there is another crucial difference between the inactivation mechanism of HO-1 and HO-2 in response to hypoxia. It has very recently been shown that there is an interdependence between HO activity and the activity of cytochrome P450 via competition for binding to CPR <xref rid="pone.0035483-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The translocation of HO-1 under conditions of hypoxia would increase the amount of CPR that can interact with cytochrome P450 <xref rid="pone.0035483-SzczesnaSkorupa1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, while the reversible inactivation of HO-2 under hypoxic conditions would not change its binding to CPR. As apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0035483-g009">Figure 9</xref>, CPR has the capacity to inhibit HO-1 translocation under hypoxic conditions. This adds another layer of complexity to the equilibrium between HO-1, CPR and drug metabolizing cytochrome P450.</p><p>In sum, we demonstrate that HO-1 and HO-2 respond differently to hypoxia in the intact cell, that their oligomerization status is different and that CPR influences oligomerization and prevents hypoxic translocation of HO-1 but not of HO-2. From a pharmacological perspective, it is important to note that hypoxia may change the competitive binding equilibrium between HO-1, drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 and their common partner CPR <xref rid="pone.0035483-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Thus hypoxia may not only have a direct inhibitory effect on heme metabolism but also a possible indirect activating effect on drug metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0035483.s001"><label>Alignment S1</label><caption><p>
