Based on the selective expression of stem cell surface markers, a method to specifically infect stem cells through antibody-conjugated lentiviral particles has been developed that can deliver both visual markers for live-cell imaging as well as selectable markers to enrich for iPS cells. Antibodies recognizing SSEA4 and CD24 mediated the selective infection of the iPS cells over the parental human fibroblasts, allowing for rapid expansion of these cells by puromycin selection. Adaptation of the vector allows for the selective marking of human embryonic stem (hES) cells for their removal from a population of differentiated cells. This method has the benefit that it not only identifies stem cells, but that specific genes, including positive and negative selection markers, regulatory genes or miRNA can be delivered to the targeted stem cells. The ability to specifically target gene delivery to human pluripotent stem cells has broad applications in tissue engineering and stem cell therapies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human embryonic stem cells (hES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are promising resources for gene therapy, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. However, culturing hES and iPS cells is a labor-intensive procedure requiring the enrichment of the pluripotent cells from a heterogeneous population capable of spontaneous differentiation. For iPS cells, a major bottleneck is the low efficiency of reprogramming and the process of identifying and selecting cells reaching the pluripotent state. For hES applications, the ability to drive differentiation toward specific pathways through the introduction of limited factors <xref rid="pone.0034778-Niakan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034778-Seguin1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> is of high interest. Subsequent removal of undifferentiated hES cells from a differentiated cell population could avoid the introduction of teratomas into patients. Safe and effective gene delivery is greatly advanced through targeting binding and content release via cell-type specific surface markers. This has been facilitated using lentiviral particles pseudotyped with a modified Sindbis virus envelope, capable of targeting gene delivery using a conjugated antibody <xref rid="pone.0034778-Morizono1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034778-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In this study, this system has been adapted for viral entry through cell-surface markers expressed on the hES and iPS cells.</p><p>The antibody-directed transduction system utilizes a modified Sindbis virus envelope, termed m 168, pseudotyped onto lentiviral particles <xref rid="pone.0034778-Morizono1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The modifications include the replacement of the laminin binding site with a protein A immunoglobulin G recognition domain (ZZ domain), and serial mutations to suppress heparin-binding sites. The insertion of the ZZ domain allows for targeted viral infection via conjugation with a specific antibody <xref rid="pone.0034778-Ohno1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. A variety of antibody molecules have been developed to be effective in targeting specific cell types <xref rid="pone.0034778-Pariente1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0034778-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

In this study we establish an Ab-mediated transduction system that allows viral entry into hES and iPS cells mediated by antibodies recognizing either the SSEA4 or CD24 surface molecules.</p><p>Embryo-derived hES cells offer great hope for their use in therapeutic treatment of various diseases, however ethical concerns regarding these cells remain. Recently, pioneering work indicates that the ectopic expression of transcriptional factors including Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc, Lin28, and Nanog could reprogram human somatic cells into iPS cells <xref rid="pone.0034778-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0034778-Lowry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. During the reprogramming process, fully reprogrammed iPS cell colonies emerge among a large and heterogeneous background population of fibroblasts and incompletely reprogrammed cells. At present, isolation of iPS cells from the heterogeneous population relies on manual selection of colonies via morphological criteria and live-cell staining <xref rid="pone.0034778-Lowry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034778-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Here we describe a robust technique for delivering reporter genes into human iPS cells through the Ab-directed targeted transduction system during reprogramming of somatic fibroblast cells to the pluripotent state. The successfully reprogrammed iPS cells can be specifically infected by the targeting Ab, marked by enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), and enriched under puromycin selection. This provides a relatively easy tool for monitoring and identifying potential iPS cells, as well as hES cells within a mixed heterogeneous population.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Optimization of gene transduction using VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors on the H9 human ES cell line</title><p>Poor viral transgene expression in hES cells is a well-known phenomenon.

Variation in the lentiviral vector backbone can also contribute to efficiency of gene transfer and cell expression profiles.

As a control, eGFP delivery in VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus was at a level of 93&#x00025;. Control infection using an IgG k2 isotype antibody resulted in transduction levels equivalent to the no antibody controls, indicating the absence of background from nonspecific transduction of igG antibodies (data not shown). Surprisingly, no transduction was observed using the FZD7 IgG antibody, despite being expressed on the surface of H9 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0034778.s002">Fig. S2</xref>), indicating that not every cell surface protein can serve as an effective receptor for the antibody-mediated transduction <xref rid="pone.0034778-Mazari1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034778-Sarangi1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Binding to a receptor is the first step of viral entry leading to a complex series of conformational changes required for membrane fusion and viral content release into the cellular cytoplasm, either at the cell surface or during transport through the cellular endosomal pathways.

Of critical interest was the ability to recognize human iPS cells, which have been shown to express similar markers as embryonic stem cells. In addition, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) and AG1 primary fibroblast (data not shown) were tested as target cells, as fibroblasts are a key source of cells for reprogramming protocols. Using the iPS5 cells line (from Dr. George Q. Daley lab) <xref rid="pone.0034778-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, the transduction efficiency paralleled that of human hES cells for all antibodies tested. Quite significantly, the virus conjugated with the SSEA4 and CD24 antibodies discriminated hES H9 and iPS cells from the differentiated HFF, with an average of 78&#x00025; and 70&#x00025; of the hES H9 and iPS cells, respectively, eGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> after infection in the presence of the CD24 antibody, compared with 1.2&#x00025; of the cells eGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> on the HFF (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0034778-t001">Table 1</xref>).

This differential for infection of hES and iPS cells over fibroblasts was not observed with the CD9 <xref rid="pone.0034778-Laslett1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> or the general HLA-1 antibody. Thus, gene delivery using the CD24 and SSEA4 antibody-conjugated targeting provides the specificity to infect the hES and iPS cells over fibroblast. All cells positive for infection showed &#x0003e;86&#x00025; cell surface expression of the marker protein (CD24, SSEA4, HLA-1 and CD9) by flow cytometry. HFF displayed extremely low cell surface expression for SSEA4 (average 3.3&#x00025;) and CD24 (2.5&#x00025;).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0034778-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0034778.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Antibody-specific transduction of stem and differentiated cells.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0034778-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0034778.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antibody</td><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">Cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">hES H9<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">a</xref>

In this study, we examined the ability of these specific Abs to selectively deliver genes to undifferentiated human ES cell by using the m 168 Sindbis Env antibody bridging system. On the basis of our results, we have demonstrated that lentiviral particles pseudotyped with modified Sindbis virus Envelopes (m 168) containing the immunoglobulin Fc-binding domain were able to target the hES cells and human iPS cells via anti-SSEA4 and anti-CD24 antibodies at a high transduction level with bias for the pluripotent stem cell over fibroblasts. The development of this technology has shown great enrichment of the pluripotent stem cells, enabling rapid and large-scale generation of iPS cells.</p><p>Although SSEA4 is a stem cell marker, CD24 is expressed on keratinocytes, mature granulocytes and in many B cells <xref rid="pone.0034778-Aasen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0034778-Kay1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> in addition to pluripotent stem cells. For the purpose of identifying iPS cells from skin fibroblasts, this is not a concern because the level of expression on the parental fibroblasts is not significant and thus the induction of CD24 expression on the stem cell is a valid marker for reprogramming. However, if the parental cells used for reprogramming is different, the level of expression of CD24 within this population would need to be verified in order to use this protocol to select for iPS cells.</p><p>Tissue specific gene delivery can be achieved through both the viral entry pathway and transcription regulation via specific promoters. The focus of these studies has been the targeted entry of the pseudotyped lentiviral particles, utilizing the EF1&#x003b1; promoter because of its general high level of expression in both the differentiated and undifferentiated cells from hES cultures. Additional layers of selection can be incorporated into this system through the use of stem cell specific promoters. Alternatively, lentiviral vectors in which the reported gene is linked with stage-specific miRNAs have recently been reported to allow for monitoring the reprogramming state of HFF <xref rid="pone.0034778-Kamata1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Combining these transcription/post-transcription systems with the targeted entry would increase the specificity in defining iPS cells in a heterogeneous live cell culture.</p><p>The ability to select for the SSEA4 or CD24-targeted cells with puromycin does provide an advantage to enrich and amplify the reprogrammed cells, especially if the efficiency of iPS formation is low.

It should be noted that the cells transduced within the iPS colony are not characteristically distinct from the other cells, but rather reflects the ability of the virus to infect a pre-formed colony. Morphological selection of putative iPS colonies remains a criteria for passage of cells, and thus distinguishes them from the nonspecific background. In addition, the anti-SSEA4 and anti-CD24 antibody conjugated m 168-pseudotyped lentivirus can discriminate hES cells from mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells and thus avoid gene delivery into the support cells, if the hES cell lines are cultured on MEF feeder cells. The approach also has the potential to deliver reprogramming factors that may be limiting, allowing for the conversion of reprogramming intermediates to true iPS colonies during the selection process <xref rid="pone.0034778-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The use of lentiviral pseudotyped viruses do result in an integrated copy of the transfer vector, and the vectors can be adapted to include the <italic>cre/lox</italic> system to allow for subsequent excision.
