Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounts for 75% of the RCC. The previous studies on the RTKs in ccRCCs mainly focused on their gene expressions. The activation and function of the RTKs in ccRCC have not been fully investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In the present study, we analyzed the phosphorylation patterns of RTKs in human ccRCC patient samples, human ccRCC and papillary RCC cell lines, and other kidney tumor samples using human phospho-RTK arrays. We further established ccRCC patient-derived xenograft models in nude mice and assessed the effects of RTKIs (RTK Inhibitors) on the growth of these cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the localization of keratin, vimentin and PDGFR&#x003b2; in ccRCCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We found that the RTK phosphorylation patterns of the ccRCC samples were all very similar, but different from that of the cell lines, other kidney tumor samples, as well as the adjacent normal tissues. 9 RTKs, EGFR1&#x02013;3, Insulin R, PDGFR&#x003b2;, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, HGFR and M-CSFR were found to be phosphorylated in the ccRCC samples. The adjacent normal tissues, on the other hand, had predominantly only two of the 4 EGFR family members, EGFR and ErbB4, phosphorylated. What&#x02019;s more, the RTK phosphorylation pattern of the xenograft, however, was different from that of the primary tissue samples. Treatment of the xenograft nude mice with corresponding RTK inhibitors effectively inhibited the Erk1/2 signaling pathway as well as the growth of the tumors. In addition, histological staining of the cancer samples revealed that most of the PDGFR&#x003b2; expressing cells were localized in the vimentin-positive periepithelial stroma.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Overall, we have identified a set of RTKs that are characteristically phosphorylated in ccRCCs. The phosphorylation of RTKs in ccRCCs were determined by the growing environments. These phosphorylated/activated RTKs will guide targeting drugs development of more effective therapies in ccRCCs. The synergistical inhibition of RTKIs combination on the ccRCC suggest a novel strategy to use a combination of RTKIs to treat ccRCCs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)</kwd><kwd>Activation and function</kwd><kwd>Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs)</kwd><kwd>Targeted therapy</kwd><kwd>PDGFR&#x003b2;</kwd><kwd>Stroma cells</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81673465</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution> China National Key Research and Development Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1705505</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par14">Kidney cancers are common in developed countries and are notoriously difficult to be treated. Ninety percent of kidney cancers are renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) which originate from tubular structures of the kidney. They are subdivided into clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC), papillary carcinoma, chromophobe, and oncocytoma. The remaining 10% are transitional cell carcinomas, which are derived from cells lining the renal pelvis and ureter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Standard treatments for RCCs are surgery (partial or total nephrectomy) for localized kidney cancer, targeted therapies and immunotherapies for metastasized cancer. Seventy-five percent of the RCCs are ccRCCs which are poorly sensitive to traditional chemotherapy. Targeted therapies are also limited by the lack of knowledge of genetic mutations in the ccRCC cells.</p><p id="Par15">The receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a large family of transmembrane receptors with 58 members in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The ligand-induced dimerization of the RTKs lead to phosphorylation/activation of the receptors as well as the downstream signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. RTKs play critical roles in the development of many diseases, especially cancer. Dysregulations of the RTK signaling through point mutation, gene amplification, overexpression, chromosomal alterations, and/or constitutive activation are key factors in oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the activation and function of the RTKs in ccRCC have not been fully investigated.</p><p id="Par16">Previous studies in ccRCCs have mainly focused on RTKs gene expressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. No genetic mutations of RTKs have been reported in the ccRCCs. The only molecular mechanism related to RTKs in ccRCCs is dysregulation of the pVHL/HIF axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which drives expression of VEGF and PDGF&#x003b2; and, hence, activation of their receptors VEGFR2 and PDGFR&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, current treatments for ccRCCs are mostly anti-angiogenic tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting VEGFR, which include pazopanib, sunitinib, axitinib, sorafenib, and bevacizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">In the present study, we analyzed the phosphorylation/activation/ patterns of RTKs in 10 ccRCC patient samples, 4 RCC cell lines, and 4 other kidney tumor samples. Our data revealed that multiple RTKs were activated in the ccRCCs and the phosphorylation patterns of the RTKs in the ccRCC patients were similar to each other but different from adjacent normal tissues and the other kidney tumors. Treatments with a combination of RTK inhibitors based on their phosphorylation patterns in the ccRCC-derived xenografts effectively inhibited the cancer cell growth. These data suggest an effective therapeutic strategy to treat ccRCC patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Collection of primary kidney tumors</title><p id="Par18">The renal tissue specimens were collected in compliance with local ethics regulations at the Department of Urology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China.

The RTK phosphorylation patterns of the four human RCC cell lines were similar with each other (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The EGFR family and HGFR were highly phosphorylated in all the four cell lines. In contrast, the RTK phosphorylation patterns of the four other types of tumor samples, namely a papillary RCC (RE0020), an oncocytoma (RE0150), a renal pelvic carcinoma (RE0210), and a cystic nephroma (RE0500), were different from each other and were also different from that of the ccRCCs, except EGFR, which was highly phosphorylated in all samples (Fig.<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). ErbB4, Insulin R, and IGF-1R were phosphorylated in the papillary RCC (RE0020), Mer (Axl family) was phosphorylated in the oncocytoma (RE0150), and HGFR, PDGFR&#x003b1;, and PDGFR&#x003b2; were phosphorylated in the renal pelvic carcinoma (RE0210, Fig.<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In the benign renal tumor, namely the cystic nephroma sample (RE0500), only EGFR was phosphorylated (Fig.<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These data demonstrated that the RTK phosphorylation patterns of the ccRCCs were specific.

Thirty-five tissue pieces from the 10 samples of the ccRCCs were subcutaneously implanted into 35 nude mice. Only one xenograft (RE0410) grew successfully. We then analyzed the RTK phosphorylation pattern of this ccRCC explant. The RTK phosphorylation pattern of the xenograft was different from its original primary sample (RE0410). Only the phosphorylation of EGFR family (EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB3) and HGFR were maintained at high levels while that of the other RTKs decreased (Fig.<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). In contrast to the poor tumorigenicity of the ccRCC samples from patients, the established cell lines of ccRCC and papillary RCC were highly tumorigenic. Both EGFR and HGFR remained phosphorylated in all four of the cell line-derived xenograft samples, although their phosphorylation levels decreased in vivo (Fig.<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b, c). These data demonstrated that the RTK phosphorylation patterns in the xenografts changed and the success rate of subcutaneous grafting of ccRCC samples was low in nude mice.

To understand the function of the PDGFR&#x003b2; in the ccRCCs, we analyzed the expression of PDGFR&#x003b2; in the patient-derived ccRCCs and their adjacent tissues. The PDGFR&#x003b2; was mainly expressed in glomerulus in the tumor adjacent tissues (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a). In the ccRCC tumor tissues, PDGFR&#x003b2; was present in the vimentin-positive stroma cells surrounding the tumor islands and blood vessels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>b, c). But the keratin-positive epithelial cells were mainly localized in the tumor islands which were PDGFR&#x003b2;-negative (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>b, c). These results suggest that the PDGFR&#x003b2; expressing cells were periepithelial stroma cells in the ccRCCs.

More importantly, the phosphorylation patterns of the RTKs in the ccRCC patient samples were similar among each other. It is therefore possible that the activation of the 6 ccRCCs-specific RTKs are important for the formation and growth of the ccRCCs. Our data are consistent with previous studies on the expressions and roles of RTKs in ccRCCs. There were several reports demonstrated VEGF/VEGFR activation and HGFR upregulation in patients with ccRCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The M-CSFR activation we observed in the ccRCC samples may be due to increases and activations of the tumor-associated macrophages in ccRCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The role of Insulin R in ccRCCs is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. There was a report showing that the expressions of Insulin R were similar in ccRCCs and their adjacent normal tissues, but the phosphorylation of the Insulin R was not analyzed in this report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our data demonstrated that the Insulin R was significantly phosphorylated in the ccRCC samples, but not in the adjacent normal tissues, suggesting that Insulin R may have a role in promoting ccRCC cell growth. However, it was also reported that Insulin R expression correlated with a lower Fuhrman nuclear grade and better patient prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Further studies are needed to clarify the roles of Insulin R in ccRCCs. None the less, these data suggest that the 6 specifically activated RTKs in the ccRCCs may be important targets for the treatment of ccRCCs.</p><p id="Par34">Among the 6 specifically activated RTKs, HGFR and Insulin R were reported to be mainly expressed in the ccRCC epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The M-CSF R seems to be expressed in the tumor-associated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] while the VEGFRs were likely expressed in the blood vessel endothelial cells. The PDGFR&#x003b2; was found to be mainly expressed within the periepithelial stroma in the ccRCC samples in our study. Similar expression patterns of PDGFR&#x003b2; were found in breast, prostate, pancreatic, gastric, and oral squamous cell carcinoma cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. More importantly, high PDGFR&#x003b2; expression in fibroblast-rich stroma is commonly associated with poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These data suggest that the RTKs in the ccRCC stroma cells may also be abnormally activated to support the growth of the cancer cells. Thus, targeting the activated RTKs in both the cancer epithelial cells and the surrounding stroma cells that associated with poor prognosis may be a primary choice for treating the ccRCC patients.</p><p id="Par35">It is unclear what caused the activation of the RTKs in the ccRCCs. The behavior of the ccRCCs in the xenograft mice, however, indicated that majority of the 9 RTKs might be activated by their corresponding growth factors in the tumor environments. When the cancer cells were implanted into a new environment in the xenograft mice, most of the cancer cells failed to grow, likely because of lack of necessary growth factors to activate the RTKs. The only ccRCC sample that did grow in the xenograft mouse had different RTK phosphorylation patterns from that of the original sample. In addition, the four cancer cell lines, when implanted into the xenograft mice, also showed similar RTK phosphorylation patterns as the primary cancer sample, but different from that of the in vitro growing cells. All these data suggest that the RTK phosphorylation patterns of the cancer cells are not cell autonomous, but rather are determined by their growing environments.</p><p id="Par36">Although we could not reproduce the same RTK phosphorylation patterns of the ccRCC primary cancer samples in the xenograft models, the treatment of the tumor cells in the xenograft mice with a combination of the RTKIs, based on the RTK phosphorylation patterns, successfully inhibited the tumor cell growth, suggesting that the RTK phosphorylation pattern-guided treatment of cancers is an effective therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par37">In summary, we have identified a set of RTKs that are characteristically phosphorylated in ccRCCs. The phosphorylation of the RTKs and the growth of the ccRCCs were determined by the growing environments of the ccRCCs. Treatment of the ccRCC xenograft mouse with a combination of RTKIs based on the RTK phosphorylation pattern of the ccRCC in the new environment synergistically inhibited the growth of the ccRCC. These data suggest a novel strategy to use a combination of RTKIs to treat ccRCCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
