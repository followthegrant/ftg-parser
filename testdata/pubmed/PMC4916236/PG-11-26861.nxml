Prior to surgery, all patients had undergone either a barium enema or colonoscopy to exclude a proximal colonic lesion. Preoperative evaluation of constipation and incontinence was done for all patients using the Cleveland Clinic Florida (Wexner) faecal incontinence score. Preoperatively, incontinence was seen in 5 (50%) patients and constipation in 4 (40%). Preoperatively, all patients were advised to perform Kegel sphincter exercises. Patients underwent adequate bowel preparation the day before surgery and were on only plain liquids up to the night before surgery. They were kept nil orally from the night before surgery and were given a dose of antibiotics before surgery. The study included patients with symptomatic rectal prolapse with the ability to understand the study purpose; patients with redundant sigmoid and patients who were unable to understand the study purpose were excluded from the study.</p><sec id="S20004"><title>Technique</title><p>The technique was under general anaesthesia, a cameraman was to the left of the patient, and the nurse near the right hand of the surgeon.

The peritoneum was opened and a SILS<sup>&#x02122;</sup>PT 12 port was introduced; this port has four openings: one for gas insufflation and three that can accommodate trocars ranging from 5 to 12 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The compressibility of the elastic polymer allows the access ports to expand and form fit the space in which they reside as well as enabling the ports to pass through the working channels.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>SILS port and trocars 5&#x02013;12 mm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PG-11-26861-g001"/></fig><p>The peritoneum was maintained at 10&#x02013;12 mm Hg. A 5-mm 30&#x000b0; long scope was introduced into one of the openings in the SILS port (through the 12-mm trocar). The patient was then placed in the Trendelenberg position. A second right port (5 mm), third left port in (5 mm). The dissection was started by opening the peritoneum on the right side of rectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>) using a harmonic scalpel, with identification of the right ureter to safeguard it, then dissection of the rectum from the presacral fascia, staying close to the rectum to avoid injury to pre-sacral venous plexus and autonomic nerves. Then dissection was done on left side after identifying the left ureter. Dissection was carried out downwards to the pelvic floor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>), then the mesh was placed behind the dissected rectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>) and the upper end of the mesh was fixed to the presacral fascia using 2-0 Prolene over the sacral promontory. Then another stay suture was made over the lower part of the mesh, and the mesh was fixed on either side of the rectum. A closed suction drain was inserted in the presacral region and reperitonealised with 2-0 Vicryl.</p><fig id="F0002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Opening the peritoneum on the right side to enter the holy plane</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PG-11-26861-g002"/></fig><fig id="F0003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Dissection of rectum up to the pelvic floor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PG-11-26861-g003"/></fig><fig id="F0004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Suturing the rectum to the fixed mesh</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PG-11-26861-g004"/></fig><p>In the post operative period all patients started oral fluids on the second day and took stool softener for 15 days.

More than half of patients with rectal prolapse have coexisting incontinence due to impaired rectal adaptation to distention [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Improvement in continence post laparoscopic mesh rectopexy in this study was 60%, compared to other studies that showed a figure of 80% [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Improvement in constipation post laparoscopic mesh rectopexy in this study was 75%, compared to other studies at (47.3%) [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the mean duration of mesh rectopexy was 120 min (range: 90&#x02013;150 min), compared to another study with the average operating time of 140 min (range: 105&#x02013;240 min) as reported by Siproudhis <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study the mean post-operative hospital stay was 4 days (range: 2&#x02013;6 days) compared to 5 &#x000b1;0.93 in another study [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications in this study. In this study, constipation was observed in 4 (40%) of 10 patients preoperatively, in the postoperative period, and 3 of 4 (75%) patients of mesh rectopexy improved as regards their constipation. In this study there was no recurrence after surgery (6 months follow-up) compared to other studies, in which the recurrence ranged from 0% to 6% [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although this study was without a control group the results are satisfactory and single-port laparoscopic mesh rectopexy is an effective and safe minimally invasive procedural alternative to open procedures, with similar success rates and no additional complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0009"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Single-port laparoscopic mesh rectopexy is a safe
