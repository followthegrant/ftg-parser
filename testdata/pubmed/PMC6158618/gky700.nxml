We have shown that the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway and its central component, DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (pol &#x003b2;), in particular, its polymerase activity plays an active role in regulating somatic TNR instability. Herein, we revealed a unique role of the pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase in preventing somatic TNR instability. We found that deficiency of pol &#x003b2; deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) lyase activity locked the pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase domain to a dRP group, and this &#x02018;tethered&#x02019; pol &#x003b2; to its template forcing the polymerase to perform a processive DNA synthesis. This subsequently promoted DNA strand slippage allowing pol &#x003b2; to skip over a template loop and causing TNR deletion. We showed that the effects were eliminated by complementation of the dRP lyase deficiency with wild-type pol &#x003b2; protein. The results indicate that pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity restrained the pol &#x003b2;-dRP interaction to suppress a pol &#x003b2; processive DNA synthesis, thereby preventing TNR deletion. This further implicates a potential of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase inhibition as a novel treatment of TNR-expansion diseases.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Institutes of Health</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>ES023569</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000001</named-content></funding-source><award-id>DMR-1555361</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Expansion of trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) in the human genome is responsible for the development of over 42 human neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases including Huntington's disease (HD), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). TNRs associated with the neurodegenerative diseases include CAG, CTG, CGG and GAA repeats, which are located at different loci of the related disease-causing genes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). On the other hand, deletions of CAG repeats in the androgen receptor are associated with prostate and ovarian cancers (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Thus, TNR instability, i.e.&#x000a0;TNR expansion and deletion, is involved in the initiation and progression of both neurodegeneration and cancer. Extensive studies have shown that DNA replication, repair, recombination, and gene transcription underlie TNR instability (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>). Among them, the role of DNA repair in mediating TNR somatic instability is implicated due to its association with age-dependent somatic TNR expansions in non-proliferating neuronal tissues of human (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Major DNA repair pathways including DNA base excision repair (BER) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), mismatch repair (MMR) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and transcription coupled-nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) are all involved in modulating TNR instability. An age-dependent somatic TNR expansion induced by oxidative DNA damage highlights a crucial role of the BER pathway in modulating somatic TNR instability (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This is because TNRs are tandem repeats containing stretches of guanines, cytosines, and adenines, which form hotspots of DNA base damage induced by endogenous and environmental stresses. These include oxidized and alkylated bases that are subject to BER (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We have previously shown that BER of oxidized and alkylated DNA base lesions in tracts of TNRs can cause both TNR deletions and expansions (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>) upon the location of a base lesion in a duplex TNR tract (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We further demonstrate that BER of a base lesion located in a TNR hairpin loop results in the removal of the hairpin preventing TNR expansion (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This indicates that DNA base lesions exhibit a position effect on TNR instability during BER. The effect is mediated by the formation of secondary structures that occur in a TNR tract, which subsequently regulates the efficiency of synthesis and removal of TNRs by DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (pol &#x003b2;) and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1). If pol &#x003b2; synthesize more repeats than those removed by FEN1, repeat expansion occurs. However, if pol &#x003b2; inserts fewer repeats than those removed by FEN1, repeat deletion occurs (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Thus, the balance between the activities of pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis and FEN1 flap cleavage in processing TNRs determines whether TNRs are expanded or deleted. Moreover, the balance can be altered by the crosstalk between pol &#x003b2; and the mismatch repair protein, MSH2-MSH3, which stimulates pol &#x003b2; synthesis of TNRs and promotes TNR expansion (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These results have demonstrated the importance of the polymerase activity of pol &#x003b2; in mediating TNR instability during BER.</p><p>However, as a bifunctional DNA polymerase, pol &#x003b2; also contains an 8-kD N-terminal lyase domain (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), which has the deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) lyase activity that removes a 5&#x02032;-dRP group generated from the 5&#x02032;-incision of an abasic site by AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) through &#x003b2;-elimination (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). It has been shown that it is the pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity that protects cells from DNA damage-induced cytotoxicity rather than its DNA polymerase activity (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Thus, the dRP lyase activity of pol &#x003b2; plays an essential role in mammalian embryonic and cellular survival (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), whereas its polymerase activity can be compensated by DNA replication polymerases and other DNA repair polymerases. It has also been shown that the dRP lyase activity of pol &#x003b2; is much faster than its DNA synthesis activity (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A recent study from the Wilson group has also demonstrated that pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase domain performs a processive search for a 1 nt gap (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). This indicates that pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase initially searches for the 1 nt gap with a dRP group and removes the dRP group leaving the 1 nt gap (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) that is subsequently filled in by pol &#x003b2; gap-filling DNA synthesis via its polymerase activity. This results in a nick that is ligated by DNA ligases (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Thus, the dRP lyase and polymerase activities of pol &#x003b2; are sequentially coordinated to ensure the efficient single-nucleotide/short-patch BER that removes AP sites and dRP groups preventing cell death and genome instability. However, it remains a puzzle how pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity is involved in the cellular maintenance of genome stability including repeat sequence stability.</p><p>Since TNRs form hotspots of DNA base lesions and their lengths undergo dynamic changes during BER, BER-mediated TNR instability can be used as an ideal system to test the importance of both the polymerase and dRP lyase activities of pol &#x003b2; in maintaining genome stability. Furthermore, since the removal of 5&#x02032;-dRP residue by the pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase is mediated by &#x003b2;-elimination during which a transient covalent bond is formed between Lys 72 of the pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase domain and a dRP group (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), it is possible that during BER of a base lesion in a TNR tract, the interaction between the pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase domain and a dRP group may prevent DNA slippage and the formation of DNA secondary structures, thereby suppressing TNR instability. Also, since the lyase domain of pol &#x003b2; cooperates with the N-terminal subdomain of its polymerase domain to form a doughnut-shaped structure to wrap around double-strand DNA (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity may also cooperate with its polymerase activity to prevent TNR instability.</p><p>In this study, employing pol &#x003b2; mutational analysis, a fluorescence-based DNA slippage assay that was newly developed by our group along with the sodium boric hydride crosslink trapping assay, we explored a unique role of the pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity in modulating TNR instability during BER. Surprisingly, we found that pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity prevented TNR deletions by suppressing the processive synthesis of TNRs by pol &#x003b2; as well as inhibiting DNA strand slippage and the formation of TNR secondary structures on the template strand.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Materials</title><p>DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA).

These appeared to be generated by the pol &#x003b2;-independent long-patch BER pathway mediated by replicative DNA polymerases suggesting that the pol &#x003b2;-independent long-patch BER pathway also resulted in TNR instability. Complementation of pol &#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cell extracts with purified pol &#x003b2; K72A mutant protein having less than 10% wild-type level of dRP lyase activity (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) failed to affect repeat deletions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels C and I) during BER, whereas complementation of pol &#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cell extracts with pol &#x003b2; H34G mutant protein having &#x0223c;50% wild-type level of dRP lyase activity (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) significantly reduced GAA repeat deletions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel D), but failed to affect CAG repeat deletion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel J).

In addition, complementation of pol &#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> extracts with the pol &#x003b2; 8 kD domain resulted in the similar sizes of GAA and CAG repeat deletion products as the ones generated by pol &#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> extracts mediated-BER (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, panels A and B to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels B and H), indicating that pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase domain alone was insufficient to prevent TNR instability during BER.

To address this, we characterized pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis of the pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase deficient mutants during the repair of a native sugar in a GAA and CAG repeat tract. The results revealed that pol &#x003b2; K72A mutant at 10 nM exhibited a highly processive DNA synthesis on both the (GAA)<sub>20</sub> and (CAG)<sub>20</sub> repeat substrates, and this was independent of FEN1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panels A and B, lanes 3&#x02013;4). Pol &#x003b2; H34G mutant at the same concentration also exhibited a significantly improved processive DNA synthesis on the substrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panels A and B, lanes 7&#x02013;8). However, pol &#x003b2; WT only exhibited a distributive DNA synthesis on the substrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panels A and B, lanes 11&#x02013;12). The results showed that the processive DNA synthesis by the pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase mutants could not reach to the end of the substrates because the synthesis products were shorter than the full length of the substrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panels A and B, compare the size of the pol &#x003b2; synthesis products in lanes 3&#x02013;4 and 7&#x02013;8 to the size of the substrates in lane 1). Thus, the repaired products were generated only through FEN1 cleavage and ligation by LIG I. This was further supported by the fact that BER reconstituted with pol &#x003b2; K72A mutant protein resulted in the repaired product only in the presence of both FEN1 and LIG I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panels A and B, lanes 5 and 6), whereas BER reconstituted with pol &#x003b2; H34G mutant or pol &#x003b2; WT led to the repaired product with the presence of LIG I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panels A and B, lanes 9&#x02013;10 and 13&#x02013;14). The presence of FEN1 significantly increased the amounts of the repaired product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panels A and B, compare lane 10 to lane 9 and lanes 14 to 13). The results indicate that deficiency of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity significantly promoted the pol &#x003b2; processive DNA synthesis activity during BER in TNR tracts. This further indicated that pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity suppressed the polymerase activity suggesting that efficient removal of the 5&#x02032;-dRP group by pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase domain restrained its ability to further synthesize DNA.

We tested this possibility by detecting the formation of TNR loop structures on the template strands of the repaired products resulting from BER with the (GAA)<sub>20</sub> and (CAG)<sub>20</sub> substrates using S1 nuclease that specifically cleaves the single-stranded regions of TNR hairpins and loops (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). We found that S1 nuclease cleavage on the repaired product from BER with pol &#x003b2; K72A mutant protein and FEN1 resulted in the cleavage products containing 38 to 62 nucleotides on the template strand of the (GAA)<sub>20</sub> substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panel A, lanes 2&#x02013;5). S1 cleavage products with the same sizes were produced through BER with pol &#x003b2; H34G mutant protein in the absence and presence of FEN1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panels B and C, lanes 2&#x02013;5). The results indicate that BER mediated by the pol &#x003b2; mutant proteins resulted in the formation of a (TTC)<sub>9</sub> loop on the template strand of the repaired product. However, S1 nuclease cleavage on the repaired product from BER with pol &#x003b2; WT generated only 53 nt and 55 nt products independent of FEN1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panels D and E, lanes 2&#x02013;5) indicating no repeat loops formed on the template strand of the repaired product. Similarly, for the (CAG)<sub>20</sub> substrate, S1 nuclease cleavage on the template strand of the repaired product with pol &#x003b2; K72A mutant in the presence of FEN1 or pol &#x003b2; H34G mutant in the absence of FEN1 resulted in the cleavage products containing 42&#x02013;51 nucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panel F, lanes 2&#x02013;5) and 51 nt and 55 nt products (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panel G, lanes 2&#x02013;5). However, S1 nuclease cleavage on the template strand of the repaired product with pol &#x003b2; H34G mutant in the presence of FEN1 led to the cleavage product containing 51 nt only. The results indicate that the mutant promoted the formation of a (CTG)<sub>4</sub> and (CTG)<sub>2</sub> loop on the template strand of the repaired product. In contrast, S1 nuclease cleavage on the repaired product resulting from pol &#x003b2; WT only generated the 51 nt product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panels I and J, lanes 2&#x02013;5).

To test this, we developed a fluorescence-based DNA slippage assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) to measure the dynamics of repeat strand slippage of the substrates in the presence of pol &#x003b2; WT and mutant proteins during BER. During BER, a single-stranded break is generated in the damaged strand in TNR tracts by incubation with UDG and APE1, and the downstream of the damaged strand slips upon DNA synthesis of pol &#x003b2;. This allows the 6-FAM group on the damaged strand of the substrates to be dissociated from the template strand and positioned far away from the BHQ-1 leading to a detectable level of the fluorescence signal. Our results revealed that during BER at different time intervals, pol &#x003b2; K72A mutant resulted in the highest level of fluorescence in both GAA and CAG repeats (red), and pol &#x003b2; H34G mutant resulted in the second highest level of fluorescence signal (blue) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, panels A and B). However, pol &#x003b2; WT only resulted in a low background level of fluorescence (magenta) that is comparable to the one with APE1 only (grey). It should be noted that under the condition without the repeat strand slippage, i.e. in the presence of APE1 with the substrate alone (grey), only a low background fluorescence signal was detected. This indicates that no spontaneous separation between the fluorophore and quencher in the substrates in the absence of pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis. Similarly, pol &#x003b2; WT with weak DNA synthesis activity also led to a low fluorescence signal (magenta) demonstrating that limited DNA strand slippage induced by the limited DNA synthesis of pol &#x003b2; WT only produced a low level of fluorescence signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, panels A and B, compared &#x02018;magenta&#x02019; to &#x02018;grey&#x02019;).

Based on this model, the slope of the curve, <italic>k</italic>, was obtained, and the rate of strand slippage (the separation of the 6-FAM group in the downstream damaged strand from the BHQ-1 group in the template strand) was calculated according to the equation: The rate of strand slippage = [Total substrate amount (1000 fmol) &#x000d7; percentage of the products (&#x0003e;1 nt insertion)/IF<sub>2min</sub>] &#x000d7; <italic>k</italic>. The percentage of the products (&#x0003e; 1 nt insertion) was determined by conducting the gel-based experiments using the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled substrates in parallel (data not shown). The results showed that during BER in GAA repeats, pol &#x003b2; K72A mutant caused the strand slippage 2-fold faster than pol &#x003b2; H34G mutant (26.80 fmol &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> vs. 11.20 fmol &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and 14.9-fold faster than pol &#x003b2; WT (1.80 fmol &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Similarly, for BER with CAG repeat substrate, pol &#x003b2; K72A mutant also caused strand slippage (17.20 fmol &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) 1.7-fold faster than pol &#x003b2; H34G mutant (10.00 fmol &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and 8-fold faster than wild-type pol &#x003b2; (2.00 fmol &#x000d7; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The results indicate that deficiency of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity significantly promoted TNR strand slippage, whereas efficient dRP lyase activity of pol &#x003b2; WT suppressed repeat strand slippage. This further suggests that failure in removal of the dRP group led to a persistent interaction between pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase domain and the 5&#x02032;-dRP group promoting TNR slippage during BER. In addition, for the random DNA sequence-containing substrate, pol &#x003b2; H34G (blue) and WT (magenta) only led to a low background level of fluorescence that is comparable to the one with APE1 only (grey) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Pol &#x003b2; K72A mutant produced a lower level of fluorescence signal in the context of random DNA sequence (red) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>) than that in the context of GAA and CAG repeats (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, panels A and B, &#x02018;red&#x02019; to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, &#x02018;red&#x02019;). This suggests that the strand-displacement DNA synthesis by pol &#x003b2; K72A led to the dissociation of the 6-FAM-dT from the BHQ-1-dT in the template strand. Interestingly, the fluorescence signal generated by pol &#x003b2; K72A mutant (red) was reduced during later time intervals (20&#x02013;120 s) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>) suggesting the reannealing of the displaced 5&#x02032;-flaps to the template strand. This further suggests that no secondary structureswere formed in the 5&#x02032;-flaps with random DNA sequence.</p><fig id="F6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>The strand slippage of TNRs during BER of a native abasic site.

Thus, we reason that the dRP lyase mutant proteins, pol &#x003b2; K72A, and H34G may persistently interact with 5&#x02032;-dRP due to lack of the ability of removing the sugar, and this then keeps the mutant polymerases staying on the template and continuously synthesizing DNA without a constraint, thereby leading to a processive DNA synthesis. To test this possibility, we examined the formation of a pol &#x003b2;-dRP complex via the Schiff base covalent linkage in TNR tracts at different time intervals (0&#x02013;15 min) using NaHB<sub>4</sub> crosslinking trapping assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The results showed that the formation of the pol &#x003b2; K72A-dRP crosslink complex in both (GAA)<sub>20</sub> and (CAG)<sub>20</sub> repeat tracts, was detected even over 15 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, panel A, lanes 4&#x02013;9 and lanes 13&#x02013;18), whereas pol &#x003b2; H34G-dRP crosslink complex in the repeat tracts was only detected between 0 min to 5 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, panel B, lanes 4&#x02013;7 and lanes 13&#x02013;16).

This indicates that deficiency of dRP lyase activity of pol &#x003b2; through K72A and H34G mutations allowed the dRP lyase domain to persistently interact with the dRP group. This is further supported by the results from the experiment during which the processivity of pol &#x003b2; H34G and pol &#x003b2; WT was significantly stimulated during BER of a reduced sugar, (tetrahydrofuran) in both (GAA)<sub>20</sub> and (CAG)<sub>20</sub> repeat tracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).

We found that deficiency of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity failed to suppress GAA and CAG repeat deletions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, complementation of the dRP lyase deficiency with pol &#x003b2; WT eliminated the repeat deletions (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We demonstrated that pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity efficiently prevented a processive DNA synthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), the formation of loop structures on the template (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), and repeat strand slippage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), thereby suppressing repeat deletions. We further demonstrated that deficiency of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity led to sustainment of a dRP group, which subsequently &#x02018;tethered&#x02019; pol &#x003b2; protein on the TNR tracts through the pol &#x003b2;-dRP interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) forcing the polymerase to switch its DNA synthesis from a distributive mode to a processive mode (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The results allowed us to propose a model that illustrates the role of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity in maintaining TNR instability during BER (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). During BER of a base lesion in a TNR tract, the base lesion is removed by a damage-specific DNA glycosylase. This results in an abasic site that is 5&#x02032;-incised by APE1, leaving a 1 nt gap with a 5&#x02032;-dRP group. Proficient pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity removes the dRP group and fills in the 1 nt gap allowing pol &#x003b2; to fall off the DNA template. This suppresses pol &#x003b2; processive DNA synthesis, TNR strand slippage, and the formation of loop structures on the template, thereby preventing TNR deletions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, sub-pathway 1). Deficiency of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase results in the sustainment of the dRP group, which &#x02018;tethers&#x02019; pol &#x003b2; on the TNR template allowing the polymerase to perform a highly processive DNA synthesis. This subsequently promotes repeat strand slippage and the formation of loop structures on the template strand and allows the enzyme to skip over the loop structures causing repeat deletions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, sub-pathway 2).</p><fig id="F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>The dRP lyase of pol &#x003b2; prevents TNR deletion by suppressing a processive DNA synthesis and repeat strand slippage during BER. A DNA base lesion that occurs in the TNR tract is removed by a damage-specific DNA glycosylase. This results in an abasic site that is subsequently 5&#x02032;-incised by APE1, leaving a 1 nt gap with a 5&#x02032;-dRP moiety. If the dRP lyase activity of pol &#x003b2; is proficient, the Lys72 of pol &#x003b2; forms the Schiff base with the 5&#x02032;-dRP group preventing DNA strand slippage. The dRP lyase then removes the dRP group leaving a 1 nt gap. Pol &#x003b2; then fills in the gap generating nick and dissociates from the product, and the nick is sealed by LIG I. This allows pol &#x003b2; to adopt a distributive DNA synthesis mode, thereby preventing repeat deletion (sub-pathway 1). On the other hand, deficiency of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase caused by dRP lyase mutations locks the dRP lyase domain to the dRP residue. This &#x02018;tethers&#x02019; pol &#x003b2; to its template allowing it to adopt a processive DNA synthesis mode. This results in DNA slippage and promotes the formation of loop structures on the template and pol &#x003b2; skip-over of the loop structures leading to repeat deletions (sub-pathway 2).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gky700fig8"/></fig><p>Here, we also revealed different DNA synthesis modes adopted by pol &#x003b2; and the mechanisms that govern the modes of DNA synthesis during BER in TNR tracts. Our results support a model that pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase domain persistently interacts with the dRP group through the lysines at its lysine pocket (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) for its substrate binding and subsequent dRP removal via &#x003b2;-elimination in TNRs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In a scenario where dRP lyase activity is deficient or the dRP group is refractory to the dRP lyase activity of pol &#x003b2; via &#x003b2;-elimination (i.e. reduced sugar such as THF), pol &#x003b2; persistently interacts with the dRP group, and this &#x0201c;tethers&#x0201d; the polymerase on its DNA template forcing the polymerase to perform a processive synthesis of TNRs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The Wilson group has shown that pol &#x003b2; can perform a processive DNA synthesis in a short gap (5&#x02013;6 nt) by interacting with the 5&#x02032;-phosphate of the dRP group through Lys 35 of the lyase domain (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Our results further indicate the pivotal role of pol &#x003b2;-dRP interaction in promoting the mode of processive DNA synthesis (compare lanes 7&#x02013;8 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> to lanes 6&#x02013;7 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref> and lanes 11&#x02013;12 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> to lanes 9&#x02013;10 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that upon the presence of the dRP group, pol &#x003b2; is &#x02018;tethered&#x02019; to its template, adopting a processive mode of DNA synthesis until the dRP group is ultimately removed. Further, our results indicated that the deficiency of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity by the point mutation at K72 resulted in the failure of the removal of the dRP group leading to a persistent interaction of pol &#x003b2; K72A with its substrate through the other lysine residues in the &#x02018;lysine pocket&#x02019; of the dRP lyase domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This in turn &#x02018;tethered&#x02019; the polymerase on its DNA template forcing the polymerase to perform a processive synthesis of TNRs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that proficient pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity efficiently removes a dRP group to prevent pol &#x003b2; from performing a processive DNA synthesis. This is critically important for preventing DNA strand slippage, the formation of TNR loops and TNR instability, and mutations mediated by pol &#x003b2;. Although K72 has been identified as the major lysine residue, it is not the only one that can form a Schiff base with a native sugar (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Our results further suggest that other lysines including K84 in the &#x02018;lysine pocket&#x02019; of the pol &#x003b2; lyase domain can also form a Schiff base with a native sugar (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) to tether the polymerase on its template (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that in a scenario where dRP lyase residue/s is mutated in the dRP lyase domain of pol &#x003b2;, the BER pathway is forced to switch from the SN-BER pathway to the long-patch BER pathway promoting TNR instability (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Our results showed that the DNA synthesis activity of pol &#x003b2; was inversely correlated with its dRP lyase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) suggesting that there is functional cooperation between the dRP lyase domain of pol &#x003b2; and its polymerase domain that suppresses the processive DNA synthesis of pol &#x003b2;. This is supported by our results showing that the pol &#x003b2; 8 kD domain alone failed to rescue TNR stability during BER in pol &#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cell extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). This is further supported by the fact that although these domains can function independent of each other, the catalytic efficiency of the isolated polymerase and dRP lyase domains is significantly reduced compared with the intact pol &#x003b2; protein. This indicates that the two domains of pol &#x003b2; synergize to fulfill efficient enzymatic activities of the intact pol &#x003b2; (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The synergistic effect appears to be also critically important to restrain pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis activity, thereby ensuring the efficient short-patch BER that in turn prevents DNA strand slippage and TNR instability. This is also supported by our results showing that in the absence of pol &#x003b2; polymerase domain, pol &#x003b2; lyase domain alone failed to coordinate with replicative DNA polymerase to prevent TNR instability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), further demonstrating a necessity of the cooperation between the activities of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase and its polymerase in sustaining TNR stability. A recent study from the Wilson group has shown that pol &#x003b2; uses positively charged lysine residues within the lyase domain to processively search for DNA damage, i.e.&#x000a0;a 1 nt gap through hopping and intersegmental transfer along DNA (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Once a gapped DNA is encountered, the lyase domain makes specific interactions with the gap to allow the lesion recognition. Moreover, the interaction between the lyase domain and nucleotides in the gapped DNA strengthens its affinity of binding to DNA, which subsequently facilitates its DNA polymerase domain to engage in the gap and initiate the DNA synthesis. This sheds light on the cooperation between the pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase domain and its polymerase domain in damage search. Our results suggest that pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase domain with a proficient dRP lyase can also serve as the &#x02018;guard&#x02019; to prevent the processive DNA synthesis mode of pol &#x003b2;. The underlying structural base is implicated by an early study from the Wilson group showing that pol &#x003b2; adopts a &#x02018;closed thumb&#x02019; as an active conformation and &#x02018;open thumb&#x02019; as an inactive conformation for nucleotidyl transfer through an &#x02018;induced-fit&#x02019; mechanism (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Since the active conformation of pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis, the &#x02018;closed thumb&#x02019; conformation is mediated by the contact between the C-terminal thumb subdomain and the dRP lyase domain, we suggest that dRP lyase deficiency causes the failure of the removal of the dRP group resulting in the persistent pol &#x003b2;-dRP interaction. This then forces pol &#x003b2; to keep &#x02018;the closed thumb conformation&#x02019; that in turn &#x02018;tethers&#x02019; the polymerase on its template leading to a processive DNA synthesis. On the other hand, a dRP group is removed efficiently by pol &#x003b2; WT allowing the polymerase to adopt the &#x02018;open thumb&#x02019; conformation. This then results in the dissociation of pol &#x003b2; from its product leading to distributive DNA synthesis. Thus, our results suggest that malfunction of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase promotes the processive DNA synthesis by locking the enzyme in the &#x02018;closed thumb&#x02019; conformation through an interaction between the dRP lyase domain and a dRP group.</p><p>Removal of the dRP group by the pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase determines if BER undergoes the single-nucleotide BER sub-pathway or long-patch BER sub-pathway (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Since the long-patch BER involves multiple-nucleotide synthesis by pol &#x003b2; or other DNA polymerases, which allows the addition or removal of repeats, the long-patch BER mediates TNR instability (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Our results further suggest that the choice of the BER sub-pathways and modes of pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis can be regulated through inhibition of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity. This may preferentially lead to deletions of expanded TNR tracts. Also, it has been reported that pol &#x003b2; can be acetylated by acetyltransferase p300 at Lys 72 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Acetylated pol &#x003b2; was less efficient in reconstituted BER due to the reduced dRP lyase activity (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). This suggests that pol &#x003b2; acetylation can act as a switch to govern the modes of pol &#x003b2; DNA synthesis and the BER sub-pathway to regulate TNR instability. The role of pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase inhibition in mediating TNR instability warrants further studies. This will help to pave the way for developing new strategies for the treatment of TNR expansion diseases by targeting pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide the primary evidence that pol &#x003b2; dRP lyase activity synergizes with its polymerase activity to prevent TNR deletions during BER. We demonstrated that this effect was achieved through the prevention of a processive synthesis of TNRs by pol &#x003b2;, repeat strand slippage, and the formation of secondary structures in TNR tracts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="gky700_supplemental_files.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Samuel H.
