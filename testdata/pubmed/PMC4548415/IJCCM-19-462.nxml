According to Gregoire and Russel,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] these scoring systems serve four major purposes. First, they are used in clinical trials for matching. Second, they are used to quantify the severity of illness for administrative decisions such as resource allocation. Third, as an audit tool, they can be used to assess ICU performance and compare the quality of care. Finally, they help to assess the prognosis.</p><p>Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] series is one of the most well-received generic severity measures, based upon clinical data, which calculates the probability of death independent of diagnosis. The APACHE score is based on acute physiological parameters and other clinical information. APACHE is actually less disease specific than other severity measurements, in that it predicts the probability of dying independent of the disease.</p><p>The first score developed in this series was developed by Knaus <italic>et al</italic>. at the George Washington University Medical Centre in 1981. This score demonstrated the ability to evaluate the severity of disease in an accurate and reproducible form.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Another simplification of the original APACHE system, the APACHE II was published in 1985.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>APACHE II is a composite score of acute physiology score, age points, and chronic health points. In acute physiology, there are 13 variables and each variable is assigned a score varying from 0 to 4. Similarly, age and chronic health are graded from 0 to 6 and 0 to 5 score, respectively. Based on the cumulative of these scores mortality is predicted.</p><p>The APACHE II severity score has shown a good calibration and discriminatory value across a range of disease processes and remains the most commonly used international severity scoring system worldwide.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It has been found to have the best Youden index, highest positive predictive value, and best specificity in predicting mortality outcome.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This scoring system has been widely applied in medical and surgical ICUs to predict the outcome of adult patients. Vasilyeva <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found in their study that APACHE II score was useful for assessing outcomes in children with severe mechanical trauma. However, due to limited data on the use of this score in pediatric age group, it is still not widely used for this population.</p><p>This study was conducted to validate the use of APACHE II scoring system in pediatric population in predicting the risk of mortality and to compare the predicted death rate (using APACHE II) with the actual death rate of the patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>It was a prospective study conducted in Pediatric ICU (PICU) of Umaid Hospital, Dr. S N Medical College, Jodhpur over a period of 1-year from December 2012 to November 2013.</p><p>All children between 1 and 18 years of age admitted in PICU for &#x0003e;24 h were included in the study. Those children who were &#x0003c;1-year of age or expired in &#x0003c;24 h of their admission or were discharged against medical advice were excluded.</p><p>Demographic details, vital signs-pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature, complete clinical examination, and investigations including liver function test, renal function test, hemogram, arterial blood gas analysis, and serum electrolytes were recorded in a predesigned and pretested Performa. Based on these APACHE II score was calculated on the day of admission. The predicted mortality was calculated on the basis of this score.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>SPSS (version 10.0, produced by SPSS Inc., and was acquired by IBM in 2009) was used to analyze the data. Student <italic>t</italic>-test and Chi-square test were used to compare quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. An one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to produce one-way ANOVA for the quantitative dependent variable by an independent variable. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to discriminate the survivor from nonsurvivor, and area under the curve was calculated to determine the degree of discrimination. An aROC &#x0003e;0.9 was defined as excellent discrimination, 0.8&#x0003e; aROC &#x0003c;0.9 as good discrimination and 0.7&#x0003e; aROC &#x0003c;0.8 as modest discrimination.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Lemeshow-Hosmer goodness of fit test was used for calculation of calibration (correlation between estimated probability of death and observed death rate). <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05 was taken as no significant difference between predicted and observed mortality. In addition, standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was also calculated to find out difference observed and expected mortality rate.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 100 critically ill patients were enrolled in the present study. In this group, neurological morbidity (51%) was the most common followed by, respiratory (17%), cardiovascular (13%), renal (8%), metabolic (6%), infection (6%), poisoning (6%), hepatic (3%), and hematological (2%). The mean age of the population was 4.95 &#x000b1; 3.61 years, and there was slight male preponderance (55% males vs. 45% females).</p><p>Mortality is increased with increasing APACHE II score. Hundred percent mortality was observed with a score &#x0003e;34. Mean APACHE II score was significantly higher among expired as compared to survivors (26.11 + 5.41 vs. 16.60 + 6.12, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.00). On comparing individual parameters of the score among the survivors and nonsurvivors, it was found that there were statistically significant correlation between survivors and nonsurvivors in relation to mean arterial pressure, heart rate, PaO<sub>2</sub>, and total white blood cell counts [Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Association between APACHE II score and mortality</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJCCM-19-462-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of study variables in survivors and nonsurvivors of study cases</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJCCM-19-462-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The degree of discrimination among survivors and the nonsurvivors was calculated using the area under the ROC curve [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

Similar morbidity profile was reported by Haque and Bano.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] They also observed major diagnostic categories of their admitting patients as neurological (10%), respiratory (10%), and cardiac (8%). El Halal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in their study, observed the most common morbidities as neurological (11.5%) followed by oncologic/hematological (11.4%) and genetic (7.3%).</p><p>In our study, 55% cases expired. Another Indian study by Singhal <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] observed 21.95% mortality of the PICU admissions. On the contrary, data from the west suggest a PICU mortality ranging from 3.8% to 13% in North and South America and Europe, respectively.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A strikingly high PICU mortality observed in our study, can be attributed to delayed referrals from rural areas in Western Rajasthan with poor transport facilities, difficult terrain and lack of awareness for early medical attention.</p><p>We observed that mortality increased with increments in APACHE II score. Mortality was observed in 100.00% cases, when the score was &#x0003e;34. Similar findings were observed by Kim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Turner <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also. Mean APACHE II score among the survivors was 16.60 &#x000b1; 6.12 as compared to 26.11 &#x000b1; 5.11 among nonsurvivors in the present study. Kim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] also reported mean APACHE II score of 15 among survivors and 23.5 among the nonsurvivors. Adesunkanmi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] use modified APACHE II score range 0&#x02013;18 and found mortality increased with increasing modified APACHE II score, A modified APACHE II score &#x0003e;15 was associated with a significantly greater mortality.</p><p>The area under the curve in our study, was found to be 0.889 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0089) indicative of a good discrimination. Tang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in their study, on the comparison of severity scoring system observed an area under ROC curve of 0.790 for APACHE II score. Nguyen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] in their study, on the comparison of the outcome of scores also found APACHE II score to have higher discrimination when compared to other scores such as MPM II and SAPS II.
