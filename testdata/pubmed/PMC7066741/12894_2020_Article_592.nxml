Moreover, antibiotic resistance is increasing and influences the efficacy of pre-biopsy prophylactic regimens. Therefore, increasing antibiotic resistance may impact on clinical care, which probably results in differences between hospitals. The objective of our study is to determine the (variability in) current practices of PB in the Netherlands and to gain insight into Dutch urologists&#x02019; perceptions of fluoroquinolone resistance and biopsy related infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">An online questionnaire was prepared using SurveyMonkey&#x000ae; platform and distributed to all 420 members of the Dutch Association of Urology, who work in 81 Dutch hospitals. Information about PB techniques and periprocedural antimicrobial prophylaxis was collected. Urologists&#x02019; perceptions regarding pre-biopsy antibiotic prophylaxis in an era of antibiotic resistance was assessed. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">One hundred sixty-one responses (38.3%) were analyzed representing 65 (80.3%) of all Dutch hospitals performing PB. Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy (TRUSPB) was performed in 64 (98.5%) hospitals. 43.1% of the hospitals (also) used other image-guided biopsy techniques. Twenty-three different empirical prophylactic regimens were reported among the hospitals. Ciprofloxacin was most commonly prescribed (84.4%). The duration ranged from one pre-biopsy dose (59.4%) to 5 days extended prophylaxis. 25.2% of the urologists experienced ciprofloxacin resistance as a current problem in the prevention of biopsy related infections and 73.6% as a future problem.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">There is a wide variation in practice patterns among Dutch urologists. TRUSPB is the most commonly used biopsy technique, but other image-guided biopsy techniques are increasingly used. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not standardized and prolonged prophylaxis is common. The wide variation in practice patterns and lack of standardization underlines the need for evidence-based recommendations to guide urologists in choosing appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis for PB in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antibiotic prophylaxis</kwd><kwd>Antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>Healthcare research</kwd><kwd>Prostate biopsy</kwd><kwd>Transrectal biopsy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMw)</institution></funding-source><award-id>541001009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kolwijck</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">In the Netherlands, prostate biopsy (PB) is performed in approximately 40,000 patients every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Biopsies are performed to diagnose prostate cancer and form the basis for further staging patients with prostate cancer in either low, intermediate or high risk prostate cancer groups. Random systematic transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy (TRUSPB) has been the preferred method for years. The field of PB, however, is undergoing rapid, significant change. Very recently, the European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline on prostate cancer has been updated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. An important modification in this guideline is the recommendation to also perform multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) before PB in biopsy-na&#x000ef;ve patients and, when mpMRI is positive (i.e. PI-RADS &#x02265;3), to combine targeted and systematic biopsies. In addition, several more or less equivalent techniques are introduced to improve targeted biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These developments may have significant impact on the urological care provided in daily clinical practice, whereby it seems plausible that diagnostic differences exist between hospitals.</p><p id="Par13">Moreover, (inter) national urological guidelines are unclear and lack standardization with regard to the recommended periprocedural prophylactic measures in PB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

Guidelines strongly recommend the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis, generally with fluoroquinolones (FQ). The EAU guidelines on urological infections, however, states that the choice of regimen remains debatable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An important reason for this is the increase in FQ resistant faecal flora, ranging from 10.6 to 92% between different countries, and 22% in the Netherlands, which is a potential threat for patients undergoing transrectal PB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

It should be noted that at the time of our survey, the EAU guideline update was not published yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

Except for one respondent, all respondents (99.4%) indicated to be aware of the increasing FQ resistance. However, the degree of FQ resistance was assumed to be lower by 52 respondents (33.6%) and to be higher by four respondents (2.6%).</p><p id="Par34">A total of 39 respondents (25.2%) (strongly) agreed with the statement that FQ resistance currently poses a problem in the empirical use of ciprofloxacin alone as prophylaxis around PB. One hundred fourteen respondents (73.6%) anticipate future problems in this area (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Although our survey was performed before the recently published update of the EAU guidelines, urologists from 41.5% of the hospitals reported that they already perform MRI guided or MRI/TRUS fusion guided PB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It suggests that (some) urologists, prior to guideline updates, already adjusted their practice patterns based on recent literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which contributes to variation in daily care. In the Netherlands, saturation biopsies are not commonly performed.</p><p id="Par37">Antimicrobial prophylaxis for PB is still dominated by ciprofloxacin monotherapy (84.4%), reflecting the recommendations in urological guidelines. However, given the rising prevalence of FQ resistance among relevant pathogens, antimicrobial prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin monotherapy is an increasingly doubtful policy. Many Dutch urologists are aware of the increased risk of FQ resistance and about a quarter of all urologists acknowledge rising FQ resistance as a current problem when prescribing antimicrobial prophylaxis. At this moment, only a small number of the Dutch hospitals are opting for a non-FQ based antibiotic regimen or have taken additional measures to address the problem of FQ resistance. We expect, however, that in the (near) future more Dutch hospitals will take measures trying to address rising FQ resistance, since 73.6% of all urologists anticipate future problems with regard to ciprofloxacin resistance and only 4.5% responded that ciprofloxacin remains their preference accepting a higher risk of urosepsis.</p><p id="Par38">Furthermore, according to current guidelines the length of antimicrobial prophylaxis should be limited to &#x0003c;&#x02009;24&#x02009;h, which is not followed by 20% of the centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This deviation from the guidelines is in line with a study of Branch-Elliman et al. in which surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis was continued for &#x0003e;&#x02009;24&#x02009;h in 26.9% of all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">It is known that there is a wide variation in antimicrobial prophylaxis regimens internationally and between centers. Prior surveys on pre-prostate biopsy prophylaxis published since 2010 can be found in <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">Supplementary Appendix III</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Variation in antibiotic choice could be related to a lack of strong evidence, which results in inconsistent and unclear recommendations in urological guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While these guidelines generally recommend antimicrobial prophylaxis in transrectal PB, the choice of regimen, duration and the starting moment are ambiguous.</p><p id="Par41">Moreover, the EAU guidelines leave individual clinicians to determine which patients may benefit from culture-guided prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It should be noted that although a recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] provided evidence for the use of culture-guided antimicrobial prophylaxis in reducing infectious complications after transrectal PB, a large prospective multicenter trial evaluating the effectiveness of rectal swab culture-guided antimicrobial prophylaxis, cost-effectiveness and optimal implementation is missing, but is currently being performed (NCT03228108).</p><p id="Par42">Finally, the EAU guidelines recommend to use rectal cleansing with povidone-iodine prior to transrectal PB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is based on a meta-analysis of six trials including 1373 men that showed that the use of pre-biopsy rectal povidone-iodine preparation in addition to antimicrobial prophylaxis resulted in lower rates of infectious complications [0.58 (0.43 to 0.76); RR (95% CI)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, not a single Dutch urologist reported to use rectal povidone-iodine cleansing prior to PB.</p><p id="Par43">There is no cut-and-dried solution to the increasing resistance against FQ in the context of the risk of post-biopsy infection, which is supported by our finding that Dutch urologists have various preferred solutions to this problem. Although, in our survey, we asked urologists mainly for solutions with in the field of antimicrobial prophylaxis, it is important to note that the solution does not have to be (solely) based on the use of adapted or rectal culture-guided antimicrobial prophylaxis. Various studies found favourable infection rates for transperineal PB compared to TRUSB with similar rates of prostate cancer detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, transperineal PB is an obvious alternative biopsy approach to avoid infections from FQ resistant bacteria. Our survey showed that transperineal biopsies were performed to some extent in 16.9% of all Dutch hospitals. In the Netherlands, transperineal biopsy is slow to be implemented in the clinic because of the consequent logistic problems such as the necessity for specialized staff and equipment, MRI capacity, greater labor time, higher costs etc. Moreover, mpMRI is likely to play an increasingly prominent role in the diagnostic pathway of prostate cancer. In the future, mpMRI could possibly reduce the number of biopsy cores and thereby possibly lower (infectious) complication rates without compromising detection rates or avoid PB in selected patients with negative mpMRI (index lesion PI-RADS &#x02264;2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">The main strength of our study is that due to the high response rate (38.3% covering 80.2% of all Dutch hospitals) we were able to get a nationwide impression regarding the current Dutch prostatic biopsy practices.</p><p id="Par45">The most important limitation of our study is that most of the results were analyzed at hospital level in order to obtain a representative picture of the variation in PB practice patterns between Dutch hospitals. Unfortunately, in hospitals where more than one urologist completed the questionnaire (50.6%), differences were also found between these intra-hospital urologists with regard to PB technique (41.5%) and antimicrobial prophylaxis (48.8%). However, in all cases the local protocol could be clarified. These intra-hospital differences again emphasize the lack of standardization in PB techniques and antimicrobial prophylaxis regimens in the Netherlands even among urologists who work in the same center. On individual level, 41 different antimicrobial prophylaxis regimens were reported instead of the 23 regimens we identified at hospital level (<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">Supplementary Appendix II</xref>). In daily clinical practice, the variation is therefore probably even wider than the variation described in this article. Another limitation is that between the performance of our survey and publication of the results, the EAU guideline on prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] has been updated. Therefore, this survey does no longer depict the current international guidelines regarding prostate biopsy technique. This is, however, illustrative for the rapid evolutions in this area. Moreover, two questions were difficult to analyze due to methodological shortcomings and were left out. However, these questions were not critical for our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par46">The diversity of the reported prophylactic regimens is likely due to a lack of good evidence. Therefore, there is need for well designed, adequately powered trials of good quality in the field of urological pre-biopsy prophylactic measures. High quality research will result in evidence-based, clear-cut recommendations and offers urologists more guidance regarding antimicrobial prophylaxis around PB in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance. Professionals in daily practice have a need for dynamic, regularly updated guidelines that address changes in procedures, antimicrobial resistance patterns or new scientific insights. This study shows that the lack of standardized, clear guidelines lead to (undesirable) practice variation between health care professionals, which implies that patients in one hospital may receive better care than in another hospital. Moreover, this study shows that in an evolving clinical landscape of PB with changes in procedures, techniques and antimicrobial resistance, current urological guidelines lead to urologists making their own policies, resulting in an over-prescription of prophylactic antibiotics. This is ironically exactly what these guidelines aim to prevent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
