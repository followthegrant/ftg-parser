still benefit from earlier diagnosis of cancer. However, fewer smokers participate in screening
despite their increased risk, which may reflect different beliefs about cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A UK population-representative sample of &#x02a7e;50 year-olds (<italic>n</italic>=6965) was surveyed
using the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer measure. These analyses examine six items on cancer
beliefs (e.g., &#x02018;cancer can often be cured'), and four on help-seeking barriers (e.g.,
&#x02018;I would be too embarrassed').</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Smokers were more likely to hold pessimistic cancer beliefs than never-smokers or former-smokers
on four of six items. For example, 34&#x00025; agreed &#x02018;a cancer diagnosis is a death
sentence', compared with 24&#x00025; of non/former-smokers (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). More
smokers (18&#x00025;) than non/former-smokers (11&#x00025;) would not want to know if they had
cancer (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). The only barrier to symptomatic help-seeking differing by smoking
status was &#x02018;worry about what the doctor might find' (36&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic> 28&#x00025;,
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Associations were independent of demographics, self-rated health and cancer
experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Smokers held more pessimistic and avoidant beliefs about cancer, which could deter
early-detection behaviour. A better understanding of these beliefs is needed to increase engagement
in early diagnosis by this high-risk group.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>smoking</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>attitudes</kwd><kwd>early detection</kwd><kwd>avoidance</kwd><kwd>pessimism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Almost 20&#x00025; of all new cancer diagnoses each year in the UK, rising to 86&#x00025; of lung
cancer diagnoses, are caused by smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parkin, 2011</xref>). Smoking is
not only the key risk factor for lung cancer but has also been linked to cancer risk at multiple
sites, including the colon, rectum, and uterine cervix; and evidence is emerging for a role in
breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Secretan <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Smoking cessation is
therefore the most important cancer prevention behaviour for smokers. However, smokers can also
benefit from screening for colorectal, cervical and breast cancer, and from prompt help-seeking for
any potential cancer symptoms.</p><p>In comparison with their non-smoking counterparts, smokers are less likely to have been screened
for breast, colorectal or cervical cancer, and among those who have been screened, smokers are less
likely to meet current recommendations, independent of socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fredman <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sutton <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Byrne <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2014</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vander Weg <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Smokers show less interest in the
prospect of lung cancer screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Silvestri <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>),
and delay longer before presenting to their GP with warning signs for lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corner <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), particularly those who have been lifelong
smokers, have chronic illnesses, or live alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith <italic>et al</italic>,
2009</xref>). There is also some indication in the literature that smokers avoid contact with
primary care more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kannan and Veazie, 2014</xref>), and two
studies suggest that smoking is associated with an increased time to help-seeking for cancer types
other than lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hansen <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Innos <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Additionally, studies have found smokers were less likely to
believe that mammograms provide peace of mind or were necessary in the absence of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Messina <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), and they perceived cervical cancer screening to
be less important than non-smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Marteau <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>).
Ultimately, poorer engagement in early detection is likely to exacerbate smokers' increased
risk of death from cancer, and will mean they miss out on potential teachable moments in smoking
cessation.</p><p>The fact that fewer smokers engage in early-detection behaviours despite their increased risk is
an important paradox to understand. The effect seems to be independent of sociodemographic
characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Byrne <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vander Weg <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>), but attitudinal factors may be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">von Wagner <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Research to date has focused predominantly
on attitudes to lung cancer. A number of clinical studies investigating reasons for delayed
help-seeking in smokers who have been diagnosed with lung cancer implicate misattribution of
symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corner <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), and perceived stigma and blame
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tod <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chatwin and Sanders,
2013</xref>). Fatalistic attitudes (the belief that cancer is neither preventable nor survivable)
also appear to be more common in smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Niederdeppe and Levy,
2007</xref>), and are reported more frequently by cancer patients who continue smoking after
their diagnosis than in those who quit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schnoll <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McBride and Ostroff, 2003</xref>), as well as by individuals who decline the
offer of lung cancer screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Patel <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). However,
because fatalism is associated with both deprivation and smoking, it is unclear whether fatalistic
perceptions are better explained by socioeconomic circumstances or smoking status.</p><p>There have been no large-scale quantitative studies that examine smokers' attitudes towards
cancer more generally. We therefore used data from a large population-based survey to compare
beliefs about cancer, early diagnosis, and help-seeking for symptoms in current-smokers compared
with former-smokers and never-smokers.</p><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Data were collected in 2011 as part of Module 2 of the International Cancer Benchmarking
Partnership (ICBP). Adults aged &#x02a7e;50 years from six countries (United Kingdom, Australia, Canada,
Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) were surveyed to provide an international comparison of Awareness and
Beliefs about Cancer (ABC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forbes <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). The present
analyses focus on the UK data concerning beliefs about cancer outcomes, early detection, and
barriers to help-seeking.</p><p>Random probability sampling methods were used to select households from electronic listings of
&#x02018;landline' telephone numbers. Before dialling, the last two digits of each telephone
number were replaced with two random digits, to include non-listed numbers. If two or more adults
from the same household were eligible for telephone interview (age &#x02a7e;50 years), the
&#x02018;Rizzo' method was used to randomly select one person to take part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rizzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><sec><title>Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer Measure</title><p>The ABC was completed during a computer-assisted telephone interview. ABC items were adapted from
previous measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Paul <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stubbings <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Park and Clery, 2010</xref>) for
the purpose of telephone interview, and have acceptable psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simon <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Beliefs about cancer outcomes and early detection were assessed with six items: (&#x02018;A cancer
diagnosis is a death sentence' &#x02018;I would not want to know if I have cancer'
&#x02018;These days, many people with cancer can expect to continue with normal activities and
responsibilities' &#x02018;Cancer can often be cured' &#x02018;Going to the doctor as
quickly as possible after noticing a symptom of cancer could increase the chances of
surviving' &#x02018;Most cancer treatment is worse than the cancer itself'). Response
options were strongly agree, tend to agree, tend to disagree, and strongly disagree; with
&#x02018;don't know' responses also recorded. For most analyses, we dichotomised responses
as strongly agree/agree <italic>vs</italic> strongly disagree/disagree/don't know.</p><p>Four items assessed perceived barriers to help-seeking for a symptom the person thought could be
serious: (i) &#x02018;I would be worried about what the doctor might find', (ii) &#x02018;I would
be worried about wasting the doctor's time', (iii) &#x02018;I would be too
embarrassed', and (iv) &#x02018;I am too busy to make time to go to the doctor'.
Interviewers explained, &#x02018;Sometimes people put off going to the doctor even when they have a
symptom they think might be serious. These are some of the reasons people give for delaying. Could
you say if any of these might put you off going to the doctor?' Response options were yes
often, yes sometimes, no, and don't know. The first and last two responses were combined for
analysis.</p><p>Smoking status was categorised as current, former, or never, on the basis of respondents'
answers to two questions: &#x02018;Do you smoke at all these days, either cigarettes, including
hand-rolled ones, pipes or cigars?' was used to classify current-smokers, and &#x02018;Have you
ever smoked either cigarettes, including hand-rolled ones, pipes or cigars?' was used to
identify former-smokers. Those answering no to both questions were considered never-smokers.</p><p>Demographic characteristics included age, gender, ethnicity (white <italic>vs</italic> other ethnicity),
marital status (married/cohabiting <italic>vs</italic> single/divorced/separated/widowed),
highest level of education (left school age &#x02a7d;15; CSEs, O-levels or equivalent; A-levels, further
education or equivalent; university degree), and three home countries within the United Kingdom
(England, Wales, Northern Ireland). As a measure of health status, participants were asked,
&#x02018;In general, would you say your health is&#x02026;?' following which they could choose very
good, good, fair, poor, or very poor. For analyses, responses were coded as very good/good
<italic>vs</italic> fair <italic>vs</italic> very poor/poor. Experience of cancer, either personally or in close
others, was assessed and coded as yes (self or close other) <italic>vs</italic> no for the present
analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><p><italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> analyses were used to investigate associations between smoking status
and the endorsement of each of the belief and help-seeking barrier items. Multivariable logistic
regression modelling was used to explore the independence of these associations. Models were run
predicting the odds of a positive response to each belief or barrier item by smoking status, and
adjusting for age, sex, marital status, ethnicity, region, highest level of education, self-rated
health, and cancer experience. The reference group was those who did not agree (i.e., answered
&#x02018;disagree', &#x02018;no' or &#x02018;don't know'). For the majority of the
belief items (5/6), &#x02018;don't know' responses were relatively uncommon (ranging
from 0.5 to 4.3&#x00025;). The exception was the belief that, &#x02018;most cancer treatment is worse
than the cancer itself' to which 15.6&#x00025; of participants responded &#x02018;don't
know'. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were repeated for the belief items excluding cases
answering &#x02018;don't know' on any of the belief items (<italic>n</italic>=5138). These
were not carried out for the barrier items, because &#x02018;don't know' responses were
infrequent (&#x02a7d;0.3&#x00025;). Refused responses were minimal across all of the belief and barrier
items (&#x02a7d;0.3&#x00025;) and were excluded from the analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Interviewers contacted 24&#x02009;231 households in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
identifying 10 &#x02009;977 adults eligible for interview (age &#x02a7e;50 years). A total of 6965 adults
completed the full interview. The overall response rate was calculated as 19.5&#x00025; using
estimates of non-respondent eligibility for those households, which could not be contacted or
assessed for eligibility. These estimates were based on the proportion of eligible households for
which eligibility was assessed (AAPOR Response Rate 3 conventions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">The American
Association of Public Opinion Research, 2011</xref>). Further details on response rates are
available in the main ICBP report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forbes <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents the demographic characteristics of the sample by
smoking status. Current-smokers comprised 15&#x00025; of the overall sample, former-smokers
39&#x00025;, and never-smokers 46&#x00025;. In comparison with never- or former-smokers,
current-smokers were younger, less likely to be married, less educated, and rated their health as
poorer, which mirrors the characteristics of smokers in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">ONS, 2011</xref>).</p><sec><title>Beliefs about cancer outcomes and early detection</title><p>For four of the six cancer beliefs, current-smokers were more pessimistic about cancer outcomes
and early detection than former- or never-smokers (see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The
absolute difference in agreement by smoking status was largest for the belief that a &#x02018;cancer
diagnosis is a death sentence', with 34&#x00025; of current-smokers agreeing, compared with
24&#x00025; of never- or former-smokers. More current-smokers also agreed that &#x02018;I would not
want to know if I have cancer' (18&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic> 11&#x00025; of both non-smoking groups).
Fewer current-smokers agreed that &#x02018;many people with cancer can expect to continue with normal
activities and responsibilities' than never- or former-smokers (82&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic>
90&#x00025; and 88&#x00025;, respectively), or that &#x02018;cancer can often be cured'
(87&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic> 91&#x00025; and 90&#x00025;). These associations remained significant in
multivariable analyses adjusting for demographics, self-rated health and cancer experience, with
significantly different odds of agreement in current-smokers compared with never-smokers for the
belief that cancer is a death sentence (OR=1.55, 1.32&#x02013;1.82), that cancer can often be
cured (OR=0.73, 0.58&#x02013;0.92), that they would not want to know if they have cancer
(OR=1.44; CI: 1.17&#x02013;1.78) and the ability to continue with normal activities following a
cancer diagnosis (OR=0.54, 0.44&#x02013;0.67). Strikingly, the responses of former-smokers
largely resembled those of never-smokers across all the domains. The absolute difference between
their responses was no more than 2.3&#x00025;.</p><p>Smoking status did not affect the odds of believing that &#x02018;going to the doctor quickly
increases chances of surviving', which was endorsed almost unanimously (&#x02a7e;97&#x00025;). It
was also not related to agreeing that &#x02018;cancer treatment is worse than the cancer'.</p></sec><sec><title>Barriers to help-seeking</title><p>Current-smokers were more likely to say that being &#x02018;worried about what the doctor might
find' might put them off going to the doctor: 36&#x00025; <italic>vs</italic> 28&#x00025; of
former/never-smokers. In multivariate analyses, this association was independent of
demographics, self-rated health and cancer experience, with current-smokers' odds of agreement
significantly increased compared with never-smokers (OR=1.25, 1.07&#x02013;1.47; see <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Current- and former-smokers were less likely than never-smokers to
think that being &#x02018;too embarrassed' would deter them from help-seeking (OR=0.79,
0.65&#x02013;0.97 and OR=0.81, 0.69&#x02013;0.93, respectively), although the absolute
differences in agreement were small (&#x02a7d;3.7&#x00025;). Otherwise, there were marginal differences
between groups in the likelihood of endorsing the other two barrier items concerning being too busy
and worry about wasting the doctor's time.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first population-based study to explore smokers' beliefs about outcomes for
cancer in general, with the aim of shedding light on why fewer smokers participate in early
detection across a range of cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Silvestri <italic>et al</italic>,
2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Byrne
<italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vander Weg
<italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Innos <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). We found
that smokers held more negative perceptions of cancer outcomes, independent of demographic
characteristics, self-rated health and cancer experience. In comparison with non-smokers, they were
more likely to believe cancer is a death sentence, saw less chance of cure, and were less likely to
believe that normal activities can be continued. They were also less likely to want to know if they
have cancer, although they were no less likely to agree with the early-detection principle that
prompt presentation increases the chance of survival.</p><p>Barriers to help-seeking that concerned embarrassment or time issues (doctor's or own time)
differed little by smoking status. But worry about &#x02018;what the doctor might find' was a
stronger barrier to help-seeking for current-smokers than never- or former-smokers. Paradoxically,
this suggests that smokers' awareness and concern about their poor health is instrumental in
deterring early detection.</p><p>The present findings suggest that the fatalism about lung cancer that has been observed in
smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schnoll <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McBride
and Ostroff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kerr <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tod <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) may be part of a more generalised negative view of
cancer outcomes in the &#x02018;well' smoking population. This might help explain why more
smokers in this sample would prefer to remain oblivious if they had cancer, and would avoid going to
the doctor if they had symptoms; beliefs consistent with their lower participation in screening
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corner <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith <italic>et
al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vander Weg <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Knowing
one's diagnosis might appear to be of little value if the outcome is assumed to be invariably
negative. Furthermore, the majority of smokers are aware that smoking adversely impacts health
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Siahpush <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and could be deterred by concern that
a diagnosis would mean they would have to quit.</p><p>Smokers' pessimism about cancer outcomes may derive partly from their experience of the
disease in their friends and family; although smokers in the present sample did not report greater
cancer experience than former- or never-smokers. Smokers have poorer health, are overrepresented in
socioeconomically deprived groups, and know more smokers, all of which increase the likelihood of
experiencing poor cancer outcomes in their social network. Although our analyses controlled for
education, self-rated health, and experience of cancer, more sensitive measures of the type of
cancer experience (i.e., positive or negative), as well as details of current health problems, would
help to further explore the viability of this explanation. However, the fact that current-smokers
were more pessimistic than both former- and never-smokers militates against this explanation, as
former-smokers are likely to have similar experiential influences given that they were, of course,
once smokers themselves.</p><p>Alternatively, pessimism might come from being dependent upon tobacco while knowing that it is
the most widely recognised cancer risk. This could foster a sense of helplessness over the extent to
which health can be controlled; consistent with evidence that female smokers are less likely to
believe mammograms provide a sense of control over health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Messina <italic>et
al</italic>, 2002</xref>). In this context, fatalistic beliefs could help smokers cope with the
uncertain health consequences of their habit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Keeley <italic>et al</italic>,
2009</xref>); particularly older smokers who are likely to have accrued a significant smoking
history and fear that the damage is already done. In other words, both fatalistic and avoidant
beliefs could help to relieve the cognitive dissonance experienced from knowing that smoking could
cause cancer, but feeling powerless to quit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Festinger, 1957</xref>). Having
been unable to change their behaviour in the past, they change their beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gibbons <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fotuhi <italic>et al</italic>,
2013</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that former-smokers' beliefs were more like never-smokers than current-smokers
is consistent with US data on attitudes towards lung cancer screening specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Silvestri <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Together, they suggest that negativity about
cancer is not a stable characteristic of those who take up smoking, but is instead conditional on
current behaviour. In support, longitudinal data suggest that smokers' tendency to agree with
risk-minimising health beliefs varies with quit attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fotuhi <italic>et al</italic>,
2013</xref>). It is possible that successfully quitting smoking fosters a greater sense of
optimism and control over health, perhaps by relieving the helplessness and cognitive dissonance
former-smokers may have felt when smoking. Another possible explanation is that those who continue
to smoke into older adulthood are a more &#x02018;hardcore' group who regard smoking as a
positive part of their identity, and as such hold different attitudes to those who have quit
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jarvis <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tombor <italic>et
al</italic>, 2013</xref>). These results indicate that helping smokers to quit may ultimately not
only reduce health risks directly but also indirectly increase utilisation of preventive or
early-detection opportunities, and this should remain the priority for finite health resources.
Research aimed at understanding the origins of negative cancer beliefs, and identifying ways to
improve smokers' engagement with cancer control and health services more widely, may provide
the foundations from which to increase the reach of supported smoking cessation programmes.</p><p>With regard to early detection, the finding that smokers were as likely to believe that prompt
presentation increases the chances of survival (97&#x00025;), despite their otherwise pessimistic
outlook, is interesting. Perhaps although they are aware of the benefits of early detection in
principle, this stands against a high perceived likelihood of a bad outcome, and therefore it is not
enough to motivate action. In support, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sach and Whynes (2009)</xref> found
that at the same time as feeling at greater risk of cancer, smokers were less enthusiastic about the
offer of colorectal cancer screening. Their reluctance to face up to the imminent risk may undermine
motivation towards early diagnosis.</p><p>Our analyses benefit from a large, non-clinical sample of older adults, for whom early-detection
messages are especially important because both age and smoking duration increase cancer risk. The
proportion of current-smokers in our sample (15&#x00025;) is as expected for this age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">ONS, 2011</xref>). However, we cannot assume younger smokers would hold the same
beliefs, and studies of younger adults may help to understand smokers' lower participation in
cervical screening. Although it was our intention to describe smokers' beliefs about cancer
outcomes generally, it is possible that they thought predominantly about lung cancer in their
responses due to their greater risk of this disease. Future studies asking questions across a range
of different cancer types might help to answer this question. We also cannot presume that these
beliefs are markers of stable attitudes because this was a cross-sectional study. To reduce burden
we used single-item measures, and the results need to be replicated using more complex measures.
Furthermore, although we speculate that pessimistic attitudes could help to explain smokers'
lower participation in early detection, studies with behavioural outcomes are needed.</p><p>We provide preliminary evidence that smokers hold more negative and avoidant perceptions of
cancer outcomes and symptomatic help-seeking, which could underlie their poorer participation in
early detection despite their increased risk. Further work is needed to understand smokers'
perceptions of different cancer types and how these might relate to engagement with cancer
screening. An understanding of the origins of these beliefs is also needed, with potential avenues
of study including the effects of tobacco dependence, the extent to which smokers' negativity
is socially constructed or consistent across different cultures, and the influence of cognitive
dissonance processes. Longitudinal designs that observe the transition in beliefs during changes in
smoking status may provide useful insights, as might qualitative study designs that explore
smokers' perceptions in depth. This research agenda could help to inform the design of
interventions to reduce fatalism and avoidance, and ultimately increase opportunities for earlier
diagnosis as well as smoking cessation advice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Anna Carluccio, Colin Gardiner, Julia Pye, Laura Thomas and Chris Marshall of IPSOS Mori
