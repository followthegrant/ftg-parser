Its abnormal accumulation in the brain underlies the pathology of multiple neurodegenerative disorders, collectively termed synucleinopathies, and constitutes the hallmark feature of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) (see, e.g. ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref> for a recent review). &#x003b1;-syn is a highly abundant brain protein, normally associated with synaptic transmission. Its pathological accumulation in neurodegeneration involves its misfolding, resulting in abnormal aggregation and eventually in its accumulation as fibrillar aggregates known as Lewy bodies that are commonly seen in the brain of PD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The molecular mechanisms that trigger &#x003b1;-syn&#x02019;s misfolding and lead to the disease pathology are not fully understood.</p><p id="Par3">Protein arginylation is a posttranlsational modification mediated by arginyltransferase ATE1 that transfers Arg from tRNA directly to protein targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Deletion of Ate1 in mice leads to embryonic lethality and impairments in multiple physiological systems, including cardiovascular development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, muscle contraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Early studies suggested that ATE1 may play a role in nerve regeneration after injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, may target multiple proteins in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and is able to facilitate removal of pathologically generated protein fragments implicated in neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It has been previously believed that ATE1 targets exclusively the N-terminus of proteolytically generated Asp and Glu, but recent studies showed that the acidic side chains of Asp and Glu can also serve as targets for arginylation in intact proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This possibility greatly expands the potential scope of arginylation and its biological effects and has been implicated, e.g., in regulation of skeletal muscle contraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, however the direct biological effects of this side chain modification for a single protein target have never been explored.</p><p id="Par4">Here we found that &#x003b1;-syn constitutes a highly efficient target for mid-chain arginylation and is arginylated <italic>in vivo</italic> on two critical Glu residues, one of them previously implicated in familial cases of neurodegeneration. Lack of arginylation results in intracellular accumulation of &#x003b1;-syn in the cultured cells and in mouse brain, and leads to pronounced symptoms of neurodegeneration. Moreover, arginylation reduces the ability of &#x003b1;-syn seeds added to neuronal culture to form intracellular aggregates. Our study is the first demonstration of physiological regulation of a single protein target by mid-chain arginylation that implicates arginylation as a previously unknown mechanism of maintaining normal brain health and preventing &#x003b1;-syn&#x02019;s abnormal accumulation in the brain and neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>&#x003b1;-syn is an efficient substrate for ATE1 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="Par5">&#x003b1;-syn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> is an abundant protein in the brain, which can assume different conformations in different physiological context and contains multiple Asp and Glu residues at critically important functional sites, while notably lacking any Arg residues. These features make it a highly interesting potential target for arginylation, since arginylation at Asp and Glu could have dramatic consequences to its function. To test if &#x003b1;-syn can be arginylated, we used our previously developed <italic>in vitro</italic> arginylation assay that utilizes [<sup>14</sup>C-Arg], which can be easily detected by autoradiography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. As a control in these assays, we also used two other neurodegeneration-relevant proteins, tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and TDP43<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. While tau and TDP43 showed no detectable arginylation in these assays, &#x003b1;-syn was very highly arginylated, much more efficiently than any other protein substrate tested to date (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). This high extent of arginylation was not species-specific and was observed using both recombinantly expressed mouse and human &#x003b1;-syn (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), suggesting that ATE1 truly favors &#x003b1;-syn as a substrate. Notably, in these <italic>in vitro</italic> assays arginylation occurred on the full length protein and not proteolytically derived fragments (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>&#x003b1;-syn is arginylated <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Remarkably, this analysis showed that two internally located E (Glu) residues in &#x003b1;-syn, E46 and E83, were arginylated on their acidic side chains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Notably, the E46 sites harbors a previously identified mutation E46K implicated in familial PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and the E83 residue has been previously found to protect &#x003b1;-syn from misfolding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Since the target groups for Arg addition on both sites constitute acidic side chains of the E residues, it appears likely that arginylation happens on intact &#x003b1;-syn <italic>in vivo</italic>, and not on its proteolytic fragments. To confirm this, we compared the 2D electrophoretic mobility of the natively purified &#x003b1;-syn to &#x003b1;-syn arginylated <italic>in vitro</italic> using [<sup>14</sup>C-Arg] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, bottom).

Moreover, in the <italic>in vivo</italic> sample the right-shifted spot corresponding to that with the highest radioactive label <italic>in vitro</italic> (and thus likely to be the pure arginylated species) was even more prominent than <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that the stationary level of this modification in the brain can be reasonably high.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Lack of arginylation leads to intracellular &#x003b1;-syn accumulation</title><p id="Par7">It has been previously shown that for some proteins lack of arginylation may lead to their intracellular accumulation due to impairments in their proteasomal degradation. This regulation, however, has never been shown for an intact protein that has not been proteolytically pre-processed prior to arginylation. To test whether arginylation of &#x003b1;-syn has any effect on its intracellular accumulation, we transfected cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts with cDNA constructs encoding either unmodified &#x003b1;-syn (U), or its mutant versions with substitutions of E residues at arginylated positions to A (Ala), individually (E46A and E83A), or in combination (E46AE83A double mutant), engineered to abolish arginylation at either one or both sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). While transfected unmodified &#x003b1;-syn did not prominently accumulate in cells, each single mutation led to an increase in its intracellular levels. Furthermore, double mutation to produce an &#x003b1;-syn mutant that is unable to undergo arginylation at these sites resulted in an even bigger increase in the protein levels compared to control, indicating that these mutations likely have a cumulative effect in facilitating intracellular &#x003b1;-syn accumulation. This difference was even more prominent in the pellets, produced by high speed centrifugation after cell lysis to enrich for &#x003b1;-syn aggregates, suggesting that &#x003b1;-syn arginylation may induce an increase in its solubility and decrease in its aggregation. Thus, arginylation at E46 and E83 is likely responsible for maintaining the overall low intracellular levels of &#x003b1;-syn and lack of this arginylation leads to the increase in intracellular &#x003b1;-syn level and its aggregation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Lack of arginylation leads to &#x003b1;-syn accumulation in cultured cells independently of proteasome degradation and renders insensitivity to inhibitors of autophagy.

</p><p id="Par8">To further test the relation of &#x003b1;-syn levels to arginylation, we transfected the unmodified &#x003b1;-syn construct into the matching cultures of wild type and Ate1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, Ate1 knockout cells had a much higher level of transfected &#x003b1;-syn compared to control, suggesting that lack of arginylation leads to &#x003b1;-syn accumulation and Ate1 knockout background may compound this effect.</p><p id="Par9">It has been previously shown that a portion of the normal &#x003b1;-syn in cells is turned over by degradation via ubiquitin/proteasome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, a mechanism that has also been found to constitute one of the possible downstream effects of arginylation. It is also known that pathologically misfolded &#x003b1;-syn can be removed via lysosomal degradation and autophagy, the processes that have also been recently shown to be regulated by ATE1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. To test whether Ate1 knockout affects &#x003b1;-syn degradation, through any of these pathways, we first compared the intracellular levels of &#x003b1;-syn transfected into wild type and Ate1 knockout cells before and after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This treatment led to an increase in the level of &#x003b1;-syn in both cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>), consistent with the fact that proteasome pathway normally participates in normal &#x003b1;-syn turnover. However, the extent of &#x003b1;-syn increase in Ate1 knockout cells was not significantly different from wild type, suggesting that &#x003b1;-syn accumulation in the absence of arginylation does not depend on the proteasome.</p><p id="Par10">To test the effect of arginylation on &#x003b1;-syn clearance by lysosomal degradation and autophagy, we treated the &#x003b1;-syn-transfected Ate1 knockout cells with chloroquine and bafilomycin &#x02013; the inhibitors of lysosomal degradation and autophagy previously shown to interfere with &#x003b1;-syn removal from normal cells. Remarkably, neither of these treatments in Ate1 knockout led to the expected increase in intracellular levels of &#x003b1;-syn (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>), suggesting that neither lysosomal degradation nor autophagy contribute substantially to the removal of &#x003b1;-syn, in the absence of arginylation. To test whether both pathways are generally functional in Ate1 knockout cells, we tested the effect of these inhibitors on an endogenous target of these pathways, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), which normally increases in levels after both treatments. Bafilomycin appeared to be fully effective (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, right), while chloroquine treatment did not appear to strongly affect the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II or their levels in Ate1 knockout cells (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, right), suggesting that chloroquine-targeted pathway may be generally impaired in Ate1 knockout cells. Control experiments confirmed that both inhibitors were working as expected in wild type cells, as evidenced by the increase in LC3-I to LC3-II conversion after both treatments (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, left).</p><p id="Par11">Thus, lack of arginylation leads to intracellular &#x003b1;-syn accumulation and its inability to be effectively removed by the degradation mechanisms that normally facilitate &#x003b1;-syn clearance from the cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Arginylation reduces aggregation of pre-formed &#x003b1;-syn fibrils</title><p id="Par12">To test whether &#x003b1;-syn arginylation affects the structural properties of &#x003b1;-syn fibrils, we analyzed non-arginylated and arginylated &#x003b1;-syn preparations, induced to form fibrils <italic>in vitro</italic> by prolonged shaking, using negative staining electron microscopy. Both preparations, as expected, contained large numbers of &#x003b1;-syn fibrils, which appeared to be individually similar to each other in width and overall length. Notably, however, the fibrils formed from non-arginylated &#x003b1;-syn exhibited a much higher tendency to bundle and form higher-order aggregates compared to the non-arginylated &#x003b1;-syn fibrils, which tended to exist more as single filaments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This effect likely indicates that arginylation reduces the ability of &#x003b1;-syn fibrils to self-associate, a property that can potentially underlie its reduced ability to facilitate intracellular aggregation and may significantly reduce &#x003b1;-syn-dependent neuropathology.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Arginylation prevents &#x003b1;-syn aggregation.

To compare the effectiveness of non-arginylated and arginylated &#x003b1;-syn seeds in facilitating intracellular aggregate formation and growth, we quantified the total number of aggregates per neuron (the number that reflects the seeding capacity of pre-added &#x003b1;-syn fibrils, i.e., their ability to induce the initial formation of intracellular &#x003b1;-syn aggregates), as well as total aggregate area per neuron (the number that reflects the overall ability of pre-added &#x003b1;-syn fibrils to facilitate further aggregate growth). Remarkably, these quantifications revealed that neurons treated with arginylated &#x003b1;-syn fibrils contained an overall smaller number of aggregates, suggesting that arginylated &#x003b1;-syn seeds were less likely to serve as sites for new aggregate formation than non-arginylated ones. Furthermore, the total area of these aggregates was significantly smaller in neurons treated with arginylated &#x003b1;-syn seeds compared to non-arginylated ones.

However, they appeared less active than their littermates and were often unsuccessful competing for nutrition, leading to progressively reduced body weights and higher incidences of mortality in the first three weeks. With extra care, including food supplementation and extended periods of time spent with the mother in the absence of wild type littermates, these mice were able to survive to adulthood and many of them had life spans comparable to the wild type. Such mice had somewhat reduced body weights, but were otherwise outwardly similar to wild type (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

Since we previously found in multiple Ate1 knockout mouse models that mice heterozygous for Ate1 are phenotypically normal (see, e.g., ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>), we assumed this effect to be due to the expression of the Cre transgene and in all the subsequent tests provided below these mice were tested along with wild type and averaged into the wild type group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Lack of arginylation results in accumulation of &#x003b1;-synuclein in the brain</title><p id="Par17">To test whether arginylation knockout leads to increased &#x003b1;-syn aggregation in the brain, we performed fractionation of brain lysates (striatum) by sequential lysis that separates soluble and aggregated &#x003b1;-syn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

We find that lack of arginylation results in &#x003b1;-syn accumulation and aggregation and leads to the downstream effects characteristic for &#x003b1;-syn-driven neurodegeneration. Our results suggest that arginylation is a previously unknown mechanism that maintains normal intracellular levels of &#x003b1;-syn and facilitates normal brain health. This finding introduces a new level of regulation into the studies of &#x003b1;-syn and potentially yields a new target pathway that could lead to prevention and treatment of neurodegeneration.</p><p id="Par22">Arginylation of &#x003b1;-syn occurs by a newly discovered mechanism that targets the acidic side chains of Asp and Glu within the intact protein chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This type of arginylation-dependent protein regulation likely carries high biological relevance, since it affects native proteins that have not been pre-processed or cleaved, however its biological relevance has not been explored until now. The current study for the first time demonstrates a direct downstream effect of side chain arginylation on a native protein target, with major implications in normal physiology and disease.</p><p id="Par23">The arginylated sites on &#x003b1;-syn identified in our studies, E46 and E83, coincide with two previously identified sites that play important roles in &#x003b1;-syn function. A previous study showed that the mutation E83A facilitates &#x003b1;-syn intracellular aggregation and formation of amyloid-like fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that this effect may be potentially related to abolishment of arginylation. Even more notably, E46 is the site of the previously identified familial &#x003b1;-syn mutation E46K that has been shown to underlie some of the cases of PD in human patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. While it may seem that E46K mutation should at least partially mimic arginylation by introducing a positively charged residue into this normally negatively charged site, our study shows that arginylation at this site actually has the opposite effect and induces &#x003b1;-syn removal rather than its accumulation. Clearly, the structure of K is sufficiently different from that of R added to the side chain of E&#x02013;a large, bulky, and stably positively charged entity that is expected to strongly affect the folding and molecular interactions of &#x003b1;-syn. We predict that at least some of the effects of the E46K mutation in PD patients are related to the fact that this mutation renders &#x003b1;-syn ineligible for arginylation at this site. In support, &#x003b1;-syn E46K mutants aggregate and accumulate in cultured cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, reminiscent to the effects seen in our studies. Exploring the possible connection between E46K &#x003b1;-syn pathology and arginylation constitutes an exciting direction of further studies.</p><p id="Par24">Our data show that arginylation prevents the pathological ability of &#x003b1;-syn to seed and propagate misfolded aggregates in cultured neurons. This effect is especially remarkable, given the fact that arginylated &#x003b1;-syn seeds added to cells differ from non-arginylated seeds by an estimated 5% of arginylated subunits, which result in over 30% downstream reduction in the aggregate numbers and area. These data strongly suggest that arginylation may affect &#x003b1;-syn early on, possibly right after its de novo synthesis, to give it a &#x0201c;good start&#x0201d; and ensure its correct folding and function. It is also possible that arginylation prevents &#x003b1;-syn propagation from cell to cell, an effect that could potentially lead to exploring &#x003b1;-syn&#x0feff;arginylation as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegeneration. Finally, given the fact that non-arginylated &#x003b1;-syn seeds are more prone to bundling, it is possible that the regularly placed Arg on the &#x003b1;-syn surface exert an electrostatic effect, preventing the side to side association of positively charged fibrils by a mechanism similar to that previously proposed for actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Regardless of the exact mechanism, it appears likely that arginylation constitutes a previously unknown core neuroprotective mechanism that facilitates the seeding of normal &#x003b1;-syn conformation in cells. This hypothesis will be elucidated in further studies.</p><p id="Par25">Previous studies showed that arginylation can target certain proteins for degradation, and that this mechanism likely acts in neurodegeneration by facilitating removal of pathologically generated protein fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, we find that full length &#x003b1;-syn arginylation does not facilitate its proteasomal degradation. Moreover, &#x003b1;-syn levels in Ate1 knockout cells are insensitive to the inhibitors of autophagy. We find that the two different autophagy inhibitors used in our assays, bafilomycin and chloroquine, appear to act differently in their specificity toward &#x003b1;-syn. Treatment of Ate1 knockout cells with bafilomycin, the classical autophagy inhibitor, affects LC3 levels as expected but does not affect the levels of &#x003b1;-syn, suggesting that in the Ate1 knockout background the pathway itself is still working but can no longer target &#x003b1;-syn. In contrast, chloroquine treatment in Ate1 knockout cells not only had no effect on &#x003b1;-syn, but also affected LC3 levels very little, suggesting that the pathways targeted by this inhibitor may be generally impaired in Ate1 knockout cells. This result is consistent with prior findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, failure of &#x003b1;-syn to be properly degraded in Ate1 knockout cells appears to be due to a combination of mechanisms, some of them linked to general impairments of protein degradation in these cells, others mediated directly by &#x003b1;-syn arginylation that, in normal cells, would prevent its misfolding and thus facilitate its normal turnover (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Arginylation prevents intracellular accumulation of &#x003b1;-syn by facilitating its normal folding and degradation. In normal cells, arginylation during, or right after translation facilitates normal &#x003b1;-syn folding, prevents its abnormal aggregation, and facilitates its removal. Lack of arginylation leads to early misfolding and impairment of normal degradation mechanisms, leading to propagation and accumulation of abnormally aggregated &#x003b1;-syn and neurodegeneration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_11713_Fig8_HTML" id="d29e827"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par26">Our previous studies suggest that arginylation can occur co-translationally via a pool of ATE1 that is associated with the ribosomes and likely targets nascent peptides during synthesis. This mechanism accounts for differential cotranslational targeting of beta and gamma actin isoforms during cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. It is possible that co-translational arginylation of &#x003b1;-syn may define its structure early on, possibly as it emerges from the ribosome, thus &#x0201c;seeding&#x0201d; its normal conformation in the cell. Lack of arginylation in this case would lead to its co-translational misfolding and initiation of neurodegenerative pathology. Based on our finding that a relatively minor fraction of &#x003b1;-syn (~5%) is arginylated in the steady state, we hypothesize that this fraction may serve as a seed for the normal structure of emerging &#x003b1;-syn molecules, and that loss of this seeding mechanism leads to misfolding and impaired degradation, eventually resulting in &#x003b1;-syn accumulation. In support, high throughput studies from other groups show that ATE1 is significantly reduced in dopaminergic neurons of human PD patients (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>), suggesting that this reduction likely correlates with reduced &#x003b1;-syn arginylation and neurodegeneration. Investigating this mechanism and its relation to neurodegeneration in human patients constitutes an exciting direction of future studies.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>ATE1 levels are significantly lowered in dopaminergic neurons from human patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.

Spectrum raw files were extracted into ms1 and ms2 files from raw files using RawExtract 1.9.9 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fields.scripps.edu/downloads.php">http://fields.scripps.edu/downloads.php</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, and the tandem mass spectra were searched against NCBI RefSeq protein database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/</ext-link>, downloaded on May 17, 2010). In order to accurately estimate peptide probabilities and false discovery rates, we used a decoy database containing the reversed sequences of all the proteins appended to the target database. Tandem mass spectra were matched to sequences using the ProLuCID algorithm with 50&#x02009;ppm peptide mass tolerance. ProLuCID searches were done on an Intel Xeon cluster running under the Linux operating system. The search space included all fully tryptic peptide candidates that fell within the mass tolerance window with maximum 2 miscleavages. Carbamidomethylation (+57.02146&#x02009;Da) of cysteine was considered as a static modification, arginylation (+156.1011 or +166.1093) on Aspartic acid and Glutamic acid residues were considered as variable modifications.</p><p id="Par43">The validity of peptide/spectrum matches (PSMs) was assessed with DTASelect2 using two SEQUEST defined parameters, the cross-correlation score (XCorr), and normalized difference in cross-correlation scores (DeltaCN). The search results were grouped by charge state (+1, +2, +3, and greater than +3) and tryptic status (fully tryptic, half-tryptic, and non-tryptic), resulting in 12 distinct sub-groups. In each one of these sub-groups, the distribution of XCorr, DeltaCN, and DeltaMass values for (a) direct and (b) decoy database PSMs was obtained, then the direct and decoy subsets were separated by discriminant analysis. Full separation of the direct and decoy PSM subsets is not generally possible; therefore, peptide match probabilities were calculated based on a nonparametric fit of the direct and decoy score distributions. A peptide confidence of 95% was set as the minimum threshold and only peptides with delta mass less than 5&#x02009;ppm were accepted. The false discovery rate was calculated as the percentage of reverse decoy PSMs among all the PSMs that passed the 95% confidence threshold. After this last filtering step, we estimate that the peptide false discovery rates were below 1%.
