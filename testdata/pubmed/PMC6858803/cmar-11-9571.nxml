While the exact mechanisms of platinum-resistance remain unclear, evidence is accumulating for a connection between the organism&#x02019;s immune-response and response to platinum. However, predictive tools are missing. This study was performed to examine the putative role of the genetic tumor immune-microenvironment in mediating differential chemotherapy response in HGSOC patients.</p></sec><sec id="S2002"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Expression profiling of 770 immune-related genes was performed in tumor tissues from 23 HGSOC cases. Tumors were screened for prognostic and predictive biomarkers using the NanoString nCounter platform for digital gene expression analysis with the appurtenant PanCancer Immune Profiling panel. As validation cohort, gene expression data (RNA Seq) of 303 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) were retrieved from the <italic>The Cancer Genome Atlas</italic> (TCGA) database. Different scoring-systems were computed for prediction of risk-of-resistance to cisplatin, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).</p></sec><sec id="S2003"><title>Results</title><p>Validated on the TCGA-dataset, the developed scores identified 11 significantly differentially expressed genes (p &#x0003c;0.01**) associated with platinum response. HSD11B1 was highly significantly associated with lower risk of recurrence and 7 targets were found highly significantly influencing OS time (p &#x0003c;0.01**).</p></sec><sec id="S2004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that response to platinum-based therapy and DFS in ovarian HGSOC is associated with distinct gene-expression patterns related to the tumor immune-system. We generated predictive scoring systems which proved valid when applied to a set of 303 EOC patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>tumor microenvironment</kwd><kwd>predictive biomarkers</kwd><kwd>platinum-resistance</kwd><kwd>HGSOC</kwd><kwd>gene expression signatures</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="44"/><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy with a worldwide annual incidence of approximately 240,000 and is responsible for 152,000 cancer-related deaths every year.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In Germany, 7380 women were diagnosed with EOC in 2012. EOC is responsible for 3.3% of all malignant neoplasms and 5.6% of all cancer deaths in women in Germany.<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> As characteristic early symptoms are missing, most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. The most common ovarian cancer subtype is high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Standard treatment consists of radical cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. However, the relative 5-year survival remains poor and despite optimal cytoreductive surgery and standard-of-care chemotherapy, the majority of patients will ultimately relapse due to the development of platinum resistance.<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Platinum-analogs are genotoxic compounds inducing DNA damage which in turn leads to TP53-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It is, however, uncertain whether the failure of this mechanism alone is responsible for impaired therapy response. Several studies have therefore attempted to understand the basis of poor treatment response.<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The platinum-free interval to relapse has been identified as a predictive factor for response to subsequent platinum therapy.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Thus, resistance to first-line platinum therapy limits therapeutic options for the relapsed disease significantly, making this patient cohort the most challenging to treat.</p><p>Several mechanisms leading to platinum resistance have been identified such as reduced intracellular cisplatin accumulation due to alterations in transmembrane transport, activation of cell growth-promoting and DNA-damage repair pathways, aberrant DNA methylation, enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and reduced endocytosis of cisplatin.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>However, there are no established tools yet for predicting response to platinum therapy. Therefore, there is an unmet need for prognostic and predictive factors helping to identify patients at high risk for platinum resistance in order to select the adequate therapy for each individual.</p><p>In the last decades, the role of the immune system has been intensively studied in various cancers, including EOC, with the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) being positively correlated with progression-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> On the other hand, immunosuppressive factors also play a significant role in EOC. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) have been shown to create an immunosuppressive environment in EOC patients, resulting in poorer survival.<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> High mRNA and protein levels of FOXP3, a surface protein predominantly expressed in Treg cells, have been reported to be negative prognostic factors for PFS and OS in these patients.<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The significance of the expression of immunoregulatory proteins such as PD-1 and PD-L1 in EOC has gained increasing attention in the scientific community in recent years.<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies have been successfully used in patients with EOC in preclinical studies<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and are currently evaluated in clinical trials.</p><p>However, the connection between platinum sensitivity and the patient&#x02019;s immune-reaction as prognostic factors in HGSOC has not been understood yet. Mariya et al showed that the absence of TILs was an independent predictor for platinum resistance, indicating a possible correlation between the mechanisms of platinum resistance and those of immune-escape.<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Similarly, Lo et al reported an increase in CD3+, CD8+ and PD1+ TILs after neo-adjuvant platinum-based treatment in EOC patients in case TILs were present before therapy. In TIL-negative tumors, no increase could be observed following platinum-based therapy.<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The aim of the present study was to identify prognostic and predictive patterns of mRNA-expression in a small test cohort of platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive HGSOC cases using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel of the NanoString nCounter platform. Considering the information stated above regarding the relevance of the organism&#x02019;s immune-response for platinum-sensitivity and therapy outcome, we focused our analysis on a panel of 770 immune-related genes. Our hypothesis was that, as the effectivity of the immune-answer is highly relevant for the course of disease, the genetic regulation of immune-related processes might allow a prediction of therapy response and prognosis.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Patient Cohort And Study Design</title><p>In this retrospective study, ovarian tumor tissues of 24 patients with the primary diagnosis of HGSOC were investigated.

Score1 and Score2 led to a logistic regression model (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), Score3 defined a clear cut-off between responders and non-responders.

Applying Score1, Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 when compared with specificity and sensitivity in predicting platinum-response, Score2 revealed and AUC of 0.99 and Score3 an AUC of 1.0. The logistic regression revealed a significance for Score1 of p=0.0078, for Score2 of p=0.0042.

When checking the risk-of-resistance score (Score1) for its predictivity against the appearance of platinum resistance, a clear separation of both groups can be observed (<bold>B</bold>). Similarly, when applying the RecScore to time-of-recurrence of each patient, low scores (0&#x02013;2) predict a significantly shortened DFS, whereas high scores (3&#x02013;4) lead to relatively long DFS times with medians between 40 and 60 months (<bold>D</bold>). Whereas scores 0 and 1 show exclusively short-time responser/survivor, score 2 shows first outliers with longer survival time, even when the overwhelming majority is still not responding at all.

Validation on the TCGA data-set showed a very good concordance for platinum-resistance and DFS. These results suggest that the gene expression patterns found in our study sample might represent essential mechanisms in HGSOC which could help to predict response to adjuvant therapy as well as the duration of the therapeutic effect.</p><p>Our results show a strong association of platinum-resistance with the expression of genes related to i) T- and B-cell receptor signaling, ii) natural killer cell-mediated toxicity and iii) leukocyte transendothelial migration. Interestingly, the expression of these pathways seems to be upregulated in platinum-resistant tumors. This might seem to be contradictory to the observation that the presence and activity of TILs correlate with better prognosis in HGSOC. However, the up-regulation of CD3, CD4 and CD25 indicate a high proportion of Tregs among the T-cells, a population known to create an immunosuppressive environment which has been associated with worse prognosis.<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Another explanation for the significant up-regulation of lymphocyte-associated genes could be found considering the fact that the over-expression of mentioned genes does not allow any quantitative statements concerning the number of immune cells actually present at the tumor site. Therefore, the increased expression activity could also mirror a lack of active T- and B-cells in terms of a positive feedback mechanism. This seems especially likely considering the results of Mariya et al reporting the absence of TILs in platinum-resistant tumors.<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Considering the results of Lo et al, it can be expected that even following platinum-based chemotherapy, there will be no increase in TILs in these patients. It can be hypothesized that in the platinum-resistant subset of tumors, immunosuppressive mechanisms are at play in the tumor microenvironment, which prevent lymphocytes to infiltrate the tumor even despite massive up-regulation of the associated genes. In order to shed some light on these mechanisms, an evaluation of TILs in correlation with gene expression profiles could be the next step for further investigation.</p><p>For DFS, the observed effect could mainly be attributed to the HSD11B1 gene which codes for the microsomal enzyme hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase. There are to our knowledge no available data on the biologic significance of HSD11B1 in ovarian cancer. However, single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene have been reported to play a role in the susceptibility for colorectal cancer.<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> As HSD11B1 is mainly responsible for the regeneration of cortisol from cortisone, it can be hypothesized that differences in the corticoid metabolism in the tumor microenvironment contribute to different outcomes in EOC. However, the biologic significance of these observation has yet to be understood.</p><p>The scoring system for the prediction of OS failed to prove the same accuracy when applied to the TCGA data-set as when applied to our trainings data. This could be due to a number of different reasons.</p><p>First of all, OS is not as directly related to tumor biology and response to therapy as DFS, as it is not only influenced by tumor-related deaths but also by comorbidities and side-effects of therapy, among others. Secondly, the sequence of therapies used for the, often, multiple recurrences vary widely between patients. As any line of therapy or combination of therapies is likely to influence survival, this makes the results hardly comparable between different populations. Moreover, the usage of different methods for RNA expression quantification (NanoString nCounter digital gene expression analysis versus RNA-sequencing in the TCGA dataset) have to be taken into account. Therefore, the (overall) high concordance between both training and validation cohort highlight the significance of the discovered underlying gene expression signature.</p><p>Besides the difference in the detection method between trainings- and validation cohort, a further limitation of these studies is the relatively small sample size used in the training cohort. Results of a complex field as host&#x02019;s anti-cancer immune response rendered on 24 subjects must be weighted carefully. We used this approach as we could train our model on a homogenous, well-characterized cohort of HGSOC, and rendered reliability by validating on a big, diverse collective including different kinds of EOC. Also, the usage of the enzyme-free gene expression quantification method strengthens our results, as the method renders a digital signal by counting single barcodes, each referring to one single-detected mRNA, and is therefore independent of overall signal intensity, making the results more reliable.<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that response to platinum-based therapy and DFS is associated with distinct gene-expression patterns related to the immune system. While the exact underlying mechanisms are not fully understood yet, we generated as set of predictive scoring systems which proved valid when applied to the TCGA data-set of 303 EOC patients. Forthcoming investigation has to elucidate the biological function and significance of these genetic patterns found. Validation of the newly developed scoring systems on larger series will help to answer the question if they can help to select high-risk patients in need for a modification of the standard adjuvant treatment in the future. Furthermore, these scores will have to be evaluated in a prospective setting in order to prove their value as predictive markers. As biomarkers for therapy stratification are missing in ovarian cancer, further research on the foundation of our results should be done to address this urgent issue.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that response to platinum-based therapy and DFS in ovarian HGSOC is associated with distinct gene-expression patterns related to the tumor immune-system.
