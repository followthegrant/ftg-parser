In addition, Rrp6, a component of the nuclear exosome, also contributes to heterochromatin assembly and is coupled with non-coding RNA transcription. The multi-subunit complex Mediator, which directs initiation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, has recently been suggested to function after initiation in processes such as elongation of transcription and splicing. However, the role of Mediator in the regulation of chromatin structure is not well understood. We investigated the role of Mediator in pericentromeric heterochromatin formation and found that deletion of specific subunits of the head domain of Mediator compromised heterochromatin structure. The Mediator head domain was required for Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin nucleation at the pericentromere and for RNAi-dependent spreading of heterochromatin into the neighboring region. In the latter process, Mediator appeared to contribute to efficient processing of siRNA from transcribed non-coding RNA, which was required for efficient spreading of heterochromatin. Furthermore, the head domain directed efficient transcription in heterochromatin. These results reveal a pivotal role for Mediator in multiple steps of transcription-coupled formation of pericentromeric heterochromatin. This observation further extends the role of Mediator to co-transcriptional chromatin regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>DNA is packaged into chromatin structure, which is important for various genome functions such as gene expression and maintenance of genetic information. Heterochromatin is a condensed chromatin structure and involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression through repression of transcription. Heterochromatin at the pericentromeric repeats in fission yeast is assembled by two distinct mechanisms, RNAi-dependent and Rrp6, a component of the nuclear exosome, -dependent mechanisms. In addition, heterochromatin spreads into neighboring regions in an RNAi-dependent manner. Both mechanisms are coupled with the transcription from the target loci by RNA polymerase II, but the molecular nature of the coupling is not understood. Here we showed that the multi-subunit complex Mediator, which directs initiation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, functions in the coupling between transcription and heterochromatin assembly. Mediator is required for Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin assembly and contributes to the RNAi-dependent spreading of heterochromatin via enhancement of production of siRNA by RNAi machinery. These observations highlight the multi-functions of Mediator in the transcription-coupled processes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>YM was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> provides a good model system for investigating heterochromatin formation. In fission yeast, heterochromatin is preferentially enriched across large chromosomal domains at the pericentromeres, subtelomeres and the mating-type locus. These regions are rich in methylation of histone H3K9 (H3K9me), which is catalyzed by the histone methyltransferase Clr4, a homolog of mammalian SUV39h <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Rea1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Nakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

At the pericentromere, RNAi machinery plays essential roles in heterochromatin formation <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Volpe1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Motamedi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Pericentromeric heterochromatin is assembled on the outer repeat (<italic>otr</italic>) region (containing of <italic>dg</italic> and <italic>dh</italic> repeats), and the outer portion of the innermost repeats (<italic>imr</italic>), which surround the central core (<italic>cnt</italic>) domain, the site of kinetochore assembly <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Chikashige1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The repeats are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to produce non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) during S-phase <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Djupedal1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Transcribed ncRNAs give rise to double-strand RNA via the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RDRC), comprised of Rdp1, Cid12 and Hrr1, and are processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the RNase III helicase Dicer (Dcr1). The siRNAs are then loaded into an RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex composed of Ago1, Tas3 and Chp1 <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Motamedi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. siRNAs target the RITS complex to cognate nascent transcripts, resulting in the recruitment of additional factors, including RDRC and ultimately Clr4, to methylate histone H3K9. Generation of siRNAs and heterochromatin assembly are interdependent processes that form a self-enforcing loop <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Noma1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Sugiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Importantly, RNAPII appears to couple transcription at the target loci with the generation of siRNAs. This was shown by the fact that a specific mutation in RNAPII results in a decrease in heterochromatic histone modifications, accumulation of pericentromeric transcripts, and accompanying loss of siRNAs, which are effects that were observed previously in RNAi mutants <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Heterochromatin, once established, spreads into neighboring region, which is typically shown by the heterochromatin formation and silencing of the genes inserted into heterochromatin. This process depends on RNAi system and probably couples with transcription <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Irvine1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Nuclear RNA is monitored by a nuclear RNA surveillance system involving exosomes with 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease activity, and a portion of the ncRNA at the pericentromere has been shown to be degraded by the nuclear exosome <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Bhler1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Bhler2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition to RNA degradation, 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; exonuclease Rrp6, a component of the nuclear exosome, was shown to mediate heterochromatin formation in parallel with RNAi, which is demonstrated by the cumulative increase and decrease of H3K9me at the pericentromere in the double null-mutant of <italic>ago1</italic> and <italic>rrp6</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1003677-ReyesTurcu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Since the amount of siRNA is not affected by depletion of Rrp6, Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin formation occurs via a pathway that is distinct from that of RNAi-dependent siRNA generation <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Bhler1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The molecular basis of the Rrp6-dependent pathway is not yet clear.</p><p>The <italic>cenH</italic> sequence, which shows 96% homology to centromeric <italic>dg</italic> and <italic>dh</italic> repeats, is present at the silent mating-type (<italic>mat2/3</italic>) locus and serves as an RNAi-dependent heterochromatin nucleation center <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Volpe1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Grewal2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In parallel with the RNAi-dependent pathway, the ATF/CREB family DNA-binding proteins, Atf1 and Pcr1, participate in heterochromatin nucleation with a histone deacetylase, Clr3 <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Jia1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Mediator, which is a well-conserved protein complex consisting of at least 20 subunits, was first identified as a factor that mediates DNA transcription factors binding at regulatory sequneces and RNAPII at promoters for the efficient start of transcription <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Kelleher1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and has been shown to be required for transcription of almost all protein-coding genes <italic>in vivo</italic>

Structural analysis indicates that this complex consists of four distinct structural domains: head, middle, tail and kinase. The head domain is responsible for extensive interaction with RNAPII, and the Med18/Pmc6-Med20 heterodimer, which is a portion of the head domain, binds to the core head domain through the C-terminal helix of Med8 <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Lariviere2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The head domain stabilizes the connection between RNAPII and TFIIH, which facilitates the transition from initiation complex to elongation complex <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Imasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In addition to the promotion of general transcription from protein-coding genes, recent studies have revealed a new function of Mediator. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, Mediator directs the transcription of ncRNA genes by recruiting RNAPII to their promoters <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In mammalian cells, a specific subunit of Mediator functions as an interaction site for alternative mRNA splicing or transcription elongation factors <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. These data suggest that Mediator might play roles in both transcription elongation and the subsequent processing of transcripts as a platform for the recruitment of various factors.</p><p>Since both Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin formation and RNAi-dependent heterochromatin formation are coupled with transcription, we assumed that the factor(s) that interacts with RNAPII directs the coupling. Therefore, we assessed the role of several RNAPII-interacting factors in pericentromeric heterochromatin assembly. We found that the disruption of Med18 and Med20, non-essential subunits of the Mediator head domain (MHD), compromised both RNAi-dependent and Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin assembly at the pericentromere. In addition, the head domain is required for transcriptional activation in heterochromatin. Therefore, we propose that Mediator links transcription of ncRNA and its processing by RNAi and exosomes for the formation of centromeric heterochromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mediator is required for heterochromatic silencing at the pericentromeres</title><p>To investigate whether Mediator is involved in heterochromatin assembly, each gene encoding a non-essential subunit of mediator was disrupted in a strain possessing marker genes in the pericentromeric heterochromatin (<italic>otr1R::ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>imr1L::ura4<sup>+</sup></italic>) to monitor heterochromatic silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003677-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Allshire1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

To test the stability of the pink and white phenotype, pink and white colonies of each mutant were selected, cultured in YES media overnight and re-spotted onto Low Ade and 5-FOA plates. Re-spotting of the cells from white colonies (<italic>med18&#x00394;-w, med20&#x00394;-w</italic> and <italic>med8-K9-w</italic>) and pink colonies (<italic>med18&#x00394;-p med20&#x00394;-p</italic> and <italic>med8-K9-p</italic>) produced predominantly white colonies and pink colonies, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003677-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003677.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). This indicated that the white and pink phenotypes were epigenetically inherited through generation but exchangeable, which is further confirmed by the measurements of the conversion rates between white and pink epiclones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003677.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The conversion rates are different in each mutants, but in all mutants, conversion rates from pink to white is higher than those of white to pink, showing that white-epiclones, in which heterochromatin is compromised, are more stable. Hereafter, we designate the epigenetic clones derived from white colonies and red colonies as white and pink &#x0201c;epiclones&#x0201d;, respectively. <italic>med18&#x00394;-w</italic> and <italic>med20&#x00394;-w</italic> showed greater sensitivity to 5-FOA than <italic>med18&#x00394;-p</italic> and <italic>med20&#x00394;-p</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003677-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that silencing at <italic>imr1L::ura4<sup>+</sup></italic> was also compromised more severely in the white epiclones and that the silencing defect at <italic>otr1R::ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> is connected with that at <italic>imr1L::ura4<sup>+</sup></italic>.

We found that at the pericentromeric heterochromatin, in the absence of MHD, the Rrp6-dependent pathway is compromised and H3K9me is largely maintained by the RNAi-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003677-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The finding that the amount of siRNA produced in the white epiclones of MHD mutants decreased to 3&#x02013;20% of that in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003677-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003677.s005">Figure S5</xref>) indicates that only a small amount of siRNA is necessary to maintain heterochromatin at the pericentromeric repeats. The remaining H3K9me at the repeats in MHD mutants spreads onto the marker genes by an RNAi-dependent mechanism. This process was also compromised by the decrease of siRNA caused by the absence of MHD, resulting in variegation of the level of H3K9me at the marker genes, which ultimately caused the appearance of white and pink epiclones. The spreading process appears to require more efficient siRNA production than the maintenance of heterochromatin at the pericentromeric repeats because <italic>med18&#x00394;-p</italic> cells that produced more siRNA showed more efficient spreading of H3K9me and silencing of marker genes than <italic>med18&#x00394;-w</italic> cells. In contrast, <italic>dcr1&#x00394;</italic> cells did not show the variegation of silencing because of loss of siRNA production. It is noteworthy that the variegated phenotype was metastable, which suggests that once heterochromatin was spread into the marker gene, it could be maintained in an MHD-independent manner, probably through the small amount of siRNA produced in MHD mutants.</p><p>Many processes involved in RNA processing, such as RNA splicing and RNA transport, are coupled to transcription by RNAPII. siRNA production is also coupled with RNAPII-dependent transcription <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Kato1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Our results showed that the mutation of MHD resulted in a large decrease in siRNA. By contrast, <italic>rrp6&#x00394;</italic> cells, which have levels of H3K9me and Swi6 at the pericentromeric repeats similar to <italic>med18&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003677-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), produced the same amount of siRNA as wild-type cells <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Bhler1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These results indicate that MHD is somehow involved in siRNA production after transcription of ncRNA. MHD is localized at the transcribed region in pericentromeric repeats (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1003677.s004">Figure S4</xref>; <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Carlsten1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Thorsen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and is required for transcription in heterochromatin, suggesting that it directly functions in the coupling of transcription of heterochromatic ncRNA by RNAPII and processing of the siRNA by RNAi machinery. Retention of RNAi factors at the pericentromeric repeats in <italic>med18&#x00394;</italic> cells and the requirement for MHD in heterochromatin formation via the artificial tethering of the RITS complex to RNA suggest that MHD functions after RITS associates with heterochromatic repeats and/or target RNA. Recently, we showed that RNAi factors are assembled into an siRNA amplification compartment that includes transcriptionally active heterochromatin <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Kawakami1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Thus, MHD might be involved in the formation of this compartment. Although we were not able to detect a stable interaction between MHD components and RNAi factors, such as Ago1, by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown), it is still possible that MHD recruits factors required for siRNA generation to transcriptionally active heterochromatin through direct or indirect interactions. In any case, further experiments are necessary to clarify the molecular function of Mediator in the RNAi pathway.</p><p>In contrast to the RNAi pathway, little is known about the Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin formation pathway. As deletion of <italic>rrp6</italic> marginally affects H3K9me and silencing at the inserted marker genes <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Bhler1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-ReyesTurcu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, the Rrp6-dependent pathway mainly functions at the pericentromeric repeats. Our genetic experiments showed that <italic>rrp6</italic> and <italic>med18</italic> were epistatic in the formation of pericentromeric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003677-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating that MHD functions in Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin formation. Rrp6 is an exonuclease that is a subunit of the nuclear exosome involved in RNA-quality control <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Houseley1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. A functional relationship between Mediator and the nuclear exosome has not been reported. We found that Rrp6 associates with both heterochromatin (<italic>dh</italic>) as well as euchromatin (<italic>act1</italic> and <italic>fbp1</italic>) and deletion of <italic>med18</italic> did not affect the localization, suggesting Mediator acts in a step after the association of Rrp6/exsosome with chromatin. This is analogous to the function of Mediator in the RNAi-dependent pathway; MHD functions after recruitment of RITS complex and RDRC to chromatin. Considering the co-transcriptional nature of RNA-quality control <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Huertas1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Suganuma1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and recruitment of RNA-splicing factors to transcripts by Mediator <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, we speculate that MHD plays a role in the co-transcriptional function of chromatin-associated Rrp6 and/or other co-factors to promote heterochromatin formation. Alternatively, given that the RNAi-independent heterochromatin nucleation pathway and Mediator functionally interact with RNAPII processivity factors <xref rid="pgen.1003677-ReyesTurcu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, Mediator may promote Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin formation by affecting elongation by RNAPII through interaction with these processivity factors. It is also possible that the same mechanism is also involved in RNAi-dependent heterochromatin formation through MHD.</p><p>Recently, two reports showed that MHD was important for heterochromatin formation at pericentromeres <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Carlsten1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Thorsen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, there are several discrepancies between their data and ours. Firstly, the decrease in H3K9me and Swi6 in <italic>med20&#x00394;</italic> cells was much more severe than that in ours. Secondly, Carlsten et al. claimed that siRNA from the <italic>dh</italic> repeat in <italic>med20&#x00394;</italic> cells was diminished but that siRNA from the <italic>dg</italic> repeats was comparable to that in wild-type cells. Thirdly, both papers assert that Mediator negatively regulates heterochromatic transcription. The first two discrepancies could be caused by the variegated phenotype of MHD mutants. If this variegated phenotype was overlooked or disregarded, the results would be affected by which epiclones were used in the experiments. In addition, since the amount of H3K9me/Swi6 varies depending on the position in the repeats, the discrepancies between their results and ours might reflect a difference in the sites used for ChIP analysis. The third discrepancy could be explained by the use of pericentromeric transcription for their analysis. As described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> section, it is hard to argue definitively for the direct influence of MHD mutants on transcription in pericentromeric heterochromatin because it is difficult to determine whether the observed increase is due to the direct effect of depletion of MHD or a secondary effect resulting from the disruption of heterochromatin. Our data using the mating-type locus heterochromatin showed that disruption of Mediator did not cause increased transcription in heterochromatin, rather it caused a decrease in transcription enhanced by deletion of <italic>dcr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1003677-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Interestingly, when heterochromatin was compromised, Mediator appears to negatively regulate transcription, which might also explain the discrepancy.</p><p>Recently, Dcr1 was shown to repress a set of genes, including stress response genes, through the degradation of target RNA <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Woolcock1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We identified a similar set of euchromatic genes that were up-regulated in <italic>med20&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>dcr1&#x00394;</italic> cells, suggesting that MHD functions in co-transcriptional degradation of euchromatic RNAs in collaboration with Dcr1. Note that previous transcriptome analysis of the mediator mutants also showed that a similar set of genes were up regulated in <italic>med18&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>med20&#x00394;</italic> cells but not in <italic>med12&#x00394;</italic> cells, supporting the collaborative function of MHD and Dcr1 <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Linder1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In addition, Rrp6-dependent heterochromatin formation was observed at several meiotic genes <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Zofall1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Moreover, the exosome and RNAi are shown to regulate a set of genes, including retrotransposons and developmental genes <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Yamanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Therefore, it is also possible that Mediator functions at these loci to silence genes by regulating both RNAi and exosomal machineries.</p><p>Emerging evidence shows that Mediator works as a platform for various factors that function in transcription and RNA processing, using a distinct subunit for particular interactions with the factors <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1003677-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Our results further extend the range of Mediator function to include regulation of higher-order chromatin structure in the genome. It is now widely accepted that RNAPII transcribes almost all of the genome.
