In addition to describing phenomenological aspects of tremor we thus aimed at assessing tremor frequency. Our hypothesis was that primary bowing tremor is similar to the phenomenological aspects and frequency of primary writing tremor.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We quantified primary bowing tremor in four violinists under two conditions: open strings and a G major scale. Data were analyzed using empirical mode decomposition because it takes into account non-stationarity and non-linearity of signals. For each patient we further described tremor phenomenology and assessed symptom onset, risk factors, medication, and family history with a structured anamnesis. We compare the findings to previous findings for primary bowing tremor and primary writing tremor.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We mainly found a flexion&#x02013;extension tremor of the wrist with a frequency range of 4.7&#x02013;6.7&#x02005;Hz. There was no significant difference between the conditions. Mean onset age was 43&#x000b1;2.4 years. Medication included trihexyphenidyl, propranolol, primidone, and botulinum toxin. We found a positive family history in two patients and an injury prior to symptom onset in another two patients. Comparison of onset age, frequency range, family history, and injuries prior to onset revealed that our findings are very similar to previous findings on primary bowing tremor and primary writing tremor.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings confirmed our hypothesis that primary bowing tremor is similar to primary writing tremor, with regard to phenomenology and epidemiology as well as tremor frequency. There was no difference in tremor frequency between conditions, suggesting that tremor is not influenced by bimanual coordination or bowing speed. Our findings thus provide new phenomenological aspects and may contribute to a better understanding of primary bowing tremor.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Essential tremor</kwd><kwd>dystonia</kwd><kwd>dystonic tremor</kwd><kwd>empirical mode decomposition</kwd><kwd>Hilbert spectrum</kwd><kwd>musician</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Task-specific tremors occur mainly during specific activities.<xref rid="b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The most common form is primary writing tremor (PWT), first described by Rothwell.<xref rid="b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Two types exist: Type A, referring to tremor induced by writing (task specific); and type B, referring to tremor induced when holding the arm in the position for writing (position specific). It is an ongoing discussion, whether PWT is a type of focal dystonia, a subentity of essential tremor or a nosological entity of its own.<xref rid="b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Recent research suggests that it is a separate entity. <xref rid="b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>In bowed string instrumentalists task-specific tremors may occur unilaterally in the right arm<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> as primary bowing tremor (PBT), a highly disabling condition that may threaten a professional career. In two recent papers it was proposed that PBT may be regarded an entity of its own, similar to PWT.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, in neither of these papers was tremor frequency quantified. Since frequency is one of the main criteria that help distinguish between tremor syndromes,<xref rid="b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> our first aim was to quantify the frequency of PBT. In addition, we describe in detail PBT phenomenology with regard to tremor onset, response to medication, spreading of tremor to other activities, risk factors, and positive family history, and compare our findings with the findings from five patients with PBT described by Lederman<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and with PWT patients.<xref rid="b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Furthermore, it is known that in long bow strokes a finger change in the left hand may have an influence on the action of the bowing hand.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Our second aim was therefore to investigate whether bimanual coordination or a change in bowing speed has an influence on tremor, to gain more insight into tremor phenomenology.</p><p>Since PBT is an action-induced tremor, difficulty arises when measuring tremor of the arm during execution of voluntary movements. One can therefore not rule out that voluntary movements interfere with the measured tremor signal. Furthermore, it is known that pathological tremor, in contrast to physiological tremor, is a nonlinear process.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Finally, our signal was highly non-stationary. To address these three problems we decided to analyze the data with empirical mode decomposition (EMD),<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> a data-driven signal-processing method that takes into account the non-linearity and non-stationarity of signals.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Furthermore, it has been shown that with the EMD, voluntary movement can be distinguished from tremor.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the local ethics committee.

Since playing long, slow legato notes using the entire length of the bow (&#x02248;65&#x02005;cm from the frog [i.e. the end of the bow held by the player] to the tip) evoked the most severe symptoms, we chose to measure this bowing technique. To assess whether bimanual coordination or bowing speed has an influence on tremor, we measured two conditions paced by a metronome set to 40&#x02005;bpm. 1) A G major scale across three octaves using the whole bow (GM). Two beats were used per bowing direction during which eight notes were played. 2) Open strings (OS) with four beats per bowing direction. In addition, we measured postural tremor in both arms, during which the patients held the arm in position for playing the violin. Finally, rest tremor was measured for which the patient was asked to completely relax the arm.</p><p><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Phenomenology, Treatment, and Frequency of PBT for the four patients</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="95%"><thead style="border-bottom: thin solid;

The <italic>z</italic>-axis thus represented the direction of tremor and was chosen for further analyses. Data were bandpass filtered using a fourth-order Butterworth filter (cutoff 1&#x02013;50&#x02005;Hz), applied back and forth to compensate for phase shift. The EMD was applied, which decomposes the signal into basic components, called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure&#x02005;2A</xref>). The resulting IMFs can be considered as simple oscillatory modes with the following properties: 1) the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings is either equal or differ at most by one, and 2) at any time the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope defined by the local minima is zero. Recent studies investigating tremor have shown that IMFs can be used to identify distinct frequency bands associated with physical or physiological phenomena, e.g. different types of tremor.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In these studies tremor was assessed with a gyroscope; however, the EMD is viable for time-frequency data analysis without making presuppositions on how the signal is acquired.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It has thus also been applied to accelerometer data.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We therefore consider the EMD a valid approach to our data.

A Hilbert transform was applied to the IMFs to obtain the instantaneous frequency and amplitude (Hilbert spectrum). In the current study IMF3 was identified as the mode containing the tremor signal in all patients. Finally, tremor history was acquired, including symptom onset, response to medication, and spreading of tremor to other activities, as well as risk factors such as previous trauma and family history. This information was obtained with a structured anamnesis asking for the corresponding item. In all patients we assessed parkinsonism by investigating signs for rigor, rest tremor, or akinesis.</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Placement of the Accelerometer on the Dorsum of the Hand.</title><p>The three axes (<italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic>) are indicated by arrows.

The main frequency was 5.9&#x02005;Hz for the OS condition and 6.7&#x02005;Hz for the GM condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure&#x02005;2B</xref>). There were no signs of parkinsonism or other extrapyramidal disorders. Since 2009, the tremor has spread to other activities, such as filling a glass of water; however, it is less severe and still unilateral. His father suffered from writer's cramp or PWT. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a single, frontal white matter lesion. A dopamine transporter (DAT) scan, full blood count, and electrophysiological measures for motor evoked potentials were normal. Somatosensory evoked potentials were marginally prolonged. Tremor responded to beta-blockers (propranolol 20&#x02005;mg); however, the effect wore off after 1 year. Alcohol reduced tremor. Trihexiphenidyl (6&#x02005;mg) had no effect. Botulinum toxin injections had a slight effect. Primidone (62.5&#x02005;mg) helped but had to be discontinued due to side effects.

Further clinical examination did not reveal any signs of parkinsonism or other extrapyramidal disorders. A DAT scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and a full blood count were normal.

This phenomenon has been described in PWT<xref rid="b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and a strict task specificity has been questioned in recent discussions.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> An &#x0201c;increasing tendency to appear the more the act resembles writing&#x0201d;<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> (or in our case playing the violin) and as an evolution of the disorder in the course of time<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> have been discussed. Two of our patients (1 and 2) and two of the patients described by Lederman<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> had a positive family history of movement disorders, which alludes to a genetic for PBT risk factor in PWT.<xref rid="b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>In two patients (1 and 4) trauma preceded the onset of PBT. Similarly, a coincidence between previous trauma and PWT was described in 19% of cases,<xref rid="b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> alluding to environmental risk factors playing a role in the development of PBT as well. We cannot rule out, however, that the trauma merely unmasked the tremor rather than being causative. The study by Lederman did not mention a traumatic event prior to PBT onset.</p><p>With regard to treatment, Botulinum toxin led to an improvement in two of our patients (1 and 3), which is in accordance with studies reporting improvement in PWT with Botulinum toxin.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Oral medication included propranolol, primidone, gabapentin and trihexiphenidyl, of which primidone and/or propranolol were most effective for all patients. Trihexiphenidyl had an effect in patient 1. Likewise, in the case series by Lederman, a beneficial effect of propranolol and trihexyphenidyl (patient 1 and 4, respectively) was reported.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This is in accordance with reports that about 60% of patients with PWT benefit from oral medication<xref rid="b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and 33% respond specifically to primidone or propranolol.<xref rid="b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Alcohol relieved symptoms in patient 1 and 2, as well as in patient 5 described by Lederman,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> which is similar to PWT, where an improvement has been reported in about 33% of the cases.<xref rid="b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>What is new in our study is that by quantifying tremor we could include a comparison of tremor frequency ranges between PBT and PWT. We found a frequency range of 4.7&#x02013;6.7&#x02005;Hz, which is comparable to the range reported in PWT (4.1&#x02013;7.3&#x02005;Hz).<xref rid="b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We are aware, however, that this frequency range is not specific for PWT and that a conclusion with regard to whether or not PBT may be an entity of its own cannot be drawn on the basis of our data. Further electrophysiological studies are necessary to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p>Finally, we found no difference of tremor frequency between the conditions. This suggests a robustness of tremor against bimanual coordination or bowing speed, at least for the conditions we measured, and thus adds another phenomenological feature to PBT.</p><fig id="v01" position="anchor"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Unmarked festgelegt von lee.</title><p>First a short up-bow movement on the g string and then a short up- and down-bow movement on the d string are visible and audible.
