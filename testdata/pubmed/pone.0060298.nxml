However, T cells have been proven difficult to modify using non-viral methods such as lipid-based plasmid transfection reagents, like Lipofectamine. These methods have been associated with high toxicity and low efficiency<xref rid="pone.0060298-Ebert1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The development of retroviral/lentiviral vector based transduction led to efficient gene transfer when using T lymphocytes <xref rid="pone.0060298-Salmon1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0060298-Bonini1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and other hematopoietic cells <xref rid="pone.0060298-Cartier1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060298-Bonamino1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, being the method of choice for clinical trials using transgene-modified T cells. <xref rid="pone.0060298-Bonini1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060298-DiStasi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0060298-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, such cell modification protocols are time-consuming and expensive, limiting a broader application in the clinical setting<xref rid="pone.0060298-Brenner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Electroporation has emerged as a powerful tool for the genetic modification of diverse cell types <xref rid="pone.0060298-Apollonio1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0060298-Murakami1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This technique is based on the transient disruption of cell membrane after exposure to an electric field, allowing charged molecules to enter the cell. The main potential disadvantages of this methodology are the excessive cell death and the low transfection efficiency, although these phenomena depend on the cell type used and electroporation conditions (including voltage and wave profile, time of the pulse and buffer composition). Indeed, early attempts of electroporating T cells with plasmid DNA resulted in low transgene expression <xref rid="pone.0060298-VanTendeloo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060298-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Several reports showed a high efficiency when using RNA <xref rid="pone.0060298-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, but this prevents the selection of cells with stable expression of the transgene. Of particular interest are the square-wave pulse based new electroporation devices, such as the broadly used Lonza Nucleofector II electroporation system, which showed high efficiency in the genetic modification of T cells applying proprietary electroporation buffers and electric parameters<xref rid="pone.0060298-Huls1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Using this methodology, according to Nucleofactor manufacturer, up to 80% of viability and 40&#x02013;60% of expression was achieved in human T cells; in murine T cells, usually harder to transfect, 35&#x02013;55% of viability and 20&#x02013;40% of expression can be achieved, varying according to the mouse strain used.</p><p>The use of this platform in combination with a non-viral genetic modification system capable of inducing stable expression of the transgene, such as the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon, configures an interesting approach for the genetic modification of T cells. The SB system consists of a transposase that recognizes flanking repetitive sequences in the transposon plasmid containing the transgene and mediates its integration in the host genome <xref rid="pone.0060298-Hackett1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. It has emerged as a gene transfer system with potential to be broadly used in gene transfer and therapy protocols, accomplishing clinical grade requirements <xref rid="pone.0060298-Kebriaei1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, with high efficiency in T cells. Due to a random integration profile, it minimizes the chance of insertional mutagenesis when compared with other transposon systems <xref rid="pone.0060298-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>The adoptive transfer of tumor-specific lymphocytes is a promising new strategy for cancer treatment <xref rid="pone.0060298-Restifo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060298-Rosenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, this approach is largely dependent on tumor infiltrating lymphocyte expansion and/or T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer <xref rid="pone.0060298-Rosenberg2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. More recently, T lymphocytes carrying Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) molecules proved successful in clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0060298-Pule1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060298-Kalos1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060298-Kochenderfer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. These receptors consist of an extracellular domain derived from an antibody that recognizes the antigen, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular signaling domain capable of activating the lymphocyte. Such a receptor allows the recognition of the antigen in a HLA-independent fashion. Despite the poor response observed in early clinical trials, which used CARs containing only the CD3zeta signaling domain, the addition of costimulatory motifs such as CD28 or 4-1BB augmented the function and persistence of these cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, achieving objective clinical responses in several patients (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0060298-Chicaybam1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>). Importantly, it was recently showed that the transferred cells can persist for more than a decade after the infusion <xref rid="pone.0060298-Scholler1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Recent reports showed efficient generation of CAR-expressing T cells using the SB system <xref rid="pone.0060298-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0060298-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and this approach is already being used in clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0060298-Kebriaei1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Despite remarkable gene transfer rates<xref rid="pone.0060298-Huls1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, the high cost of Lonza compatible electroporation kits and the dependence on manufacturer reagents and devices may limit the application of this technology for large scale experiments, especially in the research settings where multiple electroporations may be required, for instance when testing different CAR constructs or modifying gene expression in T lymphocytes targeting several genes. We herein describe a new set of generic buffers optimized for the genetic modification of human and murine T lymphocytes using Lonz&#x000e0;s Nucleofactor II device. The combined use of our buffers with the SB system allowed the generation of transgene expressing lymphocytes with high efficiency avoiding using commercial Lonza kits. This approach allows the extensive testing for best electroporation conditions and robust transient or stable gene expression for studies requiring gene transfer to T lymphocytes either for basic research or experimental immunotherapy protocols.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Donors</title><p>The use of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) from healthy donors was approved by an IRB (Brazilian National Cancer Institute - INCa - Ethics Committee) and donors signed review board approved informed consents.

Human and, notably, mouse T lymphocytes are usually hard to electroporate and the emergence of systems like Lonza Nucleofector significantly improved transfection results. When large number of electroporations must be performed, costs associated with the acquisition of the electroporation kits can potentially limit its broad application. We herein report the development of in house buffers for the nucleofection of T cells, comprising different compositions and osmolarities, which allowed optimization of protocols for each target cell to be genetically modified (the results are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060298.s007">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>The Jurkat T cell line, a prototype CD4+ lymphocyte used in many cell signaling studies, could be efficiently electroporated with our protocol yielding high expression of the reporter gene but low viability. Although the initial level of cell viability precludes refined cell analysis in the first 72 hours, cells are able to recover, allowing long-term evaluation of gene expression when SB100x transposase was included. For human primary T cells, several buffers resulted in high electroporation scores, with expression in both CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060298-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Surprisingly, GFP expression was not detected in NK cells, despite the presence of this cell subset (data not shown), indicating that the main cell population receiving and expressing the transgene are T lymphocytes. NK cells were previously described as hard to transfect and electroporate, but some protocolos for exogenous gene expression in these cells &#x02013; NK-92 cell line and primary NK cells - were described <xref rid="pone.0060298-Sutlu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0060298-Tran1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. We have no explanation for the observed restriction of NK cells to electroporation under the conditions tested in this report and NK cell resistance is currently being addressed by our group.</p><p>Electroporation of activated human T cells was ineffective with all the buffers and programs tested resulting in large loss of cell viability due to electroporation (data not shown). These results suggest that, at least for the conditions we tested, activated T lymphocytes are extremely sensitive to the provided electric pulse and do not allow efficient genetic modification if activated. These results prompted us to explore resting T cell electroporation followed by activation.</p><p>For murine primary T cells, only anti-CD3 activated lymphocytes were effectively electroporated, with little difference between T cells from Balb/c, C57BL/6 and B10A mouse strains tested. These results suggest a complete different behavior and capacity to recover from the electric pulse for murine T cells if compared to their human counterparts. We compared our protocol to Lonza kits and found no major differences in electroporation efficiencies when testing both human and murine primary cells. These results establish the buffers described in our report as reliable alternatives to Lonza's kits. The attempt to increase electroporation efficacy by adding polymers (PEG and Poloxamer-188) to electroporation buffers showed no impact in the level of transgene expression or cell viability obtained. Testing of additional polymers may increase the efficiency of the protocol and is currently under evaluation.</p><p>The combined use of the in house buffers with the non-viral SB system consists in a valuable tool for stable genetic modification. Although in this report we did not unequivocally demonstrate the integration of transgenes in host cell DNA, long term expression of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060298-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and CAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060298-g008">Figures 8A and B</xref>) support the stable integration and expression of the transgenes transferred under the conditions tested. For mature T cells the risk of insertional mutagenesis is still theoretical <xref rid="pone.0060298-Newrzela1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060298-Westwood1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and the integration pattern of SB transposase in these cells seems fairly random, unlike <italic>piggyBac</italic> or Tol2 that have a &#x003b3; retrovirus-like profile <xref rid="pone.0060298-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These particular aspects indicate that using SB based technology combined with electroporation protocols represents one of the safest ways to transfer new genes to T lymphocytes. One potential limitation of the SB system is the overproduction inhibition, causing low transposition rates at high transposase concentration <xref rid="pone.0060298-Geurts1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Furthermore, when expressed at high levels, SB transposase exhibits a cytotoxic effect dependent of p53 and c-Jun <xref rid="pone.0060298-Galla1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, although we did not observe reductions in GFP expression due to this phenomenon despite the different proportions of pT2/SB tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060298-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060298.s003">S3</xref>) in primary human lymphocytes.

The current conditions described for electroporation and cell expansion lead to an efficient long term maintenance of primary human T cells carrying and expressing functional transgenes. Singh and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0060298-Singh2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> recently described a similar nucleofection system based on SB carrying CARs. Amongst the results described here, levels of transgene expression at day one after electroporation, presence of transgene protein in both CD4 and CD8 cells and the expansion rate of T lymphocytes after electroporation were very similar to those described by Singh and colleagues, reinforcing the equivalence of our in house system and the commercial available kits.</p><p>Finally, the new buffers described in this report are extremely useful in the context of experimental adoptive immunotherapy, specifically for the generation of antitumoral lymphocytes. As showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060298-g008">Figure 8(A-D)</xref>, long term expression of 20z CAR was successfully achieved conferring high cytotoxic activity against the engineered CD20+ Nalm-6 cell line to gene modified lymphocytes.

Thus, the method presented here provides the researcher with independence over kits manufacturer, allowing functional studies under relevant conditions at similar efficiencies if compared to commercial kits, expanding the possibility of evaluating T cell function even in large scale experiments requiring multiple electroporations of primary T cells. Furthermore, the approach described here represents a viable alternative to more labor-intensive and time consuming retro/lentiviral vector based gene transfer methods, which usually require 2-3 weeks for vector production, titration and quality control testing. Moreover, our formulation provides low-income laoboratories with an affordable protocol of nucleofection, making the genetic modification of T cells a straight forward and accessible method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0060298.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
