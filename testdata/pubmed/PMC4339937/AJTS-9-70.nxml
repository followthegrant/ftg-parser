Elevated levels of these hematopoietic growth factors have been observed in several bone marrow failure diseases such as aplastic anemia (AA) that is characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow hypocellularity.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It is a well-demonstrated fact that TPO is involved in stimulating the growth of committed megakaryocyte progenitors, with progressive maturation of megakaryocytes, and proplatelet formation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Several aspects of relationship between platelet concentration and serum TPO levels have been studied but with no conclusive evidence, with some studies indicating the platelets to contain TPO receptors that efficiently bind and remove TPO from circulation,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] hence, suggesting that circulating levels of TPO are inversely related to platelet mass. Several others opine that TPO is constantly produced <italic>in vivo</italic>, primarily in the liver and kidneys[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and that the circulating TPO levels are regulated by platelet concentration.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Even reports stating that megakaryocyte mass inside bone marrow may regulate circulating TPO levels are also available[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Recent addition being the exploration of hypothesis that TPO is under circadian control.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The circulatory level of TPO is expected to vary with blood platelet counts; therefore, it is prudent to study factors involved in platelet kinetics in patients with extremely low levels of platelet counts. There is probably no data about the same from Indian subcontinent. Hence, a pilot study was undertaken at our center to estimate the TPO levels in AA patients with varying severity of thrombocytopenia and to ascertain any relation with severity of disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This two year prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India.

AA patients not fulfilling the criteria for severe or very severe type were graded as nonsevere AA. The demographic and clinical details of patients and donors were recorded from blood donor cards, case files and computer-based hospital information system.</p><p>At the time of inclusion in the study, 2 ml of blood sample was collected in Ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) vials and 5 ml blood sample in plain glass tube. EDTA sample was used for determining platelet counts by automated cell counter (KX 21, Sysmex Corporation, Japan). The clotted sample was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min and supernatant serum was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until thawed for TPO testing by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Thrombopoietin testing</title><p>The test for detecting TPO was done by using DuoSet ELISA Developmental System human TPO (R&#x00026;D system, catalogue number DY288, Minneapolis, USA) containing the basic components required for the development of sandwich ELISA, as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the capture antibody (mouse antihuman TPO) solution was diluted to the strength of 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml by reconstituting it with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl. 8.1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> with pH of 7.2-7.4. The ELISA plate was prepared by pipetting 100 &#x003bc;l of reconstituted capture antibody solution per well and overnight incubation at room temperature (RT). After washing with wash buffer, the plate was blocked by adding 300 &#x003bc;l of block buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS with 0.05% NaN<sub>3</sub>, and incubated at RT for 1 h. The plate was ready to use after second wash with wash buffer. Sample measuring 100 &#x003bc;l was added per well and incubated at RT for 2 h. After washing, 100 &#x003bc;l of detection antibody (biotinylated goat antihuman TPO) reconstituted to the strength of 400 ng/ml in reagent diluent containing 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris buffered saline (20 mM Trizma Base, 150 mM NaCl) was added per well and incubated for 2 h at RT. The color was developed by adding streptavidin horseradish peroxidase and tetra methyl benzidine as substrate solution. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 &#x003bc;l of acid and absorbance was recorded at 450 nm. The lower limit of the sensitivity of the assay was calculated by plotting a standard curve against various sample concentration of the standard solution provided and was found to be 23.1 pg/ml.</p><p>Data were maintained on SPSS version 16 (IBM corporation, USA) and Mann-Whitney U test was applied to explore the TPO levels in AA patients on the basis of severity.

We recorded a 10-fold increase in serum TPO levels in AA patients as compared to normal healthy blood donors, which is in concordance to the studies done by Schrezenmeier <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Jing <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showing 25-fold and 14-fold increase in German and Chinese population, respectively. Recently in Japan, Abe <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have also documented elevated levels of serum TPO in AA patients. There appears to be great variations in serum TPO in AA patients based on geographic distribution, the reasons for the same are still not elucidated. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study exploring the TPO levels in AA patients and in healthy volunteers in Indian population.</p><p>Numerous theories have been postulated regarding regulation of TPO in humans but with no conclusive evidence. Kojima <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] opined that regulation of TPO in humans is a multifactorial response including up regulation due to feed back mechanism, decreased utilization, and decreased elimination. It was also thought that serum TPO regulation is very closely linked to megakaryocyte mass in bone marrow and that a critical amount of megakaryocyte mass was required to set up negative feedback[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] but Marsh and co-workers[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found high TPO levels in their study on AA patients who had either reduced or absent bone marrow megakaryocytes challenging the role of megakaryocytes in regulation of TPO. Also, studies showing both megakaryocyte and platelet expressing TPO receptors[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] highlighted the fact that there was an inverse relation between circulating platelet and serum TPO.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Recently Scheding <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have reported that circulating platelets regulates serum TPO levels by binding, internalization and degradation of endogenously produced TPO, which has been previously ruled out by Kojima <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as they did not find any significant reduction in serum TPO levels even after platelet transfusion. The evidences in support for regulation of serum TPO in patients of thrombocytopenia are still insufficient. We observed high levels of serum TPO in AA patients in our study but we were unable to demonstrate any significant correlation between circulating platelet counts and levels of serum TPO in AA patients with varying severity. These findings suggest that some other factors may contribute to regulation of TPO levels.</p><p>Similar to the findings of Kojima <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] we observed significantly elevated levels of serum TPO in patients of VSAA as compared to NSAA patients, while Marsh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] failed to observed this effect that may be due to lesser number of VSAA patients in their study. On the other hand, we did not observe any significant difference in TPO levels between SAA and NSAA though the trend was higher for SAA patients. Also, we were not able to find any significant correlation between serum TPO levels and circulating platelet counts that are in line with the observations made by Schrezenmeier <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Marsh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Thus, in our study where patients who already had been transfused with blood/component before they were referred to our hospital did not show any correlation. However, Kojima <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] did observe a significant correlation between serum TPO and circulating platelets only in the patients who had not received any platelet transfusions. Supporting the observation of Schrezenmeier <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] on TPO levels in healthy controls, we also observed no significant correlation between serum TPO levels and circulating platelet counts in normal healthy blood donors.</p><p>Thus, this study has provided a glimpse into baseline levels of TPO in AA patients and normal healthy blood donors in Indian population. Our data provide further evidence that supports the concept that measuring TPO level may play some role in classifying the severity of disease in AA and consequently its management that varies according to the severity level. Hence, we recommend measuring serum TPO level as a useful tool in diagnosing thrombocytopenia in AA and other thrombocytopenic disorders. Similarly, evaluation of serum TPO in plateletpheresis donors may help in elucidating the reasons of low platelet counts in such donors who are rendered unfit to donate platelets.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflicting Interest:</bold> None
