This study evaluated the association between RPE of walking and incident major mobility disability (MMD) as well as response to a physical activity (PA) program. Older adults (n=1633) at-risk for mobility impairment were randomized to a structured PA or health education (HE) program. During a 400m walk, participants rated exertion as &#x0201c;none&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;light&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;somewhat hard&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d;. An MMD event was defined as the inability to complete the 400m walk. Transitions between RPE states and an MMD event&#x02014;when RPE was not collected&#x02014; were assessed over the follow-up (every 6 months for an average of 2.6 years). Participants rating their exertion as &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; at baseline 400m walk had nearly 3-fold higher risk of MMD compared with those rating as &#x0201c;light&#x0201d; (HR: 2.61, 95%CI: 2.19-3.11). During follow-up, the PA group was 25% more likely to transition from &#x0201c;light&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; RPE (1.25, 1.05-1.49), but was 27% (0.73, 0.55 &#x02013; 0.97) less likely to transition from a &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; RPE to MMD than the HE group. Additionally, the PA group was more likely to transition from an MMD event to a &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; RPE (2.09, 1.38-3.17) than the HE group (i.e. recovery). Older adults rating &#x0201c;hard&#x0201d; effort during a standardized walk test were at increased risk of MMD. A structured PA program increased transition from light to hard effort, which may reflect greater capacity to perform the test and increased recovery from an MMD event.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
