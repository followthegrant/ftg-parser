It is the well-documented complication of cobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) deficiency, which is often observed in patients who are suffering from pernicious anemia, various conditions leading to malnutrition, tropical sprue, or HIV infection.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) exerts neurotoxic effects by interfering with the bioavailability of cobalamin, but N<sub>2</sub>O as an etiology of the condition is not well known and often underestimated. Herein we report a case series of two patients diagnosed with SCD caused by massive N<sub>2</sub>O inhalation.</p><p>Patient A was a 22-year-old woman who presented with progressive paresthesia in her legs and hands, and unsteady gait that had first appeared about 2 months previously. She was currently taking medication for depression. She had been diagnosed and treated for a pulmonary embolism 1 month previously. In addition, she was injected intramuscularly with single high-dose supplementation of cobalamin for incidentally found cobalamin deficiency. Further questioning revealed a habit of inhaling &#x02018;Happy Balloons&#x02019; more than 100 times for the past 2 months. A neurological examination revealed decreased tactile and vibratory sensations of the legs, dysmetria in heel-to-shin tests on both sides, a positive Romberg's sign, and bilateral weakness of both lower extremities (each with Medical Research Council grade III).</p><p>Patient B was a 33-year-old man who presented with progressive symmetrical numbness in his legs, imbalance, and difficulty walking. He had a history of a diagnosis of reflux esophagitis with seropositive for <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>H. pylori</italic>), but this was never treated. Further questioning revealed a daily habit of inhaling up to 5 L of &#x02018;laughing gas&#x02019; for the past 6 months. A neurological examination revealed weakness in both upper and lower extremities, decreased vibration and proprioception sensations, bilateral hyporeflexia, sensory ataxia, and a positive Romberg's sign.</p><p>Both patients A and B had no cognitive impairment or psychiatric problems, with the exception of patient A having suffered from depression several years previously. The initial laboratory tests revealed that both patients A and B had elevated mean corpuscular volumes and low cobalamin levels. The folate level was normal in both patients, who were negative for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus and neurosyphilis. Whole-spine MRI revealed increased T2-weighted signals in the dorsal columns with a characteristic &#x02018;inverted V sign&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and C</xref>). A nerve conduction study showed axonal motor polyneuropathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B and D</xref>), and somatosensory evoked potentials suggested a lesion in somatosensory pathways between the upper cervical cord and somatosensory cortex.</p><p>Both patients were diagnosed with SCD of the spinal cord induced by N<sub>2</sub>O consumption, and they were treated with daily intramuscular cobalamin (1 mg) injections for 2 weeks followed by oral medication. This cobalamin treatment combined with the removal of the offending agent resulted in both patients showing a gradual neurological improvement with rehabilitation.</p><p>Cobalamin is an essential cofactor for cellular reactions, with it supporting methionine synthetase and further participating in the synthesis of myelin sheath.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Low cobalamin levels may result in various neurological manifestations such as peripheral neuropathy, myelopathy with dorsal column dysfunction, and encephalopathy with cognitive decline.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There have been many reports of early diagnosis and rapid treatment being crucial to a favorable outcome.</p><p>N<sub>2</sub>O was originally used as an inhalational anesthetic agent. However, its recreational consumption is increasing due to its easy accessibility and low cost. The consumption of a large amount of N<sub>2</sub>O accelerates the irreversible oxidation of the cobalt ion of cobalamin, which results in the inactivation of the cofactor required for myelin formation.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Any patients with preexisting conditions for SCD&#x02014;anorexia nervosa and <italic>H. pylori</italic> in our two cases&#x02014;or a chronically low cobalamin level may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of N<sub>2</sub>O.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It is paramount that clinicians inquire about and perform screening for N<sub>2</sub>O abuse if there is no clear etiology of SCD, especially in young patients without predisposing conditions.</p></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflicts of Interest:</bold> The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Kinsella</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current concepts in the diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency</article-title><source>Neurology</source><year>1995</year><volume>45</volume><fpage>1435</fpage><lpage>1440</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7644036</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jordan</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiser</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Ness</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Unrecognized cobalamin deficiency, nitrous oxide, and reversible subacute combined degeneration</article-title><source>Neurol Clin Pract</source><year>2014</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>358</fpage><lpage>361</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">29473558</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Flippo</surname><given-names>TS</given-names></name><name><surname>Holder</surname><given-names>WD</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></person-group><article-title>Neurologic degeneration associated with nitrous oxide anesthesia in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency</article-title><source>Arch Surg</source><year>1993</year><volume>128</volume><fpage>1391</fpage><lpage>1395</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8250714</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schilling</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is nitrous oxide a dangerous anesthetic for vitamin B12-deficient subjects?</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>1986</year><volume>255</volume><fpage>1605</fpage><lpage>1606</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3951096</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back><floats-group><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Findings of MRI and nerve conduction studies in both patients.
