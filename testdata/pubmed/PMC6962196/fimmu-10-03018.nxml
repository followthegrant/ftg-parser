One way of developing a universal influenza vaccine with a broader spectrum of protection is to use appropriate vaccine adjuvants to improve a vaccine's effectiveness and change its immune properties. Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) with unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs (CpG ODNs), which are Toll-like-receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists, are among the most promising adjuvants and are already being used in humans. However, the development of novel delivery vehicles to improve adjuvant effects <italic>in vivo</italic> is highly desirable. Here, we assessed the potential of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as CpG ODN delivery vehicles in mice to augment the vaccine adjuvant effects of CpG ODN and enhance the protective spectrum of conventional influenza split vaccine (SV). <italic>In vitro</italic>, compared with CpG ODN, LNPs containing CpG ODNs (LNP-CpGs) induced significantly greater production of cytokines such as IL-12 p40 and IFN-&#x003b1; by mouse dendritic cells (DCs) and significantly greater expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on DCs. In addition, after subcutaneous administration in mice, compared with CpG ODN, LNP-CpGs enhanced the expression of CD80 and CD86 on plasmacytoid DCs in draining lymph nodes. LNP-CpGs given with SV from H1N1 influenza A virus improved T-cell responses and gave a stronger not only SV-specific but also heterologous-virus-strain-specific IgG2c response than CpG ODN. Furthermore, immunization with SV plus LNP-CpGs protected against not only homologous strain challenge but also heterologous and heterosubtypic strain challenge, whereas immunization with SV plus CpG ODNs protected against homologous strain challenge only. We therefore demonstrated that LNP-CpGs improved the adjuvant effects of CpG ODN and broadened the protective spectrum of SV against influenza virus. We expect that this strategy will be useful in developing adjuvant delivery vehicles and universal influenza vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adjuvant</kwd><kwd>CpG oligodeoxynucleotide</kwd><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>interferon-&#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>lipid nanoparticle</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Japan Society for the Promotion of Science<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001691</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">JP17H04009</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100009619</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">16cm0106310h0001</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">17cm0106310h0002</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">18cm0106310h0003</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="57"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="9112"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza viruses are of serious public health concern: annual epidemics caused by these viruses affect 5&#x02013;15% of the global population and induce ~3&#x02013;5 million cases of severe illness (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). One of the most critical strategies for preventing the spread of influenza viruses at the population level is vaccination. However, current influenza vaccines are generally effective against highly similar (homologous) virus strains, but their effectiveness decreases markedly against antigenically mismatched (heterologous) strains (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Because influenza viruses undergo constant genetic and antigenic changes owing to the high rate of point mutations within the influenza virus genome, mismatch between vaccine strains and seasonal circulating viruses is not fully avoided and still occurs frequently (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Clearly, we need to develop a next generation of universal influenza vaccines that give a broader spectrum of protection against seasonal influenza viruses.</p><p>Virus-specific IgG2 antibodies play a predominant protective role in the response to influenza virus infection or vaccination against influenza viruses (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In fact, the marked IgG1 to IgG2c shift in influenza-virus-specific antibodies upon vaccination by using an adjuvant augments protection against heterologous virus challenge (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), suggesting that one way of improving the effectiveness of influenza vaccines against heterologous viruses is to change the virus-specific antibody isotype from IgG1 to IgG2 by using appropriate vaccine adjuvants. Nowadays, alum (aluminum salts) is one of the vaccine adjuvants most widely used in many important vaccines in humans (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Unfortunately, however, alum cannot induce Th1-type immune responses and antigen-specific IgG2 production, although it can induce strong Th2-type immune responses and antigen-specific IgG1 production (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In contrast, oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) with unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs (CpG ODNs) are appropriate adjuvants for inducing Th1-type immune responses and antigen-specific IgG2 production (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). A CpG ODN is a short single-stranded synthetic DNA fragment containing the immunostimulatory CpG motif and binding to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) at the endosomes after uptake by dendritic cells (DCs). TLR9 primarily binds unmethylated CpG DNA motifs, which are common in bacterial and viral DNA, and it plays a central role in viral immunity as well as various autoimmune disorders (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). TLR9 activates bifurcated signals downstream of MyD88 to induce the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and type I interferon (IFN) genes in macrophages, DCs, and B cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). There are several types of CpG ODNs, each of which has a different structure, physical properties, and immunostimulatory properties (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Among them, D-type CpG ODNs (also known as A-type CpG ODNs) activate plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) to produce massive amounts of type I IFNs such as IFN-&#x003b1;, which has crucial roles in the activation and cytotoxicity of natural killer T cells, the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and the maturation of DCs (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). D-type CpG ODNs have shown potential in preclinical and clinical studies as adjuvants in vaccines for infectious diseases, cancers, and allergic asthma (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, CpG ODNs&#x02014;especially D-type CpG ODNs&#x02014;are generally prone to degradation by nucleases such as DNase <italic>in vivo</italic>, resulting in a decrease in adjuvant activity, because D-type CpG ODNs have a naturally occurring phosphodiester backbone (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). To overcome this problem and enhance the adjuvant activity of CpG ODNs by their efficient delivery to DCs, a delivery vehicle must be developed to protect the CpG ODNs from degradation by nucleases.</p><p>Several functionalized nanoparticles, including polymer- and lipid-based particles, have been employed as delivery vehicles for DNA- or RNA-based medicines. Each vehicle has merits and demerits (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are typically composed of an ionizable lipid, cholesterol, lipid conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEGylated lipid), and a helper lipid, have recently attracted much attention as novel lipid-based delivery vehicles for DNA- or RNA-based medicines (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). LNPs can be readily produced with highly efficient encapsulation of DNA- or RNA-based medicines by using a microfluidic mixer (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In addition, previous reports have shown the safety of LNPs in humans after intravenous administration (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). LNPs facilitate the delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) and mRNA to several types of cells, including immune cells, as well as the release of these oligonucleotides from phagosomes or endosomes into the cytoplasm. For example, siRNA- or mRNA-loaded LNPs have been used for gene therapy of hepatic diseases and for cell-specific delivery of mRNA (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Furthermore, LNPs are expected to be useful as delivery vehicles for vaccines. For example, LNPs containing mRNA coding for protein antigens have been used to induce antigen-specific immune responses and protect against Zika virus, influenza virus, and cytomegalovirus in mice and rhesus macaques (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In the vaccine field, LNPs are expected to be used as delivery vehicles for not only mRNA but also peptide or protein antigens and adjuvants. Thus, LNPs might have potential as CpG ODN-delivery vehicles. Our group recently reported the usefulness of LNPs containing CpG ODN as immunostimulatory drugs for cancer immunotherapy (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We showed that both intratumoral and intravenous administration of LNPs containing CpG ODN enhanced the effect of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in reducing tumor growth in mice (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, the usefulness of LNPs containing CpG ODNs as vaccine adjuvants remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we show the usefulness of LNPs as CpG ODN-delivery vehicles to improve both cytokine production by DCs and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on DCs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, LNPs containing CpG ODN and given with influenza split vaccine (SV) provoked a stronger antigen-specific IgG2 response than CpG ODN, and they gave superior cross-protection against heterologous influenza virus challenge. These data thus demonstrate the usefulness of LNPs for improving the adjuvant activity of CpG ODN and broadening the protective spectrum of SVs for influenza virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane was purchased from Lipoid GmbH (Ludwigshafen, Germany). 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and N-(carbonyl-methoxypolyethyleneglycol 2000)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine were purchased from NOF Corporation (Tokyo, Japan).

Mice were housed in a room with a 12:12-h light:dark cycle (lights on, 8:00 a.m.; lights off, 8:00 p.m.) and had unrestricted access to food and water. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with Osaka University's institutional guidelines for the ethical treatment of animals (protocol number H26-11-0).</p></sec><sec><title>Synthesis of LNP-CpGs</title><p>Two types of LNPs containing CpG ODN (LNP-CpGs) were prepared by using NanoAssemblr Benchtop (Precision NanoSystems Inc., BC, Canada), which can mediate bottom-up self-assembly for nanoparticle synthesis with microfluidic mixing technology. Briefly, 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol, and N-(carbonyl-methoxypolyethyleneglycol 2000)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine were, respectively, dissolved in ethanol at a molar ratio of 50: 19.5: 30: 0.5 or 50: 17: 30: 3. CpG ODN was prepared in 25 mM acetate buffer at pH 4.0. The lipid solution (10 mg/mL) in ethanol and CpG ODN solution were, respectively, injected into the microfluidic mixer at a volumetric ratio of 1:3 and combined at final flow rate of 15 mL/min (3.75 mL/min ethanol, 11.25 mL/ min aqueous). The mixtures were immediately dialyzed (50-kD MWCO dialysis tubing, Repligen Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) against 5% glucose solution to remove the ethanol and unloaded CpG ODN. Each prepared LNP-CpG was then concentrated to ~0.7 mg/mL CpG ODN by using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (100-kD MWCO, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and filtered through a 0.22-&#x003bc;m PVDF filter (Merck KGaA). The theoretical CpG-ODN-to-lipid ratios for all formulations were maintained at an N/P charge ratio (the ratio of the charge on the cationic lipid, assuming that it was in the positively charged protonated form, to the negative charge on the CpG ODN) of 3. All LNP preparation work was performed at room temperature. We used 5% glucose solution as a control buffer in all experiments, because 5% glucose solution was used for the LNP-CpGs.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Lipid Nanoparticles</title><p>The size distributions of the two types of LNP-CpG were measured by using dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano-ZS, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK). The CpG ODN concentration in the LNP-CpGs was measured with PicoGreen reagent (Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). Briefly, LNP-CpG was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 10 min in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and PicoGreen reagent was added. The fluorescence intensity (excitation/emission wavelength, 485/528 nm) was then measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Production and Purification of Recombinant Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) Proteins</title><p>The amino acid sequences for the HA used here were derived from Cal7 (GenBank accession number: <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="ACV82259.1">ACV82259.1</ext-link>) and PR8 (GenBank accession number: <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="LC120393.1">LC120393.1</ext-link>).

Human codon-optimized cDNA of the ectodomain of HA with a C-terminal histidine tag (His-tag) and of NA with an N-terminal His-tag was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The codon-optimized fold on trimerization domain sequence and tetrabrachion tetramerization domain sequence were inserted at the C-terminal of HA and the N-terminal of NA, respectively, as previously described (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). All secreted soluble recombinant HAs and recombinant NA were expressed by using the Expi293 Expression System (Thermo Fisher Scientific), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

Plasma samples were diluted with 0.4% Block Ace, and these dilutions were added to the antigen-coated plates. After incubation with plasma for 2 h at room temperature, the coated plates were incubated with a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, or IgG2c solution for 1 h at room temperature. After the incubation, the color reaction was developed with tetramethyl benzidine (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), stopped with 2 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and measured at OD<sub>450&#x02212;570</sub> on a microplate reader (Power Wave HT, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

LNP-CpGs were prepared by using NanoAssemblr, a microfluidic mixer system. We constructed two types of LNP-CpG with different amounts of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated lipid, 0.5 or 3 mol % [LNP(0.5%)-CpG or LNP(3%)-CpG, respectively]; we had already confirmed the physical properties of each LNP-CpG (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The size distribution spectrum of each LNP-CpG showed essentially a single peak, indicating that these particles had a narrow size range and were monodispersed.

Consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A&#x02013;C</xref>, the level of SV-specific total IgG in mice given SV plus either LNP-CpG was significantly higher than that in mice given SV plus CpG ODN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). SV plus either LNP-CpG induced significantly higher PR8-specific IgG2c levels than did SV plus CpG ODN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>), whereas the level of SV-specific IgG1 in mice immunized with SV plus either LNP-CpG did not differ from that in mice immunized with SV alone or with SV plus CpG ODN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). After the final immunization, we challenged the immunized mice with Cal7 and assessed their body weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>) and survival rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). All of the mice given SV plus LNP(3%)-CpG survived, and they regained their body weights, although weight loss occurred initially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7D,E</xref>). In contrast, mice immunized with SV plus CpG ODN or LNP(0.5%)-CpG did not show a significant improvement in survival rate compared with those given SV alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). These data indicate that LNP(3%)-CpG acted as an adjuvant to combat not only heterologous-virus but also heterosubtypic-virus challenge.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Preventive effects against heterosubtypic influenza virus.

For example, greater PEG modification and modification with PEGs with longer chains inhibit the cellular uptake of LNPs, resulting in reduced cellular uptake of the molecules being delivered and inhibition of their desired functions, although these modifications inhibit opsonization, thus enhancing the stability of LNPs in the blood (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Many authors have suggested that optimal modification of PEG with a molecular weight of 2000 is a better compromise between anti-opsonization and efficient delivery strategies (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, we used two types of LNP modified with PEG at a molecular weight of 2000 in different ratios. We showed that each LNP-CpG improved the immune-stimulatory activity of CpG ODN in mouse DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This enhanced immune-stimulatory activity might result from an increase in the number of CpG ODNs taken up by each DC, because the CpG ODN is condensed into a space in the LNP-CpG. We showed that LNP(0.5%)-CpG had stronger immune-stimulatory activity (in terms of cytokine production and CD86 expression) than LNP(3%)-CpG in mouse DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, a greater number of LNP(0.5%)-CpG than LNP(3%)-CpG might have been taken up by the DCs, because the ratio of PEG modification was less in the former than in the latter. CpG ODN is localized to the endosomes or lysosomes after cellular internalization and binds to endosomal TLR9 (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In addition, by using TLR9 deficient mice, we recently showed that cytokine production by bone marrow cells in response to LNP-CpG is completely dependent on TLR9 (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that LNP-CpG might localize in the endosomes or lysosomes, releasing CpG ODN and inducing the activation of TLR9 signaling, although further study is required to clarify the exact cellular localization of LNP-CpG.</p><p>Compared with CpG-ODN, LNP(0.5%)-CpG enhanced the expression of CD80 and CD86 <italic>in vivo</italic>, in the same way as <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In analyses of the biodistribution of particles <italic>in vivo</italic>, it has been suggested that small nanoparticles (diameter, 20&#x02013;100 nm) are preferentially trafficked toward draining lymph nodes and are taken up by DCs in the lymph nodes, whereas smaller molecules tend to diffuse into the systemic circulation, with poor trafficking toward the draining lymph nodes (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that LNP(0.5%)-CpG and LNP(3%)-CpG might deliver CpG ODN into the draining lymph nodes more efficiently than CpG ODN alone. Furthermore, LNP(0.5%)-CpG enhanced the expression of CD80 and CD86 on pDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). pDCs are a unique subset of DCs that can produce IFN-&#x003b1; and promote antiviral immune responses (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Recent studies have shown that pDCs express MHC class II molecules and co-stimulatory molecules and have the potential for antigen presentation to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). For example, Loschko et al. (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) showed that antigen delivery to pDCs by monoclonal antibody against bone marrow stromal antigen 2 with an adjuvant induced antigen presentation by the pDCs to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, with increased expression of CD86 on the pDCs, resulting in the robust induction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses and antigen-specific antibody responses. Therefore, antigen presentation by pDCs might be indispensable in LNP-CpG-induced immune responses.</p><p>We found that the SV plus LNP-CpG&#x02014;but not SV plus CpG ODN or SV plus alum&#x02014;protected mice against not only a homologous strain (Cal7) but also an antigenically mismatched (heterologous) strain (PR8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, the antibodies induced by SV plus LNP-CpG did not have neutralizing activity against the heterologous strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that the protection against heterologous PR8 challenge was not due to the production of neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, SV plus LNP(3%)-CpG protected mice vaccinated with SV from Tex50 against a heterosubtypic strain (Cal7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), although it is important to examine why SV plus LNP(0.5%)-CpG did not show protective effects. It has been believed that neutralizing antibodies, which inhibit viral infection by hindering receptor binding on cells, are essential for protection against homologous influenza virus, but that these antibodies cannot protect against heterologous or heterosubtypic strains (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Conversely, recent studies have shown that non-neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses contribute to cross-protection against both heterologous and heterosubtypic strains (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The cross-protection provided by non-neutralizing antibodies depends on the effector function of the Fc region via Fc&#x003b3; receptor (Fc&#x003b3;R) interaction, for example by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, mouse IgG2 has generally stronger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity than IgG1, and it provides cross-protection more efficiently than does IgG1 because of its ability to interact with all activating Fc&#x003b3;Rs, such as Fc&#x003b3;RI, Fc&#x003b3;RIII, and Fc&#x003b3;RIV (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In fact, Van den Hoecke et al. (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) have shown that anti-influenza virus monoclonal IgG2 antibody has superior protective efficacy to monoclonal IgG1. Therefore, efficient induction of non-neutralizing IgG2 against influenza virus is a useful approach to the development of a universal influenza vaccine with cross-protection. We showed here that LNP-CpG improved the capacity of CpG ODN to induce antigen-specific IgG2 production; SV plus LNP-CpG induced PR8-specific IgG2 predominantly, whereas SV plus alum induced PR8-specific IgG1 predominantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, SV plus alum did not protect against heterologous influenza virus challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), although the level of PR8-specific total IgG in mice immunized with SV plus alum was significantly greater than that in mice given LNP-CpG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that non-neutralizing IgG2, not IgG1, induced by LNP-CpG against heterologous and heterosubtypic strains contributes to cross-protection. In contrast, after influenza infection, not only antibodies but also CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells play crucial roles in cross-protection (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). However, Yamamoto et al. (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) showed that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells do not contribute to cross-protection in the immunization of mice with SV modified with CpG ODN, although SV modified with CpG ODN induces a strong cross-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response. The contribution of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to cross-protection in the administration of LNP-CpG-adjuvanted vaccines needs to be explored.</p><p>In summary, we showed here that LNPs as CpG ODN delivery vehicles improved the immune-stimulatory activity of CpG ODN and that LNP-CpGs could broaden the protective spectrum of SV against influenza virus. We believe that LNP-CpGs can improve some influenza vaccines for pandemic influenza, as well as influenza vaccines for the elderly. We also believe that LNP-CpGs have the potential to open up new avenues for producing universal influenza vaccines with cross-protection and will help to develop novel adjuvant-delivery vehicles that could improve vaccine effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by Osaka University's institutional guidelines for the ethical treatment of animals (protocol number H26-11-0).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SS and YY designed the experiments, interpreted the results, and wrote the manuscript.
