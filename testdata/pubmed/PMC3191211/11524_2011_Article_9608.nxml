<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> The paper focuses on governance to address the social and environmental determinants of urban health inequities. It outlines the key components of governance and the plausible pathways to urban health inequity. The paper finishes with a discussion on knowledge gaps and suggests a research agenda to address the gaps in the evidence base concerning governance and urban health inequity in cities in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Concepts and Definitions of Governance</title><p>Governance is defined as: &#x0201c;the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented (or not implemented).&#x0201d; Governance is understood as a dynamic process and structure that is changing over time and is embedded within context (Box 1).

The ambiguities, dilemmas, and concerns surrounding the concept can be explained by the fact that many developmental agencies have employed the concept for various purposes, in different contexts and to advance their own agendas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref> Thus, understanding urban governance from a perspective of power and power relations requires knowledge of the historical, social, and economic processes that have characterized social relations and citizenship in specific local, national, regional, and global contexts (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>

This trend was exacerbated in South Africa by the underdevelopment of rural livelihoods under apartheid in combination with newly established freedom of movement of rural communities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref> The result has been an increase in inequity, where wealthy middle class suburbs back onto poor overcrowded, informal settlements with few basic facilities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>

While there are some encouraging examples, there remain inherent tensions within the concept of partnership that limit their effectiveness. These include power differentials among partners - such as those among government, NGOs and community partners - which determine the nature and extent of interventions; bureaucratic systems and divisions within and between organizations which hinder collaboration; external pressures, including national, donor or commercial priorities which can dominate agendas and mistrust between partners based on any of the above.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Critical Issues</title><p>Although many authors describe governance arrangements, the concept is not always referred to or explained. Our review of the literature confirmed significant variation in meaning as well as in the practice of urban governance arrangements. Governance processes are embedded within context (Box 1), but common characteristics exist across these contexts. First, <italic>scale</italic> is a particularly important variable since there are some metropolitan regions that develop across country boundaries; and so is <italic>level</italic>, since supra-local factors and decisions taken by distant and powerful actors can have a profound impact on health inequity within as well as between cities. Decentralization in practice often implied de-concentration, while the rules of the game are still defined at a central level or influenced by global actors. If participation is limited in scope, scale, space, and sphere of influence&#x02014;and the arena of action does not go beyond a specific neighborhood or single intervention&#x02014;it might be considered &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; but does not constitute participatory governance for health equity.</p><p>Second, governance is a dynamic process, and it is important to acknowledge the fact that governance has been changing significantly over the past two decades. Scholars worldwide, and particularly in the UK and the USA, have started to examine the driving forces and the implications of this shift from government into <italic>governance</italic> (greater state democratization), one in which government has now become just one of the actors in the policy and decision-making processes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref> While the Healthy Cities approach in general takes a &#x0201c;governance&#x0201d; rather than a &#x0201c;government-only&#x0201d; approach, it is striking that few evaluations of Healthy Cities have analyzed the implications of this important shift in governance for the conduct of policy, healthy urban planning, and health equity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>

</p><p>Third, the city is a contested place. Land tenure, shelter, and economic development are critical issues and this explains the interest in urban regeneration processes, spatial justice, and governance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref> Formal and informal governance arrangements can exist within the space of the city. Actors are changing and new actors are appearing, with increasing roles for civil society and the influences of powerful corporate actors including transnational corporations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref> Rationalities, structures, power, interests, resources, as well as agendas may differ between actors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref> What becomes clear is that the different forms of governance, and the way they are exercised, are closely linked to (multi-level) political processes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref> with major implications for the health of people residing in different locations.<table-wrap id="Tabb"><label>Box&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Water and sanitation: an analytical lens to examine governance and health equity</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Unequal access to water and sanitation has historically been a leading cause of urban health inequalities. Still today, household piped water and sewerage connections are the privilege of a minority in the urban centres of most low and many middle-income cities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref> For water, many residents make do with polluted groundwater, distant standpipes, or expensive water sold by local vendors at prices far higher than the official water tariff. For sanitation, open defecation remains common, particularly for children. An important aspect of the link between urban governance and water and sanitation provision lies in the collective nature of the challenge. In economic terms, water and sanitation improvement are quasi-public goods and create the sort of collective action problems conventionally used to justify government action. Indeed, the public health benefits of water and sanitation utilities were used to help justify the creation of public utilities. These utilities performed disappointingly over the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, especially in low-income settings. Governments that are responsive to the needs and health rights of their less well off citizens can overcome many of the barriers to improving their urban water and sanitation. A prerequisite for any government-implemented programme is a viable financial strategy. The same applies when the government is partnering with private suppliers to provide water and sanitation services. This is not just a question of competence, but very much of governance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref> Getting the financial and institutional aspect right requires constructive and efficient negotiations between government and civil society groups. Private-public partnerships add another governance dimension to this, as they also require negotiation across the public-private divide. In this case, community organization is likely to be critical, thereby involving another dimension of urban governance.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

All three of them are related, and they are a central concern of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, which provides the value base for the Healthy Cities Movement.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participation</title><p>Participation, according to Stiglitz,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref> is considered critical to the social transformation necessary for development. Participation can contribute to building ownership and commitment, to shaping avenues for involvement in decision-making processes, and to supporting sustainability of development processes, outcomes, and decisions. Often participation takes place in name only, while in reality professionals, public officials, and bureaucracies manipulate the concept.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref> In countries characterized by deeply rooted political, social, and economic disparities such as Peru, no straightforward relationship exists between civil society and participation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref> The situation of Peru emphasizes the need to take into account the socio-political and historical context and to pay attention to factors such as gender, class, and ethnicity in analyzing the <italic>meaning</italic> of citizenship and participation. Interpretation of a range of research in Brazil and England shows that, &#x0201c;there is a tension between different principles underpinning collective public involvement in health both within and between countries.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref> Participation is integral to social justice in both countries, and while public participation appears to be more inclusive in Brazil than in England, there is still limited evidence that social justice claims have been achieved. Analysis of the participatory dimension of urban governance in Mumbai concluded that it induced double standards of citizenship&#x02014;new governance arrangements have contributed to empowerment of the middle- and upper-middle class, who have expanded their claims on the city and the political space, while the urban poor have not benefited.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
</p><p>Many innovative experiences exist that have improved participatory governance. In Brazil, for example, there is a movement called &#x0201c;Nossa S&#x000e3;o Paulo&#x0201d; bringing NGOs, community leaders, private companies and media together to organize an innovative governance framework. It can be difficult, however, to distinguish truly influential and effective governance innovations from superficial changes that have little effect on underlying power relations and merely present a more participatory gloss. Considerations of health equity could provide a means of making such distinctions. Pursuit of urban health equity requires a form of joined-up governance that brings together the health sector and actors in other sectors of municipal, regional, and national governments, that engages with the private for-profit and private non-profit groups; and, vitally, that engages and empowers the citizenry, especially the most disadvantaged and least powerful people and communities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Partnerships and Intersectoral Action</title><p>Effective partnerships require political and bureaucratic leadership at the highest levels as well as appropriate structures and processes. Critical differences between developed countries and low- and middle income countries (LMICs), e.g., in terms of relative wealth, decision-making autonomy, legal and regulatory framework, and economic complexity, should be acknowledged in order to overcome the real challenges and make partnerships work. Recent research has also begun examining the mismatch between the political rhetoric and the empirical capacity of partnerships.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref> This UK study concluded that although the notion of partnerships creates a vision of public policy in which everyone seems to benefit by emphasizing efficiency, devolution, and participation, the reality is different: partnerships failed to be inclusive of representative interests; they have reinforced the influence of the central government and facilitated the participation of the private sector in the delivery of public services. The differential capacity of actors to exert power in urban renewal and decision-making has been studied in the context of Santiago, Chile.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref> In this situation, it was found that representatives from the central government and private investors controlled local redevelopment, while the local government and the people living near the urban renewal project ended up in non-influential positions.</p><p>Governance through the formation of public&#x02013;private partnerships or networks can be effective and has potential to enhance democratic participation in urban policy, but it may also create conflicts and deadlocks and make public governance less transparent and accountable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref> A study in Accra, Ghana of waste collection performance from 1985&#x02013;2000 under two different institutional regimes&#x02014;from a situation of complete public sector dependence toward increased private sector involvement&#x02014;found that the public&#x02013;private mix was more effective for solid waste. The collection rate and disposal improved from 51% in 1998 to 91% in 2000. Unfortunately, these positive results were not sustained once the public&#x02013;private partnership that lasted for 10&#x000a0;years came to an end.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref> The emerging Latin American and Brazilian Networks for Just and Sustainable Cities are promising as they put a strong focus on the equitable distribution of resources and sustainability. Little research has been conducted on the health equity impacts of these changes in governance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Community Empowerment for Health Equity</title><p>Different urban communities necessarily require different models of governance to respond to their varying needs. As described above, participation and partnership are essential elements of any model of governance for health equity. Beyond these, health equity depends on the growth of civil society organizations, networks, and movements, and their progressive ability to challenge inequity and push for the installation of equity in the center of all existing and emerging political debates. In Indonesia, community-based approaches have been developed as a response to top&#x02013;down and authoritarian approaches in order &#x0201c;to increase the community&#x02019;s control over the development process.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref> Empirical research in Mumbai, India draws attention to the role of civil society organizations in the contested control of urban space and in a context of removal of the urban poor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref> An examination of the extent of political participation of the urban poor in Dhaka, Bangladesh in order to ensure access to services demonstrated that collective mobilization of the urban poor in the city of Dhaka has been effective in ensuring the participation of the poor in municipal governance. However, the impact of these initiatives may be limited in terms of securing the national political commitment to urban poverty reduction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref> While evaluation of the health equity impact of community action is often limited, there is some evidence for improvements in the conditions of daily living and behavioral risk factors, as seen in the Network of Healthy Communities in Rio de Janeiro (Box 3).<table-wrap id="Tabc"><label>Box&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>The Network of Healthy Communities of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Launched in 2004, the Rio de Janeiro based Network of Healthy Communities is composed of a mix of community-based organizations (CBOs) and the Centre for Health Promotion (CEDAPS) - an organization working on empowerment and health equity.

Many experiences have not yet been identified in the academic literature, especially from cities in LMICs. Most existing evaluations of governance arrangements are incomplete. Critical issues, such as the advent of new powerful actors in the contested space of the city, the power asymmetries as well as the increasing influence of global processes, and external actors on local policy and decision-making are so far neglected.</p><p>We need research to understand the interface between international stakeholders and national and local governance and the effect on urban health inequity.

Corburn<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref> argues that there is a need for new political frames to move toward healthy city planning that includes considerations of population health, a relational perspective of place, an understanding of planning as governance, and relations of power.
