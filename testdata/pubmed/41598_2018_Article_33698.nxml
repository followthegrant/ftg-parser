CMIP5 model projections of air temperature (Ta) at QIC indicate a warming of about 2.4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 5.4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (respectively) for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, resulting in a pronounced increase in freezing level height (FLH). The impact of this warming on the QIC was quantified using equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) projections. The change in the ELA was quantified based on an empirical ELA&#x02013;FLH relationship, and calibrated with observations of the highest annual snowline altitude (SLA) derived from LANDSAT data. Results show that from the mid-2050s onwards, the ELA will be located above the QIC summit in the RCP8.5 scenario. At that time, surface mass balance at QIC and most tropical glaciers at similar elevations will become increasingly negative, leading to their eventual complete disappearance. Our analysis further corroborates that elevation-dependent warming (EDW) contributes significantly to the enhanced warming over the QIC, and that EDW at Quelccaya depends on the rate of anthropogenic forcing.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs of the United States Department of State (S- LMAQM-11-GR-086)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>NSF-P2C2 (AGS-1303828), NSF Paleoclimate (9909201 and 0402557), NSF-PIRE (OISE-1743738)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Labex OSUG@2020 (Investissements d&#x00026;amp;#x2019;avenir &#x00026;amp;#x2013; ANR10 LABX56)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A more thorough understanding of future glacier changes in the tropical Andes is critical, given their prominent role in dry season water supply, ecosystem services, and impacts on tourism, natural hazards and cultural values and belief systems of local populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Quelccaya ice cap (QIC) is located in the Cordillera Vilcanota of southern Peru (13&#x000b0;56&#x02019;S, 70&#x000b0;50&#x02032;W, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). With a median area of about 50.2 km<sup>2</sup> over the 1975&#x02013;2010 period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, QIC is the largest tropical ice cap. The average elevation of the ice margin is ~5300&#x02009;m above sea level (m a.s.l.) and the approximate summit elevation is 5680&#x02009;m a.s.l.; therefore, QIC is representative of many tropical glaciers in the Andes with a relatively low summit elevation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In comparison, the lowermost elevations reached by the largest glaciers in the tropical Andes is typically close to 4850&#x02013;4900&#x02009;m a.s.l., whereas their upper reaches are frequently above 6000&#x02009;m a.s.l.

The El Ni&#x000f1;o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and cold air incursions from the extratropics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> also affect QIC conditions on an interannual time scale. However, no continuous surface mass balance and ice dynamics measurements exist on QIC; hence the relationship between the reduction in surface area and loss of glacier mass is not known.</p><p id="Par4">Although precipitation is an important variable affecting glacier surface mass balance, observational studies document that no significant changes in precipitation occurred in this region during the past five decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

The increasing temperature is a combined effect of natural multi-decadal variability (i.e. the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and anthropogenic radiative forcing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Due to this warming, QIC is retreating at an accelerated pace, with a shrinking of the QIC area at a rate of 0.57&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.10 km<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> over the 1980&#x02013;2010 period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This retreat is consistent with the reduction in glacierized surface area observed throughout the tropical Andes, including in the Cordillera Blanca and the Cordillera Ampato<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, located to the north and south of the Cordillera Vilcanota and QIC, respectively.</p><p id="Par5">Model projections of twenty-first century climate change indicate a substantial future temperature increase across the central Andes, ranging between +3 and +5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C depending on region, model and emission scenario<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. It is important to note that the rate of warming tends to be further amplified with elevation in many mountain regions due to elevation-dependent feedbacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Given that coarse global models do not adequately resolve the Andean topography, this effect is likely underestimated in surface temperature estimates from global models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, but likely less so when considering the free tropospheric temperature trends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This elevation-dependent warming (EDW) has been documented over the tropical Andes, both in modern observations and future model scenarios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">A fairly simple diagnostic that can be calculated from reanalysis and model data, and is more relevant for glacier mass balance than surface temperature, is the freezing level height (FLH). Increasing FLH in the Central Andes negatively affects the surface mass balance of glaciers, by changing the rain/snow ratio and increasingly exposing lower reaches of glaciers to rain as opposed to snow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Hence a rise in the FLH does not only directly affect the glacier surface mass balance through higher temperatures, leading to more melt, but also impacts accumulation and glacier surface albedo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The FLH increased by approximately 160&#x02009;m over the last five and a half decades over the Cordillera Blanca and Cordillera Real<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, located to the north and south of QIC, respectively. The mean annual FLH in the Cordillera Vilcanota was 5010&#x02009;m a.s.l. over the 1980&#x02013;2015 period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, with a higher FLH during the warmer wet season and a lower FLH during the slightly colder dry season<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, respectively. Historically the increase in the FLH in the tropics can be empirically described as a linear response to the increase in tropical sea surface temperature (SST)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, the FLH over this region is dependent on the phase of ENSO and responds to both interannual and decadal-scale changes in tropical Pacific SST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">While both anthropogenic and natural forcings may affect glacier surface mass balance variability on QIC on an interannual timescale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the accelerated rate of retreat observed over the last decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> is consistent with the gradual disappearance of lower-lying Andean glaciers as is being observed for example in Bolivia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, Colombia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and Venezuela<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

In contrast to variables related to the hydrologic cycle (e.g., precipitation), free-air temperature is quite accurately simulated by GCM&#x02019;s, and very well represented by reanalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Surface temperature is also well reproduced by most GCM&#x02019;s, although there is a substantial warm bias over the Andes due to the low topography in the models. Here we rely on <italic>in-situ</italic> air temperature data recorded by an automated weather station (AWS) at the summit of QIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> to remove the temperature bias from both reanalysis and GCM output, allowing for an accurate future projection of changes in FLH. We further take advantage of the documented close empirical relationship between FLH and the glacier equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) on tropical Andean glaciers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> to project the future rise of the ELA on QIC under various emission scenarios. Although no spatially-comprehensive ELA measurements exist on QIC, the ELA can be constrained by determining the snowline during the dry season using satellite data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Hence the aim of this study is to determine how imminent a future disappearance of the QIC really is, and to what extent the timing depends on the emission scenario. We also consider the influence of EDW on the rate of the ELA rise, by comparing CMIP5 simulations with an empirical model that relates tropical SST to FLH assuming a constant lapse rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Data and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Observational data</title><p id="Par9">Daily mean non-aspirated temperature and snow height data between 21-07-2004 and 22-07-2017 from an AWS installed at QIC summit (5680&#x02009;m a.s.l., 13.93&#x000b0;S, 70.82&#x02009;W) were used to bias-correct air temperature from reanalysis and CMIP5 models, and to inform LANDSAT image selection (see below). As reference, the mean annual air temperature (Ta) at QIC from this dataset is &#x02212;3.99&#x02009;&#x000b0;C over the 2005&#x02013;2016 period. Additionally, daily rainfall data, available over the period 1979&#x02013;2016 from Ccatcca station (3693&#x02009;m a.s.l., 13.61&#x000b0;S, 71.5603&#x000b0;W, closest station to QIC, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), maintained by the Peruvian National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (<italic>Servicio Nacional de Meteorolog&#x000ed;a e Hidrolog&#x000ed;a del Per&#x000fa;</italic>, SENAMHI), were used for the LANDSAT image-selection process. Finally, monthly mean SST data from the NOAA Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature v5 (ERSST) dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> were extracted over the tropical belt (28.5&#x000b0;S&#x02013;28.5&#x000b0;N) from 1950 to 2017. Anomalies were calculated using 1979&#x02013;2005 as the reference period, and then spatially averaged to obtain a tropical SST anomaly (SSTA) time series.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ta and FLH calculation from reanalysis products</title><p id="Par10">Several studies have shown that mid- and upper-tropospheric temperatures are fairly accurately reproduced by GCM&#x02019;s and reanalysis products over the central Andes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In the present study, we relied on monthly ERA-interim reanalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, covering the 1979&#x02013;2017 period, since this dataset has higher skill in reproducing observed temperature variability over the central Andes region compared with other reanalyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Monthly Ta at the elevation of QIC summit was calculated by interpolating Ta and geopotential height (Zg) between 400 and 500 hPa pressure levels, which are the nearest standard pressure levels above QIC summit. The ERA-interim products were resampled to a 2.5&#x000b0; grid resolution, mimicking the spatial scale of the majority of CMIP5 models. A bias correction was applied to the reanalysis Ta using as reference the observed data from the AWS at QIC summit. Similarly, the FLH at QIC was calculated as the elevation of the 0&#x02009;&#x000b0;C isotherm using a linear interpolation of ERA-interim Zg and (bias-corrected) Ta between 500 and 600 hPa. The same approach was applied to Ta and FLH from CMIP5 simulations to remove temperature biases from the simulations and to calculate historical and future FLH as simulated by the models.</p><p id="Par11">The FLH in the tropics can be estimated using an empirical linear relationship with tropical SST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Here, we followed this approach by comparing the QIC FLH derived from ERA-interim with ERSST data over the tropics for the period 1979&#x02013;2017. This linear SST-FLH relationship was then applied to tropical SST simulated with CMIP5 models from both historic runs and future projections. Comparing the FLH at the elevation of QIC as simulated by the CMIP5 models (henceforth labeled FLH<sub>atm</sub>) with the FLH estimated from a linear empirical dependency with SST (henceforth labeled FLH<sub>SST</sub>) yields an estimate of future EDW, since the lapse rate is allowed to adjust to EDW feedbacks in the coupled CMIP5 simulations used to determine FLH<sub>atm</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, but held fixed at observed present-day values in the latter empirical approach of calculating FLH<sub>SST</sub>.

This method is based on the fact that on glaciers in the outer tropics the highest snowline altitude (SLA) reached during the dry season is representative of the annual ELA of the same hydrological year. Here, the annual SLA was determined using data from LANDSAT-5, -7 and/or -8 with 30&#x02009;m spatial resolution between 1992 and 2017, selecting one image (or date) per year (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The selection criteria for the LANDSAT data consist of choosing the date with the highest SLA, avoiding dates with recent snowfall and rainfall events. As indicated in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> the chosen LANDSAT images date to the dry season and early transition season, i.e. from June to October.

Measurement errors can also be produced by debris located on the lower slopes of the ice cap. Moreover, the western side of the QIC has a higher sensitivity (and hence a lower uncertainty) in SLA detection than the eastern side, since the western slope extends over flatter terrain covering a larger surface area per unit elevation change. In general, however, these errors introduced by complex topography, insolation or debris-covered ice are reduced when the SLA is measured at the end of the dry season, as the SLA reaches its highest position. At that time of year the terrain is more symmetric and uniformly sloped on western and eastern QIC sides, as observed from vertical profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and surface area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> measurements.

The resulting mean SLA per year (or date selected) is plotted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. The SLA error is associated with a) the standard deviation of the estimated mean SLA per year. It ranges between 64.2&#x02009;m and 102.6&#x02009;m.

For example, LANDSAT 7 provides an image every 16 days. When LANDSAT 8 went into service with an offset orbit, 8-day repeat coverage became available. However, sometimes cloud cover obscures the glacier and hence the SLA cannot be mapped from every available image. The combined effect of these two issues is that our remotely-sensed, highest-annual SLA determination will always be lower than or equal to the actual annual SLA. Our observations in recent years, when AWS measurements and additional imagery are also available (e.g., ESA&#x02019;s Sentinel-2) provide some assurance that this error is not large, as the SLA reflects seasonal snowfall as well as dry-season weather.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Derivation of the ELA-FLH relationship</title><p id="Par16">The SLA determined in the previous step can be considered a reasonable proxy for the ELA in each year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

Future projections of ELA<sub>atm</sub> ensembles, based on 16 CMIP5 RCP4.5 (blue dots) and RCP8.5 (red dots) simulations, however, are not following the expected ELA increase inferred from the ELA<sub>SST</sub> model. For instance, in the RCP4.5 scenario, the increase in the ELA<sub>SST</sub> ensemble is about 22.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.74&#x02009;m/decade; less (albeit not significantly) than the ensemble ELA<sub>atm</sub> increase of 24.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.94&#x02009;m/decade. In the case of the scenario RCP8.5, this difference in ELA trends is significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), with 52.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.04&#x02009;m/decade and 58.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.45&#x02009;m/decade for ELA<sub>SST</sub> and ELA<sub>atm</sub>, respectively. This implies that CMIP5 simulations with RCP4.5 radiative forcing at the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century generate an insignificant additional rise of the ensemble mean ELA at QIC of about 1.72&#x02009;m/decade when compared to the tropical SST forcing, while the RCP8.5 radiative forcing generates an additional, statistically significant ELA rise of about 5.5&#x02009;m/decade. This additional ELA rise can be understood as an EDW response, resulting from feedbacks that effectively lead to a flattening of the tropical lapse rate. Thus, for a more intense anthropogenic radiative forcing scenario, the EDW effect will increase. This analysis verifies and quantifies the projected EDW effect over the QIC environment in response to future changes in radiative forcing.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>ELA<sub>atm</sub> vs ELA<sub>SST</sub> comparison.

We did not consider the influence of potential future changes in ENSO behavior on QIC climate, which would be relevant for understanding future changes in interannual variability and will be included in future work, but present-day ENSO variability over the period for which the model was built is implicitly included.</p><p id="Par30">Here we relied on air temperature (and FLH) from global products (reanalysis and CMIP5) since a comparison with <italic>in-situ</italic> data from our AWS showed that these products very faithfully reproduce temperature conditions on QIC once a bias&#x02013;correction is applied, consistent with earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Hence while the application of free-tropospheric air temperature in our model did not require a more sophisticated statistical downscaling method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, a comparative study between our results and other downscaling products (e.g., CORDEX) would be a worthwhile follow-up study.</p><p id="Par31">One important outcome of this study is that the ELA will strongly be affected by feedback mechanisms that accelerate the warming at high elevations, most noticeable in the RCP8.5 scenario. QIC is likely to completely loose its accumulation zone before the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The critical time when the ensemble RCP8.5 simulated ELA will reach the QIC summit is around 2055, concomitant with RCP8.5 annual average Ta at QIC summit rising to approximately &#x02212;1.8&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. From that point forward, the ELA will remain above the ice cap&#x02019;s highest elevation, leaving the entire ice cap exposed to a continuously negative surface mass balance. However, other factors, not considered here, can change this timing, such as changes in the amount or seasonality of precipitation. Since changes in precipitation are a more complex issue to assess, it will be dealt with in a separate analysis. As far as precipitation phase is concerned, Ta&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;1&#x02009;&#x000b0;C is the critical threshold where precipitation starts to change phase in the tropical Andes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, leading to a decrease in snowfall and increase in mixed precipitation. Based on our results, this threshold will be reached around 2070 for a few models in the RCP4.5 scenario and the ensemble mean Ta for the RCP8.5 scenario.</p><p id="Par32">Here we have focused on the influence of tropical SST on FLH over QIC, since tropical SST provide the dominant first-order control on FLH and snowline altitude throughout tropical mountain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Indeed tropical SSTA explain more than 70% of the total variance in the FLH over QIC on interannual timescales. While other factors such as land surface feedbacks, tropical convection over the Amazon basin and interactions with extratropical air masses can also influence the FLH over Quelccaya on interannual timescales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, their influence is rather limited and they are by no means independent from tropical SST.</p><p id="Par33">Although the ELA is closely correlated with the FLH<sub>atm</sub> and previous studies have documented that this relationship holds throughout the tropical Andes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, this prediction of the ELA could potentially be further improved by applying a multivariate model including other atmospheric variables, such as precipitation and wind field. We have, however, opted not to consider such variables, given the large uncertainties in future projections of precipitation over the Andes. In our view the added values from inclusion of these variables is offset by much larger uncertainties in the future projections. That said, the presented uncertainty ranges in the timing of ELA reaching the summit should themselves be considered conservative estimates.</p><p id="Par34">More research is needed to further clarify the nature of the feedbacks that lead to the anticipated elevation-dependent warming on QIC. In addition, it is critical to better quantify elevation feedbacks, edge effects, and the impacts of changing precipitation phase with higher FLH on QIC&#x02019;s surface mass balance. As these aspects will promote an even faster demise of the ice cap, our projections are likely conservative estimates.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note:</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was produced under the framework of the Andean Climate Change Interamerican Observatory Network (ACCION, grant S- LMAQM-11-GR-086 to M.
