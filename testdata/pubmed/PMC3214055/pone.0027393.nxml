It is well documented that certain regions of the adult human central nervous system contains undifferentiated, progenitor cells or multipotent precursors. The primary objective of this study was to describe the distribution and progenitor features of this cell population in humans, and to confirm their ability to differentiate within the neuroectodermal lineage.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We demonstrate that neural stem/progenitor cells are present in FT obtained from patients treated for tethered cord. When human or rat FT-derived cells were cultured in defined medium, they proliferated and formed neurospheres in 13 out of 21 individuals. Cells expressing Sox2 and Musashi-1 were found to outline the central canal, and also to be distributed in islets throughout the whole FT. Following plating, the cells developed antigen profiles characteristic of astrocytes (GFAP) and neurons (&#x003b2;-III-tubulin). Addition of PDGF-BB directed the cells towards a neuronal fate. Moreover, the cells obtained from young donors shows higher capacity for proliferation and are easier to expand than cells derived from older donors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>The identification of <italic>bona fide</italic> neural progenitor cells in FT suggests a possible role for progenitor cells in this extension of conus medullaris and may provide an additional source of such cells for possible therapeutic purposes.</p><p>Filum terminale, human, progenitor cells, neuron, astrocytes, spinal cord.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Filum terminale (FT) is a structure that during development and is attached to the first segment of the coccyx. Under normal conditions the FT is thin and does not prevent free movements of the spinal cord. In few individuals this connection is maintained which then effects growth and posture, induces pain and leads to neurological symptoms of the condition teathered cord. The normal human FT is mainly a fibrous band, composed of two segments, one intradural and one extradural. FT contains an extension of the central canal which is lined with ciliated ependymal cells <xref rid="pone.0027393-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Fontes1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Kunitomo1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Pinto1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Rethelyi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Hansasuta1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Standring1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Throughout the FT this canal can disappear and reappear in distal portions. To avoid neurological deficit, FT is divided during surgery in patients that suffer from tethered cord <xref rid="pone.0027393-Pinto1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Iskandar1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This surgery can be undertaken with a small resection of FT without development of neurological deficits. With ethical permission we utilized these surgical procedures to harvest tissue from FT.</p><p>Early reports suggested that FT could contain neural tissue <xref rid="pone.0027393-Harmeier1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Tarlov1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Choi et al. demonstrated that FT contains an abundance of glial cells, ependymal cells and what has been described as degenerated neuronal elements <xref rid="pone.0027393-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. It was recently shown that cells from FT contain progenitor&#x02013;like cells, which could form neurospheres. These neurosphere-derived cells could differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes <xref rid="pone.0027393-Varghese1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Since the original published article on <italic>in vitro</italic> isolation of neural stem cells in the adult central nervous system (CNS), several groups have shown that stem/progenitor cells cultured from the ventricular wall of adult humans may differentiate into neurons <xref rid="pone.0027393-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These cells can develop mature biological and electrophysiological features, including synaptic communication <xref rid="pone.0027393-Moe1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Westerlund1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These findings opened the possibility to replace lost neurons or glia by transplantation of cultured neural progenitor cells harvested and multiplied from the ventricular wall.</p><p>In this study we investigate the occurrence and distribution of neural stem/progenitor cells in FT. We explored the expression of stem cell markers; reveal the distribution of progenitor cells and their capacity for expansion and response to growth factor stimulation. We applied protocols previously used for characterization of progenitors <xref rid="pone.0027393-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> already known to be present in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation <xref rid="pone.0027393-Cameron1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Curtis1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Eriksson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Lois1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Weiss1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

FT derived neurospheres were frequently detected from young patients and had an excellent growth capacity and could be passaged for up to 15&#x02013;30 passages (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6). Moreover, these progenitor cells shows higher capacity for proliferation and is easier to expand than cells derived from older donors.

To test if FT derived neurospheres have self-renewal capacity, we isolated single cells from the neurospheres and cultured them at a density of 60 cells per ml. Single isolated cells gave rise to secondary neurospheres, demonstrating that some cells possess self-renewal capacity. A clonal expansion study showed that 60 primary culture cells was the minimal number needed to form one neurosphere which indicate a relatively strong self-renewal capacity.

Reptiles lack a true FT, whereas in birds, the equivalent region of FT contains neurons <xref rid="pone.0027393-Afonso1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In contrast, such is not the case for mouse in which no neural markers are present in this region <xref rid="pone.0027393-Shum1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The present morphological study of the human FT was carried out since this region has been shown to contain cells with stem cell properties <xref rid="pone.0027393-Varghese1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Here we focused on the location, distribution and organization of the progenitor cells within the FT. We found that Sox2 positive cells were abundant in the ependymal layer and the subependymal area adjacent to the central canal as well as in the form of islets of Musashi positive cells. The Musashi family belongs to a conserved group of neuronal RNA-binding proteins <xref rid="pone.0027393-Okano1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Sox2 is a transcription factor which is critical in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal. Sox2 and Musashi have been shown to be selectively expressed in the neuronal progenitor cells <xref rid="pone.0027393-Okano1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Kaneko1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Komitova1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-BarnabeHeider1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Co-localization of Musashi and Sox2 was seen in a majority of cells in the FT. The general morphology of the human FT has previously been described <xref rid="pone.0027393-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and our findings are in line with the previous findings, showing the presence of fibrous tissue, astrocytes and ependymal cells. We were, however, surprised by finding so many cells expressing pluripotency markers and that they were present throughout the length of FT.</p><p>The establishment of viable cultures was not always achieved, this could, in part be explained by the operating technique which often involves electro-coagulation, and thereby may devitalize the cells. The yield of cells was highly variable between individuals which could be explained by the variation in anatomy between individuals together with the use of electro-coagulation during the surgical procedure. These patients are operated for tethered cord syndrome which is a pathological state. The tissue decribed here is thereby not entirely normal, although tumors are excluded. For ethical reasons healthy filum is not accessible. This rare procedure is performed only 10&#x02013;15 times per year and some material was discarded due to the finding of a tumor, such as lipoma or ependymoma which may arise in this region<xref rid="pone.0027393-Sonneland1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-AlOmari1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Our findings are interesting from two clinical perspectives; as source of progenitor cells and from the perspective of tumor formation, which was not addressed in this study. We confirmed here that FT contains neural stem/progenitor cells. Since all humans possess this structure, these cells can potentially be used for auto-transplantation purposes. Identification of neural stem cells in humans has opened possibilities for transplantation strategies to treat neurodegenerative diseases; including supporting compromised neurons in a damaged spinal cord. Neural stem cells are almost impossible to remove without causing permanent damage to the CNS. An alternative structure in the CNS, such as the FT, would give new possibilities to isolate neural stem/progenitor cells without damaging the CNS. Our results revealed that FT derived cells were found to have self-renewal capacity and the ability to grow <italic>in vitro</italic> to form numerous neurospheres in a similar manner as stem/progenitor cells derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) <xref rid="pone.0027393-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Westerlund1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Interestingly, the self-renewing properties were maintained also in tissue from adult donors (&#x0003e;age 30), suggesting that this progenitor pool is maintained during adulthood. The result showed also that the progenitor cells detected can reach different cell passage depending on age. The cells from young patients have larger growth capacity, higher proliferative ability and easier to expand than cells derived from older donors. In rat neurosphere proliferation rate, telomerase activity decreases with age <xref rid="pone.0027393-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, also in the hippcampus of rat the proliferation of the CA1 cells decreases with age <xref rid="pone.0027393-Encinas1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>After differentiation the cultures were labelled with &#x003b2;-III-tubulin as a marker for neurons <xref rid="pone.0027393-Geisert1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Roskams1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Interestingly, in response to PDGF-BB stimulation, the number of &#x003b2;-III-tubulin positive cells increased. It has been shown that PDGF-BB supports neuronal differentiation of <bold>CNS</bold> stem cells by acting as a mitogen in the early phases of stem cell differentiation, promoting survival and proliferation of immature neurons <xref rid="pone.0027393-Erlandsson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Johe1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The response to PDGF-BB indicates that the cells are early progenitors the cell fate of which can be influenced and directed as is the case for SVZ progenitor cells. Varghese et al., (2009), transplanted human FT cells to Sprague Dawley rats in a global ischemia model and found that the cells developed into GFAP expressing cells, however -as expected, eliciting a strong immune reaction <xref rid="pone.0027393-Varghese1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The abundance of progenitor cells, expressing markers of immaturity throughout the FT may also be of relevance for tumor formation in this region. We speculate that dedifferention occurring in the ependymal progenitor clusters could be the origin of the myxopapillary ependymoma sometimes encountered in the region <xref rid="pone.0027393-Sonneland1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027393-Chesler1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>

</p><p>In summary, our findings add further evidence for the existence of cells with neuronal progenitor nature within the FT. We demonstrate the abundance and distribution of the cells and their ability to respond to growth factors. We also demonstrate that the progenitor cells detected from young patients have greater growth capacity, higher proliferative ability and more easy to expand than cells derived from older donors. Since the FT can be removed without functional impairment it may represent an attractive CNS reservoir of neural stem/progenitor cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Tissue preparation</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>I.

To stop the enzymatic reaction, 10 mg/ml BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mg/ml ovomucoid (Worthington) were mixed with L15, added and mixed with the dissociation medium. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 220 g for 5 min. To further enrich for progenitor cells, 0.9 M sucrose in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Invitrogen) was added to the tissue solution followed by centrifugation at 750 g for 10 min and washing with L15. The cell pellet was resuspended and to allow single cell cultures in 5 or 10 cm &#x000d8; petri dishes in neurosphere medium, composed of DMEM/F12 (invitrogen), HEPES (Gibco), B27 supplement (Gibco) and Penicillin-Streptomycin (Invitrogen).
