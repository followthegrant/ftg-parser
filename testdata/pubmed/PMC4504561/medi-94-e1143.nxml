A meta-analysis<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> performed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists&#x02019; Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) confirmed that whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery could reduce local recurrence and translated into a survival benefit compared to no radiotherapy (1:4 theory). However, traditional whole-breast irradiation usually requires a lengthy treatment time of approximately 5&#x02013;6 weeks. Many patients do not receive subsequent radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery or choose mastectomy instead for reasons including the long course of treatment, advanced age, a long travel distance to the hospital, and socioeconomic status.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Based on the finding that most local recurrences occur at or near the tumor bed after breast-conserving surgery,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI), a new radiation technique that targets partial breast tissue around the tumor cavity with fewer fractions has emerged.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is one pattern of APBI. IORT is defined as a single dose of irradiation delivered to the tumor bed at the time of surgery and can be substituted for whole-breast irradiation.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The overwhelming advantage of IORT was that it could shorten the treatment time from approximately 5 to 6 weeks to only once concurrently with surgery, which was very convenient. In addition, IORT could reduce the cost of RT and improve the quality of life.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Recently, 2 randomized clinical trials&#x02014;the ELIOT trial and the TARGIT trial<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>&#x02014;have reported their results of local control and survival outcomes when comparing IORT with whole-breast EBRT, and both reported promising results regarding IORT. However, the results were controversial because of the relatively high rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and because of the various limitations of each study.</p><p>To date, there has not been a corresponding meta-analysis to investigate this problem. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IORT compared with whole-breast EBRT for women with early-stage breast cancer and breast-conserving surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Literature Search</title><p>We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Web of Science, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, Issue 8 of 12, Oct 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov databases using the following phrases: &#x0201c;breast cancer,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;radiotherapy,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;intraoperative radiotherapy,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;IORT,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;intrabeam,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;external beam radiotherapy.&#x0201d; MeSH terms and free terms were used for each electronic search.

Overall mortality, breast cancer mortality, non-breast cancer mortality, and distant metastases did not differ significantly between the groups. The cosmetic effects of IORT were better, and the overall side effects were significantly less than those of whole-breast EBRT.</p><p>As far as we know, this is the first meta-analysis summarizing current trials that focused on the newer radiation strategy&#x02014;a single dose of IORT to the tumor bed at the time of surgery. Our results indicate that IORT should be used with caution for women with early-stage breast cancer and breast-conserving surgery because of the higher risk of IBTR.</p><p>The higher risk of IBTR with IORT might be attributed to the selection of patients who were unsuitable for this technique. Except for the TARGIT trial,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> patients in the other 3 studies<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> were assigned to the IORT group or the EBRT group without the consideration of adverse clinical and pathologic prognostic factors. In the ELIOT trial,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> approximately half of the patients were less than 60 years old. Thirteen percent (13%) of the patients had a tumor size of more than 2&#x0200a;cm, and about one third of patients had positive nodes, which exceeds the &#x0201c;suitable&#x0201d; criteria of ASTRO's guidelines for APBI.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Leonardi et al<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> assigned 1822 patients treated with IORT at the European Institute of Oncology to suitable, cautionary and unsuitable groups. The results showed that the 5-year rate of IBTR increased from the suitable to the cautionary to the unsuitable group (1.5% vs. 4.4% vs. 8.8%, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0003). Similarly, when patients were assigned to good, possible, and contraindication groups according to the GEC-ESTRO recommendations for APBI, the 5-year rate of IBTR was 1.9%, 7.4%, and 7.7%, respectively (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001).<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In the ELIOT trial, when patients were divided into subgroups according to unfavorable factors, the 5-year rate of IBTR for women who did not have any unfavorable factors was far lower than for women who did have unfavorable factors (1.5% vs. 11.3%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0&#x000b7;0001).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The TARGIT trial had a risk-adapted design.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This study predefined several adverse features before randomization, and additional whole-breast irradiation would be prescribed after IORT if adverse features appeared. This indicates that the IORT technique should be applied in an individualized way, and the prudent selection of patients who are at low risk of recurrence and suitable for IORT is essential.</p><p>To date, criteria have not been identified to determine which patients could receive single-dose IORT safely. Multivariate analysis in the ELIOT trial<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> found that some factors doubled the risk of IBTR, including a tumor size greater than 2&#x0200a;cm, the presence of 4 or more positive lymph nodes, a poorly differentiated tumor and a triple-negative subtype. The adverse features in the TARGIT trial<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> included a tumor-free margin smaller than 1&#x0200a;mm, an extensive in-situ component, an unexpected invasive lobular carcinoma, close margins, and other adverse prognostic factors (several positive nodes, extensive lymph-vascular invasion, etc.). The ASTRO and ESTRO guidelines for APBI could be used as references when selecting suitable patients for IORT.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Sperk et al demonstrated that the selection of patients for IORT should be more restrictive.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Excluding clinical and pathological factors, patients&#x02019; preference should also be taken into consideration when making decisions.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>Our study had some limitations. First, our meta-analysis only included 4 studies of 5415 patients. Two of these 4 studies were non-RCTs with a limited sample size, suggesting that our study was prone to biases, such as selection bias. Second, significant heterogeneity was observed for IBTR. Actually, a great deal of heterogeneity existed among the 4 included studies, in various dimensions. First, the patient characteristics were different. Some studies limited the patients&#x02019; age and tumor size, but with different threshold values. Some studies did not. Second, the study designs were different. The TARGIT trial had a risk-adapted design. In the IORT group, 15.2% patients received both IORT and EBRT because of the appearance of predefined adverse features. The other 3 trials did not take any clinical or pathological prognostic factors into consideration. Third, the techniques used to deliver IORT were different. The TARGIT trial adopted a prescription of 20 Gy using 50-kV x-rays, but the other 3 studies delivered 21 Gy using electrons. It was also hard to assess and compare the real target area irradiated. Fourth, the follow-up time was different in each study and might have been insufficient. All of these studies started in the year 2000 or later. The median follow-up time varied from 29 months to 5.8 years. This might be insufficient to observe differences in local control, survival outcomes, and adverse effects, especially late complications.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Darby et al<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> demonstrated that ischemic heart disease started within a few years and continued for at least 20 years after radiotherapy in breast cancer patients.</p><p>In conclusion, there was a significantly higher risk of IBTR with IORT compared to whole-breast EBRT for women with early-stage breast cancer and breast-conserving surgery, due to moderate heterogeneity, the results should be interpreted with caution. Overall mortality did not differ significantly between the groups. Identifying appropriate patients with a low risk of local recurrence is very important. For carefully selected patients who have a low risk of local recurrence, IORT should be a feasible choice.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: APBI = accelerated partial breast irradiation, CI = confidence interval, EBRT = external beam radiotherapy, IBTR = ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, IORT = intraoperative radiotherapy, RCT = randomized controlled trials, RR = risk ratio.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>L.Z. and Z.Z. have contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Conception and design: L.Z., Z.Z., X.Y., X.G.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Collection and assembly of data: L.Z., Z.Z., X.Y., X.G.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Data analysis and interpretation: Z.Z. and L.Z. completed the statistical analysis.
