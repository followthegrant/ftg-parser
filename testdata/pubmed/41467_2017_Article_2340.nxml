Stomata are leaf pores that control gas exchange and, therefore, impact critical functions such as photosynthesis, drought tolerance, and also are the preferred entry point for pathogens. Here we show the addition of ATP leads to the rapid closure of leaf stomata and enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen <italic>Psuedomonas syringae</italic>. This response is mediated by ATP recognition by the receptor DORN1, followed by direct phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase RBOHD, resulting in elevated production of reactive oxygen species and stomatal closure. Mutation of DORN1 phosphorylation sites on RBOHD eliminates the ability of ATP to induce stomatal closure. The data implicate purinergic signaling via DORN1 in the control of stomatal aperture with important implications for the control of plant photosynthesis, water homeostasis, pathogen resistance, and ultimately yield.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Extracellular ATP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern that triggers signaling responses to wounding and environmental stimuli in plants.

However, ATP can also be released into the extracellular matrix, where it is referred to as extracellular ATP (eATP), either in response to environmental stimuli or wounding, where it is recognized as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. For example, the release of eATP in animals can evoke a variety of responses, such as inflammation, neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and even cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In mammalian cells, two classes of plasma membrane localized purinoceptors are known: P2X ligand-gated ion channels and P2Y G protein-coupled receptors that bind eATP-inducing complex, downstream cellular signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In contrast to mammals, the role of ATP as an extracellular signal in plants is poorly understood. However, a number of recent reviews have highlighted a variety of plant cellular processes that can be impacted by the addition of exogenous ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. For example, eATP has been implicated in root hair growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, biotic and abiotic stress responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, gravitropism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and thigmotropism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Plants respond to eATP with many of the same responses seen in animals, including elevation of cytoplasmic calcium [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, production of nitric oxide (NO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and reactive oxygen species (ROS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and expression of defense-related genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These various responses to eATP lacked a mechanistic explanation until the identification of the first plant purinoreceptor, DORN1 (DOESN&#x02019;T RESPOND TO NUCLEOTIDES)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, was reported in 2014, defining a new family of kinase purinergic receptor (i.e., P2K1). DORN1 encodes LecRK-I.9 (L-type lectin receptor-like kinase) composed of an extracellular legume L-type lectin domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain. The DORN1 extracellular binding domain binds to ATP and ADP with high affinity and to other purine nucleotides with lesser affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

The main port of entry by pathogenic bacteria, such as <italic>P. syringae</italic>, is via the leaf stomata.

The rapid generation of ROS has been shown to be among the initial plant responses to pathogen infection. However, ROS also plays a variety of important roles in plant growth and development: such as supporting cell wall growth and also stomatal aperture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, ROS production in response to pathogen recognition (e.g., due to recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)) is mediated by the NADPH oxidase resiratory burst oxidase homolog D (AtRBOHD) with AtRBOHF showing some redundant function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

However, no specific mechanism was offered to explain how ATP affected stomatal aperture. In the current study, we provide a molecular mechanism for the light response by showing that ATP-triggered activation of the DORN1 kinase function leads to direct phosphorylation of AtRBOHD, resulting in an elevation of ROS production and subsequent stomatal closure.

In order to determine the specific DORN1 residues critical for phosphorylation activity, we used mass spectrometry to identify a total of 13 autophosphorylation sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>, and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Indeed, many of the cellular responses to eATP (e.g., ROS production) are similar between plants and animals. However, the receptors that mediated these responses are quite different. A great deal of research has gone into deciphering the cellular signaling pathways downstream of the mammalian P2Y and P2X purinergic receptors and these studies have led to the development of important drugs. In comparison, nothing is known of how ATP recognition by DORN1 is coupled to downstream signaling pathways. For example, although DORN1 was identified as the first plant eATP receptor, the downstream substrates of DORN1 phosphorylation are unknown. However, clearly, the kinase activity of DORN1 is crucial for its role in purinergic signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The key residues within the DORN1 kinase domain that are autophosphorylated in response to ATP and are essential for signaling are now identified as S391, S440, and S451. Mutation in any of these residues results in the production of a protein that is unable to complement the <italic>dorn1</italic> mutant phenotype.</p><p id="Par28">Given that eATP is implicated in a variety of plant stress responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, it is likely that DORN1 signaling involves a variety of downstream target proteins. Therefore, RBOHD is likely only one of the substrates but its phosphorylation already explains some of the key physiological responses attributed to eATP. For example, the data show that DORN1 phosphorylation of RBOHD on residue S22 results in an activation of ROS production and stomatal closure providing enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens that use stomata as their primary site of infection. Interesting parallels can be made with mammals. For example, the purinergic receptor P2X7 is known to activate ROS production via membrane-associated NADPH oxidase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. This can also provide protection against invading pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, as well as generally contributing to the inflammatory response. It is likely that these processes represent convergent evolution, where plants and animals have adapted purinergic signaling to provide for a robust stress response but using different receptors. An interesting, unanswered question is to what extent plant and animal purinergic pathways have been conserved.</p><p id="Par29">The importance of ROS production and RBOHD is exemplified by the myriad ways in which the activity of this protein is regulated.

For example, CPKs were shown to phosphorylate RBOHD at residues Ser133, Ser148, Ser163, and Ser347<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In addition, PAMP treatment induces phosphorylation of the RBOHD residues Ser39, Ser148, Ser152, Ser163, Ser343, and Ser347<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.

Residue Ser347 is of particular importance since it can be phosphorylated by both BIK1 and CPKs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">Note that none of these identified kinases was shown to phosphorylate RBOHD residue S22, although a previous phosphoproteomic study showed that this residue was phosphorylated in planta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. We now identify DORN1 as the kinase that specifically targets S22 and by so doing activates NADPH oxidase activity. This adds a new element to the overall regulation of RBOHD allowing for integration of responses to PAMPs (via BIK1), DAMPs (via DORN1 and BIK1), and a variety of stresses (via calcium signaling). At this point, it remains unclear as to how or whether these various regulatory mechanisms interact to either antagonize or synergize the ROS response. The presence of these multiple regulatory pathways that control RBOHD activity may explain, in part, why <italic>dorn1-3</italic> mutant plants still retain some, residual ROS production.</p><p id="Par31">ROS production acts as an important signal mediating both plant and animal immunity. One aspect of this in plants is the ability to induce closure of stomata, blocking a key path for pathogen entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. The addition of ATP was previously shown to trigger ROS production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Independent reports also indicated that ATP addition could induce closure of stomata<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. However, in neither case was a mechanism provided for these phenomena. The data presented here now provide this mechanism by showing that ATP-induced stomatal closure depends on DORN1 and is mediated by direct phosphorylation of RBOHD. The addition of ATP to <italic>dorn1</italic> or <italic>rbohd</italic> mutant plants failed to close stomata, and this function was not restored by expression of RBOHD mutant proteins possessing the S22A modification. Interestingly, pathogen inoculation leads to a significant elevation of extracellular ATP, which appeared to be at its highest around the stomata guard cells. Therefore, in addition to inducing defense responses through PAMP-triggered immunity, the pathogen also is recognized by the plant through stress-induced release of eATP.</p><p id="Par32">The stomata not only serve as a conduit for pathogen infection, but also function for gas and water exchange. Measurements of plant transpiration demonstrated that ATP can close the stomata to prevent plant water loss. Both <italic>dorn1</italic> and <italic>rbohd</italic> mutant plants, consistent with their open stomata, showed significantly higher transpiration loss of water. Thus, eATP, through the action of DORN1 and RBOHD, may be an important signal that helps mediate water homeostasis, a critical trait for crop production, especially under conditions of a changing climate.</p><p id="Par33">In summary, the data support a model by which ATP, released as a result of stress (biotic or abiotic), is recognized by DORN1, triggering phosphorylation of the N terminus of RBOHD, resulting in elevated levels of ROS production that function to induce stomatal closure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>).
