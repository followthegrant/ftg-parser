The biological activity of platelets, both in physiological processes as well as under pathological conditions, is dependent on the degree of their activation. A platelet&#x02019;s activation process, despite the absence of a nucleus, is very complex and associated with elements of enzymatic signal transduction chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. After the platelets&#x02019; activation, signal transduction leads to mobilization of intracellular calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>). High intracellular concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> results in activation of phospholipases, which are responsible for the release of cell membrane phospholipids&#x02019; enzymatic hydrolyses. These include, for example, the precursor of essential bioactive eicosanoids &#x02013; 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid called arachidonic acid (AA), which is a 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid. AA released from the membranes is enzymatically oxidized, transformed by the cyclic peroxide prostaglandin synthase known as cyclooxygenase (COX) into intermediate products: pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and pro-thrombotic thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> (TXA<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These are accompanied by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. TXA<sub>2</sub> is generated from prostaglandin H2, formed by COX through thromboxane-A synthase. TXA<sub>2</sub> is an autocrine or paracrine mediator in the nearby tissues surrounding its production site. TXA<sub>2</sub> is a very strong blood platelet activator acting as a pro-aggregator and vasoconstrictor mediator, leading to increased platelet aggregation. This plays a pivotal role in the growth and stabilization of a coronary thrombus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. TXA<sub>2</sub> is formed in platelets in response to local stimuli and exerts an activating effect within a short distance of its biosynthesis.</p><p id="Par6">AA metabolism by COX is a major pathway of blood platelets activation, and is associated with pro-thrombotic platelets&#x02019; activity and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. AA addition in vitro to platelet rich plasma causes a burst of oxygen consumption, TXA<sub>2</sub> generation and platelet aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">One of the major method in anti-platelet pharmacotherapy of preventing arterial thrombosis is inhibition of COX activity. The results of clinical studies have shown that intake of aspirin, or different aspirin-like COX-inhibitors, reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Low-dose aspirin (40&#x000a0;mg per day) supplementation reduces the risk of serious cardiovascular events by 12% and non-fatal myocardial infarction by 18%. This dose is able to inhibit a large proportion of thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> release provoked acutely by the platelets&#x02019; response. Aspirin is also able to reduce the risk of secondary thrombotic events by about 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Experiments performed on human monocytes have shown that flavonolignans &#x02013; active chemical compounds presented in a silymarin (standardized extract from of Milk thistle (<italic>Silybum marianum</italic>)) inhibit the COX pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The oxygenase activity of COX causes conversion of the arachidonic acid to a prostaglandin G2 (PGG<sub>2</sub>) which is the first intermediate in the COX pathway. This assay is based on the reaction formed between PGG<sub>2</sub> and 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (ADHP), which produces the highly fluorescent compound Resorufin. This can be analysed using an excitation wavelength of 530&#x02013;540&#x000a0;nm and an emission wavelength of 585&#x02013;595&#x000a0;nm.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">Cyclooxygenase is a representative of membrane-bound glycoproteins and possesses two distinct enzymatic activities: oxygenase and peroxidase. In the early 1990s, identification of two members of the COX family was made. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many types of cells, however it is the only COX form expressed in blood platelets. COX-2 is an inducible form which is activated in cells by pro-inflammatory inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">COX-pathway activation in blood platelets is strictly dependent on its substrate &#x02013; the unesterified free form of arachidonic acid released from the internal phospholipid membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. AA is the main fatty acid component of phospholipids in blood platelets&#x02019; cell layer (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol may contain even 80% of AA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. After being released by phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> and phospholipase C, free AA is oxidized at C-11 by COX. The oxygenase activity of COX catalyses the incorporation of two oxygen atoms to one molecule of arachidonate, creating a prostaglandin G2 (PGG<sub>2</sub>). Next, peroxidase catalysis results in reduction of the 15-OOH group in the PGG<sub>2</sub> structure to the 15-OH group, and formation of prostaglandin H2 (PGH<sub>2</sub>). PGH<sub>2</sub> is a substrate for enzymes in the heme prosthetic group &#x02013; thromboxane A (TXA) synthase. The heme group presented in the catalytic centre of TXA synthase is responsible for homolytic cleavage of the epidioxy bond in PGH<sub>2</sub>, and rearrangement to TXA<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">One of the direct actions of thromboxane on blood platelets is to modify the response of platelets to exogenous agonists, as well as to stimulate platelet activation. The platelet&#x02019;s response to TXA<sub>2</sub> is responsible for the surface receptor for TXA<sub>2</sub> (TP), which is a member of the seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor family. Activation of TP results in both the autocrine and paracrine action of TXA<sub>2</sub> released from blood platelets. The TP signalling pathway is mediated by two G proteins: G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>12/13</sub>. G<sub>q</sub> is responsible for activation of phospholipase C, resulting in increased inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate concentration. In consequence, intra-cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are mobilised and diacylglycerol is formed, which activates protein kinase C. These events cause platelet shape change, aggregation, and secretion from intra-cellular granules. Stimulation of G<sub>12/13</sub> subunits activates the Rho pathway, which results in myosin light chain phosphorylation and subsequent platelet shape change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">TXA<sub>2</sub> is a very unstable molecule with a short half-life of about 30&#x000a0;s, after which it passes to the very stable but inactive metabolite TXB<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The involvement of blood platelets in both the physiological coagulation process and pathological conditions is dependent on their activation level. The non-stimulated (resting) blood platelets lacked any free AA and therefore blocked the COX. After activation, an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux activated both enzymes: phospholipases C and A<sub>2</sub>, which hydrolyse membrane phospholipids and release free AA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The exogenous arachidonic acid is able to cause irreversible platelet aggregation, as it can be rapidly incorporated into membrane phospholipids, primarily phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol, by arachidonoyl coenzyme A synthetase. Our current studies have demonstrated that flavonolignans are able to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by extracellular AA. This suggests the ability of the tested flavonolignans to block the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway in blood platelets. Additionally, in probes pre-incubated with flavonolignans we also observed inhibition of the formation of COX pathway metabolites: MDA and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>. Following this, we determined the direct effect of flavonolignans on COX activity and saw that silychristin and silybin have very strong inhibitory properties with low IC<sub>50</sub> values (35&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M and 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M respectively).</p><p id="Par29">The final step of our study, to explain the potential mechanism of obtained experimental results, was to characterise the interaction between selected flavonolignans and COX structure using bioinformatic ligand docking. In silico docking methods have undergone significant developments and improvements over the last few years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Docking software computes the best conformation and placement of ligands in a receptor structure. For our study, we used the AutoDock Vina programme, which combines some of the advantages of knowledge-based potentials and empirical scoring functions. It extracts empirical information from both the conformational preferences of the receptor-ligand complex and from experimental affinity measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The results obtained from the docking demonstrated the potential direct mechanism of interaction between flavonolignans (silychristin and silybin) and the active COX centre. This interaction block entry to the COX loop where is located Tyr385 residue. Tyr385 generates a tyrosyl radical in the cyclooxygenase active site which is abstracts the pro-S hydrogen atom from carbon-13 of AA, initiating the cyclooxygenase reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Acetylsalicylic (ASA) acid was the first cyclooxygenase inhibitor to be recognized and introduced to clinical use, and has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular disease conditions associated with thrombosis, and increased blood platelet activation. The molecular mechanism of this inhibition is ASA&#x02019;s ability to cause irreversible acetylation of the platelet cyclooxygenase, with serine residue of: Ser529 of COX-1 and Ser516 of COX-2. This acetylation results in blocking of the access of arachidonic acid to the active enzyme site, which leads to irreversible inhibition of the formation of both prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory mediators in blood platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. ASA is the most popular substance in prevention of cardiovascular pathologies and has a well-established role in preventing thrombotic events in patients with recognized cardiovascular disease. Additionally, large-scale clinical studies conducted last years, demonstrated the effectiveness of ASA in the primary prevention of thrombotic events in men and women without diagnosed cardiovascular disease. In these studies, ASA significantly reduced the risk of a first myocardial infarction, stroke or death from cardiovascular causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, ASA treatment is subject to risks from bleeding. Meta-analysis performed by Baigent et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] demonstrated that long-term ASA administration increases the risk of major gastrointestinal and other extracranial bleedings by 0.5%. In a study by De Berardis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], the risk of bleeding increased by 2.5% in the ASA treatment group. ASA also increases the risk of haemorrhagic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These facts illustrate the necessity of ASA therapy to give proven clinical benefits, and the need for its assessment using precise estimation of benefits and risks, especially for rare events, such as intracranial haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. For these reasons, all over the world incessant research is taking place on novel, therapeutically better, more effective anti-platelet agents that would have a significant effect on proper haemostatic stability, without adverse effects. Plants are a good source for isolating natural compounds without unfavourable side effects, capable of inhibiting the enzymes involved in cell signalling pathways and reducing blood platelets activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par31">The results obtained from this study clearly present the potential role of flavonolignans, natural-origin compounds present in fruits of Milk thistle, an <italic>Asteraceae</italic> family plant (<italic>Silybum marianum</italic>, L.
