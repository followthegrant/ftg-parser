The platform angle could be freely adjusted and then fixed to fit the user&#x02019;s needs, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Regular, straight, atraumatic smooth forceps (forceps 1) (GRAEFE 18-880-10, DANNORITZER Medizintechnik GmbH &#x00026; Co.

Tissue forceps (angled, length 100&#x000a0;mm) (forceps 2) (GRAEFE 18-883-10, DANNORITZER Medizintechnik GmbH &#x00026; Co.

A 22-G intravenous catheter 25&#x000a0;mm in length with an internal diameter of 0.6&#x000a0;mm and a hub of 20&#x000a0;mm (Terumo Europe N.V., Leuven, Belgium) was used as the tracheal intubation tube (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The associated needle stylet (38&#x000a0;mm long, 0.024 inch (0.61&#x000a0;mm) in diameter, connected to a 30-mm hub) with 2&#x000a0;mm of the most distal sharp tip removed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), or a soft-tipped, 0.014-inch (0.36&#x000a0;mm)-wide coronary artery guide wire (Balance Middleweight Elite, Abbott Vascular, International BVBA, Belgium) which was cut to 12&#x000a0;cm from the default length of 190&#x000a0;cm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), served to guide the tracheal tube into the trachea in both methods, as described below. A torque device (Radifocus &#x000ae; Torque device, Terumo Europe N.V., Leuven, Belgium) was used to mechanically lock the tail of the guidewire (at around 4&#x000a0;cm from the tail end of the guide wire) to manipulate it across the vocal cords whenever needed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). A 100&#x000a0;W halogen light source (MORITEX MHF-D100LR) was used to transilluminate the oropharynx from the ventral side of the mouse&#x02019;s neck to facilitate localization of the trachea during intubation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Equipment for the orotracheal intubation of laboratory mice. <bold>a</bold> tissue forceps acting as a laryngeal blade. <bold>b</bold> 22-G intravenous catheter. <bold>c</bold> 38-mm long, sharp tip-blunted needle stylet with a 30-mm hub. <bold>d</bold> 0.014-inch (0.36&#x000a0;mm) guide wire. <bold>e</bold> Guide wire-manipulating torque device</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12871_2016_173_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The platform was then elevated to an angle of 45&#x02013;60&#x000b0; to help straighten the curvature between the trachea and larynx (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Panel b) to allow for clear visualization of the oropharyngeal cavity. A 100&#x000a0;W halogen light source with a flexible fiber-optic arm was aimed at the ventral side of the mouse&#x02019;s neck to elucidate the trachea just below the vocal cords (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Panel a). The mouth of the animal was opened with the regular, straight, atraumatic smooth forceps (forceps 1) and the tongue was pulled laterally. The angled, 10-cm long tissue forceps (forceps 2, working as a laryngoscope blade) were then inserted into the oral cavity along the tongue and then adjusted anterosuperiorly to displace the soft palate and to lift the epiglottis in order to clearly illustrate the vocal cords and trachea. The position of the fiber-optic arm of the light source was adjusted for each mouse to provide optimal illumination of the vocal cords and trachea (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Panel b). Orotracheal intubation was then performed using either the Conventional or Modified method as described below. For the mice intubated with the Conventional method (Conventional Group), the trachea was intubated directly with a 22-G intravenous catheter over a 38-mm stiff, straight, tip-blunted needle. For the mice intubated with the Modified method (Modified Group), a 0.014-inch coronary artery guide wire (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>) controlled with a torque device (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>) was initially inserted into the trachea. After removal of the torque device, a 22-G catheter was advanced into the trachea over the guide wire.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessment of feasibility and safety</title><p id="Par10">The technical feasibility of both methods for tracheal intubation was evaluated by the time taken to complete the intubation procedure (defined as the time from opening the animal&#x02019;s mouth with the tissue forceps, advancing the endotracheal tube into the trachea to connection of the tube hub to the mechanical ventilator), the number of attempts needed, the difficulties encountered during the procedure (vigorous gag reflex interrupting intubation, excess salivary secretion hindering clear visualization of the larynx, and unusual resistance precluding smooth advancement of the tube into the trachea), and the overall success rate. Technical safety was assessed by the number of instances of esophageal mispositioning, massive oral bleeding, and procedure-related mortality. Tissue integrity was assessed by direct histological analysis of the intubated trachea in both the short and the long term. Short-term analysis was conducted in the mice subjected to open-chest surgical procedures with immediate sacrifice of the animal after completion of the experimental steps (cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury and acute myocardial infarction models). In these mice, the hearts were explanted, the chest cavities opened and the tracheas exposed. The position of the tip of the tracheal tube was determined using an inverted microscope at 5x magnification. The tracheas were then harvested and their integrity between the vocal cords and the catheter tip position was examined histologically by a researcher blinded to group allocation, using H&#x00026;E staining to determine whether the epithelium was damaged. Long-term analysis was performed in the mice that had recovered from anesthesia (chronic myocardial infarction and left ventricle pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction models). They were extubated with spontaneous breathing, returned to their cages and given standard care until they were sacrificed at 4&#x000a0;weeks for research purposes. In these animals, the integrity of the entire trachea from the vocal cords to bifurcation was histologically examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par11">Continuous variables are expressed as mean or median&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD, and categorical variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages.

The present study demonstrates that this difficult and time-consuming procedure can be quickly and safely completed using a novel method employing easily acquired and inexpensive tools including a halogen light, tissue forceps, a 0.014-inch guide wire and a 22-G IV catheter, without causing any short- or long-term complications. Heightened ethical concerns for animals used in research have focused on the preservation of life as the pivotal issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and the unique value of genetically modified mice underscores the need to protect them from inadvertent harm during experimental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that the crucial yet potentially life-threatening tracheal intubation procedure can be performed more efficaciously and safely without the loss of animal life, thus suggesting the application of this novel method in laboratories requiring intubation of mice for subsequent experiments.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Comparison of our orotracheal intubation methods with other methods</title><p id="Par16">Orotracheal intubation of laboratory mice was first reported by Ho and Furst in 1973 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Since then, a number of modifications in the procedure and instruments used have been proposed to improve the success rate and to reduce unnecessary loss of animal life. However, these reports have either not provided adequate details for researchers who want to replicate the protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], or have indicated that the procedure can only be performed with complex and expensive equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] such as fiber-optic arthroscopes and endoscopes, or requiring operators with extensive training (three students and one physician needed to accomplish 20 consecutive intubations successfully within 60&#x000a0;s before performing subsequent intubations) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Importantly, only a few studies have reported overcoming the two key difficulties in tracheal intubation, i.e., clear visualization of the tracheal orifice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and easy advancement of the endotracheal tube into the trachea. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] Tools meant to fully open the oral cavity such as a metal laryngoscope blade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] or a custom-made laryngoscope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] have the disadvantages of obscuring visualization of the vocal cords and triggering pharyngeal-laryngeal reflexes, which can easily cause esophageal disposition and laryngeal injury. Instruments designed to reveal the location of the tracheal entrance such as expensive endoscopic instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] including a modified arthroscope with affiliated light source plus video camera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and an optic-fiber cable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] can easily induce a visual mismatch between the video images and the real oral cavity, thus needing a much longer learning curve to master.</p><p id="Par17">On the other hand, for both of our methods, the mice were placed in the dorsal recumbent position at a 45-60&#x000b0; tilt with the upper incisors fixed by a silk band, thereby maximizing the opening of the oral cavity and aligning the operator&#x02019;s line of sight with the epiglottis. Additional expansion of the operative field by tissue forceps to lift the epiglottis anterosuperiorly along with transillumination of the trachea from the ventral side of the mouse&#x02019;s neck by a light source further helped localize the vocal cords and trachea visually. The tissue forceps used in this study (forceps 2) functioned as a miniature human laryngoscope with the curvature of its arms similar to the blade of the laryngoscope, and it also provided good view to allow successful endotracheal intubation. Importantly, they were slim enough not to obscure localization of the vocal cords and trachea, thus avoiding inadvertent esophageal intubation during advancement of the endotracheal tube. Our methods do not need expensive devices or extensive training, as with most of the other methods. Most importantly, the instruments we used in the Modified method to facilitate tracheal tube advancement, i.e., the floppy, slippery, thin guide wire (only 0.36&#x000a0;mm in diameter) and a torque device, could be delicately manipulated atraumatically to wherever the operator intended it to go, just as in a human coronary artery which is smaller than the trachea of a mouse. In fact, utilization of a guide wire to facilitate orotracheal intubation in mice has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], including Vergari et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] who used a 0.4-mm guide wire, Hamacher et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] who used a 2F (0.67&#x000a0;mm in diameter) guide wire, and Thomas et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] who also used a straight 2F (0.67&#x000a0;mm in diameter) guide wire in their studies. The main difference between their methods and ours is that the guide wires we used in our Modified Group were smaller in diameter (only 0.36&#x000a0;mm) and designed specifically for human coronary artery interventions, which can be well controlled by a torque device to smoothly and accurately enter the trachea in the same manner as they are manipulated in a coronary artery without causing injury to the endothelium they touch. The results of the present study demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this novel modified procedure for the orotracheal intubation of laboratory mice. This tool is at least not inferior to other devices used for the same purpose, as reflected by the 100&#x000a0;% procedural success rate and no immediate or late complications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Comparison between the Modified and Conventional methods of tracheal intubation</title><p id="Par18">Orotracheal intubation could be completed in all of our mice with either of our Conventional or Modified method, however the relatively longer time and greater number of attempts needed, along with significantly more difficulties encountered with the Conventional method indicate that the 0.024-inch (0.61-mm) stiff stylet used in the Conventional method was a less efficient instrument than the 0.014-inch (0.36&#x000a0;mm) floppy guide wire used in the Modified method as an introducer for the tracheal tube. The significantly higher incidence rates of procedure-related complications and short- and long-term tracheal tissue damage further suggests the potential harm that can be caused by a stiff stylet made from a needle with the end blunted. In contrast, the better performance of the 0.014-inch guide wire used in the Modified method in terms of ease of intubation and freedom from procedure-related complications or tracheal injury indicates that it is both an efficacious and atraumatic method to enter the extremely narrow tracheal opening and cross the rapidly vibrating vocal cords without triggering vigorous gag/salivary reflexes or damaging the tracheal epithelial lining. In addition, the torque device used for precise human percutaneous coronary interventions enhances the maneuverability of the guide wire to accurately enter the trachea, thus reducing esophageal disposition. Moreover, for experiments in which animals are kept alive for a period of time or are intubated repeatedly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] such as for radiological imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], pulmonary ventilation or agonist challenging studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the absence of short- and long-term tracheal injuries in the Modified method can the primary experiments, thus making it a more suitable method than others for a wider range of in vivo research.</p><p id="Par19">In summary, tracheal intubation of laboratory mice for subsequent experiments can be accomplished quickly, safely and reliably with our proposed novel method employing a slanted platform, an external light source, tissue forceps, a slim and soft 0.014-inch guide wire, a torque device, and a modified tracheal tube, all of which can be readily acquired at low cost and easily assembled in a typical animal laboratory dedicated to cardiovascular research. This method can be considered as a good choice for relevant experiments, especially for those in which repeated tracheal intubation is necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par20">Tracheal intubation of anesthetized mice undergoing experimental surgical procedures can be rapidly and successfully accomplished with the proposed novel technique using inexpensive readily available instruments including a slim, soft-tipped guide wire and an associated torque device without immediate or late complications.
