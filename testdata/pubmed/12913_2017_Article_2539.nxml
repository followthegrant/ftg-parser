Increasingly, clinical decision-making is a concern for clinical research in primary care. In this study, we review the prior application and utility of CSR as a technique for research interviews in primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Following Arksey &#x00026; O&#x02019;Malley&#x02019;s method for scoping reviews, we searched seven databases, grey literature, reference lists, and contacted experts in the field. We excluded studies on medical education or competence assessment. Retrieved citations were screened by one reviewer and full texts were ordered for all potentially relevant abstracts. Two researchers independently reviewed full texts and performed data extraction and quality appraisal if inclusion criteria were met. Data were collated and summarised using a published framework on the reporting of qualitative interview techniques, which was chosen a priori. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines informed the review report.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">From an initial list of 789 citations, eight studies using CSR in research interviews were included in the review: six from North America, one from the Netherlands, and one from Ireland. The most common purpose of included studies was to examine the influence of guidelines on physicians&#x02019; decisions. The number of interviewees ranged from seven to twenty nine, while the number of charts discussed per interview ranged from one to twelve. CSR gave insights into physicians&#x02019; reasoning for actions taken or not taken; the unrecorded social and clinical influences on decisions; and discrepancies between physicians&#x02019; real and perceived practice. Ethical concerns and the training and influence of the researcher were poorly discussed in most of the studies. Potential pitfalls included the risk of recall, selection and observation biases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Despite the proven validity, reliability and acceptability of CSR in assessment interviews in medical education, its use in clinical research is limited. Application of CSR in qualitative research brings interview data closer to the reality of practice. Although further development of the approach is required, we recommend a role for CSR in research interviews on decision-making in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12913-017-2539-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Chart stimulated recall</kwd><kwd>Scoping review</kwd><kwd>Qualitative research</kwd><kwd>General practice</kwd><kwd>Decision making</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001590</institution-id><institution>Health Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSAFP/2011/3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinnott</surname><given-names>Carol</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>School for Primary Care Research</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">Since the early 1980s, chart stimulated recall (CSR) has been used to assess the competency of practicing physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Originally described for the re-certification of emergency physicians, CSR is a case-based interviewing technique used to examine clinical decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Chart-based medical notes are sometimes short or incomplete and reviewing the chart alone may not offer sufficient information to understand why or how clinical decisions were made. The premise of chart stimulated recall is that asking physicians to describe a clinical encounter using the patient&#x02019;s chart to prompt their recollection of events will lead to a narrative that has greater detail than the medical notes or the participants account alone and allows an interviewer to probe the reasons why certain decisions were made. Empirical research supports the acceptability, reliability, and validity of CSR in competence assessment, and shows that it allows a more thorough assessment of clinical practice than chart review alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. More recently, CSR has been adopted as a means of assessing decision-making in postgraduate medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this setting, it has been found to be useful for delivering immediate feedback on specific patient encounters to residents, enhancing their understanding of the competencies being evaluated, and encouraging reflective practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Given the proven value of CSR in generating information on clinical decision-making in regulatory and educational settings, it would seem a useful technique in clinical research interviews in primary care. Clinical decision-making is a complex process which incorporates both slow deliberate and fast intuitive cognitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It requires the synthesis of conscious and sub-conscious information on the signs and symptoms of disease, patients&#x02019; values, treatment options, and available healthcare resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In primary care, research on clinical decision-making presents additional challenges as many issues may be dealt with in a single clinical encounter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], record keeping is often brief or incomplete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the diagnosis or course of action is not always clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Research methods capable of capturing these multiple dimensions are required. However, even in the context of increasing interest in decision-making and complexity in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], CSR has been infrequently used in clinical research to date.</p><p id="Par8">Recently, we used CSR during qualitative interviews to explore how general practitioners (GPs) make decisions for patients with multiple long-term conditions in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We found the technique was acceptable to GPs, and was an efficient means of generating rich data on the complexities of their clinical practice. Given our positive experience, the aim of this paper was to review the broader application of CSR as a clinical research tool in primary care, to provide an overview for other researchers who may consider using the CSR technique.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par9">We conducted a scoping review of the literature using CSR in clinical research in primary care. Scoping reviews are designed to describe relevant literature in a particular area, in contrast to systematic reviews, which seek to answer specific research questions. Scoping reviews are useful for topics that have not been previously reviewed and where many different study designs might be applicable. We followed the five step framework for scoping reviews described by Arksey and O&#x02019;Malley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], but incorporated recent refinements to the approach by Levac et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Step 1: Identify the research question</title><p id="Par10">To describe the use of CSR in clinical research studies in primary care, we defined clinical research as research relating to the study and practice of medicine in relation to the care of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We excluded studies using CSR for medical education research, which we defined as any investigation relating to the education of medical professionals including curriculum development, teaching, evaluation, research methodology, and use of technology in education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We also excluded studies using CSR for competence assessment or physician licensing purposes, and study protocols where CSR had not yet been used. Based on the assumption that in general practice consultations and charts differ in content from those in secondary care, we restricted the review to studies that were conducted in primary care or included a majority of general practitioners (GPs) or their equivalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Step 2: Identify relevant studies</title><p id="Par11">The search was conducted in May 2015, using seven databases on the EBSCO platform: CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycINFO, Social Sciences Full Text (H.W. Wilson), and SocINDEX. These databases represent a broad scope of academic fields where health related research is published. We used broad search terms which related to general practice and chart stimulated recall (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and looked for these in any aspect of the title, abstract or paper text. The search was not limited by language, dates of publication or study type. We supplemented this by searching databases of grey literature (WorldCat, Ebooks, Proceedings, and Papersfirst from the OCLC FirstSearch platform), citation and reference lists and contacting experts in the field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Step 3: Study selection</title><p id="Par12">The titles and abstracts of all retrieved citations were read by one reviewer (CS). Full texts were ordered for all potentially relevant abstracts. Each full text was reviewed by two researchers (CS, MK) and included if inclusion criteria were met. Exclusion criteria were ranked a priori and once one exclusion criterion had been met, others were not sought. Reasons for exclusion of full texts were recorded and compared between the two reviewers for consistency. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus discussion of the full text papers, or referral to a third reviewer (CB) where necessary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Step 4: Charting the data</title><p id="Par13">All reviewers independently read each included study, extracted relevant data and entered it into a data extraction form (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Extracted data included: the study aims, setting, participants, means of chart selection, approach to data analysis, and contribution of CSR to the study findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Step 5: Collating, summarising, and reporting the results</title><p id="Par14">This step had three components: analysing data, reporting results and applying meaning to the results including the implications of our findings in a broader context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The data extraction forms for each study were combined and discussed by all authors. The Kendall and Murray framework for describing approaches to qualitative interviews (four specific areas are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) was adapted to structure the analysis and reporting of results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although quality appraisal is not an original feature of scoping reviews, it was felt that quality appraisal would reveal particular strengths and weaknesses of the CSR literature, and would be important to guide future researchers in the use of the technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, two reviewers (CS, MK) assessed included studies with the relevant critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. THE PRISMA guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] informed the review report (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Kendall And Murray framework for describing approaches to qualitative interviewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Kendall and Murray framework for describing approaches to qualitative interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>When is this approach appropriate?</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>How to use this approach</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>What type of findings to expect</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Potential pitfalls and how to avoid them</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

Jennett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] described it as &#x0201c;using the patient&#x02019;s chart as a stimulus for recall, (while) the physicians were interviewed&#x0201d;. Guerra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] focused on decision-making, defining CSR as &#x0201c;a physician uses their own documentation of actual patient encounters to stimulate recall of his or her decision-making processes...as an evaluator probes the reasoning behind their medical decision-making&#x0201d;, a definition referenced by two other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Lockyer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] described allowing access to patients&#x02019; charts &#x0201c;to allow the physician to elaborate on the process of care and decision-making&#x0201d;.

For example, in Lockyer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], each participant&#x02019;s first incident case of phototherapy during the study period was chosen. In Rochefort et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] the researchers selected two charts: one patient who was treated according to hypertensive guidelines and one who was not. Other studies used larger numbers of charts: Dee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] discussed all patients seen in the preceding half day of practice, while Ab et al.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] demonstrated that using CSR alone remained prone to reporting biases. Chief among these was inaccurate post-hoc rationalisation.

None of the findings in Rochefort et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] were related back to the patients whose charts were discussed. In Lockyer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] it was unclear if interviewees answered questions based on their management of the incident case that triggered the interview, or if their answers were rhetorical. Keeping the interview and the data analysis focused on the case data where possible may lessen the risk of observer effects.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par41">In this scoping review, we have described the clinical research studies in primary care that have used chart stimulated recall. We identified eight clinical studies that used CSR, most of which had an emphasis on guideline implementation and adherence. From our analysis, it appears that referring to charts during qualitative interviews generates additional information on the influences on decision-making. None of the included studies offered any theoretical explanations to support their use of CSR. We suggest that the encoding specificity principle of memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] provides theoretical reasoning for how accessing contextual information about a patient encounter improves clinicians&#x02019; memory of that encounter. The principle states that memory is improved when information available at encoding is also available at retrieval. For example, the encoding specificity principle would predict that recall for information about a clinical decision is better if participants are interviewed while accessing the notes they wrote at the time of clinical decision-making. This may explain why study authors used CSR to gain greater specificity of detail, and explore not just what participants do but when they do it and why. Another explanation is that CSR may circumvent the difficulties GPs have in talking about diseases separately from the people who &#x02018;have&#x02019; the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Despite these utilities, we found that CSR was used in an inconsistent way and remains prone to biases that threaten its validity. CSR brings interviews closer to the reality of practice, but it does not completely close the gap.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par42">The strengths of our review include a systematic search of the literature, which was augmented with manual searches of reference lists of published papers and systematic reviews. CSR is not a MeSH term so we used free text searches and a broad range of databases to capture relevant papers. A second strength is the quality assessment; although this is not usually a component of scoping review, it helped illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of included papers. Third, to facilitate interpretation of our findings and the use of CSR by other researchers, we analysed and reported our review using an established framework for the reporting of qualitative research techniques. A limitation of our review is the relative paucity of studies. The lack of a consistent definition of CSR increased the likelihood that we overlooked some papers. During the search, we found study protocols that outlined the intended use of chart-stimulated recall to evaluate the impact of knowledge transfer interventions on physicians&#x02019; behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]; once these results are available, they will add to the findings of our review. We restricted our analysis to the published accounts of the included studies for pragmatic reasons; greater justification for the approaches used may have occurred if authors were not restricted by word limits. Lastly, we were not able to determine the added value of using CSR in qualitative interviews in most studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Unanswered questions and areas of future research to advance this method</title><sec id="Sec27"><title>Reflexivity and researcher training</title><p id="Par43">In the assessment of professional competence, CSR interviewers are experienced clinicians who follow a six-month training programme on competence assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the training of interviewers using CSR for clinical research has not been well described. To probe clinical reasoning, it may be advantageous for interviewers to have a clinical background, as doctors have been observed to give richer interviews with clinical researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, clinical researchers can change the dynamic of an interview if perceived by the interviewee to be a judge, a source of reassurance, or an expert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, reflection on the impact of the clinical interviewer is required at the interview and the analysis stage, using input from a multidisciplinary research team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. None of the included papers discussed CSR training for non-clinical interviewers; this is another area which merits further evaluation and description. Empirical evaluation of the number of charts required to deliver optimal validity and the generalisability of CSR findings is also needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par44">There are ethical issues that are of specific concern in CSR but were not discussed in any of the published accounts. For example, unprofessional care or signs of physician burn-out may be identified in the interviews, and provisions should be made within the ethics protocol to deal with this scenario. Patient consent was rarely discussed. Researcher access to the charts or patient identifying information is not always necessary in CSR, but where it is necessary, patient consent would now be a mandatory requirement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Other potential applications of CSR</title><p id="Par45">CSR has been used in competence assessment for physical therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and occupational therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], so it may have potential in clinical research in these specialities. We did not find evidence of its application in the assessment of decision-making in secondary care or by multidisciplinary care teams. Although it may be potentially useful in these settings, the technique would likely require modification to assess comprehensively the additional dimensions involved in team-based decision-making.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Alternative approaches to CSR</title><p id="Par46">CSR resembles other research techniques that use verbalisation to explore decision-making, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses. An overview of these techniques and others used to stimulate concurrent or retrospective verbal reports in qualitative health research interviews is provided in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. For example, in the think-aloud technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], participants verbalise all thoughts that come into their mind while actually performing a decision task. As a real-time approach, this may give more valid information than retrospective CSR. However, in acute clinical settings, it can slow down the decision process, is time-consuming and intrusive for participants, and can interfere with thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Case vignettes are a safe approach to explore decision-making but difficulties arise in determining the relationship between beliefs in a hypothetical situation and actions in real practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par47">The limited use of chart-stimulated recall in clinical research to date undersells its potential to explore clinical decision-making. It can add specificity to qualitative interview data, bridge the gap between real and perceived practice, and facilitate a deeper exploration of cognitive reasoning. However, although CSR reduces some biases, it introduces others and a number of challenges lie ahead if CSR is to be adopted on a wider scale.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec32"><p>
