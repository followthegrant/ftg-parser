However, each of these techniques has their own disadvantages and limitations. Tissue engineering emerged as a solution to challenge these limitations with the primary objective to regenerate structural and functional tissue, using living cells in combination with scaffold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>. Tissue engineering revolves around an important concept, <italic>i.e</italic>. to mimic the structure and physiological function of the tissue concern. Three key elements in recreating the living tissue are progenitor cells of the tissue concerned, biomaterial as cell carrier and tissue scaffolding, and growth factors. In bone tissue engineering, the best osteoprogenitor sources are a debatable issue. Angela <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, have shown that periosteum provides a rich source of osteoprogenitor cells that readily proliferate and lay down bone. However, bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell is still the method of choice due to limited availability of periosteal tissue.</p><p>The ability of particular materials to serve as a scaffold on which bone cells can attach, proliferate, and mineralized is called osteoconduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>. It has been shown that a complete supply of calcium and phosphate source is crucial during the bone regeneration phase. Lacking in mineralization, the tissue formed will be void of mechanical strength. Hence calcium phosphate ceramics are gaining popularity as implants alone or as the biomaterial for tissue-engineered bone construct. These biomaterials are considered bioactive due to its active interaction with normal bone surfaces during bone regeneration, hence allowing osteointergration of the biomaterial and bone interface. This is important in bone tissue regeneration as the bone undergoes dynamic tissue remodelling during regeneration process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>.</p><p>Calcium phosphate and its analogues, hydroxyapatite (HA), the crystalline form of calcium phosphate being the predominant form, constitute 60-70 per cent of bone tissues and provide mechanical strength to the tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>. Both synthetic and naturally occurring HA and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) have been used for orthopaedic applications. Tricalcium phosphate is a tertiary calcium phosphate also known as bone ash [Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]. It serves as a rich source for calcium and phosphorus, which can be easily assimilated and absorbed. Beta-tricalcium phosphate is highly biocompatible and creates a resorbable interlocking network within the defect site to promote healing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>.</p><p>We have developed a living three-dimensional (3D) bone construct that comprises living bone cells in active mineralization phase that forms bone at <italic>in vivo</italic> ectopic sites (<italic>e.g</italic>. subcutaneously in nude mice). Three import components in the tissue engineered bone construct are <italic>(i)</italic> living bone cells that can be harvested by a simple bone marrow aspiration from the iliac crest without any open surgery, <italic>(ii)</italic> sheep plasma-derived fibrin from the sheep blood to be used as an effective cell carrier and a rich source of growth factors to promote cell growth and differentiation, and <italic>(iii)</italic> a porous ceramic scaffold with constituents similar to the natural bone <italic>i.e</italic>. calcium and phosphate, which is osteoinductive and resorbes slowly over time as it is being replaced by newly formed bone. This study was undertaken to investigate the potential of HA or TCP/HA scaffold seeded with osteogenic induced sheep marrow cells (SMC) for bone tissue engineering.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p>The commercial HA and TCP/HA (G. Surgiwear Limited Shahjahanpur, India) used in the study had the following characteristics: HA: derived from natural sources with average granule size of 1.8-3.0 mm. TCP/HA: synthetic with 80 per cent TCP and 20 per cent HA and an average granule size of 1.5-3.0 mm.</p><p><italic>Isolation of sheep marrow cell</italic>: Six healthy sheep each weighing between 15 and 20 kg, were used. The study protocol was approved by the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Animal Ethical Committee (UKMAEC) with the approval number ORTHO/2003/TAN/22-SEPTEMBER/122. Sheep marrow cells (SMC) were obtained by iliac crest aspiration. The animals were anaesthetized and under sterile conditions, a 16-gauge Jamshidi needle (Cardinal Health, Dublin, Ireland) was used to aspirate 12-15 ml of bone marrow. SMCs were collected into two 20 ml syringes, each containing 1.5 ml of heparinized (250 units/ml) saline solution. The syringes were detached and inverted several times to ensure mixing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>. The suspension was centrifuged at 180 g for 5 min and the supernatant removed. The bone marrow was mixed with osteogenic medium and seeded in two 75 cm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks (Orange Scientific, Belgium). The osteogenic medium contained high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high-glucose DMEM) (GIBCO Laboratories, USA) supplemented with 10 per cent foetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), glutamine (1 mM), penicillin G (100 U/ml), streptomycin sulphate (100 &#x003bc;g/ml), 10<sup>-8</sup> M dexamethasone (Sigma, USA), 10 mM sodium &#x003b2;-glycerol phosphate (Sigma) and L-ascorbic acid (50 &#x003bc;g/ml; Sigma). Three-fourths of the culture medium was changed after 5 days, and non adherent cells were removed along with the culture medium. The medium was then replaced twice weekly. When the SMC became nearly confluent, the cells were detached and serially sub-cultured<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>.</p><p><italic>Autologus fibrin preparation</italic>: For preparation of autologous fibrin, 20-30 ml sheep blood was collected into a sterile tube containing citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD) solution (2.63% sodium citrate, 0.33% citric acid, 2.32% dextrose, and 0.25% sodium dihydrogen phosphate) with one-ninth volume of the collected blood as an anticoagulant. The blood was centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min, and the upper layer, including plasma and the buffy coat (mostly white blood cells and platelets) was transferred to another tube. To spin down the buffy coat, further centrifugation of the transferred layers was performed at 1500 g for 10 min and once again the upper layer was transferred to a new tube using 0.2 &#x003bc;m-syringe filter for sterility. This final volume of fibrin obtained was 10-15 ml. This fibrin was used directly or stored in -20&#x000b0;C until further usage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Bone construct preparation</italic>: After 21 days, passage 1 (P1) cell culture were rinsed twice with phosphate buffer saline solution, lifted with 2 ml of 0.2 per cent trypsin, concentrated by centrifugation at 180 g for 10 min, and diluted to 1 ml of SMC suspension (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) in sheep plasma for seeding into ceramic grafts. HA and TPA with HA (TCP/HA) scaffolds were first pre-wetted with sheep plasma; 5-6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> SMCs were then mixed with 1 ml of sheep plasma and dropped onto pre-wetted scaffolds. Polymerization of fibrin in the plasma was initiated by adding 25 &#x003bc;l 250 mM calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>). HA and TCP/HA scaffold mixed with SMC and fibrin are known as HA-SMC construct and TCP/HA-SMC construct<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>.</p><p><italic>In vitro HA-SMC and TCP/HA-SMC induction</italic>: HA-SMC and TCP/HA-SMC constructs were immersed into osteogenic medium for osteogenic induction and differentiation for 3 wk before being harvested. Medium was charged every 2 and 3 days in the culture plate. Samples were evaluated by histology and gene expression analysis. Porous TCP/HA consisting of hydroxyapatite (20%) and tricalcium phosphate (80%) with 60-70 per cent porosity of 1,5-3.00 mm and HA with the same porosity and a mean pore size 1.8-3.0 mm was used<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>.</p><p><italic>Bone construct implantation</italic>: HA-SMC and TCP/HA-SMC constructs were implanted subcutaneously on both sides of the dorsum of nude mice (n=6) age ranged 8-12 wk under general anaesthesia using 50 mg/ml ketamine, 20 mg/ml xylazil and 50 mg/ml zoletil; dosage given, 0.2 ml/kg. All mice were monitered weekly. All the insicion sites were applied with a bactroban antiseptic until these dried and healed completely.

Specimens were cut into the sizes of 1 cm<sup>3</sup> slices, which were immediately transferred into small vials, immersed in primary fixation, 2.5 per cent glutaraldehyde for at least 24 h at 4&#x000b0;C. This was followed by three changes of 0.1M sodium cacodylate solution for 10 min each. The samples were then post-fixed with 1 per cent osmium tetraoxide for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Next, the samples were dehydrated into a series of gradual increasing gradient of acetone (35, 50, 75, 95% for 10 min each and 3 changes in 100 per cent for 15 min). Once dehydrated, samples were transferred into specimen basket immersed in 100 per cent acetone, ready to be dried in critical point dryer (Baltec 030 CPD, Liechtenstein, Switzerland) for approximately 30 min. Samples were then mounted onto aluminum stub and sputter-coated with Au/Pd and viewed under scanning electron microscope (LEO 1455 Variable Pressure SEM, Carl Zeiss, Germany) in high pressure mode of 15 kV accelerating voltage. Samples were mounted into a stub using double-sided carbon tape, aided with stereomicroscope before sputter-coated (Polaron E5100 sputter coater, Milan, Italy) with gold-palladium.

The efficiency and specificity of each primer set was confirmed with standard curve (Ct value versus serial dilution of total RNA) and melting profile evaluation. Real-time PCR reaction was performed with 100 ng of total RNA, 400 nM of each primer and iScript One-Step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction.

Immunohistochemistry of type 1 collagen was positive. In the present study, we achieved similar results by detecting the mineralization area via Alizarin Red. Intense Alizarin Red staining in seeded scaffolds suggested higher matrix mineralization. The observed calcified nodules were formed within the pores of the scaffolds, revealing cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction during differentiation. Moreover, H&#x00026;E and Alizarin Red staining showed large scale of new bone formation in our seeded scaffolds, TCP/HA-SMC construct compared to the HA-SMC construct. However, both ceramic-SMC constructs still exhibited ceramics residue due to short incubation period. The TCP/HA-SMC construct showed greater new bone formation in both the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> systems compared to HA-SMCs. Less bone formation showed in HA-SMCs constructs with some granule residues can be seen on the scaffolds.</p><p>Bone formation is a dynamic process and requires an understanding of how bone cells interact with its surroundings. This study demonstrated the behaviour of bone cells in the process of adhesion, growth, collagen synthesis and calcification characteristics. There are two types of proteins in bone extracellular matrix: the collagens, mostly type I collagen, which account for 90 per cent of the bone matrix proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> and the noncollagenous proteins, including osteocalcin and osteopontin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>. Osteocalcin, the most abundant noncollagenous protein of the mineralized bone matrix, binds calcium and plays an important role in matrix mineralization, and represents the later state of osteoblastic differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>. Osteopontin is a highly sulphated, phosphorylated, and glycosylated protein that mediates cell attachment through a RGD motif (RGD is the single letter code for arginine-glycine-aspartate) to extracellular matrices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>. Due to its highly negatively charged characteristics, osteopontin can sequester calcium ions while conserving polyglutamate regions, which have hydroxyapatite crystal nucleation potential<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>. In the absence of osteocalcin, osteopontin could contribute to an overall metabolic shift toward new bone formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>. Induction of osteoblastic differentiation by osteogenic medium also leads to the expression of both noncollagenous proteins, (osteocalcin and osteopontin) and collagen type I. These noncollagenous protein and collagen type I are major components for ECM deposition. Our findings showed evidence of bone formation as indicated by expression of collagen type I and osteopontin in these osteogenic-inducing cells in this study. These genes are related to bone extracellular matrix formation. Initially it was thought that the SMC in a ceramics construct form gradually lost its phenotypes during the process of <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation. However, it was found that the SMC retained its phenotypes and it was highly expressed in the SMC-TCP/HA construct compared to the HA-SMC construct.</p><p>In SEM analysis, it was observed that mineralization had taken place in the two different types of constructs. The mechanism of bone formation in TCP/HA-SMC bone constructs underwent a physiological process known as collagen calcification in disoriented manner. Development of osteoblast along osteogenic pathway was reported to progress along the development of extracellular matrix in three phases; cell proliferation with ECM secretion, maturation and finally mineralization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>. The mechanism of calcification in HA-SMC constructs differed in a few ways. Flattened cells could be seen gradually transforming into mineralized sheet formation. Similar results have been earlier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>. Various calcified accretion were formed from these mineralized sheets which broke off to fuse with other nodules to produce the overall bone-like matrix. However, this phenomenon occurred in a small region of the HA-SMC constructs.</p><p>The sheep fibrin prepared in our laboratory was found to be a suitable cell carrier and acted as a temporary scaffold for the formation of stable constructs in bone tissue engineering. It fulfilled the criteria of being biocompatible, osteoinductive and resorbable<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>. Due to lack of mechanical strength, its usage may be limited to non-load bearing or minor bone defects. Torigoe <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> investigated the effect of autologous fibrin and bone marrow on &#x003b2;-tricalcium phosphate on a monkey ectopic bone formation model. They found that autologous plasma efficiently promotes osteogenesis. Thus, in our laboratory we developed the engineered bone tissue with addition of autologous plasma incorporated with calcium phosphate granule due for implantation. We also created a system that eliminated the addition of bovine thrombin as used in other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>. This reduces the risk of immune rejection after transplantation and the risk of contamination.</p><p>In conclusion, TCP-HA appears to be a scaffold of choice for bone tissue engineering based on the ideal surface for attachment and synthesis of matrix.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This study was supported by the IRPA grants 06-02-02-0059-EA292 and 06-02-02-003
