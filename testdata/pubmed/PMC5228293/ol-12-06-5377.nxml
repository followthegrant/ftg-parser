Following the publication of this article, an interested reader drew to our attention that two Figures (Figs. 1 and 2) and one Table (Table II) featured in the above-named article had also appeared, either in their entirety or in part, in our previous publication in Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention: Xian SL, Cao W, Zhang XD and Lu YF: Inhibitory effects of 3-bromopyruvate on human gastric cancer implant tumors in nude mice. Asian Pac J Cancer Prev 15 3175&#x02013;3178, 2014.</p><p>We had intended that the paper published in Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention focused on the observed phenomenon, and the paper in Oncology Letters (a subsequent study) explored details of the mechanism. However, we realize that our submission to Oncology Letters was in breach of the requirement that a submitted paper should represent &#x02018;an original study presenting novel work, that it has not been previously submitted to or accepted by any other journal&#x02019;. The paper was submitted to Oncology Letters 2 months after the submission of the preceding paper to Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, where it was under consideration for publication at that time. Therefore, we are going to retract the paper from Oncology Letters. All the named authors agree to this retraction. We sincerely apologize for this mistake, and thank the reader of our article who drew this matter to our attention. Furthermore, we regret any inconvenience this mistake has caused.</p></body></article>
