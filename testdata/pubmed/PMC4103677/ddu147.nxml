Biochemical analyses demonstrated that loss of heparanase 2 led to upregulation of fibroblast growth factor 2/phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase signalling and to alterations in levels of transcripts encoding neural- and muscle-associated molecules. Thus, a key role of heparanase 2 is to buffer growth factor signalling in motor neuron development.

It is characterized by incomplete bladder emptying during micturition. This is associated with a dyssynergia in which the urethral walls contract at the same time as the detrusor smooth muscle in the body of the bladder (<xref rid="DDU147C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Through post-natal life, individuals with UFS can suffer from urinary incontinence, urosepsis, damaged kidneys and, ultimately, renal failure. UFS is also characterized by an abnormal facial expression upon smiling, typically with downturned lateral aspects of the mouth (<xref rid="DDU147C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DDU147C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Individuals with UFS have nocturnal lagophthalmos, the lack of complete eyelid closure during sleep (<xref rid="DDU147C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and a more marked bilateral weakness in the distribution of the facial nerve has been reported (<xref rid="DDU147C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Newman (<xref rid="DDU147C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) noted that 150 affected individuals with UFS had been reported in the medical literature available to 2013. The condition, however, may be underreported because the clinical severity is variable. For example, in families with more than one affected member, existing individuals have sometimes only been designated as having UFS after their more severely affected sibling was diagnosed. The congenital nature of certain aspects of the syndrome is evidenced by the fact that UFS newborns have a distorted expression when crying and, moreover, lower urinary tract dysmorphology (e.g. hydronephrosis and an enlarged bladder) can present before birth (<xref rid="DDU147C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Thus, at least some clinical features of UFS should be regarded manifestations of abnormal development.</p><p>In 2010, we and others showed that biallelic mutations in <italic>heparanase 2</italic> (<italic>HPSE2</italic>) cause UFS (<xref rid="DDU147C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), with further cases subsequently reported (<xref rid="DDU147C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Most <italic>HPSE2</italic> mutations in UFS are predicted to be null mutations, with only one missense mutation reported to date (<xref rid="DDU147C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The severity of urinary tract and facial features varies among family members with the same mutation (<xref rid="DDU147C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). <italic>HPSE2</italic> codes for heparanase 2, a protein with 44% identity and 59% similarity to the endoglycosidase heparanase (for clarity, henceforth referred to as heparanase 1), encoded by <italic>HPSE1</italic> (<xref rid="DDU147C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Heparanase 1 catalyses the cleavage of heparan sulphate (HS) sidechains from HS proteoglycans (HSPGs), cell surface and extracellular matrix macromolecules that bind to growth factors and structural matrix proteins, thereby regulating their activities (<xref rid="DDU147C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). For example, heparanase 1 enhances fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) availability (<xref rid="DDU147C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and signalling (<xref rid="DDU147C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), the latter evidenced by increased amounts of phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (pERK; <xref rid="DDU147C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Mammalian heparanase 2 lacks endoglycosidase activity but it binds HS with a higher affinity than heparanase 1, inhibiting heparanase 1 activity by sequestering HSPG targets and preventing HS-mediated cellular uptake of heparanase 1, required for its enzymatic activation within lysosomes (<xref rid="DDU147C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>In 2013, we identified biallelic mutations in <italic>leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 2</italic> (<italic>LRIG2</italic>) in UFS families lacking <italic>HPSE2</italic> mutations (<xref rid="DDU147C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; OMIM #615112). As for most mutations in <italic>HPSE2</italic>, <italic>LRIG2</italic> mutations are predicted to be null (reviewed in <xref rid="DDU147C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). <italic>LRIG2</italic> encodes leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 2 (LRIG2), one of a family of three mammalian LRIGs (<xref rid="DDU147C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). LRIGs are transmembrane proteins which, based mostly from studies on LRIG1, are considered to modulate growth factor signalling by controlling receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) turnover (<xref rid="DDU147C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DDU147C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Notably, clinical phenotypes are indistinguishable between <italic>HPSE2</italic>- and <italic>LRIG2</italic>-linked UFS so the encoded proteins are likely to have overlapping functions in development. It is plausible that, based on the limited published data regarding functions of heparanase 2 and LRIG2, clinical features of UFS arise from dysregulated actions of growth factors which bind RTKs and signal through ERK phosphorylation.</p><p>The exact cell types which are affected by <italic>HPSE2</italic> and <italic>LRIG2</italic> mutations in UFS are currently undefined, although a neurogenic basis for the syndrome has long been postulated (<xref rid="DDU147C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The UFS bladder resembles a dysfunctional &#x02018;neurogenic&#x02019; organ which can result from spinal cord injury, yet UFS individuals lack overt spinal lesions (<xref rid="DDU147C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>; reviewed in <xref rid="DDU147C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Ochoa (<xref rid="DDU147C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) speculated that both the bladder and facial features of UFS were explained by one brainstem lesion affecting both the VII nerve nucleus supplying facial skeletal muscles and also the micturition centre that modulates bladder emptying. However, others (<xref rid="DDU147C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) suggested that UFS bladder dysfunction as well as constipation, a variable feature of the syndrome, both result from defects in sacral spinal cord nuclei which send motor axons to skeletal muscle in the external bladder and anal sphincters. We recently showed that transcripts for both UFS genes are present in healthy mammalian bladders; moreover, HPSE2 and LRIG2 proteins were immunodetected in nerve fascicles growing into muscle layers of human foetal bladder walls (<xref rid="DDU147C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These latter observations provide evidence that peripheral nerves are involved in UFS.</p><p>In the current study, we generated a Xenopus model to begin to define the biological roles of heparanase 2 in vertebrate development. The data show that, in this species, this UFS molecule is required for the functional development of motor nerves emerging from the truncal neural tube. These results support the hypothesis that peripheral neuropathy is a key element of the human UFS clinical phenotype. Furthermore, we present evidence that depletion of heparanase 2 in frog embryos is associated with upregulation of <italic>fgf2</italic> and pERK, consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>HPSE2</italic> encodes a molecule which regulates actions of growth factors during normal development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> heparanase 2</title><p>Using the tblastn tool and the human heparanase 2 amino acid sequence, we searched the <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> genome project database (JGI) for a putative heparanase 2 orthologue. We identified a 569 amino acid fragment match with homology from amino acid 24 of the human protein to the stop codon. From the corresponding Xenopus genomic sequence, we identified an in-frame ATG start codon starting 33 bp upstream and positioned 51 bp downstream of an in-frame stop codon; we annotated this ATG as the start codon for Xenopus heparanase 2, and this prediction concurs with that of Gnomon, the NCBI gene prediction tool (XM_002937183.2).</p><p>Synteny analysis of the region of the Xenopus genome encoding the putative heparanase 2 orthologue (Metazome; data not shown) revealed a syntenic block encompassing at least 15 genes (centred at <italic>SLC25A28</italic>/<italic>GOT1</italic>/<bold><italic>HPSE2</italic></bold>/<italic>HPS1</italic>/<italic>LOXL4</italic>) conserved between Xenopus, human and mouse genome sequences. Direct comparison of the human and Xenopus genomic sequences revealed perfect conservation of exon/intron boundaries (data not shown). This analysis confirms the identification of a Xenopus orthologue for heparanase 2.</p><p>At the protein level, Xenopus heparanase 2 has 580 amino acids and shares 80% identity and 88% similarity with human heparanase 2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F1">1</xref>), consistent with the proteins having conserved evolutionary function. The first 80 amino acids in the human N-terminal region show low conservation with the Xenopus sequence; however, these regions are predicted to be signal peptides in both proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F1">1</xref>, black bar; Interpro). Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F1">1</xref> also details predicted HS-binding domains (orange bars) and glycosylation sites (blue diamonds) conserved between Xenopus, human and mouse heparanase 2. Full-length Xenopus, human and mouse heparanase 2 proteins contain the sequence His335_Tyr337 (equivalent to heparanase 1 His296_Tyr298), in which the tyrosine residue has been implicated in HS substrate binding (<xref rid="DDU147C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Asn543 in heparanase 2 is also conserved between the three species. This residue has been proposed to be functionally important in HS binding (<xref rid="DDU147C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and has undergone a missense mutation in a human UFS family (<xref rid="DDU147C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Based on homology with human heparanase 1 and heparanase 2 and using the Interpro database, we identified a region of homology to glycoside hydrolase family 79, the endoglycosidase enzymatic region in heparanase 1. Full-length human heparanase 2 contains certain key features associated with active heparanase 1 (<xref rid="DDU147C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), e.g. the proton donor Glu258 (Glu243 in heparanase 1) and a putative nucleophile Glu380 (Glu343 in heparanase 1). Heparanase 2 Glu380, however, has a 1 amino acid shift when aligned with heparanase 1 and this may be why human heparanase 2 lacks endo-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucuronidase activity (<xref rid="DDU147C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Interestingly, Xenopus heparanase 2 lacks a Glu residue in this location, suggesting that it too lacks enzymatic activity.

A custom-designed antibody to heparanase 2 was used (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F1">1</xref>, immunizing peptide annotated in green) and the arising immunostaining signals, as ascertained in Stage 40 embryo sections, were abolished by pre-incubation of this antibody with the immunizing peptide (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F2">2</xref>B and C), thus demonstrating signal specificity. As assessed by bright field IHC in Stage 30 embryo sections, heparanase 2 was detected in the neural tube in a ventrolateral pattern excluding the floorplate, and in the notochord and flanking myotomes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F2">2</xref>D). A similar pattern was found for LRIG2 at Stage 30, with this protein additionally present in the dorsal part of the neural tube but less prominent in the notochord (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F2">2</xref>E). At Stage 40, heparanase 2 immunostaining remained prominent in developing skeletal muscles, but the neural tube signal was less prominent than at Stage 30 (compare Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F2">2</xref>B with D). Heparanase 2 was immunodetected in the apical zone/luminal surface of gut epithelium at Stage 42 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F2">2</xref>E and F), a time point after the archenteron has undergone coiling. These expression data demonstrate the presence of both heparanase 2 and LRIG2 in the developing neural tube and skeletal muscle of the Xenopus embryo, providing circumstantial evidence supporting the hypothesis that a common neuromuscular developmental functional pathway is mediated by these two molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Dynamic developmental expression of heparanase 2 in the neural tube</title><p>To refine the anatomical localization of heparanase 2, co-immunofluorescence was performed between Stages 30 and 42 with antibodies to mark specific cell types.

The 5 ng dose of MO1 led to a near-complete loss of heparanase 2 on immunostaining (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F4">4</xref>D). Embryos injected with 5 ng MO1 were incubated to tadpole stages and three main phenotypes were observed, reproducible over numerous sets of injections. The first phenotype, apparent in approximately two-thirds of MO1-administered embryos, concerned hypomotility (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F4">4</xref>E). Embryos injected with CTL MO hatched normally at Stages 26&#x02013;28, displaying the appropriate physical reflexes (the &#x02018;hatching reflex&#x02019;) to facilitate this process, and thereafter responded to touching either the head or the tail by swimming away (the &#x02018;escape reflex&#x02019;). In contrast, those injected with 5 ng MO1 hatched late, around Stage 35, with embryos continuing to elongate within their enveloping embryonic membrane prior to hatching. Morphants lacked both the hatching reflex and later, the escape reflex. These defects were also noted at the lower MO1 dose of 2.5 ng, which did not generate the gut or tail defects, described below. In embryos with these skeletal muscle motility defects, blood continued to circulate, indicating intact heart muscle function.</p><p>Secondly, about two-thirds of MO1-administered embryos had a gut which lacked normal coiling; instead the organ remained as an ovoid mass (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F4">4</xref>E and F), as normally found in the undifferentiated archenteron (<xref rid="DDU147C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This phenotype was associated with a protruding proctodeum (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F4">4</xref>F) but the shape of the cloaca appeared grossly normal (data not shown). Furthermore, imaging pronephric tubules and ducts did not reveal any gross anatomical anomalies (data not shown) nor were embryos oedematous (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F4">4</xref>F). Thirdly, each embryo with a gut defect also displayed dorsal kinking of its tail (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F4">4</xref>E and F). The gut and tail defects were found in &#x0003c;5% of embryos administered CTL MO, and CTL MO embryos never had motility defects (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F5">5</xref>E). The incidence of each of the three (i.e. motility, gut and tail) phenotypes in the 5 ng MO1 morphants versus embryos administered CTL MO was highly significant (Fisher's exact test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Eleven percent of embryos administered CTL MO and 16% of those administered MO1 showed non-specific effects (data not shown; <italic>P</italic> = 0.38). Injection of 5 ng of MO1 proved lethal beyond Stage 41, possibly as result of the complete failure of gut formation/patterning. The motility, gut and tail defects were replicated upon administration of either MO2 targeting the exon 2 splice donor site or the ATG MO (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F4">4</xref>A; data not shown), supporting the specificity of the MO1 effects.

Separate sets of control and morphant embryos were then analysed (data not shown); two further sets at Stage 32/33 confirmed that heparanase 2 knockdown was associated with increased pERK/tERK, and another set at 40/41 showed similar levels between the two groups. Collectively, the results show a constant pattern of upregulation of pERK signalling between Stages 30 and 36, when truncal motor nerves are normally becoming functionally active, correlating with increasing embryonic motility.

These descriptive observations, coupled with the upregulation of pERK in heparanase 2 knock-down embryos, support the hypothesis that, in normal development, heparanase 2 downregulates pERK in the ventrolateral neural tube.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate <italic>in vivo</italic> developmental roles for heparanase 2 in any model organism and is also the first to shed light on the pathogenic biological mechanisms underpinning the clinical features of UFS. Specifically, in <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>, we demonstrated that heparanase 2 is required for functional peripheral neural development and that it modulates growth factor signalling during embryogenesis. In turn, these results support the contention that congenital peripheral neuropathy is a key feature of UFS.</p><p>By bioinformatic analyses, we identified the Xenopus orthologue of human heparanase 2. The protein is extensively conserved between frog, mouse and human, consistent with conserved functions between diverse species. Although we identified a domain in Xenopus heparanase 2 with homology to the glycosyl hydrolase domain of heparanase 1 (also present in human heparanase 2), the substitution of key residues required for degradation of HSPGs suggests that, like human heparanase 2 (<xref rid="DDU147C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), Xenopus heparanase 2 lacks this enzymatic activity.</p><p>In biochemical assays, heparanase 2 can act as an inhibitor of heparanase 1 enzymatic activity (<xref rid="DDU147C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We therefore examined the temporal expression of <italic>hpse</italic> genes in developing Xenopus embryos. <italic>hpse2</italic> transcripts were not present at Stage 1 but were detectable at Stages 15 and 20, and became prominent at Stages 30 and 40. <italic>hpse1</italic> transcripts were maternally expressed and robust levels were detected at all time points assessed between Stages 15 and 45, the limit of the study. We demonstrated that, at Stage 30, heparanase 2 localizes to the ventrolateral neural tube. Although we did not perform IHC for heparanase 1, immunostaining for this protein in Xenopus embryos in neural tube, somites and gut at Stage 39 has been shown (<xref rid="DDU147C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Thus, the potential for a regulatory role for heparanase 2 on heparanase 1 activity exists from neurulation stages onwards, within the neural tube. The more prominent early expression of <italic>hpse1</italic> in contrast with <italic>hpse2</italic> suggests that heparanase 1 has independent functions in the early embryo. This is supported by the fact that heparanase 1 knockdown in Xenopus is lethal between Stages 17 and 28 (<xref rid="DDU147C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), a developmental time period which corresponds to neural tube formation, and our observation that heparanase 2 knockdown resulted in lethality much later in development (Stage 41). Finally, we observed that knockdown of heparanase 2 results in increased levels of <italic>hpse1</italic> transcripts. Hence, a normal function of heparanase 2 may be directly or indirectly downregulate the transcription of <italic>hpse1</italic>. Such an effect would provide a second molecular &#x02018;brake&#x02019; on heparanase 1 activity in addition to the already established direct biochemical blockade on this protein conferred by heparanase 2 (<xref rid="DDU147C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Heparanase 2 knock-down Xenopus embryos lacked hatching and escape reflexes. Such morphants possessed motor nerves, which emanated from the truncal neural tube at regular intervals as normal. Moreover, although the average length of these nerves running along the inside surface of the myotome was shorter in morphants than in controls, the difference did not reach statistical significance. Conversely, it was clear that motor nerve paths were more meandering in morphants and that the axons in these nerves were less compactly bundled than in control embryos. These results demonstrate that heparanase 2 is required for motor neuron development and/or function.</p><p>In embryonic frogs, the outgrowth of motor axons is mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor but their functional maturation, involving lateral filopodia formation and synapsing with nascent skeletal muscle cells, is modulated by FGF2 derived from myotome cells (<xref rid="DDU147C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Heparanase 2 is present in the ventrolateral neural tube of Xenopus embryos (this study), the zone containing cell bodies whose motor neuron axons are becoming functional (<xref rid="DDU147C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In addition, somite-derived myotomes contain heparanase 2. We therefore analysed FGF2 expression and activity, using the surrogate marker of pERK/tERK ratio, in heparanase 2 morphants. Heparanase 2 knockdown led to increased levels of <italic>fgf2</italic> transcripts at Stages 32 and 40. We also detected pERK+ nuclei in the lateral zones of the neural tube, overlapping heparanase 2 protein, and the pERK/tERK ratio was markedly increased in heparanase 2 morphants between Stages 31 and 36. FGF2 is also implicated in the induction of <italic>olig2</italic> (<xref rid="DDU147C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), a transcription factor that defines the motor neuron progenitor domain of the ventrolateral neural tube, from where motor neurons and oligodendrocytes are sequentially generated (<xref rid="DDU147C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>); we identified, at Stage 40, a modest upregulation of <italic>olig2</italic>. Moreover, <italic>nkx6.1</italic>, encoding another transcription factor functional in motor nerve precursors (<xref rid="DDU147C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), was also increased at Stage 40. Hence, downregulation of heparanase 2 leads to an upregulation of FGF2 bioactivity. We speculate that this upregulation of FGF2 bioactivity in response to reduced heparanase 2 proceeds indirectly via heparanase 1, given that heparanase 1 has established effects on FGF2 signalling and levels of pERK (<xref rid="DDU147C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DDU147C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Putting all the historic and current experimental observations together, we conclude that a normal embryonic function of heparanase 2 is to buffer growth factor signalling, including that mediated by FGF2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F8">8</xref>A). When this signalling system is abnormally upregulated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDU147F8">8</xref>B), motor neuron functional development is perturbed resulting in skeletal muscle motility defects.

The most studied member of the LRIG family is LRIG1, which downregulates growth factor RTK signalling (<xref rid="DDU147C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

LRIG2 is permissive for oligodendroglial and glioblastoma-like brain tumour formation in a mouse model (<xref rid="DDU147C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) and downregulation of LRIG2 in cultured glioma cells led to ligand-mediated loss of the epidermal growth factor receptor (an RTK), cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis (<xref rid="DDU147C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>We identified overlapping expression patterns of heparanase 2 and LRIG2 in embryonic frog neural tube and myotomes, consistent with the hypothesis that the proteins are involved in similar biological molecular pathways, as is the fact that biallelic mutation of either gene causes an identical disease in human UFS (<xref rid="DDU147C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Knockdown of heparanase 2 caused a small increase in levels of <italic>lrig2</italic> in whole embryos. Thus, it is possible that the two genes/proteins are involved in a feedback loop or can interact in a redundancy mechanism. It is currently unknown whether a reciprocal relationship exists whereby alterations in LRIG2 expression lead to changes in expression of <italic>hpse2</italic>. In terms of UFS associated with <italic>HPSE2</italic> mutations, it is possible that pathogenic effects are mediated by LRIG2 dysregulation and studies to test the ability of LRIG2 overexpression/knockdown to rescue the heparanase 2 morphant phenotype in Xenopus can be undertaken in future.

Extrapolating the data presented in the current study, demonstrating a requirement for heparanase 2 for correct peripheral motor neuron functional development in the trunk region, we propose a similar requirement for heparanase 2 in the development of other peripheral motor nerves, including those of the human face and viscera. These would clearly include the facial nerve, corresponding to the abnormal facial movements and weakness (<xref rid="DDU147C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) observed in individuals with UFS. With regard to the bladder and bowel evacuation dysfunction which also feature in the syndrome, consideration must be given to two sets of motor neurons, i.e. somatic pudendal nerves which stimulate constriction of the external sphincters of the bladder and gut, and autonomic nerves which modulate contraction of detrusor and gut smooth muscle (<xref rid="DDU147C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). In fact, both heparanase 2 and LRIG2 have been immunodetected in presumed autonomic nerve trunks in human bladders (<xref rid="DDU147C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), but whether these proteins are also present in external sphincter nerves is unknown. Notably, a human precedent has already been set with respect to a genetic autonomic neuropathy generating congenital bladder dysfunction because mutation of <italic>CMRM3</italic>, encoding the M3 acetylcholine receptor on detrusor smooth muscle, leads to such a disease (<xref rid="DDU147C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Interestingly, pERK has already been implicated in the neural control of mouse bladders. Levels of pERK are upregulated in the L6 spinal cord segment after spinal cord injury in the rat, and concomitant with abnormally high frequencies of bladder contraction; intrathecal administration of PD98059, a specific inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation, reduces the frequency and amplitude of abnormal bladder contractions (<xref rid="DDU147C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Furthermore, injury-induced upregulation of pERK causes increased frequency.</p><p>The embryonic frog is not an appropriate model in which to study mammalian bladder or hindgut dysfunction because the just-formed cloaca simply acts as a passive conduit for excretory products such as pronephric urine. We did, however, note that heparanase 2 is localized to the apical zones of embryonic gut epithelia and that heparanase 2 morphant embryos displayed a lack of normal gut rotation. Heparanase 2 morphants had decreased levels of transcripts encoding a smooth muscle myosin, <italic>myh11</italic>. Intriguingly, we found that levels of <italic>myod1</italic>, encoding a skeletal muscle transcription factor, were increased in heparanase 2 morphants; this may indicate that the myotome, which also normally contains heparanase 2 and which is mildly dysmorphic in heparanase 2 morphants, is also defective when heparanase 2 is lacking. These Xenopus observations point to defects of both classes of muscle and, by analogy, lead to a novel suggestion that, in addition to neural defects, there may also exist aberrations of smooth and skeletal muscle which help to explain the spectrum of clinical disease in UFS.</p><p>The severe kidney disease present in some individuals with UFS (<xref rid="DDU147C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="DDU147C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) may be the result of post-natal damage caused, for example, by ascending bacterial pyelonephritis, a well-documented complication in a subset of patients. However, an alternative, non-exclusive, hypothesis is that some UFS kidney disease represents congenital defects, i.e. aberrant kidney development before birth. A major role of the embryonic amphibian pronephros is to excrete excess water which enters the body via the skin and by ingestion (<xref rid="DDU147C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and thus kidney failure would manifest as oedema. In the current study, heparanase 2 morphant embryonic frogs were not oedematous and they contained pronephric tubules and ducts which did not appear to be malformed. Both observations suggest that heparanase 2 does not have critical roles in structural and functional differentiation of the embryonic pronephros, although subtle effects cannot be excluded. An implication could be that kidney disease in humans with UFS does not have a developmental origin. However, caution is required in such a conclusion because the mammalian adult kidney forms from the metanephric embryonic organ rather than a pronephros.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Embryo culture and microinjection</title><p>Animal experiments were approved by the University's Ethical Review Panel and were undertaken under UK Home Office project licence PPL 40/3550. <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> embryos were obtained and cultured by standard methods (<xref rid="DDU147C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (<xref rid="DDU147C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).
