Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization.</p><p><italic>Pilot 1</italic>: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts.</p><p><italic>Pilot 2</italic>: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems.

A published protocol allows easier comparison between what was originally intended and hypothesized and what was actually done, and it gives readers greater insight into the methodological quality of a study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, it has often been recognized that negative or adverse outcomes are less likely to be published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Publishing the design of a study before its start announces the study will be undertaken, which encourages publication of the results and in any case informs researchers where they can find the data for inclusion in systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus, publishing a design article can prevent publication bias. In addition, publishing pilot results provides a better insight in the choices for particular instruments and interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary care and elderly</title><p>In the Netherlands all people are registered in a primary care practice and Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) act as gatekeepers to specialist care, whereas for example in the USA most persons are not registered in a primary care practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. There are few barriers to primary care facilities in the Netherlands and in the Netherlands about 86% of older people contact their PCP yearly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Older persons in primary care are, therefore, a good representation of the total older population at risk. Primary care is confronted with increasing numbers of frail elderly because of the aging of the population, and their wish to live independently for as long as possible. Frailty poses a complex problem for primary care. Up to about 20% of the elderly, defined here as those 75 years of age and over are vulnerable for further deterioration of functional abilities and quality of life accompanied by a substantial increased risk of institutionalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This implies an exploding need for care.</p><p>Primary care is insufficiently equipped for a potential explosion of care needs. GPs are often unaware of the health status and functional limitations of their elderly patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Several studies reported a considerable amount of undetected morbidity both among consulting and non-consulting patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, PCPs, as the medically responsible person, do not regard themselves suited for systematic management and long-term monitoring for chronic diseases and disabilities associated with frail health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Proactive detection of care needs in elderly but still competent persons who do not explicitly seek help is at odds with the prevailing reactive paradigm in primary care. However, as perhaps many frail elderly are unaware of the types of help available, there is a need for care experiments with transmural collaboration among health professionals, which might increase the quality of (primary) care for frail persons at home.</p></sec><sec><title>Earlier interventions</title><p>Systematic home visits to frail elderly by nurses can reduce mortality and nursing home admissions provided that a substantial number of home visits are paid and care plans are based on multidimensional assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, accumulating evidence shows that preventive home visits are mostly accompanied by a reduction of health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Both from patient (health gains) and societal (cost savings) perspective this is a desirable situation.</p></sec><sec><title>Frailty and preventive mechanisms</title><p>Frailty is the result of reduced ability to maintain a physiological and psychosocial equilibrium, thereby increasing the risk of functional disability, temporary or permanent loss of the ability to cope, morbidity, and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Frailty is strongly associated with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The potential preventive mechanisms of home visits comprise early detection of worsening health conditions and modifiable risk factors, enabling concerted actions with responsible health professionals to optimize treatment, improve life style and increase support for family caregivers to persevere informal care.</p></sec><sec><title>Costs</title><p>Aging is costly. About one third of the health care expenditures in industrialized countries relate to persons 70 years or older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Nursing homes, homes for the elderly and hospital beds are occupied mainly by elderly. Elderly are massive consumers of medication. Elderly consume most home care. When the number and portion of (frail) elderly increases the health care costs will explode. Among community dwelling elderly with usual care the median annual nursing home and hospital admission rate is 2.4% (range 0&#x02013;40%) respectively 26% (range 5&#x02013;56%). Among frail elderly median annual admission rates are 15% and 45% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients.

Data on resource use are collected in several ways: self report questionnaires, hospital and nursing home registration, and community pharmacy records. Only direct healthcare costs will be considered such as costs of consultations of the general practitioner, nursing home physician, medical specialist, hospitalizations, and medical department of the nursing home, and use of medication and medical aids. Medication data are retrieved from the centralized pharmacy files in the research region. If available, Dutch guideline prices are used to value resource use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Otherwise, tariffs are used. Medication costs are valued using prices of the Royal Dutch Society for Pharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Contacts with GPs and referrals will be checked as well in GPs' patient information files.</p><sec><title>Cost analysis</title><p>To compare costs between the two groups, confidence intervals for the differences in mean costs are calculated using bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrapping with 5000 replications. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] For the cost-effectiveness analysis the difference in total costs between the intervention and usual care group are compared with the difference over 18 months in improvement of quality of life, reduced institutionalization, hospitalization and mortality. In addition, a cost-utility analysis will be done to assess the incremental costs per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY). Uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios is calculated using the bias-corrected percentile method (5000 replications) and presented in a cost-effectiveness plane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Patient outcome analysis</title><p>QALYs are calculated by multiplying the utility based on EQ-5D scores with the amount of time a patient spent in this particular health state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

The main study main study holds unique elements. The intervention concerns pro-active care that should guarantee timely detection of patients with frailer health, followed by structured nurse-led care focusing on patients. It focuses on the client as well as on the system around the client. The nurses use the Resident Assessment Instrument; a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol that, by computerization, triggers health risks and, hereby, guides care planning.</p><p>The main study achieved a substantial response on the postal COOP-WONCA screening. In our pilot study, home visits by nurses were regarded to have potential for quality of care improvement. Point of concern was the inadequate selection of frail patients by the PCPs. Also, the assessment protocol used by the nurses provided no triggers on when actions should follow. In a second pilot study, the COOP-WONCA emerged as the most feasible postal screener compared to vulnerable elders survey (VES-13) and the Frailty screening list of Strawbridge. Our selection rule identified a frail group.</p><p>Limitations to the generalizability of our future findings are firstly the non-response to the mailed health survey. A number of persons (n = 100) responded but did not want to participate because of their good health. We remain uncertain about other non-responders being frailer and perhaps in greater need of nurse support. In future projects alternative means for health screening may be tested in older PCP patients such as contacting consulting patients. Secondly, our RAI assessment demanded a structured approach of computer skilled persons. The computer skills of the nurses were rather limited which led to extensive additional training. Some nurses had difficulties with the computerized assessments and disliked the structured format in which the assessment took place. Thirdly, we remain uncertain about the best frailty measure to identify persons that can benefit most from preventive actions. We selected the COOP-WONCA because of its broad health definition and very good feasibility. Last, whether PCPs remain blind for group assignment during he follow up remains to be seen. It is possible that the regular contacts with the nurses will reveal some of the assignments.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HPJvH, GN and HWJvM designed the study.
