The higher rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion of LdT treatment than other anti-HBV agents suggests a potential immunomodulatory effect. The aim of the study was to investigate the changes of regulatory T cell (Treg)/interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4+T helper (Th17) balance during LdT treatment and to discuss the relationship of Treg/Th17 balance with HBeAg change in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving LdT antiviral treatment. Twenty-seven HBeAg-positive CHB patients received LdT for 24 weeks and the percentages of Tregs and cells (Th17 cells) in peripheral blood as well as the serum TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-17 levels in these patients were longitudinally analyzed. We found that the frequencies of Tregs and Th17 cells in peripheral blood as well as the serum TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-17 levels increased significantly in CHB patients compared with healthy controls. During the LdT treatment, the Tregs frequency and TGF-&#x003b2;1 level tended to decrease, and Th17 cells frequency and IL-17 level showed a reverse &#x0201c;V&#x0201d;-type change. The frequency of Tregs and the ratio of Treg/Th17 were significantly lower in the HBeAg loss group than those in the HBeAg no-loss group at the baseline. More important, the Tregs frequency and TGF-&#x003b2;1 level were both positively correlated with HBeAg level during the LdT treatment for 24 weeks. Our data suggest that the lower Tregs frequency and Treg/Th17 ratio at the baseline of LdT treatment, the more likely to get the HBeAg loss. HBeAg negative can be predicted using changes in Tregs frequency and TGF-&#x003b2;1 level during LdT treatment in CHB patients. Maybe we could provide the immunology marker for exploring the mechanism of the higher HBeAg seroconversion rate of LdT therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>chronic hepatitis B</kwd><kwd>HBeAg positive</kwd><kwd>telbivudine</kwd><kwd>Th17 cells</kwd><kwd>Tregs</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious threat to human health. Approximately 2 billion people have been infected with HBV, and more than 370 million patients worldwide are chronically infected. Hepatitis B is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma and accounts for about 1 million deaths annually.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>HBV is a noncytopathic, hepatotropic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus that induces a series of host immune responses, resulting in progressive inflammatory liver damage.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> The immune response between the host and virus can affect the clinical outcome of HBV infection and clinical antiviral therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> CD4+T cells play an important role in the induction and maintenance of specific T-cell immunity to clear viral infection.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) exhibit a weak or undetectable virus-specific T-cell response.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> This T-cell hyporesponsiveness is associated with high viral and/or antigen load in patients with CHB.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Nucleos(t)ide analogs can effectively suppress HBV replication, alleviate liver injury, and decelerate disease progression. Nevertheless, patients with CHB exhibit varied responses to these drugs, which is related to the immune status of the host.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>An immune disorder or imbalance exists in patients with CHB. Helper CD4+T cells can orchestrate host immune responses by releasing distinct cytokine profiles. Recent studies have described 2 additional subsets, namely, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4+T helper (Th17) cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> The reciprocal relationships between T-helper subsets and the outcome of anti-HBV therapy have also been reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Tregs effectively inhibit other immune cells by secreting cytokines TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-10 to mediate immune tolerance and maintain immune balance.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive CHB exhibited a higher percentage of Tregs in their peripheral blood and liver, and the higher percentage of Tregs is positively correlated with HBV-DNA level.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, HBeAg-positive patients exhibit a higher percentage of Tregs in peripheral blood than HBeAg-negative patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Long-term treatment with adefovir dipivoxil or entecavir enhances HBV-specific T-cell immunity and reduces the frequency of Tregs in patients with CHB.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> These findings suggest that Tregs actively participate in regulating anti-HBV responses. Th17 cells, a new discovery subtype of CD4+T cells, are characterized by secreting several kinds of cytokines, such as IL-17A (main effect cytokine), IL-17F, and IL-22. Th17 cells have been shown to play a role in a number of liver diseases, including alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and CHB.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Th17 cells are significantly increased in patients with CHB, and the frequency positively associated with the grade of liver inflammation in the patients, indicated by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Tregs and Th17 cells play a role in suppressing and promoting the inflammatory responses, respectively. Many studies have found that an imbalance between Tregs and Th17 cells is closely related to the development of chronic inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Su et al<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> found that the increase of Tregs was lower than that of Th17 cells in patients with low-to-moderate CHB, which led to a decreased ratio of Treg/Th17 cells. The frequency of Tregs significantly increased in patients with severe CHB, whereas that of Th17 cells slightly increased, resulting in increased ratio of Treg/Th17 cells. Zhang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> also indicated that the Treg/Th17 ratio decreased during the first 3 months of entecavir treatment as the HBV DNA levels were inhibited. These results indicated that the balance of Treg/Th17 plays an important role in mediating the immune response of anti-HBV therapy.</p><p>Telbivudine (LdT), a nucleotide analog, has been used in antiviral treatment of CHB. Available data from clinical trials indicate that LdT is a potent inhibitor of HBV replication and a more efficient inducer of HBeAg seroconversion compared with other antiviral reagents in patients with CHB.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Chen et al<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> demonstrated that LdT treatment enhanced the reconstitution of CD4 response, but also showed a significant enhancement in stimulation of HBV-specific T cells activity and reduced HBV serum titers. LdT treatment also suppressed the programmed death ligand-1 expression in T cells and increased the secretion of IFN-&#x003b3;, which may be attributed to HBeAg seroconversion.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Pan et al<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> found that patients with CHB, whose frequency of peripheral blood Tregs rapidly decreased at the early phase of LdT treatment, could achieve HBeAg seroconversion easily. These studies suggested that the higher HBeAg seroconversion rate of LdT antivirus therapy may be associated with the immunomodulatory activities of this regimen.</p><p>In this study, we performed a longitudinal study to investigate the changes of Treg/Th17 balance during LdT treatment and to discuss the relationship of Treg/Th17 balance with HBeAg change in HBeAg-positive CHB patients receiving LdT antiviral treatment. To provide the immunology marker for exploring the mechanism of the higher HBeAg seroconversion rate of LdT therapy.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>Twenty-seven treatment-naive patients with CHB (20 males and 7 females, aged 22&#x02013;48 years) between September 2012 and September 2013 at the Department of Hepatology from Tianjin Second People's Hospital were enrolled in this study. All patients were consecutively followed up with protocol visits for 24 weeks during the course of the LdT antiviral treatment (600&#x0200a;mg orally per day). The CHB diagnostic criteria were described in detail in a previous study.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> The screening criteria were as follows: all patients with seropositive for hepatitis B surface (HBsAg) for more than 6 months; seropositive for HBeAg; HBV DNA&#x0200a;&#x02265;&#x0200a;10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL; serum ALT level&#x0200a;&#x02265;&#x0200a;twice the upper limit of the normal level; and has not received immunomodulatory agents or antivirus therapy. Patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, or hepatitis D virus were excluded from this study. Patients with other possible causes of chronic liver damage, such as alcohol, drugs, autoimmune diseases, and congestive heart failure were also excluded. Another 12 gender-, age-, and ethnicity-matched healthy subjects were recruited as healthy controls (HCs).

These patients exhibit varied responses to antiviral drugs, which could be due to different immune status of the host.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> The balance between Tregs and Th17 cells may significantly influence the progress and prognosis of hepatic diseases.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> LdT is an <sc>l</sc>-nucleoside that has been recently approved for use in patients with chronic HBV infections. Clinical trials have confirmed that LdT potently inhibits HBV replication and achieves the higher HBeAg seroconversion rate,<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> and exerts immune modulation effects on both the adaptive and innate immune systems.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> Hence, this study <italic>aimed</italic> to observe changes in Treg/Th17 cells and their related cytokines under LdT therapy, analyzed the correlation between changes in Treg/Th17 balance and HBeAg negative or HBeAg level, and provided the immunological markers for exploring the mechanism of the higher HBeAg seroconversion rate of LdT therapy.</p><p>Previous studies showed that LdT treatment was superior to lamivudine in terms of the ability to reduce HBV load to undetectable levels, normalize serum ALT, and improve the rates of HBeAg seroconversion in patients with CHB.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> In the present study, we observed that an early rapid viral load reduction and remarkably serum ALT level reduced after the LdT. This finding provided supporting data for the excellent anti-HBV effects of LdT.</p><p>To elucidate the roles of Tregs, Th17 cells, TGF-&#x003b2;1, and IL-17 on the immunopathology of chronic HBV infection, we analyzed the relationship between the frequencies of these cells and the levels of related cytokines and clinical parameters. We found that the peripheral blood Tregs frequency and TGF-&#x003b2;1 level were significantly higher in HBeAg-positive CHB patients than those in the HCs (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05). And Tregs frequency and TGF-&#x003b2;1 level were positively correlated with the level of HBV-DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05). This finding was consistent with the study of Xu et al<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and Guo et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> A previous study<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> showed that Tregs can secrete TGF-&#x003b2;1, which in turn induces Tregs proliferation in the absence of other inflammatory cytokines. The positive feedback effect between Tregs and TGF-&#x003b2;1 jointly mediate the immune tolerance status of HBeAg-positive CHB patients, resulting in HBV persistent infection. We also found that peripheral blood Th17 cells frequency and IL-17 level were significantly higher in HBeAg-positive CHB patients than those in the HCs (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05). Moreover, Th17 cells frequency and IL-17 level were positively correlated with the level of ALT (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05), which is consistent with the findings of previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> These findings suggest that Th17 cells and their related cytokines were positively associated with the grade of liver inflammation and participated in liver injury process and HBV clearance. We also found that the ratio of Treg/Th17 and TGF-&#x003b2;1/IL-17 also increased in CHB patients compared with those in the HCs, the balance of Treg/Th17 is skewed toward Treg cells in HBeAg-positive CHB patients. Hence, observing changes in the Treg/Th17 ratio could provide reference for observing the immune status of host and antivirus therapy.</p><p>Previous study observed that Adefovir treatment can partially reduce the frequency of circulating Tregs, and this reduction occurs concomitantly with increase in HBV-specific T cell response<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Zhang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> indicated that Treg/Th17 ratio decreased during the first 3 months of entecavir treatment along with the inhibition of HBV DNA level. In the present study, we found that Tregs frequency and TGF-&#x003b2;1 level tended to decrease with prolonged LdT antiviral therapy, which may contribute to the inhibition of HBV replication. We also found that Th17 cells frequency and IL-17 level showed a reverse &#x0201c;V&#x0201d;-type change, increased to their maximum levels at week 8 and then gradually decreased to the baseline. This trend may be related to the weakened immune suppression function to Th17 cells along with the reduction of Tregs frequency and TGF-&#x003b2;1 level at the early period of antiviral therapy. Thereby the damaged Th17 cells function was partially restored and IL-17 secretion increased, which may contribute to the HBV clearance. On the other hand, the previous study suggested that Th17 cell was positively associated with the grade of liver inflammation.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> The HBV DNA decrease and ALT normalization at the early period of treatment may be adverse to the Th17 cell differentiation, resulting in the decline of Th17 cells frequency and IL-17 level after 12 weeks of treatment. The exact mechanism remains unclear. A previous study reported that the Treg/Th17 ratio declined in complete responders but was not significantly different in nonresponders during the antiviral therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> In our study, the Treg/Th17 ratio and TGF-&#x003b2;1/IL-17 ratio decreased after 12 weeks of the treatment, which was coincident with the decline of HBV DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg. This suggested that changes in Treg/Th17 balance may be related to antiviral response. Hence, detection of Treg/Th17 balance has great clinical meaning for evaluating antiviral efficacy.</p><p>HBeAg was considered a toleragen in HBV infection. HBeAg seroconversion indicates that the immune status of HBeAg-positive CHB patients changed from immune tolerance to immune activation and which has been considered the key marker of treatment success. Previous studies<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup>found that HBeAg-positive patients exhibited a higher percentage of Tregs in peripheral blood or hepatic tissues compared with HBeAg-negative patients. This finding suggested that HBeAg may be involved in the induction of Tregs. We compared the difference in Treg/Th17 cell frequencies and TGF-&#x003b2;1/IL-17 levels at the baseline between the HBeAg loss group and HBeAg no-loss group at week 24. The results showed that the frequency of Tregs and the ratio of Treg/Th17 were significantly lower in the HBeAg loss group compared with those in the HBeAg no-loss group at the baseline (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05). Nevertheless, no significant statistical difference was observed between the 2 groups in Th17 cell frequency, TGF-&#x003b2;1 and IL-17 levels and TGF-&#x003b2;1/IL-17 ratio. Our data suggest that the lower Tregs frequency and Treg/Th17 ratio at the baseline of antiviral therapy, the more likely to get the HBeAg loss, and vice versa, which further suggested that the balance of Treg/Th17 may influence HBeAg seroconversion. Zhang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> highlighted the existing direct relationship between Treg/Th17 ratio and HBV DNA levels. We dissected the relationship between changes in Treg/Th17 balance and HBeAg level in these patients with CHB during antiviral therapy. Results showed that the frequency of Tregs and the level of TGF-&#x003b2;1 were both positively correlated with HBeAg level during the period from the baseline up to week 24. Hence, HBeAg negative can be predicted using changes in Treg cell frequency and TGF-&#x003b2;1 level undergoing LdT treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, LdT therapy not only rapidly suppresses HBV DNA replication but also exerts immunomodulatory effect on Treg/Th17 balance. The decrease in Treg cell frequency and TGF-&#x003b2;1 level could disrupt the immune tolerance, and the increase in Th17 cell frequency and IL-17 level could contribute to immune injury and HBV DNA clearance. Our data also suggest HBeAg negative can be predicted using changes in Tregs frequency and TGF-&#x003b2;1 level during LdT treatment in CHB patients. Maybe we could provide the immunological markers for exploring the higher HBeAg seroconversion rate of LdT therapy.</p><p>We recognize that our study has some limitations, such as a relatively small sample size, a single-center study, and short observation period. The bias may exist in the study. Only 2 patients achieved HBeAg seroconversion, and we could not analyze the relationship between the Treg/Th17 balance and HBeAg seroconversion rate, just through the change of HBeAg level to predict HBeAg negative or seroconversion. Therefore, we will perform a large sample, multicenter, and a longer observation period study to obtain a reliable immunological index for forecasting HBeAg seroconversion of LdT treatment and explore the immunomodulatory mechanism of LdT antiviral therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ALT = alanine aminotransferase, CHB = chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg = hepatitis B e antigen, HBsAg = hepatitis B surface, HBV = hepatitis B virus, HC = healthy control, LdT = telbivudine, Th17 cell = interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4+T helper cell, Treg = regulatory T cell.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding/support: The present study was supported by grants for The Key Research and Development Project of Tianjin Health Industry from Tianjin Municipal Health and Family Planning Committee (Project No:13KG126).
