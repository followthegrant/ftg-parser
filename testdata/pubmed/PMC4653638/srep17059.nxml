There are eleven putative deadenylases in mammals, and it is thought that each targets specific transcripts, although this has not been clearly demonstrated. Nocturnin (NOC) is a unique deadenylase with robustly rhythmic expression and loss of <italic>Noc</italic> in mice (<italic>Noc</italic> KO) results in resistance to diet-induced obesity. In an attempt to identify target transcripts of NOC, we performed &#x0201c;poly(A)denylome&#x0201d; analysis, a method that measures poly(A) tail length of transcripts in a global manner, and identified 213 transcripts that have extended poly(A) tails in <italic>Noc</italic> KO liver. These transcripts share unexpected characteristics: they are short in length, have long half-lives, are actively translated, and gene ontology analyses revealed that they are enriched in functions in ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. However, most of these transcripts do not exhibit rhythmicity in poly(A) tail length or steady-state mRNA level, despite <italic>Noc&#x02019;s</italic> robust rhythmicity. Therefore, even though the poly(A) tail length dynamics seen between genotypes may not result from direct NOC deadenylase activity, these data suggest that NOC exerts strong effects on physiology through direct and indirect control of target mRNAs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Poly(A) tails are hallmarks of most eukaryotic mRNAs, serving to protect the mRNA from degradation and promote circularization of the RNA to allow efficient translation initiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Changes in poly(A) length occur throughout the life of the mRNA, and long poly(A) tails of ~150&#x02013;250&#x02009;nt are initially acquired during the 3&#x02032; end processing of the nascent transcripts in the nucleus. After transcripts are translocated into the cytoplasm, they subsequently become shortened by deadenylases, a group of ribonucleases specific for homopolymeric tracts of adenosines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Deadenylation is a rate-limiting step for mRNA degradation that occurs in both mRNA- and context- specific manners, and can result in RNA de-stabilization or translational silencing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>There are 11 putative deadenylases currently identified in mammals based on their sequence homology, and most of them have been shown to play important roles in regulating diverse processes, ranging from general viability of organisms to bone formation, cell growth and metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. All known deadenylases are magnesium-dependent and belong to one of two superfamilies: The DEDD (Asp-Glu-Asp-Asp) superfamily contains POP2 (or CAF1), CAF1Z, PARN and PAN2 families, whereas the second superfamily includes members related to a class of <underline>E</underline>xonucleases, <underline>E</underline>ndonucleases, and <underline>P</underline>hosphatases, known as the EEP (or CCR4) superfamily that includes CCR4, NOCTURNIN, ANGEL, 2&#x02032;PDE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. It still remains unclear, however, why there are so many deadenylases, whether they are functionally redundant or have distinct roles, and whether these deadenylases act on specific target mRNAs. As the deadenylation process generally occurs in a biphasic manner in mammals, in which long poly(A) tails are first gradually shortened by the PAN2-PAN3 complex to ~100&#x02009;nt, followed by the CCR4-CAF1-NOT complex to 8&#x02013;12&#x02009;nt<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, it is possible that multiple deadenylases act on the same mRNA with discrete but overlapping functions. However, given the difference in temporal and spatial expression patterns of the deadenylases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and the different phenotypes caused by disrupting specific deadenylases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, it is more likely that each deadenylase targets a specific set of transcripts, although this has not been clearly demonstrated.</p><p>Among these deadenylases, <italic>Noc</italic> (Gene name; <italic>Ccrn4l</italic>) is unique, in that it exhibits a robustly rhythmic expression pattern driven by the biological clock, peaking during the night with particularly high amplitude rhythms in liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. <italic>Noc</italic> is also unique in that it is an immediate early gene (IEG), showing acute responses to several stimuli including serum shock, phorbol ester, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) agonist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. NOC has a conserved catalytic domain in the C-terminus, with sequence similarities to other CCR4 family members, but it has a significantly divergent N-terminus and lacks the leucine-rich repeat region required for yeast Ccr4p and mammalian CCR4a and CCR4b to interact with Caf1 and other proteins in the major CCR4&#x02013;NOT complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. These differences in expression pattern and structure suggest that NOC has a function distinct from other members of this protein family.</p><p>Mice lacking <italic>Noc</italic> (<italic>Noc</italic> KO) are resistant to diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis, yet do not have reduced food intake, increased activity, or measureable changes in whole body energy expenditure when fed a High-Fat Diet (HFD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. This phenotype is due, at least in part, to abnormal dietary lipid trafficking in intestinal enterocytes, preventing efficient energy intake from diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. <italic>Noc</italic> is also one of the differentiation switches of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), supporting a shift towards adipogenesis rather than osteogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. However it is unknown whether the deadenylase function of NOC contributes to these phenotypes, and if so, which specific transcripts NOC targets for its deadenylase activity.</p><p>Because <italic>Noc</italic> exhibits a unique expression pattern that is different from other deadenylases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, we hypothesized that NOC would exert its enzymatic activity on a specific set of transcripts and shorten their poly(A) tail length, and a lack of such regulation would ultimately lead to the phenotypes observed in <italic>Noc</italic> KO mice. In order to attempt to identify these transcripts, we used our recently developed technique, a genome-wide screen which we call &#x0201c;Poly(A)denylome&#x0201d; analysis to assess the poly(A) tail length of mRNAs from WT and <italic>Noc</italic> KO livers in an unbiased manner. Using this analysis, we identified 213 transcripts that have longer poly(A) tail lengths in <italic>Noc</italic> KO mouse liver. Despite <italic>Noc&#x02019;s</italic> robust rhythmicity, however, the great majority of these transcripts do not exhibit rhythmicity in poly(A) tail length or in their steady-state mRNA level in mouse liver. Instead, these transcripts share surprising yet interesting characteristics: they are generally short in length and have relatively long half-lives. Gene ontology analysis of these transcripts, as well as other mRNAs that have altered abundance in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO (both up- and down-regulated), suggests that NOC-regulated transcripts are enriched in those involved in ribosome functions and in oxidative phosphorylation. Most of the transcripts that have altered tail length in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO livers do not fit our expectations for direct targets of NOC and this suggests that NOC acts, at least in part, through a novel activity or via indirect control of target mRNA metabolism that ultimately contribute to the phenotypes observed in <italic>Noc</italic> KO mice.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of transcripts that have different poly(A) tail lengths in Noc KO liver</title><p>In order to identify mRNAs that have altered poly(A) tail lengths in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO mice, we performed &#x0201c;poly(A)denylome&#x0201d; analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, a method that can measure poly(A) tail length of transcripts in an unbiased and global manner. Mouse livers were collected at Zeitgeber Time 4 (ZT 4; where ZT 0 is defined as time (hours) of lights on and ZT 12 is defined as time of lights off) and ZT 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), time points when the NOC expression is at its nadir and peak, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. S2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. RNAs were then extracted and fractionated by oligo(dT) chromatography into populations that contained either short (&#x0003c;75 nt) or long (60&#x02013;250 nt) poly(A) tails by varying the salt concentrations in the elution step<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Non-fractionated mRNAs (the total poly(A)<sup>+</sup> pools) were also obtained as a reference. These RNA samples were subjected to microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Gene ST 1.0 chips that do not require oligo(dT)-based sample preparation to avoid bias from the different poly(A) lengths in the different fractionated samples. Since the correlation of gene expression between each RNA pool was quite strong (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, we used the long/short ratio from the microarray analyses as an indicator of poly(A) tail length. Indeed, this normalization largely eliminated the correlation of the expression levels in each fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 1d</xref>), and we have previously shown that this ratio provides reliable quantitative information on the relative poly(A) tail length<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>As was previously reported, there are dynamic circadian changes in poly(A) tail length in WT mouse liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Since NOC expression is higher during the night (i.e. ZT 16) compared to the daytime (i.e. ZT 4), we expected that the effect of NOC would be stronger and the number of transcripts with longer poly(A) tail in <italic>Noc</italic> KO would be higher at ZT 16. However, the correlation of the long/short ratio between WT and <italic>Noc</italic> KO was weaker at ZT 4 than at ZT 16, indicating there is more variability between two genotypes at ZT 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We also observed that the long/short ratio was more variable between the two time points in <italic>Noc</italic> KO than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>), despite the known circadian rhythms in tail length in the WT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>In order to identify potential NOC target transcripts, we compared the long/short ratio between WT and <italic>Noc</italic> KO samples and identified transcripts that had significantly different ratios (i.e. tail lengths) in the absence of NOC. Using stringent criteria in which we only examined transcripts that had raw expression values of greater than 200 and a fold-change ratio of greater than 1.5, we identified 309 transcripts that exhibited a statistically significant difference (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) at ZT 4, and 10 transcripts at ZT 16 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). All 10 transcripts that were found to differ at ZT 16 had longer tails (higher long/short ratios) in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO samples, while at ZT 4, 203 transcripts had longer tails and 106 transcripts had shorter tails in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO liver. Although it remains unclear why these 106 transcripts had shorter poly(A) tails in <italic>Noc</italic> KO liver, it may be that other deadenylases (all expressed in liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) over-compensate for the lack of <italic>Noc</italic>. It is likely that these differences underestimate the number of transcripts that have altered poly(A) tail length in the KO due to the stringent criteria we used to call a difference in the long/short ratio. In addition, our method does not capture mRNAs with extremely short tails, or lacking tails altogether, which may represent a significant population of mRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p><p>In order to independently validate the microarray results, the poly(A) tail lengths of randomly chosen transcripts were directly measured using the ligation-mediated poly(A) tail length (LM-PAT) assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> as well as Poly(A) Length (PAL) assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). These assays revealed that the poly(A) tail length of the mRNAs we tested indeed exhibited changes between WT and <italic>Noc</italic> KO, as predicted from microarray analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Due to the heterogeneous nature of poly(A) tail lengths, signals are often detected as smears, therefore, the distribution of sizes detected by densitometry analysis was used to compare the poly(A) tail length between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). In addition, these PAT assays also displayed multiple differently-sized PCR products for some mRNAs (such as <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> or <italic>Hspb1</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>), either possibly arising from alternative polyadenylation which occurs in more than 70% of all genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> or representing two populations of transcripts: newly synthesized RNAs with long poly(A) tails and old RNAs that have shortened poly(A) tails.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Changes in poly(A) tail length do not correlate with changes in mRNA abundance</title><p>Because the poly(A) tail length is an important factor in determining the translation initiation and mRNA stability, it has long been thought that depletion of deadenylases would lead to the stabilization of mRNAs, hence increased mRNA abundance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Recent studies, however, have challenged this idea and shown that the loss of a deadenylase can have only small effects on changes in mRNA abundance, and changes in mRNA stability have an inverse correlation with mRNA abundance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In addition, there is accumulating evidence that mRNA decay and transcription are coupled to buffer mRNA abundances and to maintain RNA homeostasis, and increased mRNA stability is not predictive of increased abundance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Because &#x0201c;mRNA abundance&#x0201d; (i.e. the steady-state mRNA levels) represents the sum of RNA degradation and de novo RNA synthesis, longer half-lives may not always result in higher mRNA abundance. We therefore tested whether this is also true in <italic>Noc</italic> KO mouse livers by analyzing the changes in mRNA abundance, obtained from the poly(A)<sup>+</sup> (non-fractionated) pool and comparing this with changes in poly(A) tail length between WT and <italic>Noc</italic> KO. Interestingly, we did not observe any correlation at either time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), supporting the idea that these NOC-dependent changes in poly(A) tail length do not necessarily correlate with the changes in mRNA abundance.</p><p>Since we expected NOC targets to have increased tail lengths in the KO, we also examined the relationship between mRNA abundance and poly(A) tail length specifically among the 213 transcripts (from both time points) that had longer poly(A) tail length in <italic>Noc</italic> KO liver. We found that 29 of these transcripts (13.6%) had higher mRNA abundance, but all other transcripts (86.4%) had no changes in mRNA abundance in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO samples. Among the 106 transcripts that had shorter poly(A) tails in <italic>Noc</italic> KO, 1 transcript (0.9%) had lower mRNA abundance and another transcript (0.9%) had higher mRNA abundance in <italic>Noc</italic> KO, while all other transcripts (98.2%) were present at equal levels in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The changes of mRNA abundance from the microarray data was further confirmed by qPCR for several transcripts that had altered poly(A) tail length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In addition to confirming the general lack of correlation between mRNA abundance and poly(A) tail length, in some cases even small differences that had been observed in abundance in the microarrays (i.e. <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> and <italic>Cd52</italic>), did not reach the level of significance when re-examined by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These results suggest that tail shortening by NOC does not usually result in changes in mRNA abundance, but may have some other function.</p><p>We also measured the mRNA stability of several transcripts in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from both WT and <italic>Noc</italic> KO mice. We observed small changes in half-life in some of the mRNAs that we tested, but for most of the mRNAs we examined, there was no difference in half-life in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characteristics of transcripts that have longer poly(A) tails in the Noc KO</title><p>The 213 transcripts whose poly(A) tail length (i.e. long/short ratio) was longer in <italic>Noc</italic> KO were of particular interest, because these transcripts fit the pattern expected for bona fide target transcripts of NOC. Therefore, we further hypothesized that NOC target transcripts would share common characteristics that would distinguish themselves as targets. In general, the fate of an mRNA is largely determined by the composition and timing of the interaction between trans-acting factors (i.e. miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins) and cis-elements commonly found in 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. Therefore, we first attempted to identify cis-elements commonly found in either UTR of the 213 mRNAs that had longer tails in the KOs. However, there was no enrichment of any specific RNA sequence found by HOMER RNA Motif Analysis (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.salk.edu/homer/motif/rnaMotifs.html">http://homer.salk.edu/homer/motif/rnaMotifs.html</ext-link>) (data not shown), although this does not rule out the possibility that NOC recognizes a cis motif defined by RNA secondary structure, rather than RNA sequence.</p><p>Because we have previously shown that many mRNAs have poly(A) tail lengths that change over the daily cycle and because <italic>Noc</italic> is expressed with robust rhythms in mouse liver, we hypothesized that NOC might contribute to this circadian control of poly(A) tail length and therefore NOC targets would be enriched for transcripts with rhythmic poly(A) tails. However, this does not appear to be the case, as only 3 (1.4%) of the 213 putative NOC targets (<italic>Lims2</italic> (peak ZT 16.4), <italic>Alkbh7</italic> (ZT 8.6), <italic>Hspb1</italic> (ZT 16.2) were found to have rhythmic poly(A) tails in our previous analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, a significant underrepresentation compared to all mRNAs, of which 2.3% had rhythmic poly(A) tail lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). None of the transcripts with shorter poly(A) tail length in <italic>Noc</italic> KO had rhythmic poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we had originally expected that NOC&#x02019;s rhythmic expression pattern would contribute to rhythmic mRNA profiles by destabilizing target transcripts during the night. However, this was not the case, because only 3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> (<italic>Alkbh7</italic> (peak ZT 21.8), <italic>Safb</italic> (ZT 21.7), <italic>Hist1h1c</italic> (ZT 22.1)) or 6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> (<italic>Saa1</italic> (peak ZT1.4), <italic>Hist1h1c</italic> (ZT 0.8), <italic>Arid3a</italic> (ZT 22.4), <italic>Cd52</italic> (ZT 6.4), <italic>Dct</italic> (ZT 3.2), <italic>Hspb1</italic> (ZT 20.8)) of the 213 transcripts were determined to be rhythmic in abundance, based on the two recent datasets of extensively analyzed circadian mRNA profiles at the steady-state level in mouse liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, a much smaller percent than the percent of total rhythmic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>).</p><p>A recent study also made an interesting observation that the intrinsic poly(A) tail length does not correlate with open reading frame (ORF), untranslated region (UTR) and mRNA length in mouse liver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, although in yeast there is a correlation between poly(A) tail length and UTR, mRNA, and ORF length<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In order to gain insight into whether this group of mRNAs with extended tails in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO show any such correlation in gene/transcript length, we analyzed the length of 5&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-UTRs, ORF, and the entire gene. Interestingly, all these parameters were significantly shorter in the transcripts that had longer poly(A) tails in <italic>Noc</italic> KO, as compared to all the transcripts included in the dataset (ALL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d&#x02013;g</xref>).</p><p>It has long been thought that one of the major roles of poly(A) tails is to determine mRNA stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Therefore, despite the lack of correlation with overall abundance, we wondered whether the mRNAs with longer tails in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO were generally long- or short-lived mRNAs. To this end, we utilized genome-wide datasets of mRNA half-life measurements from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and NIH3T3 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, and examined reported half-lives of this group of mRNAs. Our in silico analyses using these datasets revealed that the transcripts with longer tails in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO have an average half-live that was significantly longer than the average half-live of both the entire group of all mRNAs and those with shorter poly(A) tails in <italic>Noc</italic> KO. This was true for both the mESCs and NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h,i</xref>).</p><p>Another important function of poly(A) tail length is to regulate translation initiation, as mRNAs form a &#x0201c;closed-loop&#x0201d; circular structure in order to initiate translation and the presence of longer poly(A) tails facilitates the formation of this structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, although this relationship has recently been challenged in some situations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Thus, in order to clarify whether NOC may function in translation, we next examined a ribosomal profiling dataset from mES cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, an indicator of translation status. In this dataset, the <italic>Noc</italic> target transcripts are associated with larger numbers of ribosomes, compared to all transcripts and those with shorter tails in the KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3j</xref>), indicating that <italic>Noc</italic> target transcripts may belong to a more actively translated group of mRNAs at least in mES cells.</p><p>Since poly(A) tail length impacts translation initiation, and NOC targets are generally translationally active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3j</xref>), we hypothesize that the NOC-dependent changes may be reflected in translational competence and therefore intrinsic protein levels. Recent proteomic analyses from mouse liver over the circadian cycle have provided datasets on rhythmic protein levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, but the proteins encoded by most of the 213 candidate NOC targets were not represented in these datasets, likely due to the sensitivity limits of the mass spectroscopy.</p><p>Together, these results suggest that NOC acts either directly or indirectly on specific sets of target mRNAs to shorten their poly(A) tails but this tail shortening does not generally affect the RNA stability or overall abundance of these mRNAs, and NOC does not seem to significantly regulate rhythmicity of poly(A) tail length or mRNA abundance. Consistent with this, these target mRNAs are generally quite stable, suggesting that tail-shortening by NOC may not be important for regulating mRNA half-life. Nevertheless, it still remains a possibility that NOC regulates mRNA stability, regardless of the changes in poly(A) tail length, until direct NOC-targets can be identified. It should be noted that we have previously reported that NOC stabilizes the iNOS mRNA although it is still unclear whether this is a direct effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Nocturnin&#x02019;s role in ribosome and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation</title><p>In order to determine whether the transcripts that have longer poly(A) tails in <italic>Noc</italic> KO liver belong to particular biological pathways and functions, we performed gene ontology analyses using DAVID<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Pathways significantly enriched in transcripts with longer poly(A) tail length in <italic>Noc</italic> KO were: Ribosomes, Cytosol, Oxidative Phosphophorylation, and Laminin, and these keywords were not enriched in transcripts with shorter poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table S3</xref>). Similar results were also obtained when we used JEPETTO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, a different algorithm that enabled visualization of the network analysis data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b,d,e</xref>).</p><p>We also performed gene ontology analyses using transcripts that had altered mRNA abundance in <italic>Noc</italic> KO, independent of whether or not their poly(A) tail length changed, and also found the pathways &#x0201c;Mitochondrion&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Ribosome&#x0201d; to be significantly enriched, and this enrichment was particularly strong in a set of genes that had increased mRNA abundance in <italic>Noc</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, this enrichment of transcripts in ribosomal and mitochondrial functions in both datasets is not due to the same sets of transcripts present in both poly(A) and mRNA abundance datasets. For example, among 31 transcripts (out of a total of 213 transcripts) that have differences in their poly(A) tail length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and 53 transcripts (out of a total of 196 transcripts) that have altered mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) between the two genotypes that are involved in regulating mitochondrial functions, only 9 transcripts (<italic>Atp5l</italic>, <italic>Bloc1s1</italic>, <italic>Mrps24</italic>, <italic>Mrps28</italic>, <italic>Ndufa2</italic>, <italic>Romo1</italic>, <italic>Tmem256</italic>, <italic>Timm13</italic>, <italic>Uqcc2</italic>, <italic>Uqcr</italic>) were included in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Similarly, among 41 (poly(A) tail length) and 40 (mRNA abundance) transcripts that display functions in ribosome, only 6 transcripts (<italic>Mrps24</italic>, <italic>Mrps28</italic>, <italic>Rpl35</italic>, <italic>Rps29</italic>, <italic>Snrpd2</italic>, <italic>Timm13</italic>) were present in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). This suggests that NOC plays a prominent function (direct or indirect) in regulation of these biological processes/pathways, through both poly(A) tail length shortening and via changes in mRNA abundance. Because of NOC&#x02019;s known role in metabolism, we were particularly interested in a potential role for NOC in mitochondrial function. Therefore, we measured hepatic ATP levels as well as serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels and found that both are decreased in <italic>Noc</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g,h</xref>), despite that the total number of mitochondria is unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4i</xref>). Since the function of oxidative phosphorylation is to produce ATP and beta-hydroxybutyrate predominantly in liver from acetyl-CoA by oxidizing fatty acids, these data suggest that the mitochondrial functions are altered in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO. To support this idea, the levels of <italic>Nd4/4L</italic>, <italic>Nd5</italic>, <italic>Nd6</italic>, <italic>CoxI</italic>, and <italic>CoxII</italic>, all of which are mitochondrial RNAs that encode proteins that are involved in Complex I and Complex IV of oxidative phosphorylation chains, are decreased in <italic>Noc</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4j</xref>), further suggesting a role for NOC in regulating the oxidative phosphorylation pathway.</p><p>In conclusion, our Poly(A)denylome analysis identified transcripts that have altered poly(A) tail length in <italic>Noc</italic> KO. A significant portion of these transcripts are related to mitochondrial function as revealed by gene ontology analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Table 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">4</xref>) and may contribute to the metabolic phenotypes observed in the <italic>Noc</italic> KO mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. However, transcripts that have longer poly(A)tails in <italic>Noc</italic> KO liver are relatively stable, and the majority of these transcripts do not exhibit rhythmicity in poly(A) tail length or in their steady-state mRNA level in mouse liver, even though the expression of <italic>Noc</italic> is robustly rhythmic. Therefore, although the poly(A) tail lengths are altered, these may not be direct target transcripts of NOC deadenylase activity. Further supporting this idea is the finding that the number of transcripts that have longer poly(A) tails is higher at ZT 4 when the expression of <italic>Noc</italic> hits nadir, as compared to ZT 16 that the level of <italic>Noc</italic> reaches its peak. In fact, we have not been able to detect any direct physical interaction between NOC and possible target transcripts, even though we have attempted several different techniques with various materials (i.e. cell lines vs tissues, endogenous vs overexpressed NOC). It may be that because NOC does not have an RNA binding domain outside of its catalytic pocket, it only associates with its targets transiently, making it difficult to trap the targets. Together these findings suggest that NOC may be regulating tail length through an indirect mechanism, or through some novel activity. One possibility is that NOC competes against some other deadenylase activity in a rhythmic manner. We have previously shown that the deadenylase activity of NOC is moderate, compared to that of PARN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, therefore, slow or incomplete deadenylation by NOC may block complete deadenylation by another more active deadenylase. It will be of interest to explore whether NOC has a molecular function other than a deadenylase.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Poly(A)denylome analysis</title><p>RNA fractionation and the 3&#x02032;-end labeling assay were performed as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.
