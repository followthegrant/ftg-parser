The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 14 million prevalent TB cases (range, 12 million-16 million), 1.3 million deaths among HIV-negative people and 0.38 million deaths among HIV-positive people in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recently, drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), and especially multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), has emerged as an increasingly important factor in TB deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. According to a WHO report, DR-TB has spread worldwide and has become a serious public health problem that threatens the success of the directly-observed treatment strategy (DOTS), a treatment approach recommended by WHO for the detection and cure of TB, as well as global TB control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Among TB patients notified in 2009, an estimated 250,000 had MDR-TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. DR-TB is caused by various factors, including not only factors at individual level (e.g., sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], genetic susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], occupation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], previous treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], etc.), but also factors at ecological level (i.e., environment factors, including natural factors and social factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). Therefore, it is essential to investigate in depth the risk factors for DR-TB prevention and control, especially the ecological factors.</p><p>From 1994, WHO, the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) and other partners have launched the Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance (the Global Project) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Since the establishment of the Global Project, 114 countries (59% of all countries) have been covered, and data on drug resistance have been systematically collected and analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The results indicate that Central and Western Europe have the lowest proportions of resistance to any TB drug and the lowest MDR-TB, followed by African countries and then The Americas, with moderate proportions of resistance in the Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia regions, followed by the Western Pacific region. Proportions of resistance to any TB drug and MDR-TB are highest globally and for all first-line drugs in Eastern Europe. Furthermore, important variations exist within different regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This suggests that ecological causes (specifically, climate and geography, TB epidemiological factors and socioeconomic factors, etc.) for DR-TB vary in different regions. Spatial examination of these risk factors for DR-TB would play an essential role in developing regional prevention measures and control strategies.</p><p>However, the variables of climate and geographical factors, TB epidemiological factors and socioeconomic factors, etc. usually show spatial autocorrelation and obvious spatial heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], which is difficult for the traditional multivariable model (e.g. global ordinary least square (OLS) regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]) to deal with. We therefore introduced geographical weighted regression (GWR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] to assess the spatial heterogeneity in the putative relationships between DR-TB and its risk factors. As the variables involved in this study presented characteristics of high-dimension, non-normality, small sample size and multicollinearity, we first proposed partial least square path modeling (PLS-PM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] to extract the latent synthetic DR-TB factors from the DR-TB vector, and latent synthetic risk factors from the ecological factors vector; then we constructed the structural equation model (SEM) to analyze the complex causal relationship between the latent synthetic DR-TB factors and latent synthetic risk factors. Furthermore, the GWR model was employed to analyze the local spatial heterogeneity in the estimated relationships between the latent synthetic DR-TB factors and latent synthetic risk factors. All the maps in this study were created by ArcGIS (v9.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Setting</title><p>In 2008, the fourth report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] of the WHO/UNION Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance was published, which summarized data from 114 countries between 1994 and 2007. 109 countries (covering 126 regions, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) reported data on first-line anti-TB drug resistance among new cases, including prevalence of resistance to isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), streptomycin (S) and ethambutol (E). We used mono-drug resistance (resistance to a single drug, H, R, E or S: Mono-rate), multidrug resistance (resistance to, at least H and R, including HR, HRE, HRS and HRES: MDR-rate), and poly-drug resistance (resistance to several drugs, excluding combined resistance to H and R, including HE, HS, RE, RS, ES, HES and RES: Poly-rate) to reflect the prevalence of drug resistance. The present study was carried out using surveillance regions as units of analysis.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Locations of 126 regions for anti-tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-072X-10-50-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Data sources</title><p>The anti-TB drug resistance data was extracted from the fourth report, including Mono-rate, MDR-rate and Poly-rate of DR-TB in 126 regions.

Based on the results of EFA, SEM was constructed to show the complex relationship between the latent synthetic DR-TB factors and latent synthetic risk factors. Because of the non-normal distribution, small sample size and multicollinearity of the data, the PLS algorithm was chosen to set up SEM, named as PLS-PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is a component-based estimation method, which is an iterative algorithm that separately analyzes the blocks of the measurement model and then estimates the path coefficients in the structural model. PLS-PM is regarded as a "soft modeling" approach, without strong assumptions for the distributions, the sample size and the measurement scale, and has been applied extensively, especially in customer satisfaction studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Based on the software review by Temme et al. (2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], the software SmartPLS version 2.0M3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] was chosen to conduct the analysis. SmartPLS supports graphical modeling and carries out the bootstrapping procedure to generate significance measures. In this research, the path weighting scheme was implemented for the inner estimate of the standardized latent variable in PLS analysis, and the resampling number was specified as 1000 in bootstrapping. Furthermore, the latent synthetic DR-TB factors and latent synthetic risk factors scores were estimated for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of spatial dependence relationship between DR-TB and ecological factors</title><p>To explore the spatial dependence relationship between DR-TB and its ecological risk factors, PLS-PM, in combination with OLS regression as well as GWR, was used to build the global and local spatial regression model between the latent synthetic DR-TB factors and latent synthetic risk factors. PLS-PM was firstly used to estimate the latent synthetic DR-TB factors and latent synthetic risk factors for each region as above. Then, the ordinary Kriging interpolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] was used to obtain the predicated values of the latent synthetic DR-TB factors and latent synthetic risk factors. Finally, by using Spatial Analysis software in Macroecology (SAM v4.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], OLS regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and GWR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] were used to set up the global and local spatial regression models between the latent synthetic DR-TB factors and the latent synthetic risk factors, respectively.</p><p>As a virtually unbiased method in an interpolation situation, the Kriging model has several advantages over other interpolation and smoothing methods, and has been used to create maps of geographic disease clines in many studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In this study, after the Kriging maps were created by ArcGIS, the Natural Breaks (Jenks) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] was used to classify the latent synthetic DR-TB and risk factor clines. Unlike conventional OLS regression, which may only produces a single regression equation to summarize global relationships between DR-TB and ecological synthesis factors, the GWR, whose regression coefficients are allowed to vary spatially, can generate spatial dependence that express the local spatial variation between them dynamically. GWR has been successfully applied in spatial epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and in spatial ecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Latent synthetic risk factors and DR-TB factors</title><p>From five climatic and geographic factors (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), two latent synthetic risk factors were extracted, which could explain about 87.17% of the total variance for these factors. The first, named as "Temperature", was reflected by annual atmospheric temperature (ATT), temperature climate zone (TCZ) and geography latitude (GL). The second, named as "Humidity", was described by annual precipitation (AP) and geography climatic zone (GCZ). Based on the value assignment of the climatic and geographic factors (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), the larger the "Temperature", the hotter the climate; and the larger the "Humidity", the wetter the climate.</p><p>Four latent synthetic factors were extracted from the TB epidemic situation, the effects of DOTS, health expenditures, etc., which could explain 86.09% of the total variance for the twelve ecological risk factors (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The first, named as "TB Epidemic", was reflected by TB case notification rates (x1), prevalence of tuberculosis (x2), and TB mortality among HIV-negative people (x3). The second, named as "Health Service", consisted of population with sustainable access to improved rural sanitation (x4), 1-year-olds immunized with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) (x5), 1-year-olds immunized with meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV) (x6) and life expectancy at birth (x7). The third, named as "Health Expenditure", was composed of total expenditure on health as percentage of gross domestic product (x8), per capita total expenditure on health at average exchange rate (x9) and per capita government expenditure on health at average exchange rate (x10). The fourth, named as "DOTS effect", was described by new smear-positive TB treatment success under DOTS (x11) and TB treatment success under DOTS (x12). Obviously, the larger the "TB Epidemic", the more serious the TB epidemic situation; the larger the "Health Service", the higher quality the health service; the larger the "Health Expenditure", the greater the health investment; the larger the "DOTS Effect", the better the effect of DOTS.</p><p>From Mono-rate, MDR-rate and Poly-rate, the latent synthetic factor named as "DR-TB" was extracted to reflect the prevalence of drug resistance, which could explain 70.09% of the total variance. It can be seen that the larger the "DR-TB", the more serious the epidemic situation.</p></sec><sec><title>Complex relationship between "DR-TB" and ecological factors</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the PLS path model of DR-TB rates with ecological factors, in which reflective mode was used to relate the manifest variables (ecological factors) to their latent variables (latent synthetic risk factors). It can be seen that the six latent synthetic risk factors could explain 38% of the total variation of the "DR-TB" factor (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Among them, the "Humidity" factor had the largest effect, with a standardized path coefficient -0.351, i.e., there was a negative relationship between "Humidity" and "DR-TB", and the larger the "Humidity", the lower the prevalence of DR-TB. Both "Temperature" and "Health Expenditure" factors had a negative effect on "DR-TB", with standardized path coefficients -0.336 and -0.279, respectively. "TB Epidemic", "DOTS Effect" and "Health Service" factors all had a positive influence on "DR-TB", with standardized path coefficients 0.186, 0.165 and 0.087, respectively. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> show the bootstrapping test results for outer loading of the measurement model and path coefficient of the structure model, which demonstrated that in the measurement model, most loadings of the manifest variables except x5 and x6 were significant at 0.20 level (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.20); in the structure model, all path coefficients except "Health Service" were significant at 0.20 level (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.20). Therefore, the analysis indicated that the latent synthetic risk factors "TB Epidemic", "Health Expenditure", "DOTS effect", "Humidity" and "Temperature" had major effects and played an important role

This suggests a non-stationary relationship between "DR-TB" and the latent synthetic risk factors. The standardized regression coefficient estimates of "TB Epidemic" were mostly positive (some were not statistically significant), except in southern South America, eastern and southern Europe, and central and southern Africa (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a1, a2</xref>).

While there are wide areas of development in the treatment of DR-TB (drug therapy, immunotherapy, gene therapy, etc), it is not an easy problem to overcome. Therefore, prevention and control measures should be taken for DR-TB. It is crucial to explore the risk factors of DR-TB, especially the ecological factors. Nonetheless, at present, there has been no specialized research published to explore the ecological factors in DR-TB. In this study, we conducted such a study using anti-tuberculosis drug resistance data from the WHO/UNION Global Project and the collected ecological factors data. An ecological study often lacks the ability to control potential confounding factors, and ecological fallacy is inevitable. Therefore, we selected all the anti-tuberculosis drug resistance countries or regions as study samples, and implemented strict quality control measures (including risk factor variable determination and collection, data sorting and analysis, etc.) to improve the research quality as far as possible.</p><p>Previous studies, such as researches that explored the ecological factors of TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], were all based on data distribution to construct a linear regression model, a Poisson regression model or a logistic regression model directly to estimate the relationship between factors and TB incidence rate, without considering the internal relevance and potential structure of the factors. With the unit of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance monitoring countries or regions, we explored the relationship between ecological factors (TB epidemic, DOTS effect, health expenditure, climatic geography, etc.) and the level of DR-TB globally. In order to fully use the data information and reveal the inner characteristics of risk factors comprehensively and thoroughly, EFA was used to find the latent synthetic risk factors, and then PLS path modeling was constructed to show the complex ecologic causal relationship between the level of DR-TB and the latent synthetic risk factors. Finally, six latent factors ("TB Epidemic", "Health Service", "Health Expenditure", "DOTS Effect", "Humidity" and "Temperature") were extracted, and "DR-TB" was used to reflect the level of the DR-TB rate. We found that except the "Health Service" factor, other factors had a major impact on "DR-TB".</p><p>According to the predicated values of "DR-TB" and the latent synthetic risk factors by the Kriging method, the GWR model was constructed to analyze the local relationship between latent synthetic risk factors and "DR-TB". The parameters of the GWR model in different regions reflected the influence of the degree and direction of association of each latent synthetic factor to "DR-TB". The contour map of the regression coefficients in the GWR model showed that it had significant spatial variability, which demonstrated that the effect of latent synthetic risk factors on the level of DR-TB was different in different regions. The results suggested that local control and prevention strategies and monitoring schemes should be formulated according to the spatial characteristics of the latent synthetic risk factors and the local association with drug-resistance rates, instead of roughly establishing global strategies and policies based only on the results of drug-resistance monitoring.</p><p>The GWR model is an expansion of traditional regression analysis, which allows the parameters to vary with changes in spatial location. Unlike traditional methods, the GWR model can adjust the spatial heterogeneity by changing the sample location of spatial data, and then estimate the local parameter to reflect the variance of the factor contribution in different areas, hence its regression results are much more reasonable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In the present study, the relationships between "DR-TB" and latent synthetic risk factors showed spatial variability, thus the GWR model was chosen for local estimation. The GWR results showed that the signs of parameter estimates are not all the same as those in the OLS regression model. Also the average adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>(0.592) of the GWR model was larger than the <italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>(0.335) of the OLS model, which reflected the spatial variability of DR-TB. Meanwhile, the <italic>AIC</italic>c (394.851) of the GWR model was smaller than that of the OLS model (470.952), which also demonstrated that the fit of the GWR model was better than that of the OLS model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study found that GWR (local) showed a stronger relationship between latent synthetic risk factors and the DR-TB latent factor than OLS (global) regression, and established the "non-stationary" nature of the local relationship, i.e., the influence of the latent synthetic risk factors on DR-TB presented spatial variability. Thus, monitoring planning and prevention and control strategies for DR-TB should be formulated according to the spatial characteristics of the latent synthetic risk factors and the local relationship between "DR-TB" and the latent synthetic risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p><italic>AIC</italic>c: corrected Akaike's Information Criterion; AP: annual precipitation; ATT: annual atmospheric temperature; DOTS: directly-observed treatment strategy; DR-TB: drug-resistant tuberculosis; DTP3: diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis; E: ethambutol; EFA: exploratory factor analysis; GCZ: geography climatic zone; GL: geography latitude; GWR: geographical weighted regression; H: isoniazid; MCV: meningococcal conjugate vaccine; MDR-TB: multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; OLS: ordinary least square; SEM: structural equation model; PLS-PM: partial least square path modeling; R: rifampicin; S: streptomycin; TB: tuberculosis; TCZ: temperature climate zone; WHO/UNION: World Health Organization/International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YXL extracted the data, conducted the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
