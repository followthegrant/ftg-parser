We analyzed RNA-sequencing data of 2322 pan-cancer [1378 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 6 adenosquamous carcinomas (ASC), and 938 adenocarcinomas (AC)] including six carcinomas arising from MCT (four SCCs, one ASC, and one AC). Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis showed that gene expression profiles of carcinomas arising from MCT were different between each histological type and that gene expression profiles of SCCs arising MCT (MCT-SCCs) was apparently similar to those of lung SCCs. By epidermis-associated pathways activity based on gene set enrichment analysis, 1030 SCCs were divided into two groups: epidermis-signature high (head and neck, esophagus, and skin) and low (cervix, lung, and MCT). In addition to pan-SCC transcriptome analysis, cytokeratin profiling based on immunohistochemistry in the independent samples of 21 MCT-SCCs clarified that MCT-SCC dominantly expressed CK18, suggesting the origin of MCT-SCC was columnar epithelium. Subsequently, we investigated differentially expressed genes in MCT-SCCs compared with different SCCs and identified <italic>XCL1</italic> was specifically overexpressed in MCT-SCCs. Through immunohistochemistry analysis, we identified XCL1 expression on tumor cells in 13/24 (54%) of MCT-SCCs but not in MCTs. XCL1 expression was also significantly associated with the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive T cells and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. XCL1 produced by tumor cells may induce PD1/PD-L1 interaction and dysfunction of CD8-positive T cells in tumor microenvironment. XCL1 expression may be a novel biomarker for malignant transformation of MCT into SCC and a biomarker candidate for therapeutic response to an anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Tumour biomarkers</kwd><kwd>Diagnostic markers</kwd><kwd>Ovarian cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16H06267</award-id><award-id>JP16H06279</award-id><award-id>18K16760</award-id><award-id>JP16H06279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamura</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name><name><surname>Yoshihara</surname><given-names>Kosuke</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakaoka</surname><given-names>Hirofumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Mochida Grant</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Tsukada Grant for Niigata University Medical Research</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>"Challenging Exploratory Research Projects for the Future" grant from ROIS (Research Organization of Information and Systems)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Limited 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Malignant transformation occurs in ~1&#x02013;2% of mature cystic teratomas of the ovary (MCT), and the prognosis is poor at advanced stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Because of its rarity, there is no standard therapy for this disease. Malignant transformation of MCT has also been characterized by difficulty of preoperative diagnosis and histological diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common histological type in malignant transformation of MCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which is reasonable because skin epithelium is usually found in MCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recently, Cooke et al. analyzed genomic alterations of 25 SCCs arising from MCT (MCT-SCC) by using a gene panel with 151 cancer-related genes and reported frequent alterations of <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> that are also frequently detected in other types of SCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the number of targeted genes in their study was limited, and other molecular characteristics of MCT-SCC such as transcriptome, proteome, and methylation profiles remain unclear. Specific biomarkers for the early diagnosis of malignant transformation and novel therapeutic targets, which are required in clinical practice, have not yet been identified.</p><p id="Par3">The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has recently performed an extensive molecular characterization of SCC derived from four different anatomical sites (lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], head and neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and esophagus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). Moreover, TCGA studies demonstrated molecular and biological similarities across SCCs derived from different organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In line with these molecular backgrounds, the clinical efficacy of anti-PD1 antibodies has been confirmed in SCC derived from lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], head and neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], esophagus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and skin tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, there were different immune subtypes in pan-SCCs, and the survival benefit of anti-PD1 antibodies was limited to a subset of SCC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we investigated the molecular characteristics of carcinomas arising from MCT by performing comprehensive analyses of genomic and transcriptomic data and immunohistochemistry-based protein expression profiles.

The median onset age of all patients was 58 (33&#x02013;79) years old, and 12/27 (44%) patients were diagnosed at advanced stage (stage II&#x02013;IV). Consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], patients at an advanced stage (stage II&#x02013;IV) had a poor prognosis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Because all cases include skin epithelial tissues, we evaluated histological findings of normal epithelium close to the cancer site and divided them into three types: cancer site close to skin epithelium (7/27, 26%), cancer site close to not otherwise specified epithelium (7/27, 26%), and not available (13/27, 48%) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

All MCT-SCCs were located in cluster R, which mainly consisted of lung SCC.

Our findings suggest that XCL1 expression may be a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of malignant transformation of MCT into SCC and a biomarker candidate for therapeutic response to an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.</p><p id="Par16">Consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we detected a high frequency of <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> (E542K/E545K) mutations in MCT-SCCs.

In particular, most MCT-SCCs [7/8 (87.5%)] harbored at least one known oncogenic alteration in the PI3K&#x02013;AKT&#x02013;mTOR pathway that was targeted by many inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition, we identified oncogenic kinase gene alterations that were druggable, and the clinical efficacy of the molecular target therapy was confirmed in various types of malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], such as <italic>FGFR3&#x02013;TACC3</italic> fusion, <italic>BRAF</italic> missense mutation, <italic>FLT3</italic> missense mutation, and <italic>MET</italic> amplification. Intriguingly, the <italic>SETD2</italic> nonsense mutation was recurrently detected in MCT-SCC, including sample #1, in which no druggable alteration was identified. SETD2 is a histone-modifying enzyme responsible for all trimethylation of H3K36 (H3K36me3). Decreases in H3K36me3 lead to chromosomal instability, such as MMR-deficient tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and cause drug vulnerabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, some MCT-SCC patients might obtain a new therapeutic strategy for <italic>SETD2</italic> mutation in the future. We evaluated TMB in eight MCT-SCC samples, and there was no obvious hypermutated tumor in our samples compared with other types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our findings suggest that integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis could increase therapeutic drug targets in MCT-SCC.</p><p id="Par17">We identified unique gene expression profiles in carcinomas arising from MCT by comparing with pan-cancer RNA-sequencing data. Three histological types of carcinomas (SCC, ASC, and AC) arising from MCT showed different gene expression patterns. Our data suggested that the expression profile of MCT-SCC was similar to that of SCCs arising from other anatomical sites. In particular, MCT-SCC showed a more similar expression pattern to lung SCC than cutaneous SCC. The origin of MCT-SCC has been discussed for decades, and there are two possible origins: epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and columnar epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The epidermis origin theory is the most likely candidate because skin epithelium is generally found in MCT. Moreover, carcinoma in situ with a Bowen&#x02019;s disease-like pattern that is typical in cutaneous SCC is found in some cases of MCT-SCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. On the other hand, the columnar epithelium origin theory has also been considered because some MCT-SCCs exhibited a sequential change from respiratory epithelium to carcinoma in situ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. CK18-positive and CK10-negative expression patterns that were observed in lung and cervix SCCs were found in the majority of MCT-SCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although we could not find a sequential change from columnar epithelium to carcinoma in situ in our H&#x00026;E slides of MCT-SCC samples, our results of expression data analysis support the columnar epithelium origin theory in MCT-SCC.</p><p id="Par18">Although the gene expression profile of MCT-SCC was similar to that of lung SCC, we identified that XCL1 was specifically overexpressed in MCT-SCC compared with other SCCs and benign MCT. There were no significant differences in prognosis or clinical stage between the high- and low-XCL1 groups in MCT-SCCs. These results suggest that XCL1 may be a biomarker for SCC transformation from MCT but not a prognostic factor. XCL1 is a C class chemokine and is produced mainly by natural killer and activated CD8-positive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The selective receptor XCR1 is expressed by a subpopulation of dendritic cells, and the XCL1&#x02013;XCR1 axis plays a crucial role in the development of efficient cytotoxic immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, the XCL1&#x02013;XCR1 interaction is involved in tumor migration, invasion, and proliferation in several malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In MCT-SCC, we found XCL1 expression on tumor cells as well as some intratumor immune cells in XCL1-positive MCT-SCCs/ASCs. These intratumor immune cells with XCL1 expression were rarely observed in HGSCs. These findings might reflect that CD8-positive T cells activated by the XCL1&#x02013;XCR1 interaction produced XCL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that XCL1 expression on tumor cells was positively correlated with the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive T cells and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, which were predictive biomarker candidates in an immune checkpoint therapy in various types of malignancies. Based on tumor PD-L1 expression and the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, four different types of tumor immune microenvironment were proposed to predict the response to immune checkpoint therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. More than half of MCT-SCCs [13/24, (54%)] showed high tumor infiltration of CD8-positive T cells and high PD-L1 expression, and these cases might be treated effectively by the PD1/PD-L1 blockage therapy.

For these patients, other strategies such as combination therapy that is designed to bring T cells into tumors and avoid them being turned off, such as the combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1, might be needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">No significant correlations between <italic>XCL1</italic> expression and CD8A/CD274 expression in pan-SCC data nor any types of SCCs were observed.
