As a general rule, chronic ongoing exposure to IH has been considered detrimental, as it has been linked to adverse cardiovascular, cognitive, and metabolic outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. On the other hand, there has been considerable interest over whether more short-term IH might have benefits, particularly with respect to training effects in skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this regard, there is evidence that skeletal muscle hypertrophy, strength, and metabolic efficiency can be enhanced when IH is introduced into a training regimen, although this has not been uniformly reported and remains controversial [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, while impaired inspiratory muscle function in OSA patients has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], other authors have failed to find evidence of diaphragmatic dysfunction in these patients [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Although most studies have focused on situations characterized by prolonged exposure to IH such as OSA, there has been relatively little study of the short-term effects of IH on diaphragmatic function. However, short-term exposure to IH is a common occurrence in patients hospitalized with acute respiratory disorders such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema, and is typically most severe during sleep. It is almost certainly the case that the balance between benefits and adverse consequences of IH depends upon the pattern of hypoxia exposure, as well as its duration and severity [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, tissue responses to IH are very likely to be not only organ-specific but also muscle-specific. Therefore, in the present study we determined the effects of short-term IH (8 hours/day for 4 days) on structural, metabolic, and contractile properties of the mouse diaphragm, and compared responses in the diaphragm to a commonly studied reference limb muscle, the tibialis anterior (TA). Our study reveals that the diaphragm undergoes unique structural and metabolic changes after short-term IH, which result in a preferentially atrophied but more fatigue-resistant muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>IH protocol</title><p>Male mice (8 weeks old, C57BL/10ScSnJ, Jackson Laboratories) were randomly divided into 2 groups. The IH group was exposed to hypoxia (FiO2 nadir = 6%) at a frequency of 30 times/hour, 8 hours per day during the light phase of the circadian cycle, for 4 consecutive days. On the first day of the protocol, mice were pre-adapted to less severe IH conditions (FiO2 nadir = 10%) for 3 hours prior to instituting the above protocol. IH was achieved by nitrogen injection into sealed cages as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Mice from the control group (Ctl) were exposed to the same experimental conditions but nitrogen was replaced by air. Five animals were housed per cage in a controlled pathogen-free facility throughout the course of study. At the end of the experimental protocol, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg body weight, IP) and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. All animal procedures were approved by the McGill University Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. This study followed the Animal Research: Reporting of <italic>In Vivo</italic> Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines for reporting animal research.

The purified RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad: #170&#x02013;8841). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using 5 ng of cDNA mixed with 10 &#x003bc;l Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mixes (Thermo scientific: #K0222) and 1&#x003bc;l of 10&#x003bc;M primer mixes.

The dilutions of primary (Calpain, Sigma: #C5736; LC3B, Cell signaling: #3868) and secondary (Calpain, Promega: #W4021; LC3B, Promega: #W4011) antibodies were made as per the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. Assessment of protein carbonylation levels in muscle was performed using the Oxyblot Protein Oxidation Detection kit (Millipore: #S7150). Briefly, muscle lysates were incubated with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) to derivatize the carbonyl groups present in oxidized proteins into 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP-hydrazone). Then, the proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with antibodies raised against DNP-hydrazone. All steps of the protocol were performed according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Acquisition and quantification of density for specific protein bands was performed by the ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Ponceau S solution (Sigma: #P7170) was used to control for protein loading.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Histological analysis</title><p>Excised muscles (diaphragm and TA) were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled 2-methylbutane (Fisher, #O3551) and stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C. For general morphology, 8&#x003bc;m-thin cryostat sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) according to standard protocols. Images were photographed using an Olympus BX51 microscope with a QImaging Retiga 2000R camera system. A grid containing fixed dimension squares (352&#x003bc;m x 352&#x003bc;m) was randomly applied onto each photographic image. To quantify the cross-sectional area of individual myofibers, measurements were made on myofibers contained within 5 randomly chosen squares, using ImageJ software [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For each tissue section analyzed, approximately 500 muscle fibers were evaluated. Type I myofibers were detected by immunofluorescence on transverse muscle sections using an overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C with a primary antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank: #BA-F8) raised against the mouse slow type I myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform. After 4 washes with PBS, muscle sections were incubated with a fluorescent anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes: A-21140) for 1 hour at room temperature, washed 4 times in PBS and mounted using Immu-mount (Thermo: #9990402). Images were acquired with a QImaging Retiga 2000R camera on an Olympus BX51 fluorescent microscope and the morphometric analysis of type I MyHC-positive myofibers was performed using ImageJ. To assess the level of intramyocellular lipid accumulation, muscle sections were stained with Oil red O. Lipid droplets were quantified using a threshold-based analysis method with ImageJ as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

The homogenate was incubated on ice for 15 min, centrifuged (10 min, 14,000g, 4&#x000b0;C), and the supernatant was used for enzymatic activity measurements. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity was measured at 600 nm to detect the reduction of 2,6-Dichloroindophenol (DCIP) induced by the SDH-dependent oxidation of succinate and decylubiquinone. The assay was performed at 30&#x000b0;C in a KPi-EDTA buffer containing 1mg/ml BSA, 0.24mM KCN, 4&#x003bc;M rotenone, 0.4&#x003bc;M antimycine A, 100&#x003bc;M decylubiquinone, 100&#x003bc;M DCIP, 10mM succinate, and 0.2mM ATP at pH 7.4. SDH activity was calculated by the difference of DCIP reduction (&#x003bc;mol sec<sup>-1</sup>) with and without malonate, an inhibitor of SDH activity.

After attaching the muscle to a force transducer/length servomotor system (model 300B; dual mode; Cambridge Technology, Watertown, MA), optimal length (<italic>Lo</italic>) was determined. The force-frequency relationship was measured by sequential supramaximal stimulation for 1 sec at 10, 30, 50, 100 and 150 Hz, with 2 min between each stimulation train. Muscle force was normalized to cross-sectional area and expressed as Newtons/cm<sup>2</sup>. To assess fatigue resistance, muscles were intermittently stimulated (330 ms trains at 30 Hz each second) and the decrement in force production was continuously recorded over a period of 160 seconds.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For each experiment, we evaluated the sample size according to an estimated standard deviation of samples based on pilot experiments and/or prior studies.

Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase of total calpain protein in diaphragm (<xref rid="pone.0131068.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) but not TA limb muscle (<xref rid="pone.0131068.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) exposed to IH. However, neither the diaphragm nor the limb muscle showed a significant increase in the cleaved (active) form of calpain, arguing against a major role for this pathway in the preferential diaphragmatic atrophy induced by IH. Along these same lines, real-time quantitative PCR did not demonstrate significant changes in expression levels of the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF1) and atrogin-1, in either the diaphragm (<xref rid="pone.0131068.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>) or the limb muscle (<xref rid="pone.0131068.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>) following IH. On the other hand, levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B-II (LC3B-II) protein, a biochemical marker of autophagosomes, were increased approximately 2.4-fold in the diaphragms (<xref rid="pone.0131068.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>) of IH-exposed mice while no significant change was discernable in the limb muscle (<xref rid="pone.0131068.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>).

We also determined the relationship of these changes to canonical pathways linked to proteolysis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial metabolism. The main findings of our study are: 1) IH induced preferential atrophy of the diaphragm, which correlated with greater activation of the autophagy but not calpain or muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase pathways; 2) a similar anti-oxidant response and decreased SDH activity were found in both muscles; and 3) the diaphragm demonstrated a unique metabolic profile characterized by greater lipid droplet accumulation and activation of lipid metabolism pathway genes, an increase in type I MyHC-expressing fibers, and enhanced fatigue resistance despite reduced SDH activity of the muscle.</p><p>It is likely that the similar responses to IH observed in the two muscles, such as the increase of anti-oxidant Gpx3 expression and the reduction of SDH activity found in both diaphragm and TA, are primarily related to hypoxia per se. Oxidative stress is a well-described consequence of hypoxia in various organ systems and cell types [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our study, this appears to have been relatively well-compensated by anti-oxidant mechanisms insofar as there was no measurable excess of protein carbonylation in the muscles after IH, although we cannot exclude a mild degree of oxidative stress. Shortt et al [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] recently reported similar findings in diaphragms of rats exposed to 2 weeks of IH, in which the GSSG/GSH ratio was increased but without evidence for increased lipid peroxidation. In addition, the decreased SDH activity which we observed in the two muscles is consistent with the downregulation of mitochondrial content and/or activity previously reported in mouse hindlimb muscles exposed to continuous hypoxia (FiO2 = 0.10) over 4 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] as well as similar findings in other studies involving sustained rather than intermittent hypoxic exposure [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, a number of divergent responses were observed between the diaphragm and limb muscle, which could result from their different activity levels during the hypoxic stimulus (i.e., greater in the diaphragm), or alternatively be due to muscle-specific differences in their intrinsic properties (fiber type, etc.). For example, whereas no atrophy occurred in the limb muscle, the diaphragm underwent an approximate 30% reduction in muscle fiber size during the IH protocol. To decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in this atrophy, we investigated 3 major proteolytic systems: the calcium-activated calpain, ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy pathways. Our data suggest that amongst these proteolytic systems, the autophagy-lysosomal pathway is most likely to account for the observed differential atrophy responses between diaphragm and limb muscle. Indeed, it is well established that hypoxia can trigger cellular autophagy in a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, autophagy has been reported to be protective against cardiac dysfunction induced by IH [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and may have played a beneficial role in the metabolic remodeling observed in our study by eliminating dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy) [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Exercise has also been shown to increase basal autophagy, which appears necessary for optimal muscle adaptation and improvement of physical performance [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We posit that the increased work of breathing during IH is equivalent to an exercise stimulus for the diaphragm, which when combined with hypoxia-related signaling serves to reinforce cellular activation of autophagy and thereby induce atrophy. Alternatively, greater atrophy in the diaphragm could be due to a greater intrinsic sensitivity of its fibers to hypoxia-induced muscle atrophy. The diaphragm and TA muscles are both composed predominantly of type II fast-twitch fibers in the mouse (approximately 90% and 100%, respectively), but the diaphragm fibers are inherently more oxidative and fatigue resistant [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, in a recent comparison of oxidative (soleus) and glycolytic (extensor digitorum longus, EDL) limb muscle responses to continuous hypoxia (FiO2 = 0.08 for 4 or 21 days), muscle atrophy and autophagy activation were significantly more pronounced in the EDL [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, it appears unlikely that intrinsic fiber type differences account for preferential atrophy of the diaphragm in our study, since its more oxidative fibers should in principle confer greater protection against hypoxia-induced atrophy.</p><p>This study provides novel evidence for altered lipid metabolism in the diaphragm after IH. The diaphragm demonstrated a 2.5-fold increase of lipid droplet accumulation as compared to normoxic controls, whereas the limb muscle did not show any significant alteration. Consistent with this observation, we documented an upregulation of key genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis such as Fasn and its transcriptional regulator SREBP1, SCD1, and the SREBP-cleavage activating protein Scap in the diaphragm. In contrast, most of these lipogenic markers were either downregulated (Fasn) or remained unchanged (SCD1, Scap) in limb muscle. In addition, Plin2 and Plin3 were preferentially induced by IH in the diaphragm, suggesting active processing of intramyocellular lipids since the lipid droplet-associated Plin proteins appear to be markers of lipid utilization during exercise [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, the specific induction of both PDK4 and UCP3 in the diaphragm is similarly consistent with a metabolic shift towards greater fatty acid oxidation [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, our data collectively support increased lipogenesis, fatty acid storage and utilization in the diaphragm after IH, which mimics aspects of the metabolic signature reported in athletes&#x02019; muscles [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The nature and functional consequences of intramyocellular lipid accumulation are poorly understood, being linked to insulin resistance in obesity [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] but considered as a potentially beneficial adaptation in the muscles of endurance-trained athletes [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Oxidative muscle fibers store greater amounts of lipids to support their more sustained energy demands [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which explains the higher basal levels of lipid droplets observed in the diaphragm as compared to the limb muscle in normoxic animals. Lipid droplets have long been recognized to accumulate in hypoxic cells [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although this could be due to a reduced ability to oxidize fatty acids, there is evidence that this response is not solely a consequence of unused substrate accumulation, but is actively promoted in many cell types including neurons [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], liver [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], heart [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], immune cells [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and adipose tissue [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This may be at least partly related to the phenomenon of aerobic glycolysis (also known as the Warburg effect), which can occur when mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism is inhibited by hypoxia, exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) or other factors [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], leading to its alternative conversion into lactate. The induction of HK2 mRNA in the diaphragm after IH is consistent with this hypothesis given its role as an important mediator of the Warburg effect [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Increased expression of PDK4 provides further supportive evidence, since PDK4-dependent phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex inhibits pyruvate conversion into acetyl-CoA in mitochondria [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Under such conditions, glutamate-dependent anapleurosis can also promote reductive metabolism of &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate to supply citrate for lipid biosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although the precise biochemical nature of the lipids which accumulate in hypoxic cells are not well delineated, these lipids may serve other functions beyond simply providing an alternative substrate for ATP production.</p><p>A shift toward greater lipid utilization and type I MyHC expression in the diaphragm following IH may initially seem counterintuitive given the simultaneous reduction of mitochondrial complex II (i.e., SDH) activity. However, a recent study reported that myotubes exposed to short-term hypoxia in vitro similarly demonstrated upregulated type I MyHC expression despite a concomitant reduction in oxidative phosphorylation complex proteins [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, the increased diaphragm muscle activity triggered by IH could facilitate its ability to employ lipids as a fuel source through other mechanisms. In this regard, it has been reported that endurance training prevents hypoxia-induced decrements in mitochondrial fatty oxidation, possibly due to greater muscle carnitine palmitoyl transferase (mCPT)-1 activity and improved mitochondrial efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Previous studies have noted that mitochondrial content, respiratory capacity, and muscle endurance are not necessarily well correlated with one another [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Other investigators have found that SDH activity correlates less closely with fatigue resistance than does MyHC phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Improved diaphragmatic endurance without increased SDH activity was reported in the rat diaphragm after 6 weeks of chronic hypoxia exposure [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and normal human volunteers trained under conditions of normobaric hypoxia demonstrated improved bicycle exercise endurance despite reduced quadriceps SDH activity, possibly mediated by a switch in COX isoforms [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] leading to enhanced oxygen affinity [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>An adaptive response of the diaphragm leading to increased energetic efficiency after IH is supported by the combination of increased type I MyHC content and improved endurance properties of the muscle demonstrated in our study. Although diaphragmatic force-generating capacity was significantly depressed immediately after the last hypoxic session, it had completely recovered to normal 6 hours later. These findings are consistent with induction of diaphragmatic fatigue during the hypoxic sessions, which is not unexpected given the combination of reduced oxygen availability and increased work of breathing [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, a key observation is that once the mice were returned to normoxia, the &#x0201c;rested&#x0201d; IH diaphragm muscle exhibited an improved capacity to resist fatigue during repetitive electrical stimulation in vitro. These physiological properties of the IH-exposed diaphragm are in keeping with the observed increase in fibers expressing type I MyHC, which are known to be more energetically efficient [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Furthermore, in view of the potential contribution of respiratory complex II to mitochondrial ROS production [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], the decrease in SDH activity could conceivably play a role in limiting muscle fatigue associated with ROS generation. However, a limitation of our investigation is that species differences may exist in these responses, since studies in rats have not found the same shift toward slow oxidative fibers in the diaphragm after IH [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], although a better maintenance of force production in IH-exposed diaphragms was reported [<xref rid="pone.0131068.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our study shows that 4 days of IH induces major atrophy in the mouse diaphragm associated with increased autophagy, together with a compensatory metabolic adaptation linked to enhanced muscle endurance. These findings may have implications for acute pulmonary diseases associated with episodic hypoxemia. In addition, it is conceivable that short-term IH could be used as an adjunct to respiratory muscle training as a means of increasing diaphragmatic endurance provided that muscle atrophy can be avoided, and this possibility deserves further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131068.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Animal Research: Reporting of <italic>In Vivo</italic> Experiments (ARRIVE) checklist of the study.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0131068.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131068.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Sequences of PCR primers used for gene expression analysis.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0131068.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Fonds de Recherche du Quebec&#x02014;Sant&#x000e9;, and the McGill University Health Centre Research Institute.
