The estimated total numbers of overweight and obese adults in 2005 were 937 and 396 million, respectively. Overall 23% world adult population is overweight and 9.8% is obese. By 2030, the number of overweight and obese adults is projected to be 2.16 and 1.12 billion, (38% and 20%), respectively.

A recent survey conducted on an adult population of Karachi showed that 46% of the participants were obese and 18% were overweight. The prevalence of obesity in medical students of Pakistan is unknown. Moreover, the dietary patterns and level of physical activity have not been studied in this particular population group.</p><p>The aim of this descriptive study was to assess the prevalence of preobesity and obesity among medical students of Lahore, Pakistan.

</p><p>Assuming a proportion of 20% in a population of 10,000 and 95% confidence interval, the calculated sample size was 240. A total of 244 students were randomly selected by using computer generated random numbers. Medical students of both genders and all professional years were eligible. Students were enrolled in the survey after obtaining written informed consent. A brief history was taken regarding any endocrine disorder, medication, or relevant subjective signs and symptoms before choosing the respondent. Medical students suffering from metabolic disorders such as hypothyroidism (untreated), type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome were excluded. Medical students who are taking steroids and anti-obesity drugs, such as amphetamines and orlistat, were also excluded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Data collection procedure</title><p>The detailed demographic information was collected from the respondents. The data related to dietary and physical activity were collected on a self-administered structured questionnaire. Caloric intake was assessed across 24 categories of common high-caloric food items. Frequency, number of servings, and serving sizes were recorded and monthly caloric intake from each dietary item was calculated. Average total daily caloric intake from high-calorie diets was calculated for each individual. Physical activity was assessed by documenting type and time spent on a number of physical activities and time spent on watching TV. Subjects were given instructions on how to fill out the questionnaire completely and truthfully. After filling out the questionnaire, anthropometric measurements such as weight, height, waist, and hip measurements were done according to the WHO standards.</p><p>Based on the revised guidelines for Asian population, the respondents were classified as overweight and obese if their BMI was 23&#x02013;24.9 and &#x02265;25, respectively. Central/abdominal obesity was defined as a WHR &#x02265;0.90 for males and 0.85 for females.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Data analysis procedure</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics software version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Frequencies of different categorical variables were calculated. Median and range were calculated for continuous variables.

The median age was 20 years (range: 18&#x02013;25) and 159 (65.2%) were females. Out of 244 subjects, 143 (58.6%) were from the public sector. Median height of the subjects was 165 cm (range: 146&#x02013;193), median weight was 58 kg (range: 38&#x02013; 105), and median BMI was 21.35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range: 15.6&#x02013;36.1). Out of 244 subjects, 26 (10.7%) were underweight, 142 (58.2%) had normal BMI, 25 (10.2%) were overweight/preobese, and 51 (20.9%) were obese.

It was observed that preobesity and obesity were 14.5% more prevalent in males as compared to females. Our findings are similar to other studies in terms of high prevalence of preobesity and obesity among male medical students. A study in Greece showed that 40% of male and 23% of female students had BMI &#x02265;25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] A study in Slovakia showed that 16% of male but only 2% of female medical students had a BMI &#x0003e;25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In a study of male medical students in the US, nearly one-fifth of the subjects had a BMI &#x0003e;24.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a further 30% were classified as overweight with BMI 22.8&#x02013;24.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In our survey, the prevalence of central obesity was alarmingly high (46% of male and 31.4% of female students); higher than that reported in Greece (33.4% male and 21.7% female medical students).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Students with central obesity had a significantly greater total daily caloric intake. However, no correlation was found between total daily caloric intake from high-calorie diets and BMI. Students from private medical colleges were more likely to have central obesity and had a higher median daily high-caloric intake. Day scholars were also more likely to have central obesity; however, the average total daily caloric intake was not significantly different from that of boarders.</p><p>Overall, the physical activity was very low in medical students. Most of the students neither played sports in college nor did do regular walk or jogging. Several studies have illustrated the importance of decreased energy expenditure in the pathogenesis of weight gain. Estimates of energy intake and energy expenditure in Great Britain suggest that reduced energy expenditure is more important than increased food intake in causing obesity.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Similarly, a study of middle-aged men in the Netherlands found that the decline in energy expenditure accounted for almost all of the weight gain.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] According to the Surgeon General's Report of Physical Activity, the percent of adult Americans participating in physical activity decreases steadily with age, and reduced energy expenditure in adults and children is predictive of weight gain.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the median time to watch TV or work on the computer was also high (median 2 h a day). Of all sedentary behaviors, prolonged television watching appears to be the most predictive of obesity and diabetes risk. In the Nurses&#x02019; Health Study, after adjustment for age, smoking, exercise level, and dietary factors, every 2 h increment spent watching TV was associated with a 23% (95% CI 17&#x02013;30%) increase in obesity and a 14% (95% CI 5&#x02013;23%) increase in the risk of diabetes.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] We did not find any statistically significant difference in physical activity between obese and nonobese individuals. As overall physical activity was very low across these groups, the risk of &#x000df; error is high, and a larger sample size would be required to address this problem.</p><p>Students with central obesity had a higher caloric intake from butter and zinger burger. Frequent fast-food consumption may also be associated with weight gain and risk of type 2 diabetes. This was illustrated in a secondary analysis of the CARDIA study, a population-based prospective study of cardiovascular disease risk factor development in young adults followed for the subsequent 15 years.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] When compared to subjects who ate fast food infrequently (less than once per week), and after adjustment for other lifestyle factors, subjects who consumed fast food frequently (greater than twice per week) at baseline and follow-up gained an extra 4.5 kg of weight and had a two-fold increase in insulin resistance as measured by the homeostasis model (HOMA). The study is limited by the lack of information on portion size and caloric density of the foods consumed.</p><p>Our results underscore the need to implement health promotion programs, especially to promote the need for adopting a healthy and active lifestyle in the adult population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>There is a high prevalence of obesity and preobesity in medical students of Lahore, Pakistan.
