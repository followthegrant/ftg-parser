Succinylcholine, the drug traditionally used to facilitate rapid tracheal intubation has been replaced by rocuronium. Rocuronium, in doses of 0.6-1.2 mg/kg has proven to be as effective as succinylcholine 1 mg/kg in producing acceptable (good or excellent) conditions for rapid tracheal intubation. Rocuronium is the only approved nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug with a rapid onset of action.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The doses of rocuronium used in previous studies of rapid tracheal intubation have ranged from 0.6 to 1.2 mg/kg. Favorable intubating conditions were achieved in most patients with rocuronium and were comparable to succinylcholine.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, succinylcholine and rocuronium differ in their ability to provide excellent intubation conditions, with succinylcholine being superior in this respect. A possible approach to improve the ability of rocuronium to produce perfect conditions for rapid tracheal intubation would be to increase the dose administered.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Our goal in this study was to define doses of rocuronium that would provide perfect conditions for tracheal intubation in patients in whom succinylcholine was relatively contraindicated.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] An example of such a group of patients is trauma victims coming with severe head injury.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In these patients, succinylcholine may be contraindicated because it may significantly increase intracranial pressure and serum potassium.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Rocuronium, in contrast, does not increase intracranial pressure[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and because of its nondepolarizing mechanism of action, will not increase serum potassium concentration.</p><p>Heier and Caldwell, found that rocuronium, in a dose of 2.0 mg/kg, can produce a &#x0003e;90% probability of achieving perfect conditions for rapid tracheal intubation. The use of such a large dose of rocuronium should be balanced against the consequences. Large doses will produce prolonged neuromuscular block. The median period of no tactile TOF response after rocuronium 2.0 mg/kg was approximately 2 h. Such a long duration makes the large dose rocuronium technique unsuitable in cases with short surgery time. However, if large doses are used in patients who will require prolonged tracheal intubation, such as those with head trauma, then prolonged block is not necessarily a disadvantage.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The use of large doses of rocuronium also raises the issue of cost. This cost can be justified if obtaining perfect intubation conditions[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] is a clinical priority and helps prevent an adverse patient outcome.</p><p>It was found that the onset time of rocuronium is faster at the laryngeal muscles than at the adductor pollicis.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Complete neuromuscular block at the adductor pollicis muscle was found to be a nonessential prerequisite for optimal intubating conditions. The onset of action of rocuronium at the laryngeal adductor muscles is slower than that after suxamethonium, and the degree of the block is less intense.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This may be because of the earlier blockade of laryngeal muscles than adductor pollicis by rocuronium.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In our study, onset time in the rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg group was prolonged than the succinylcholine group. As the dose of rocuronium increased from 0.6 to 0.9 mg/kg the onset time for neuromuscular blockade decreased.</p><p>When anesthesia was induced with propofol in elective cases, endotracheal intubation conditions were not different between succinylcholine and rocuronium approximately 60 s after the injection of the neuromuscular relaxant.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] A meta-analysis of the Cochrane collaboration concluded that when propofol is used to rapidly induce anesthesia, endotracheal intubation conditions are not statistically different between succinylcholine and rocuronium.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The time required for intubation was shorter with succinylcholine as compared to that of rocuronium. Succinylcholine created excellent intubation conditions than rocuronium, and there was a statistically significant difference of intubation conditions in favor of succinylcholine. However, as far as clinically acceptable intubating conditions and failed intubation attempts are concerned, the two relaxants were not statistically different.</p><p>Adjustment of opioid or the use of increased doses of propofol may permit a high probability of successful tracheal intubation with smaller doses of rocuronium.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, in the context of a rapid sequence induction of anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl in emergent cases, succinylcholine allowed a more rapid endotracheal intubation sequence and created superior intubation conditions than rocuronium. However, the use of rocuronium involves a long duration of neuromuscular block and significant drug cost. The technique of using a large dose of rocuronium to achieve perfect conditions for tracheal intubation may have application in situations in which succinylcholine is relatively contraindicated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Onset time of rocuronium was less by 36% in Groups B than A with increase in dose from 0.6 to 0.9 mg/kg. The intubation score of rocuronium at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg was the best as compared to succinylcholine at 2 mg/kg. The time taken to intubate with rocuronium at 0.6 mg/kg and 0.9 mg/kg was found to be comparable. Rocuronium at 0.9 mg/kg has a longer duration of action than at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg. The onset time is 39% more prolonged with rocuronium at 0.9 mg/kg as compared to succinylcholine at 2 mg/kg. The time taken to intubate is the shortest with succinylcholine. The time taken to intubate with rocuronium at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg was 41% prolonged and with rocuronium at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg was 20% prolonged as compared with that of succinylcholine. The intubation conditions were found to be inferior with rocuronium at 0.6 mg/kg. The duration of neuromuscular blockade is shortest with succinylcholine.
