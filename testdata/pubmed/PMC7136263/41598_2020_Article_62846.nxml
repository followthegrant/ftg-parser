However, the mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood. This study evaluated the effect of urban particles (UP) on <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumococcus) <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm formation, colonization of human middle ear epithelium cells (HMEECs) as well as mouse nasal cavity and its transition to the middle ear and lungs. The <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilms and planktonic growth of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> were evaluated in metal ion free medium in the presence of UP. Biofilms were quantified by crystal violet (CV) microplate assay, colony forming unit (cfu) counts and resazurin staining. Biofilm structures were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal microscopy (CM). Gene expressions of biofilms were evaluated using real time RT-PCR. Effects of UP exposure on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonization to HMEECs were evaluated using fluorescent <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization (FISH), cell viability was detected using the Ezcyto kit, apoptosis in HMEECs were evaluated using Annexin-V/PI based cytometry analysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were evaluated using the Oxiselect kit. Alteration of HMEECs gene expressions on UP exposure or pneumococci colonization was evaluated using microarray. <italic>In vivo</italic> colonization of pneumococci in the presence of UP and transition to middle ear and lungs were evaluated using an intranasal mice colonization model. The UP exposure significantly increased (*p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) pneumococcal <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilms and planktonic growth. In the presence of UP, pneumococci formed organized biofilms with a matrix, while in absence of UP bacteria were unable to form biofilms. The <italic>luxS, ply, lytA, comA, comB</italic> and <italic>ciaR</italic> genes involved in bacterial pathogenesis, biofilm formation and quorum sensing were up-regulated in pneumococci biofilms grown in the presence of UP. The HMEECs viability was significantly decreased (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and bacteria colonization was significantly elevated (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in co-treatment (UP&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>) when compared to single treatment. Similarly, increased apoptosis and ROS production were detected in HMEECs treated with UP&#x02009;+&#x02009;pneumococci. The microarray analysis of HMEECs revealed that the genes involve in apoptosis and cell death, inflammation, and immune response, were up-regulated in co-treatment and were unchanged or expressed in less fold in single treatments of UP or <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. The <italic>in vivo</italic> study showed an increased pneumococcal colonization of the nasopharynx in the presence of UP and a higher transition of bacteria to the middle ear and lungs in the presence of UP. The UP exposure elevated <italic>S. pneumoniae in vitro</italic> biofilm and colonization of HMEECs, and <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse nasopharyngeal colonization, and increased dissemination to mouse middle ear and lungs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Microbiology</kwd><kwd>Health care</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">World-wide air-pollution is a major problem due to toxic particulate matter (PM) contents that exert a negative effect on human health. In 2012 alone, approximately 7 million deaths have been reported, particularly in developing countries where pneumonia was one of the most common disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Urban particles (UP) are a major component of air-pollution and are a mixture of liquid and suspended atmospheric particles that consists of various size particles with an average size of 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;m (aerodynamic diameter&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;10 &#x003bc;m, PM<sub>10</sub>), along with fine (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ultrafine particles (PM<sub>0.1</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These UP also contain various metal ions such as iron, calcium, manganese, sodium, magnesium, zinc, copper etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The UP are inhaled and deposited on various parts of body including the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and distal lungs. Epidemiological studies have revealed that vehicle emissions and cigarette smoke containing PM exposure increased the vulnerability to respiratory infections including otitis media (OM) and pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Previously, PM including UP have been implicated in enhancing respiratory tract and nosocomial microbial infection such as OM, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, pneumonia, and meningitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3"><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a Gram positive commensal opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the nasopharynx and is responsible for two million deaths annually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Pneumococci initially colonizes the nasopharyngeal cavity in the form of biofilms, and from these, transits to other sterile sites causing chronic otitis media (COM), meningitis, pneumonia, bacteremia and sepsis in immune-compressed patients, children and the elderly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The initial interaction of PM such as UP and nosocomial bacteria such as <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> occurs in the nasopharyngeal cavity, and PM exposure increases the risk of infection and alters host&#x02019;s defense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

However, the interaction of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in the presence of UP or vise-versa is not well understood. Whether the pre-exposure of UP to the nasopharynx increases pneumococcal colonization or if the presence of UP reverts commensal pneumococci to the pathogenic kind needs to be understood.

Therefore, in this study, we evaluate the effects of UP exposure on; (i) <italic>S. pneumoniae in vitro</italic> biofilm and planktonic growth, (ii) pneumococcal colonization and toxicity to human middle ear epithelium cells (HMEECs) and alteration of global gene expression (iii) pneumococcal colonization of mouse nasopharynx and dissemination to the middle ear and lungs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical statement</title><p id="Par4">The animal experiments were carried out as per the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) Korea University Seoul, South Korea.

Similarly, UP are inhaled during respiration and deposited in the nasal cavity. It was previously detected that cigarette smokers exposed to PM are more susceptible to microbial infection, including OM, which has been associated with microbial biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, the biofilm formation and colonization of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in the presence of UP is not well understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of UP on <italic>S. pneumoniae in vitro</italic> biofilm formation, colonization of HMEECs and the nasopharynx and transit to the middle ear and lungs.</p><p id="Par33">Here, we detected an elevated pneumococcal planktonic growth in the presence of UP, indicating that the UP composition induced a biological effect that favored pneumococcal growth. Planktonic growth was examined in metal ion free medium, which are critical components of bacterial growth medium. These UP contain various metals such as iron (3.92%), sodium (4240&#x02009;mg/kg), silicon (12.8%), zinc (4800&#x02009;mg/kg), magnesium (0.81%), manganese (790&#x02009;mg/kg), calcium (5.84%), etc. (NIST, USA). The increased growth in samples supplied with UP potential indicate that pneumococcal growth was attributed to the metal components of UP. Iron is an essential nutrient for bacterial growth and many studies reported it crucial for pneumococcal energy production, nucleotide synthesis, and regulation of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm growth results revealed elevated pneumococcal biofilm growth in the presence of UP, and bacteria formed thick biofilms that were organized in a 3&#x02013;dimensional honey-comb structure as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in the absence of UP (control) the bacteria were unable to form organized biofilms and the bacterial cell appeared small in size and formed a chain like structure. These results indicate that probably in the absence of UP, normal bacterial growth was disrupted, and in the presence of UP, pneumococci were able to maintain normal grown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The primary reason for elevated biofilm growth is due to an increase in planktonic cell growth, and the second reason could be that UP provides favorable scaffold for biofilm growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In addition, the elevated expression of biofilm related genes such as <italic>luxS</italic>, <italic>comA</italic>, <italic>comB</italic>, <italic>ciaR</italic> in the presence of UP was attributed to increased biofilms. Pneumococcal biofilm formation is regulated by LuxS mediated quorum sensing (QS) and two component QS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Here, our results demonstrated increased expression of <italic>LuxS</italic>, <italic>ciaR</italic>, <italic>comA</italic>, <italic>comB</italic> in biofilms grown in the presence of UP, which contain a number of metals including iron (3.92%). These results indicate that the metal contents of UP induced expressions of biofilm and competence related gene expression and elevated biofilms growth. Previously, various studies reported that the presence of metal ions, such as iron and zinc, elevated pneumococcal biofilm growth, and iron up-regulated <italic>luxS</italic> gene expressions and controlled biofilm formation and fratricide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Overall, these results indicate that <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> forms elevated biofilm growth in the presence of UP and regulated gene expression of genes involved in biofilm, competence and toxin production.</p><p id="Par34">The results of this study showed decreased HMEECs viability, increased apoptosis, ROS production and increased bacteria colonization/aggregation to HMEECs in the presence of UP. <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> produces various toxins including pneumolysin (encoded by the ply gene) that induces DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, and hydrogen peroxide mediated by pneumococcal autolysin LytA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. We detected up-regulation of <italic>ply</italic> and <italic>lytA</italic> genes in pneumococcal biofilms in the presence of UP.

These results indicate that UP and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> treatment individually are toxic to epithelium cells, which is mediated by elevated ROS production, and in co-treatment, ROS production was amplified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Possibly, various factors including elevated ROS, hydrogen peroxide and toxins produced by pneumococci, increased the apoptosis rate in HMEECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Overall, these results indicate that exposure of HMEECs to UP increased cell susceptibility to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection, and amplified inflammation, ROS production and apoptosis that results in decreased HMEECs viability.</p><p id="Par35">Global gene expression using microarray revealed up-regulation of a number of genes involved in apoptosis, inflammation and cell death. Down-regulation of genes involved in DNA repair, anti-apoptosis and cell growth in co-treatment indicates that UP&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>S. pneumonia</italic> treatment was more toxic to HMEECs. In our previous study, we detected a concentration dependent decreased HMEECs viability and increased inflammatory related gene expression in the presence of UP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

The down-regulation of CD44 in co-treatment indicated that immune responses and defense was suppressed. It has been reported that a defect in CD44 gene expression obstruct bacteria clear during otitis media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The up-regulation of apoptosis related genes (AIFM2, CASP4) and down-regulation of anti-apoptosis genes (BCL2L11, NOTCH1 and IFI6) in HMEECs indicates that co-treatment induced apoptosis in HMEECs. The AIFM2 gene encodes an apoptosis inducing factor mitochondrion associated protein, which plays a vital role in the caspase-independent cell death pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In addition, the CASP4 protein plays an important role in the clearance of bacterial toxins, and the down-regulation may hamper bacterial clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The BCL2L11 gene encodes for anti-apoptosis proteins that play a vital role in apoptosis and is associated with OM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Similarly, the NOTCH1 gene down-regulation has been reported to induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation and metastasis in laryngeal squamous cells and is a risk factor for AOM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. The IFI6 gene encodes protein that negatively regulates apoptosis and has been down-regulated on virus infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Another important gene down-regulated in co-treatment was CXCL10, which encodes an important anti-microbial peptide (AMP) capable of directly killing bacteria and can act as a chemoattractant for natural killer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. The down-regulation of CXCL10 indicates decreased defense of HMEECs. Here, our results showed up-regulation of five genes that encode metallothionein proteins in co-treatment and less than 2 fold expressed in UP or <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> treatment. The metallothioneins are stress response proteins induced during inflammation, bacterial infection, restraint stress and agents that generate reactive oxygen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. In addition, the cell growth related genes were also reduced as suggested by down-regulation of CIT and MKI67. The significantly low viability of HMEECs in co-treatment could be due to the amplified inflammation, which may result in HMEECs injury and resulting in cells becoming more susceptible to pneumococci infection and cell death (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;4).</p><p id="Par36">A significant percentage of the population carries pneumococci asymptomatically in the nasopharynx, and after inhalation the UP find their path in the nasopharynx where they interact with epithelium cells and bacteria.

Our <italic>in vivo</italic> results showed increased pneumococcal colonization in the mouse nasopharynx in the presence of UP. Probably the presence of UP decreased the host defense and obstructed bacterial clearance that favored pneumococcal colonization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is known to form biofilms <italic>in vivo</italic> during nasopharyngeal and middle ear colonization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Moreover, elevated recovery of pneumococci in the presence of UP from the nasal lavage indicated that perhaps the UP provided a favorable surface for pneumococci colonization/biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Biofilms in the nasopharynx act as a reservoir of bacteria, and planktonic bacteria from those biofilms can transit to other typically sterile anatomical sites such as middle ear causing OM, in blood causing bacteremia, or meningitis, and in lungs causing pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.
