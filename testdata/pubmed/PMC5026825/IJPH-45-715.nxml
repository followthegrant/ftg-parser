Most of the research on stress conducted to date has focused on physical and psychological aspects; however, there are very few reports about the association between psychological stress and elements within the residential environment, such as the home, room, and furniture. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the effects of indoor flooring in the residential environment on stress, as flooring is a feature that the human body is in contact with for long periods of time. We objectively measured the extent of psychological stress perceived while walking on carpeting and on wood flooring.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty-two healthy subjects were recruited for this study, and were asked to walk on carpeting and wood flooring for 10 min each. Their electroencephalogram (EEG) and skin impedance values were measured for each task.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The &#x003b1;-wave content percentage in EEG data and skin impedance values were significantly higher just after walking on carpet than just after walking on wood flooring.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Walking on carpeting induces less stress than walking on wood flooring.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stress</kwd><kwd>Carpeting</kwd><kwd>Wood flooring</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>Skin impedance</kwd><kwd>Plantar aspect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Given the complexity of current societal demands, stress levels have increased, causing 30 or more types of diseases, including ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Meniere&#x02019;s syndrome, depression, primary glaucoma, and menopausal symptoms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). For the most part, stress has been frequently discussed in terms of its relationship with disease, external injury, and physical stress and its association with other sources of psychological stress imposed during work, school, and interpersonal relationships. However, very few reports have addressed the association between psychological stress and elements within the residential environment, such as the home, room, or furniture (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>According to Penfield&#x02019;s homunculus, deep stimulation of the plantar aspect of the foot is perceived quite sensitively near the midline of the cerebral cortex parietal lobe, and has been suggested to be strongly associated with mental health (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, in this study, we focused on the effects of indoor flooring in the residential environment on stress, as the floor is an aspect of the residential environment that the human body is in contact with for long periods of time. Carpet and wood are currently the flooring materials that are most commonly used in Japan, Europe, and the USA; therefore, in the present study, we objectively measured and compared the extent of psychological stress perceived while walking on carpeting and on wood flooring. In general, people in developed countries spend approximately 90% of their lives inside their houses. Since the plantars are usually in contact with flooring materials, determining the best materials to alleviate stress would be a significant method for providing the basic amenities of living.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The subjects were 42 healthy non-smokers comprising 20 men and 22 women ranging in age from 20 to 68 yr (mean &#x000b1; SD, 30.5 &#x000b1; 15.1 yr).

These results revealed that EEG and skin impedance measurements are excellent indicators of stress and relaxation, and that walking on carpeting is generally less stressful than walking on a wooden floor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our experiments revealed that after the subjects walked on a carpet, their EEGs showed more &#x003b1;-waves and less &#x003b2;-waves than when they were walking on a wood floor. The impedance measurements were found to be consistent with the EEG results, indicating minimal amounts of sweat on the palm when walking on carpeting. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that walking on carpeting seems to induce a lower stress state than walking on wood flooring.</p><p>Previous studies have used EEG measurements to evaluate stress, including reports related to the stress recovery effects in aerobics, yoga, and aromatherapy, as well as the circadian rhythm and sleep state (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). With respect to skin impedance, studies have shown that pain can be objectively measured using a skin impedance meter (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and other reports (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) have suggested that the skin impedance evaluation we employed here can be used to accurately measure the degree of relaxation.</p><p>Recently, in Japan, considerable effort has been expended to avoid mites and dust, thereby increasing the prevalence of wood flooring at the expense of carpeting (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In Europe and the USA, there have been numerous reports on the benefits of carpeting, such as prevention of dust to pass through in reverse (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), a soundproofing effect beneficial for mental health (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and improvement in educational performance after laying of carpeting in schools (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, no studies have directly evaluated the relationship between stress and carpeting. Our results supplement these reports by demonstrating the potential effect of carpeting on reducing psychological stress. Overall, these results suggest the need to address the public perception of the benefits of indoor carpeting.</p><p>The limitations of the present study include the facts that: 1) only one type of carpet was evaluated; 2) the subjects were primarily young/healthy adults; 3) only one trial was conducted with no further validation; 4) the skin impedance meter used in this study has not yet been released on the market; and 5) the study was conducted in an artificial laboratory setting, and not in a natural environment such as a home, office, or hospital, and there is little empirical data against which to validate the results. In the future, we intend to validate our results by evaluating several types of carpeting over multiple trials, with varying environmental conditions and a greater number of subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study revealed, for the first time, that EEG measurements for &#x003b1;-waves along with measurements of skin impedance were significantly higher, and EEG measurements for &#x003b2;-waves were significantly lower just after walking on carpeting as compared to those measurements just after walking on wood flooring. These results strongly suggest that walking on carpeting induces lower levels of stress compared to walking on wood flooring.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical issues (Including plagiarism, informed consent, misconduct, data fabrication and/or falsification, double publication and/or submission, redundancy, etc.) have been completely observed by the authors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Mr. Alberto Gayle for reviewing the English language of our manuscript.
