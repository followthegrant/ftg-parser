Here we report the identification and characterization of two novel zinc-attenuating compounds, ZAC307 and ZAC989, which exhibit broad-spectrum <italic>in vitro</italic> antifungal activity and <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy in a fungal kidney burden candidiasis model. The compounds were identified serendipitously as part of a drug discovery process aimed at finding novel inhibitors of the fungal plasma membrane proton ATPase Pma1. Based on their structure, we hypothesized that they might act as zinc chelators. Indeed, both fluorescence-based affinity determination and potentiometric assays revealed these compounds, subsequently termed zinc-attenuating compounds (ZACs), to have strong affinity for zinc, and their growth inhibitory effects on <named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida albicans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus fumigatus</named-content> could be inactivated by the addition of exogenous zinc to fungal growth media. We determined the ZACs to be fungistatic, with a low propensity for resistance development. Gene expression analysis suggested that the ZACs interfere negatively with the expression of genes encoding the major components of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> zinc uptake system, thus supporting perturbance of zinc homeostasis as the likely mode of action. With demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> antifungal activity, low propensity for resistance development, and a novel mode of action, the ZACs represent a promising new class of antifungal compounds, and their advancement in a drug development program is therefore warranted.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>zinc homeostasis</kwd><kwd>antifungal</kwd><kwd>zinc deprivation</kwd><kwd>yeasts</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source id="gs1"><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust Research Councils, UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="gs1">100480/Z/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohrt</surname><given-names>Karen A.

Through a process known as nutritional immunity, the host immune system sequesters metals that are necessary for microbial growth, resulting in an extremely nutrient-limited host environment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). For example, vertebrates express a number of iron-binding molecules, e.g., the transferrin family, that ensure extremely low concentrations of free iron in the body (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Additionally, neutrophils and other myeloid and nonmyeloid cells synthesize large amounts of the antimicrobial Zn<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>-chelating protein calprotectin during infection, and the contribution of calprotectin to the innate immune response against yeast and filamentous fungal pathogens is well documented (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>For fungal pathogens to grow and establish infection inside their hosts, they must be able to obtain iron, zinc, and other essential metals from the harsh environment imposed by nutritional immunity (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Consequently, successful pathogens have evolved elegant mechanisms to sequester essential metals from their hosts during infection. The mechanisms for iron sequestration are best described and include the expression of high-affinity iron transporters, iron-chelating siderophores, and iron-binding proteins (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Although iron acquisition is recognized as a virulence factor for many fungal pathogens (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), research in recent years has highlighted the important contribution that zinc sequestration makes to fungal pathogenesis and virulence (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Indeed, fungal acquisition of zinc has been clearly demonstrated to be essential for fungal growth and pathogenicity, and zinc-depleting conditions are known to reduce fungal growth <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In all fungal species, the major zinc-binding proteins include Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup> superoxide dismutases (SODs), alcohol dehydrogenase, and ribosomal proteins (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). SODs are key enzymes in fungal virulence and are necessary for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species generated by host cells during fungal infection (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus fumigatus</named-content>, zinc uptake is regulated by the transcriptional regulator ZafA, and deletion of <italic>zafA</italic> has been shown to not only impair germination and overall growth capacity of <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> in zinc-limiting media but also completely abrogate <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> virulence in a murine model of invasive aspergillosis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Thus, the control of access to zinc is one of the central battlefields on which the outcome of an infection is decided. In further support of this notion, calprotectin comprises &#x0223c;40% of total protein content in the neutrophil cytoplasm during infection, and its antifungal effect can be reversed <italic>in vitro</italic> by micromolar quantities of zinc (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Because of the great need for fungal zinc uptake during infection, it has been hypothesized that both chelation therapy and the modulation of zinc homeostasis and zinc acquisition are promising antifungal strategies (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>We have previously reported the identification of novel antifungal compounds targeting the fungal plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the further optimization process a number of compounds were synthesized, and we found two of these compounds, ZAC307 and ZAC989, to be very potent inhibitors of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida albicans</named-content> growth, despite the fact that they lacked H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-inhibitory activity. Due to their characteristic arrangement of an aromatic structure with nitrogen bound in close proximity to a hydroxyl group, we speculated that ZAC307 and ZAC989 could act as metal chelators. Thus, the goals of this study were (i) to investigate the chelating properties of these compounds, (ii) to characterize the spectrum of antifungal activity of these compounds <italic>in vitro</italic>, (iii) to ascertain whether the compounds were fungistatic or fungicidal and the propensity of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. albicans</named-content> to develop resistance against these compounds, (iv) to investigate whether the antifungal activity was caused by extracellular zinc sequestration or if the compounds were taken up by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida albicans</named-content> cells, (v) to assess whether these compounds influenced the expression level of genes encoding zinc transporters required for zinc uptake from zinc-limiting media and that of other genes regulated by ZafA, which is the master regulator of zinc homeostasis in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus fumigatus</named-content>, and (vi) to test and evaluate the effects of these compounds against mammalian cells and their antifungal efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic> in a murine model of candidiasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>ZAC307 and ZAC989 have high binding affinity for zinc and copper but not for magnesium and calcium.</title><p>ZAC307, ZAC989, ZAC623 (collectively referred to as ZACs), and the reference compounds EDTA and TPEN [N,N,N&#x02019;,N&#x02019;-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) were evaluated for their zinc binding properties.

Since potentiometric methods require millimolar concentrations, and ZAC307 and ZAC989 displayed poor solubility in water at such high concentrations, the measurements were performed in a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water (70:30, vol/vol), as described previously (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). To determine the deprotonation constant, a solution of 1 mM ZAC307 or ZAC989 was titrated with 0.3 M NaOH at constant ionic strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">B</xref>). In a second run, the same titration was performed in the presence of 0.5 eq of Zn<sup>2+</sup> for ZAC307 and ZAC989. A shift in the pH curve in the presence of the metal (ZAC307, 0.5 eq of Zn<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>]) compared to the absence of the metal (ZAC307 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>]) indicates binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> to the compound. The measured pH data were analyzed with the Hyperquad program suite, taking into account all relevant equilibrium constants, including also the constants for metal hydroxylation. The analysis provides the pK<sub>a</sub> values and metal complex stability constants, as well as ligand-metal complex speciation calculation, indicating how many ZAC molecules are involved in coordinating the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion at different pH values. Refinement of the measured pH data for ZAC307 provided a pK<sub>a</sub> value of 6.84 and formation constants log &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, log &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, and log &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> of 7.47, 13.27, and 18.14, corresponding to the formation of 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 ligand-Zn(II) complexes, respectively. The corresponding species distribution diagram is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, and it shows that at neutral pH in a DMSO-water solvent mixture, the ligand-zinc stoichiometry is a mixture of 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 binding, with 2:1 and 3:1 being the dominant stoichiometries. Similar potentiometric experiments were carried out with CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> in place of Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and these revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding to ZAC307 is negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Potentiometric titration of ZAC307 with CuSO<sub>4</sub> was not possible due to precipitation of the resulting complex, suggesting that ZAC307 also binds copper. Refinement of the measured pH data for ZAC989 provided a pK<sub>a</sub> value of 7.70, and in the presence of zinc we measured formation constants log &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, log &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, and log &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> of 7.35, 14.30, and 19.71, corresponding to the formation of 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 ligand-Zn(II) complexes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Potentiometric experiments were also carried out with ZAC989 and CuSO<sub>4</sub> and with CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and the data indicated that ZAC989 chelates copper, whereas binding of calcium and magnesium is negligible. ZAC989 bound copper with the formation constants log &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, log &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, and log &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> of 7.83, 13.37, and 20.62, respectively.

The affinity constant of this probe for zinc is 2.2 nM (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), which is weaker than that of most zinc-binding proteins, and thus it reports only the free or weakly bound zinc ions. The probe localizes to the internal membrane system, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. albicans</named-content> (L. Kjellerup, A. L. Winther, D. Wilson, and A. T. Fuglsang, submitted for publication). A decreased Zinbo-5 fluorescent signal in the presence of fungal cells, compound, and zinc would indicate that intracellular Zinbo-5 is competing with the added compound for zinc ions. ZAC307 and ZAC989 were evaluated at a concentration of 25 &#x003bc;M, equivalent to 7 &#x003bc;g/ml and 9 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively. ZAC989 induced a time-dependent decrease in Zinbo-5 fluorescence, similarly to 1.3 &#x003bc;g/ml of TPEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). ZAC307 decreased the Zinbo-5 fluorescence after only 1 h of incubation, and this decrease was greater than that observed for ZAC989 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), despite ZAC307 having a 5-fold-lower affinity for zinc than ZAC989. These data suggested that ZAC307, ZAC989, and TPEN were cell permeative and bound intracellular zinc.

Thus, when the cytoplasmic zinc content is high enough, ZafA becomes saturated with Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions and adopts a transcriptionally inactive conformation.

The set of genes investigated was selected based on a genome-wide transcription analysis of <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> grown under zinc-limiting conditions that had been performed previously in our laboratory (J. A. Calera, unpublished data), using the primers listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>. All selected ZafA target genes were induced by ZafA under zinc-limiting conditions with the exception of the putative zinc storage vacuole transporter <italic>zrcA</italic>, which was repressed by ZafA under zinc-limiting conditions (Calera, unpublished). As expected, the relative expression levels of all ZafA target genes induced by ZafA under zinc-limiting conditions were dramatically reduced, to almost undetectable levels, upon the addition of Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast, the expression level of the <italic>zrcA</italic> gene, which was repressed by ZafA, and most of the genes not regulated by ZafA increased under zinc-replete conditions to different extents, with the exception of <italic>actA</italic>, whose expression level remained similar to that observed before the zinc shock. Interestingly, exposure to either ZAC307 or ZAC989 inhibited the expression of the ZafA target genes similarly. We also observed reduced expression levels for most of the investigated genes that were not regulated by ZafA following ZAC307 exposure.

The compounds ZAC307 and ZAC989 possess a characteristic arrangement of an aromatic structure with nitrogen bound in close proximity to a hydroxyl group. This structural arrangement led us to speculate whether ZAC307 and ZAC989 were metal chelators. To address this hypothesis, we synthesized ZAC623 as a control compound where the hydroxyl group is replaced with an amino group, and as expected, this compound lacked metal-chelating and antifungal properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The metal-chelating compounds EDTA and TPEN have previously been described as antifungal compounds (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>); thus, they were selected as comparators in this study.</p><p>Our findings indicate that ZAC307 and ZAC989 chelate both zinc and copper, with zinc ions being most effective in reversing the growth-inhibitory effects of the ZACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">D</xref>). The ZACs have lower affinity for iron and negligible affinity for magnesium and calcium. The ZACs are less potent zinc chelators than the known zinc, copper, and iron chelators TPEN and EDTA, but they inhibit fungal growth more effectively than EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>). The inhibitory effects of the ZACs can be inactivated by the addition of excess zinc in both <named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida albicans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aspergillus fumigatus</named-content>, which indicates that these compounds interfere either directly or indirectly with fungal zinc homeostasis.</p><p>The first challenge that any microorganism faces in the homeostatic response to zinc deficiency is to obtain zinc from the surrounding environment. The major components of the zinc uptake system in <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> that facilitates zinc uptake from zinc-limiting media are the ZIP plasma membrane transporters ZrfA, ZrfB, and ZrfC. The ZrfA and ZrfB transporters operate mainly under acidic zinc-limiting conditions (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), although they also contribute to zinc uptake from alkaline zinc-limiting media along with ZrfC (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), which is expressed exclusively in alkaline media (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that if the ZACs inhibited the intake of zinc mediated by these transporters, the growth capacity of a wild-type strain in the presence of ZACs should be reduced to the same level as that of fungal mutant strains lacking the acidic (ZrfA and ZrfB) and/or the alkaline (ZrfC) zinc transporter. The investigation of the growth capacity of a &#x00394;<italic>zrfC</italic> mutant in the presence of the ZACs suggested that ZrfC plays an important role in overcoming ZAC inhibition, since deletion of <italic>zrfC</italic> increased the sensitivity of <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> to these compounds (AF14 versus AF54 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">E</xref>]). Hence, it could be possible that the actual effect of ZACs on the &#x00394;<italic>zrfA</italic> &#x00394;<italic>zrfB</italic> strain was masked to some extent by the ZrfC function. As expected, the AF721 strain lacking <italic>zrfC</italic> did not grow under zinc-limiting conditions, and the effects of these compounds on this strain could therefore not be tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). However, we observed that ZAC989 noticeably inhibited the growth capacity of AF721 in the presence of 50 &#x003bc;M zinc. Thus, it is plausible that ZAC989 interfered with a zinc homeostatic process other than zinc uptake. Furthermore, the higher growth capacity of the &#x00394;<italic>zrfC</italic> strain in the absence of ZACs than of the wild-type, AF48, or AF731 strain suggested that the lack of <italic>zrfC</italic> in AF54 may have been compensated for by the overexpression of <italic>zrfA</italic> and <italic>zrfB</italic>, as reported previously (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). On the other hand, the stronger growth inhibition of the growth capacity of the AF54 strain in the presence of ZAC307 and ZAC989 than of the wild-type, AF48, or AF731 strain suggested that the levels of expression of the <italic>zrfA</italic> and <italic>zrfB</italic> genes in AF54 were insufficient to counteract the effects of ZAC307 and ZAC989. Taken together, these results suggest that both ZAC307 and ZAC989 interfered negatively with the expression of the genes encoding zinc transporters rather than with their zinc uptake function. Indeed, gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR suggested that the antifungal effects of ZAC307 and ZAC989 were mediated through a mechanism that ultimately results in inhibition of the transcriptional activation activity of ZafA. In addition, and since ZafA activity was inactivated by zinc under physiological conditions, the effects of ZAC307 and ZAC989 on the expression of ZafA-regulated genes could be exerted either directly, upon their binding to ZafA, or indirectly by increasing the cytosolic concentration of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions that would bind to and inactivate ZafA. Although direct binding of ZAC307 or ZAC989 to ZafA was an attractive possibility, we consider it more likely that the ZACs triggered a transient rise in the cytosolic concentration of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions by favoring their releasing from cytosolic zinc ligands and/or zinc storage compartments (e.g., the vacuole). For the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, we observed that the ZACs promote a decrease in the available zinc levels within the internal membrane system, including the ER, in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. albicans</named-content>. This decrease can be explained either by a direct competition between Zinbo-5 and ZACs within these compartments or by promotion by the ZACs of the release of zinc from the ER into the cytosol. The latter scenario could induce a higher concentration of zinc in the cytosol, and if the same situation occurs in <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content>, this could explain the decrease in transcription of the ZafA-induced genes, similar to when zinc is added extracellularly. Moreover, since most intracellular eukaryotic zinc proteins bind zinc with a higher affinity than ZACs (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> values for most zinc-binding proteins are between 0.1 and 1.0 pM) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), it is more likely that these compounds interfere with the regulation of zinc homeostasis by promoting the release of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions from intracellular storage compartments. Nevertheless, since acidification of cytoplasm can also promote zinc release from cytoplasmic zinc ligands (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), it could also be possible that the ZACs disturbed the activity of proteins involved in maintaining the pH homeostasis of the cytoplasm. In this regard, we observed that the expression level of <italic>pmaA</italic> was higher under zinc-replete than under zinc-limiting conditions. This finding suggests a putative interplay between the function of PmaA and the Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport capacity of the fungal zinc transporters, provided that the expression level of the <italic>pmaA</italic> gene correlated with the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (PmaA) activity. It is known that the accumulation of zinc into the vacuole by CDF transporters (e.g., ZrcA) is mediated through a Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter mechanism and relies on the proton gradient generated by the V-ATPase (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In contrast, and although it is not completely known how ZIP proteins transport zinc across the plasma membrane, it seems that it is not dependent on the proton gradient generated by the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase but is pH dependent, such that intracellular acidification increases zinc transport, whereas extracellular acidification decreases zinc transport (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In this regard, it is plausible that under the alkaline zinc-limiting conditions provided by sRPMI medium, a low PmaA activity would increase intracellular acidification to favor zinc uptake by ZIP transporters located in the plasma membrane. In contrast, a high PmaA activity under zinc-replete conditions would reduce intracellular acidification and increase extracellular acidification (e.g., to counteract the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-induced dissipation of the electrochemical gradient that is essential for fungal survival). The same reasoning could be applied to zinc transport by the ZrfF ZIP transporter located in the vacuolar membrane, such that the intravacuolar pH, which is kept lower than the cytosolic pH under normal conditions via V-ATPase activity, would favor the exit of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cytosol. However, the unexpected finding that ZAC307 reduces <italic>pmaA</italic> expression suggested that it might interfere with the putative mechanism that links the regulation of zinc homeostasis with the function of PmaA.</p><p>The ZACs display broad-spectrum fungistatic activity and exhibit a low propensity for acquired resistance development compared to that of fluconazole. Additionally, they are superior antifungal agents to the nonpermeative chelator EDTA, and our RT-qPCR data suggest that the ZACs affect fungal zinc homeostasis differently from the very potent chelator TPEN. Therefore, the ZACs act distinctly from either EDTA or TPEN, both of which have previously been investigated as antifungal agents. EDTA has been evaluated as a combination treatment together with amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) in an invasive pulmonary aspergillosis model in immunosuppressed rats. The combination of EDTA with ABLC led to improved survival times and a lower tissue burden of <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> than with either agent alone (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Furthermore, TPEN has been shown to significantly increase survival after 7 days compared to that with vehicle treatment in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Moreover, administration of either of the two zinc-chelating agents phenanthroline and TPEN has been shown to lead to significant improvements in survival with concomitant reduction in fungal burden in immunosuppressed mice intranasally infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content>. Finally, it was shown that TPEN given in combination with caspofungin significantly increased survival times in murine models of invasive aspergillosis compared to that with either drug alone (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>There is an unmet need for novel antifungal agents with broad-spectrum antifungal activity and low potential for resistance development for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. With potent antifungal activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, the ZACs fulfill these criteria, and their advancement in a drug development program is therefore warranted. Interestingly, the ZACs and EDTA did not inhibit mammalian cell proliferation considerably within the first 24 h of exposure (EC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003e; 28 &#x003bc;g/ml), in contrast to TPEN (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.6 &#x003bc;g/ml), and even after 72 h of ZAC exposure, we observed a &#x0003e;12-fold selectivity index in growth inhibition between <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. albicans</named-content> and HepG2 cells; the index between <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. fumigatus</named-content> and HepG2 cells was limited. However, it should be taken into account that metal ions are crucial in every cellular system, including the host. Therefore, any intervention aiming to treat an infection through ion sequestration must deal with the delicate balance between positive and negative effects in both the pathogen and the host. The therapeutic safety window as well as whether the ZACs can induce zinc deficiency in the host still needs to be addressed. In summary, interfering with fungal zinc-dependent processes represents a promising new approach to antifungal therapy, and this series of zinc-attenuating compounds represents a potentially new class of antifungal agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec4-1"><title>Synthesis of ZAC307, ZAC989, and ZAC623.</title><p>ZAC307 {2-[6-(dimethylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl]-5-phenyl-pyrazol-3-ol} synthesis pathway: (a) (i) <italic>N</italic>-methylmethanamine, TEA, 2-propanol, 0&#x000b0;C, 2 h, evaporate, (ii) hydrazine hydrate, reflux, 2 h, column chromatography, yield 65%; (b) ethyl 3-oxo-3-phenyl-propanoate-2-propanol, reflux, 1 h, yield: 69%, <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (400 MHz; DMSO-<italic>d<sub>6</sub></italic>, d): 13.2 (1H, bs), 8.49 (1H, d), 7.89 (2H, bd), 7.43 (3H, m), 6.92 (1H, bs), 6.13 (H, s), and 3.17 (6H, s).</p><p>ZAC989 {3-[(3<italic>S</italic>)-1-[6-(5-hydroxy-3-methyl-pyrazol-1-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl]pyrrolidin-3-yl]oxy-pyridine-4-carbonitrile} synthesis pathway: (a) NaH, abs. <italic>tert</italic>-butyl (3S)-3-hydroxypyrrolidine-1-carboxylate, THF, 0&#x000b0;C, 3 h, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 82%; (b) diethyl ether, conc.
