TGF-&#x003b2; signals via Smad and non-Smad pathways. Under normal conditions, wild-type p53 forms a complex with Smad2/3 and co-activates transcription of a variety of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in tumor suppressive effects. Thus, p53 stability is essential in progression of tumor suppressive responses mediated by TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. However, it remains unknown whether p53 stability is regulated by TGF-&#x003b2;. In the current study, we identify that USP15 binds to and stabilizes p53 through deubiquitination in U2OS and HEK293 cells. TGF-&#x003b2; promotes the translation of USP15 through activation of mammalian target of rapamycin by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway. Upregulation of USP15 translation links the crosstalk between TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and p53 stability, allowing this cytokine to have a critical role in cancer progression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) is a pleiotropic cytokine with a dual role in cancer progression. In the early stages of progression, TGF-&#x003b2; acts as a tumor suppressor that regulates the transcription of tumor suppressor genes, inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell cytostasis, apoptosis and autophagy. Paradoxically, TGF-&#x003b2; can also function as a tumor promoter in the advanced stages of cancers, supporting tumor cell motility, survival, invasion, metastasis and immune evasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Thus, to understand the molecular mechanisms for TGF-&#x003b2; and the regulation of cancer progression will provide vital information and help to develop targeted therapeutics. TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is initiated upon binding of TGF-&#x003b2; to its receptor (TGF-&#x003b2;RII), leading to the formation of a heterotetrameric complex with TGF-&#x003b2;R1 and to subsequent phosphorylation of TGF-&#x003b2;R1 by TGF-&#x003b2;RII. The cytosolic transcription factors, Smad2 and Smad3, are recruited and phosphorylated by the active TGF-&#x003b2; receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> After dissociation from the TGF-&#x003b2; receptors, phosphorylated Smad2/3 form a complex with the co-Smad (Smad4) and are translocated into the nucleus where the transcription complex regulates the expression of numerous target genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> In addition, TGF-&#x003b2; signaling also includes several non-Smad pathways. The active TGF-&#x003b2; receptors can activate downstream ligands. These non-Smad pathways include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, INK/p38, Ras-ERK and RhoA pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> The cooperation between Smad and non-Smad pathways determines the ultimate consequence of cellular reactions to TGF-&#x003b2;.</p><p>The linkage between p53 and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling was first pointed out by Wyllie <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Inactivation of p53 disrupted the cellular response to TGF-&#x003b2; treatment. More recent studies have demonstrated crosstalk between p53 and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, indicating that p53 can act as a component of Smad complexes, participate in the stabilization of Smad-DNA complexes and regulate a myriad of tumor suppressor genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Therefore, stabilization of p53 is essential in maintaining cooperation with TGF-&#x003b2; signaling.</p><p>However, it remains unknown whether TGF-&#x003b2; can regulate the stability of p53. In this study, we demonstrate that TGF-&#x003b2; can upregulate the translation of USP15 through the PI3K/AKT pathway, in turn resulting in stabilizing p53 through deubiquitination.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>USP15 binds to and stabilizes p53</title><p>In our yeast two-hybrid screen and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay, we have identified peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) in association with USP15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). PADI4 is a p53-binding protein which regulates the expression of p53 target genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> We wished to determine whether USP15 also binds to p53. The interaction between USP15 and p53 was verified by GST pull-down assays. The GST-USP15 fusion protein was prepared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and incubated with His<sub>6</sub>-p53. The GST-USP15:His<sub>6</sub>-p53 complex co-precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose, suggesting that USP15 directly associates with p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The p53-binding site was located at the C-terminal region of USP15, as evidenced by the GST pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). USP15 binding to p53 in cells was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), suggesting that USP15 forms a complex with p53. To determine whether USP15 can stabilize p53 in cells, Flag-USP15 was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Western blot analysis indicated that overexpression of Flag-USP15 increased the stability of p53, in turn leading to an increased expression of p21, a p53 regulated target gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The residue Cys-269 is the active site of USP15.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Replacement of Cys-269 with Ser results in loss of the USP15 enzymatic activity. Overexpression of an inactive USP15 C269S did not increase the stability of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This replacement did not disrupt the complex formation of USP15 with p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), suggesting that USP15 stabilization of p53 is dependent on its enzyme activity. The levels of endogenous p53 in HEK293 cells were reduced by treatment with shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). However, co-overexpression of USP15 in the p53-knockdowned cells can increase the levels of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p><p>Cells were pre-treated with shRNAs to knockdown USP15. The levels of endogenous USP15 in HEK293 cells were reduced after treatment with shRNAs, concomitant with the reduction of cellular p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This scenario was also observed in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In addition, co-overexpression of shRNA-insensitive USP15 cDNA in USP15-knockdowned cells can increase the levels of the recombinant USP15 and, in turn, upregulate the levels of the cellular p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Overexpression of USP15 increased the half-life of endogenous p53, but overexpression of the inactive USP15 C269S failed to increase the half-life of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c and d</xref>). Moreover, pre-treatment with shRNA, to knockdown the endogenous USP15, significantly reduced p53 stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2e and f</xref>). Taken together, the results suggest that USP15 can bind to p53 and regulate its stability.</p></sec><sec><title>USP15 deubiquitinates p53</title><p>To examine whether USP15 can deubiquitinate p53, the effect of USP15 on p53 that had been ubiquitinated by overexpressed MDM2 was determined. Ubiquitination of p53 increased when ubiquitin and MDM2 were co-transfected into HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). A reduction of MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53 was observed following overexpression of USP15 in cells. However, co-transfection of an inactive USP15 C269S failed to show this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). MDM2 overexpression reduced p53 stability whereas the stability was recovered following co-transfection with USP15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3b and c</xref>). In addition, p53 localization in cells was also regulated by USP15 through deubiquitination of p53. The polyubiquitinated forms of p53 in cytosol were increased when HEK293 cells were transfected with MDM2. However, these forms of p53 were reduced in cytosol but increased in nucleus following co-transfection of USP15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Competitive recognition of both MDM2 and p53 by USP15</title><p>The mechanism for USP15 to block p53-ubiquitination mediated by MDM2 was analyzed. MDM2 can form a complex with p53 and catalyze p53-ubiquitination. When the MDM2/p53 complex was incubated with USP15, the original complex was disassembled and the new complex, MDM2/USP15, was formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Inactivation of USP15 by replacement of the active site, Cys-269, with Ala, did not affect the competitive recognition of both MDM2 and p53 by USP15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>TGF-&#x003b2; promotes USP15 production</title><p>It is important to elucidate the signaling mechanism that modulates production of USP15. This could explain how enhanced p53 stability mediates the cell cycle and cell apoptosis. DNA damage induced by doxorubicin can promote the accumulation of p53.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> However, when HEK293 cells were treated with doxorubicin, the levels of USP15 were decreased in the time-course assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that USP15 is not involved in p53 accumulation induced by DNA damage. The cytokine(s) which upregulates the production of USP15 remains unknown. There are several reports implying that TGF-&#x003b2; may upregulate USP15.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Indeed, when U2OS cells were treated with TGF-&#x003b2;, the levels of USP15 were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a and b</xref>), concomitant with an increase in p53 stability and synthesis of p21. USP15 knockdown disrupted p53 stability and p21 synthesis mediated by TGF-&#x003b2;, indicating that TGF-&#x003b2; modulated p53 stability through upregulation of USP15 synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Upregulation of USP15 by TGF-&#x003b2; is not due to an increase in USP15 transcription. No effect on the mRNA levels of USP15 was observed after TGF-&#x003b2; treatment in the time-course assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Upregulation of USP15 by TGF-&#x003b2; was also observed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). In the presence MG132 that inhibits proteasome activity, treatment with TGF-&#x003b2; increases USP15 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). In addition, in the presence of cycloheximide that blocks translation, the levels of USP15 increased by TGF-&#x003b2; treatments were blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Taken together, TGF-&#x003b2; enhanced USP15 production was due to upregulation of its translation and not by suppression of USP15 degradation.</p></sec><sec><title>TGF-&#x003b2; upregulates the translation of USP15 through a non-smad pathway</title><p>TGF-&#x003b2; signaling can regulate protein synthesis through the PI3K/AKT pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> TGF-&#x003b2; treatment can activate the AKT activity, as judged by an increased level of phospho-AKT (ser-473) in the time-course assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a and b</xref>). The key regulator of protein synthesis is mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream effector in the PI3K/AKT pathway mediated by TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, which activates S6 kinase and initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) via phosphorylation, thereby promoting translational capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Indeed, TGF-&#x003b2; can increase the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and upregulate the synthesis of USP15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c and d</xref>). Pre-treatment with LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, or with MK2206, an inhibitor of AKT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), or with rapamycin or RAD001 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), the inhibitor of mTOR, blocked the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 mediated by the PI3K/AKT pathway, and disrupted upregulation of USP15 synthesis mediated by TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c and d</xref>). In addition, the biological effects of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling on cell proliferation were also analyzed. TGF-&#x003b2; treatment suppressed the cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Knockdown of USP15 without TGF-&#x003b2; treatment promoted the cell proliferation. The cell proliferation of USP15-knockdowned cells was suppressed after treatment with TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that TGF-&#x003b2; signaling can regulate p53 stability through upregulation of USP15 translation mediated by the PI3K/AKT pathway and partly elucidate why TGF-&#x003b2; can suppress cancer progression in early stages when cells express wild-type p53.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that USP15 binds to p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b and c</xref>). USP15 can stabilize p53 through deubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a&#x02013;d</xref>) and upregulate the p53 transcriptional activity, in turn promoting the expression of p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Our results confirmed a previous report that overexpression of USP15 can upregulate the transcriptional activity of p53.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> We have also demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2; signaling can upregulate USP15 synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Upregulation of USP15 synthesis results from activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, the time for the augmented USP15 expression in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is later than that of the activation for the PI3K/AKT pathway, but it is earlier than that of the increased levels of p53, followed by an increased expression of p21 in the time-course assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a and b</xref>). In the presence of the inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, or an inhibitor of AKT, MK2206, or an inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin or RAD001, to block the PI3K/AKT pathway, TGF-&#x003b2; upregulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was reduced and levels of USP15 synthesis were suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is one of the key steps for mTOR to upregulate protein translation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> USP15 knockdown abolished p53 stabilization by TGF-&#x003b2; signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and suppressed the transcriptional activity of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><p>Wild-type p53 has a key role in the anti-tumor effects of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, which sends a signal to promote p53 stability, allowing this anti-tumor protein to be accumulated and consequently recruited to its DNA-binding sites on chromatin. This specific TGF-&#x003b2; signaling for stabilization of p53 was identified in our study. U2OS and HEK293 cells displaying the wild-type p53 are considered as the cell lines more close to the early stages of cancer. TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in U2OS and HEK293 cells promotes p53 stability through upregulation of USP15 translation by the PI3K/AKT pathway. The wild-type p53 can be sustained at a higher concentration by TGF-&#x003b2; signaling to promote TGF-&#x003b2;-induced tumor suppression. That USP15 has a key factor in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling to suppress the cell growth was also observed in the immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Cell growth of HaCaT cells was arrested by treatment with TGF-&#x003b2; and knockdown of USP15 impairs this TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent growth arrest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup></p><p>However, in advanced cancer, TGF-&#x003b2; signaling can also mediate USP15 to promote oncogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> In glioblastoma, USP15 associates with the SMAD7-SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 to form a ternary complex. USP15 in this trimeric complex deubiquitinates and stabilizes type 1 TGF-&#x003b2; receptor, upregulating the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and providing a critically pathogenic factor for glioblastoma. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, USP15 is required for metastasis triggered by TGF-&#x003b2; signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> The role of USP15 in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is complicated and has a dual function in regulation of cancer progression. Switch of USP15 function in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling from a tumor suppressor to a promoter is highly dependent on the stages of cancer cells. Apparently, USP15 appears to be an important therapeutic target for cancer.</p><p>Domain-mapping studies revealed that the first ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain ranging from residue-114 to &#x02212;278 of USP15 associates with MDM2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> whereas p53 binds to the C-terminal region (residues-548&#x02013;953) of USP15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Although MDM2 and p53 interact with the different regions of USP15, USP15/p53/MDM2 cannot form a ternary complex. On the contrary, USP15 competitively recognizes both p53 and MDM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The deubiquitination activity of USP15 is not essential in this competitive recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), but is required in stabilization of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Taken together, we suggested that USP15 disrupts the MDM2/p53 complex and forms two new complexes, USP15/MDM2 and USP15/p53. The herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (also named as USP7) can be activated by ATM to stabilize p53 response to DNA damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> However, DNA damage cannot increase the USP15 production to stabilize p53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). USP7 can also competitively recognize both p53 and MDM2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> However, USP7 and USP15 may carry out the different mechanism in this action. The molecular mechanism for competitive recognition of p53 and MDM2 by USP7 has been well elucidated by the co-crystal structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> USP7 contains one unique tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated factor (TRAF)-like domain that is not found in other members of USP family in human.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> Both MDM2 and p53 bind to the TRAF-like domain of USP7 in a mutually exclusive manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Especially, both MDM2 and p53 binds to the same key sequence, <sup>164</sup>DWGF<sup>167</sup>, of TRAF-like domain in USP7. Other different residues of TRAF-like domain also interact with MDM2, but not with p53, and vice versa, accounting for USP7 binding to MDM2 and p53 with the different affinities. Indeed, USP7 has a higher affinity with MDM2 than with p53. USP15 lacks the TRAF-like domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> The first Ubl domain of USP15 does not contain the DWGF sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> It remained unknown whether USP15 shows a different affinity with MDM2 and p53. Molecular recognition of MDM2 and p53 by USP15 needs to be characterized.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Anti-p53 (Cat.
