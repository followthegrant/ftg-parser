For diagnosis, the Kato-Katz (KK) method is recommended, however, this method showed low accuracy in areas of low endemicity. This study aimed to characterize the cytokine and chemokine profile of individuals with an extremely low parasite load (&#x0003c;4 eggs per gram of feces), e.g., individuals who were detected by alternative parasitological methods, such as the saline gradient and/or Helmintex&#x000ae;. In order to search for immunological markers for infection, the immunological profile in serum samples of these individuals was then compared with patients detected with the KK method and with a higher parasite load and with individuals repetitively negative by extensive stool exams. The study was conducted in Northern Minas Gerais in a rural area of the Municipality of Janu&#x000e1;ria. Serum samples of a total of 139 parasitologically well-characterized individuals were assessed for the following immunological markers by commercially available immunoassays: TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-33, IL-27, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL10, CCL11, and CCL17. As a result, there were no significant differences in concentrations or frequencies for immunological markers between egg-negative individuals or individuals with ultra-low (&#x0003c;4 epg) or low (4&#x02013;99 epg) parasite loads. However, we found significant correlations between egg counts and eosinophil counts and between egg counts and IL-1&#x003b2; or TNF-&#x003b1; concentrations. The most striking alterations were found in individuals with the highest parasite load (&#x02265;100 epg). They had significantly higher TNF-&#x003b1; concentrations in serum when compared with individuals with a low parasite load (4&#x02013;99 epg) and CCL17 concentrations were significantly elevated when compared with egg-negative individuals. Radar diagrams of frequencies for cytokine and chemokine responders in each infection group confirmed a distinct profile only in the infection group with highest parasite loads (&#x02265;100 epg).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic></kwd><kwd>humans</kwd><kwd>low parasite load</kwd><kwd>immunological markers</kwd><kwd>CCL17</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="66"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="9120"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schistosomiasis is a-chronic disease with estimates of more than 250 million infected people. Of these, the biggest part, about 201.5 million infected individuals, lives in Africa (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In Brazil, the only species found is <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>. Here, as in other parts of the world, the disease is still considered a public health problem and, most recently, it was estimated that around 1.5 million people are infected (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and 25 million people live in endemic areas at risk of infection (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). One of the main advances in the control of schistosomiasis was the implementation of the Brazilian Schistosomiasis Control Program (BSCP) in the 1970s, following the recommendations of the World Health Organization. One of the pillars of BSCP is the readily detection of infected individuals by large scale stool examinations, using the Kato-Katz (KK) method (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and the subsequent treatment, in order to minimize mortality and morbidity of the affected population (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Nowadays, with the advances of schistosomiasis control worldwide, the goals of WHO have moved from reduction of mortality rates and reduce morbidity to transmission control and even eradication in some areas (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Other positive effects of the ongoing efforts on schistosomiasis control include significant reduction of prevalences and of individual parasite loads in endemic populations (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). As a consequence, most of the infected individuals in Brazil harbor low parasite loads, which are hardly detected by the commonly applied parasitological methods (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), as initially recommended by the WHO (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, if health services seek to advance to transmission control or even eradication, more sensitive diagnostic methods have to be integrated in endemic areas, as it was shown by Oliveira et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>During their development in the human body, the different parasitic stages of schistosomes induce significant alterations in the immune response, both during the acute and chronic phase of infection (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In the course of the infection, the parasite-specific immune response is modulated from a type 1, inflammatory and cell-mediated, to a type 2, and more antibody-dependent immune response (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In schistosomiasis endemic areas, most of the infected individuals exhibit the intestinal asymptomatic form of the disease and are normally detected already during the chronic phase of infection (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The majority of these studies on immune responses in humans are based on <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with schistosome antigens and the detection of intracellular transcription of cytokine or chemokine genes or detection of secretion patterns in cell culture supernatants. Even in stimulated PBMC cultures, such cytokine and chemokine secretion patterns sometimes are subtle and depend on the parasite load and clinical status of the individuals (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) or may even be influenced by co-infections (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Nevertheless, studies with different schistosome species (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and studies on co-infections with soil-transmitted helminths and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) indicated that systemic inflammatory or chemokine markers and/or type 2 responses might be used as surrogate markers of infection and might be of value for diagnostic purposes.</p><p>Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the serum cytokine and chemokine profile of <italic>S. mansoni</italic>-infected individuals from an endemic area in Brazil in the search for surrogate immunological markers for infection. Here, a special attention was drawn to individuals with medium to low parasite burdens, where common parasitological procedures may be negative and present with reduced sensitivities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical Standards</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the Resolution CNS N&#x000b0; 466/12 from the National Brazilian Research Council and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Centro de Pesquisas Ren&#x000e9; Rachou (Fiocruz) and by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Minas Gerais,and is registered at the National Brazilian Platform for Research with Human Subjects under the following number: CAAE # 21824513.9.0000.5091 with written informed consent from all subjects. In the case of minors, additional written informed consent was obtained from their parents or guardians. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>The study was conducted in the district of Brejo do Amparo, Municipality of Janu&#x000e1;ria, about 600 km north of the capital Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais. According to the local health authorities, the local population at the rural communities Corregos Santana, Tocantins, and P&#x000e9; da Serra did not participate in any schistosomiasis control campaign during the last 2 years prior to the beginning of the study.</p><p>In this rural population, the initial prevalence for <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection after parasitological screening with the KK method, as recommended by the World Health Organization (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), was 20.4%. However, after extensive parasitological examinations with different methods, such as up to 18 KK slides from three fecal samples, saline gradient, and Helmintex&#x000ae;, the prevalence reached 45.9% (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>A longitudinal study was initiated in the area, where ~250 individuals were examined by parasitological methods (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Individuals with a positive result for <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs were examined again 30 days after treatment with praziquantel, where parasitological cure was confirmed. Further follow-up visits took place for the whole population at several time points after treatment.</p><p>Out of a total population of ~270 individuals, 250 subjects signed the consent forms, but only 139 patients provided the required three fecal samples for thorough parasitological examinations. For the present immunological study, 139 individuals were enrolled, of which 113 were egg-positive for <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection. Twenty-six egg-negative individuals served as uninfected controls and were negative for any intestinal protozoan or helminth parasite in extensive parasitological stool examinations, as stated above.</p><p>Blood samples (5 ml EDTA tubes) were drawn from these 139 individuals and complete hemograms were performed for each participant by a commercial clinical laboratory (Millenium, Janu&#x000e1;ria). For serum collection, 5&#x02013;10 ml of venous blood was collected in siliconized tubes. After clotting samples were centrifuged at 2.000 rpm for 15 min and obtained serum samples were aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C at the field laboratory in Janu&#x000e1;ria. Subsequently, these serum samples were transferred to the main university laboratory and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C, until used in immunological assays. From the 113 <italic>S. mansoni</italic>-infected and treated individuals, 78 cured individuals provided blood and were included in the follow-up immunological study at 3 months post-treatment. The extensive parasitological exams, as described in more detail below, allowed us to classify the individuals from the endemic area into different groups and investigate and compare their immunological profiles in the peripheral blood. The classification of the parasite loads based on KK results in the different infection groups was done according to the WHO (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, mean individual epg values were calculated from a total of six KK slides from three fecal samples, as recommended by others (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) As such, the minimum epg value that could be detected by KK was 4 epg and, therefore, individuals only detected by the other parasitological methods were classified as ultra low or &#x0003c;4 epg. Infected individuals detected by the KK method were classified as low (4&#x02013;99 epg) or medium to high (&#x02265;100 epg). The Negative group contained individuals negative for schistosome eggs in any of the parasitological exams, without any other intestinal coinfections, and with eosinophil counts in peripheral blood below 500 per mm<sup>3</sup>. The last group consisted of egg-positive and praziquantel-treated individuals, who were confirmed cured at 30 days post-treatment with 24 KK slides, and remained without reinfection 3 months after chemotherapy with praziquantel, confirmed with Helmintex&#x000ae;, saline gradient, and six KK slides from three fecal samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Fecal Examinations</title><sec><title>Kato-Katz Method</title><p>Before treatment, Helm Test (Biomanguinhos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) was performed with three fecal samples collected on consecutive days, as described by Katz et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). From the first sample, up to 14 thick smears were mounted and examined under the microscope. Samples two and three were examined by two slides each. Three months after treatment, three fecal samples from the cured individuals were reexamined, again with two KK slides in each sample, in order to check for possible <italic>S. mansoni</italic> reinfection.</p></sec><sec><title>Modified Helmintex&#x000ae;</title><p>Thirty grams of feces were collected, homogenized in 10% formaldehyde, and purified by successive sieving processes. Subsequently, the sediment was placed in a 15 ml plastic tube and mixed with 5 ml ethyl acetate, according to Ritchie (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). After centrifugation, the sediment was removed from the plastic tube and transferred in a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube, adding 19 &#x003bc;L of paramagnetic beads (Mylteni, Germany). The samples were shook for 1 h on an orbital shaker and then exposed to a strong magnetic field for 3 min (BioMag&#x000ae;, Polysciences, USA). The final sediment trapped, to the walls of the reaction tube, was mixed with a few drops of saline (NaCl 0.9%), transferred onto a glass slide, and examined under the microscope for the presence of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs, as described else where (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Saline Gradient</title><p>Briefly, the apparatus consists of two interconnected cylindrical columns, with the lower column containing 500 mg of feces suspended in 0.9% saline solution. The purification of the fecal suspension with heavy schistosome eggs is guaranteed by a slow flow of a 3% saline solution from the upper column. Approximately 60 min after applying the slow flow of the concentrated saline solution, the suspension in the lower column was discarded and the remaining sediment transferred on microscope slides in order to search for <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Cytokine and Chemokine Concentrations in Peripheral Blood</title><p>In order to search for immunological markers of infection, peripheral blood serum samples from egg-negative endemic individuals, and egg-positive individuals were screened for the following cytokines and chemokines: IL-1&#x003b2; (3.9&#x02013;500 pg/ml), IL-6 (4.68&#x02013;600 pg/ml), TNF-&#x003b1; (7.8&#x02013;1,000 pg/ml), IL-27 (78.13&#x02013;10,000 pg/ml), CXCL10 (15.63&#x02013;2,000), CCL3 (3.9&#x02013;500 pg/ml), IL-17A (7.8&#x02013;1,000 pg/ml), IL-10 (15.63&#x02013;2,000 pg/ml), IL-5 (11.72&#x02013;1500 pg/ml), IL- 13 (46&#x02013;6,000 pg/ml), IL-33 (11.72&#x02013;1,500 pg/ml), pg/ml), CCL5 (7.8&#x02013;1,000 pg/ml), CCL11 (7.8&#x02013;1,000 pg/ml), and CCL17 (3.9&#x02013;500 pg/ml). The assays were run in duplicate, final concentrations extrapolated from a standard curve, and were expressed in pg/ml, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Duo Set kits, R&#x00026;D Systems, USA).</p><p>Briefly, Costar half area microplates (Corning, USA) were sensitized with the respective capture antibodies, specific for each cytokine and chemokine and, subsequently incubated overnight at room temperature (RT). On the following day, after a washing step with PBS/ Tween-20 (0.05%), the microplates were blocked with diluent solution (PBS/ 1% BSA) and incubated for 1 h at RT. After another washing step, diluted serum samples (1:2 in diluent solution) and standards were added and incubated for 2 h at RT. Subsequently, plates were washed (5x), incubated with the diluted and biotinylated detection antibodies, and incubated for another 2 h at RT. Thereafter, plates were washed again (5x) and incubated for 20 min with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:200 in reagent diluent) at RT in the dark. After a last washing step (5x), substrate solution (1:1 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and tetramethylbenzidine solution) was added and plates incubated for 20 min. Finally, stop solution (4N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) was added and the color reaction read in an automated ELISA reader at 450 nm (Molecular Devices, Versa Max microplate reader). Sample concentrations were extrapolated from the standard curve, using a 4-point curve-fitting program (Softmax Pro 6.4), and considering the sample dilutions.</p></sec><sec><title>Frequency Profiles of Responders for Cytokines and Chemokines</title><p>Additional analyses of cytokine and chemokine data included frequency data of responders in each group of individuals, in order to check whether the response pattern was different between the infection groups and in comparison with egg-negative individuals and whether it changed after treatment in each infection group.</p><p>For this purpose, each individual cytokine and chemokine concentration was evaluated and defined as a positive response (responder), if the concentration showed a considerable value above the lowest detectable value of the standard curve of each of the different cytokines and chemokines. For IL-&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL,5, IL-6, IL-13, CCL3, CCL11, CCL17 was 10 pg/ml. For IL-10, IL-17A, IL-27 the cut-off was set to 50 pg/ml and for CXCL10, CCL5, and IL-33 it was set to 100 pg/ml (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software package (GraphPad Prism, USA) and Excel. Initially, a descriptive analysis was performed (median and interquartile ranges). Subsequently, the variables were analyzed with specific tests according to the data distribution and compared between the different groups. The normal distribution of the continuous data was verified and discarded through the Shapiro-Wilk test. Non-parametric data were compared between groups, using Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post test. The analyses of paired samples before and after treatment were done with the Wilcoxon test. Categorical variables were compared using Pearson's chi square test. Also, associations between different variables were analyzed with Spearman's rank test.

Individuals with such a low parasite burden are hardly detected by the control programs, using the commonly applied KK method. However, by combining several parasitological methods, we were able to show that a considerably higher percentage of the population was actually infected with schistosomes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The study area matches the present epidemiological situation in many endemic Brazilian regions, where frequent treatment cycles have led to a considerable reduction of clinical cases and morbidity and reductions in the individual and community parasite loads (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Nowadays, most of the BSCP controlled endemic areas for intestinal schistosomiasis have populations with median to low individual parasite loads (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), thus, this turns precise individual diagnosis much more difficult. As a consequence, more sensitive direct or indirect methods or combination of methods are urgently needed for diagnosis (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). One alternative are indirect serological methods, which are capable to detect acute and chronic infections, show a high sensitivity, but usually have problems with the specificity, due to other cross-reactive infections (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Therefore, several groups have been searching for other indirect immunological markers, which could indicate a present schistosome infection in the absence of extensive parasitological exams (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>In our study, the first step was to elucidate the infection profile on a populational level and in the different age groups. If the diagnostic method of choice was KK, the infection profile showed the highest infection rate in children and young adults from 11 to 20 years of age, which was similar to earlier studies (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Interestingly, when more sensitive parasitological methods were used, the infection profile was somewhat inverted. Now, the youngest and the oldest age groups showed elevated and the highest rates of infection, thus, showing their relevance and contribution for maintaining the parasitic cycle and continuous transmission. In the youngest age group, a considerable population with adult parasite worms and increased parasite loads are supposed to build up slowly with increasing exposure during the first years of their life and, therefore, eggs might not be readily detected in common stool exams (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). On the other end of the age scale, reduced parasite loads in elderly individuals might be explained by more effective immune responses and reduced reinfection rates, reduced exposure due to altered habits and/or by aging worms and reduced fertility of female parasites (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>Alterations in peripheral blood leukocyte counts and especially elevated eosinophil counts are considered a hallmark of helminth infections (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, in our study we were able to detect peripheral blood eosinophilia only in 33&#x02013;50% of our infected individuals, depending on the infection group, which would not classify eosinophil counts as a good and mandatory infection marker. For example, for experimental <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infections in mice it was shown that activation, recruitment and granuloma composition of eosinophils vary to a considerable degree, depending on the phase of infection and time post-infection (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) Nevertheless, in individuals with quantitative KK egg counts, peripheral blood eosinophilia correlated to a significant degree, as was already observed in former studies (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>Since the major goal was the search of detectable infection markers in the peripheral blood of individuals with very low parasite loads, we tried to identify cytokines and chemokines, which could readily be detected in serum samples. Generally, during the migration and acute phase of infection it was shown that schistosome antigens induce a host immune response in humans, which is characterized by increased secretion of type 1 cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Later on, during the chronic phase of infection, this type 1 profile is gradually modulated to a type 2 profile (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), with the major contribution of IL-10 (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) and especially T regulatory cells as its source (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). In addition, in patients with confirmed clinical alterations the immunological profile was shown to be driven by the secretion mainly of type 2 IL-13 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) and an upregulation of Th 17 cells (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). All of the before mentioned studies on the immune response in human schistosomiasis were based on results obtained by <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or whole blood cultures with egg or adult worm antigens from schistosomes.</p><p>Here, we searched for circulating infection markers in sera from individuals with different infection intensities, before and 3 months after treatment with praziquantel, and compared cytokine and chemokine concentrations and their frequencies with parasitologically well-confirmed and egg-negative individuals from the same endemic area.</p><p>A panel of pro-inflammatory, type 1, type 2, Th 17, and regulatory cytokines and chemokines were measured in serum samples. First, we tried to correlate any of the immunological markers with egg counts, but only serum IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; concentrations weakly correlated with KK epg values throughout the infection groups, which corroborated the results obtained by Coutinho et al. from individuals with elevated parasite loads and/or clinical manifestations (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>As already shown before (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), most of the pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, were only detected at low concentrations in the different infection groups. However, TNF-&#x003b1; serum levels in individuals with a medium to high parasite load (&#x02265;100 epg) were significantly higher than in the group with a low intensity of infection (4&#x02013;99 epg). In this case, this might be an indicator of pathological changes in apparently asymptomatic individuals, though they were only observed in a restricted number of individuals. However, thorough clinical and ultrasound examinations were not within the scope of the present study and were not done. In a former study (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), such elevated TNF-&#x003b1; levels were not found in schistosome-infected individuals even with a median to high parasite load. This might be due to the presence of co-infections with intestinal nematodes and might be explained by a deviation to a type 2 immune response, as measured by increased CCL11 and CCL17 concentrations in co-infected individuals (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In addition, IL-17A was hardly detected in any of the infection groups, which would be more indicative of chronic inflammatory processes (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) or, in schistosomiasis, be more indicative of severe liver pathology (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). As already shown for multiple helminth infections and at increased parasite loads (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), serum CCL17 concentrations were highest in the infection group with &#x02265;100 epg, but in the infection groups with low or ultra-low parasite loads, the CCL17 concentrations did not differ from non-infected individuals. Also, CCL11 (eotaxin-1) was not found significantly elevated in the infection groups, when compared with non-infected individuals. This is in contrast to what was previously found in individuals co-infected with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and with geohelminths (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and, again, might be explained by low parasite loads and absence of co-infections with intestinal helminths in the present study. Therefore, the results of serum CCL11 and CCL17 concentrations did not support previous findings that these chemokines could also be used as infection markers in individuals with diminished parasite loads. On the other hand, type 1 markers and pro-inflammatory markers, such as CXCL10 (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) and IL-27 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), were readily detected in serum samples, but throughout all groups and without significant differences between infected and egg-negative individuals. This fact, also might argue against acute infections or severe schistosome-induced pathologies in the examined individuals, as found in other studies (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). They are rather indicative of balanced type 1/type 2 immune responses during asymptomatic chronic infections (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Interestingly, a most recently published study on chemokines in plasma samples of individuals with fibrotic lesions but with low parasite loads, also did not reveal any significant differences in concentrations of several chemokines between groups of infected individuals and egg-negative controls. However, individual chemokine concentrations, such as CCL3, CCL7, CCL24 (eotaxin-2), Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), and soluble TNF-&#x003b1; receptor 1, were positively associated with <italic>Schistosoma</italic>-related liver fibrosis (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). As far as the comparison of frequencies of the different cytokines and chemokines between infection groups and egg-negative individuals are concerned, we found a very similar pattern in the groups with ultra-low and low parasite loads, when compared with non-infected individuals. Only the group with moderate to high parasite loads (&#x02265;100 epg) showed alterations, which would be indicative of inflammatory processes. However, other biomarkers who were found to be associated with granuloma size and severity of the disease in animal models and in humans, were only found at low frequencies. From the cytokines and chemokines found in serum samples with high frequencies, IL-27 is considered a pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is able to regulate Th1, Th2, and Th17 responses, as shown in experimental infections (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) The chemokines CCL5, CCL11, and CCL17 were also found in high frequencies, especially in the group with the highest parasite loads (&#x02265;100 epg). In other studies it was shown that these chemokines were important to attract eosinophils and to inhibit severe disease. On the other hand, especially CCL3 and CCL5 were shown to be elevated in schistosomiasis patients with severe disease (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Three months after treatment, the frequencies in the cytokine and chemokine profiles again were somewhat different for the infection groups with low parasite loads (&#x0003c;4 epg and 4&#x02013;99 epg) when compared with individuals with medium to high parasite loads. This difference might be explained by the different amount of released antigens after chemotherapy, or by more profound immuno-modulatory and regulatory mechanisms in individuals with a higher parasite load. However, this was not addressed in the present study and could be part of future research.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe in the importance to search for alternative markers of infection in human schistosomiasis, in order to overcome shortcomings of correct parasitological diagnosis in individuals with reduced parasite loads. However, the immunological alterations in peripheral blood (serum or plasma) of such individuals are subtle and might not be measurable by the common immunological assays, instead, they only become more obvious in individuals with medium to high parasite loads and/or advanced pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SG: conception and design of the work, acquisition of data and field work, analysis and interpretation of the work, drafted the work, and critically revised the work.
