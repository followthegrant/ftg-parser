a band gap energy of 2.05 eV, and their bilayers were prepared by
controlling the potential of anodic and cathodic polarization in a
copper(II)&#x02013;tartrate complex aqueous solution containing copper(II)
sulfate hydrate and tartaric acid in the dark and under light irradiation.
Electrochemical characteristics of the electrodeposition and the resultant
CuO and Cu<sub>2</sub>O layers were investigated with cyclic voltammetry,
chronoamperometry, and Mott&#x02013;Schottky plots, and the structural
and optical characterizations were performed with X-ray diffraction,
scanning electron microscopy, and optical absorption spectra measurements.
The CuO layer prepared at 0.4&#x02013;0.7 V was composed of aggregates
of granular grains with the monoclinic lattice, and the Cu<sub>2</sub>O layer composed of coarse grains with the cubic lattice was deposited
at &#x02212;0.4 to 0.6 V. The flat-band potentials were estimated to
be 0.145 and &#x02212;0.1 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for the CuO and Cu<sub>2</sub>O layers, respectively. The 0.4 &#x003bc;m CuO/1.1 &#x003bc;m Cu<sub>2</sub>O bilayers could be prepared by switching the electrodeposition
potentials of 0.4 and &#x02212;0.4 V, irrespective of the presence
of light irradiation. The photoelectrodeposition under light irradiation
enabled the preparation of continuous and dense 1.1 &#x003bc;m Cu<sub>2</sub>O/0.4 &#x003bc;m CuO bilayer by controlling the potential, while
electrodeposition in the dark led to sparse, isolated, and coarse
Cu<sub>2</sub>O grains being deposited. The mechanism for the photoelectrodeposition
of the bilayers was discussed based on the energy band alignment at
the heterointerface to the Cu&#x02013;tartrate complex solution.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao9b03308</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao9b03308</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cupric oxide (CuO) and cuprous oxide (Cu<sub>2</sub>O) are p-type

precipitation occurred despite the strong alkaline solution due to
the formation of Cu(II)&#x02013;tartrate complex. Complex species in
strongly alkaline solutions of Cu(II)&#x02013;tartaric acid, also known
as Fehling&#x02019;s solution, have recently been investigated by H&#x000f6;rner

Considering the molar ratio of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to H<sub>2</sub>L (1:1)
in the prepared solution, the predominant complex present in the electrolyte
would be [Cu<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>&#x02013;2</sub>L)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>4&#x02013;</sup>. The formation of this tartrate ligand requires at
least 4 equiv NaOH to tartaric acid. The fact that the pH value &#x0223c;13
of the electrolyte containing 0.3 mol L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> tartaric

preferred orientation from the X-ray diffraction pattern and maintains
a lattice relationship of the (111) Cu<sub>2</sub>O//(0001) ZnO with
a lattice mismatch of 7.1%. On the other hand, the orientation of
the SnO<sub>2</sub> layer in the FTO substrate was dispersed randomly.
The n-ZnO layer and its orientation affected the grain structure and
the preferred orientation of the resultant Cu<sub>2</sub>O layer.
The insertion of the n-ZnO layer between the CuO layer and the FTO

intensity ratio of the diffracted X-ray peaks of the CuO layer. There
was a large lattice mismatch of over 15% for the (200) CuO/(0001)
ZnO combination, and the lattice relationships between the monoclinic
CuO and hexagonal ZnO lattices is a reason for no effects of the ZnO
layer insertion on the electrochemical growth of the CuO layer. The

The Cu<sub>2</sub>O crystals grow through the dehydration of CuOH

number of electrons is quite low just after &#x02212;0.4 V was applied

at the photon energies higher than the band gap energy induced the
increase in the number of electrons as minority carriers by excitation
from the valence band to the conduction band, which were then swept
down to the Cu&#x02013;tartrate complex solution, resulting in the
formation of a continuous Cu<sub>2</sub>O layer. This consideration

and cubic lattice, and bilayers consisting of both have been prepared
by controlling the potential in an aqueous solution containing copper(II)
sulfate hydrate and tartaric acid in the dark and under light irradiation.
The CuO layers were composed of granular grains on the FTO substrate
with and without the n-ZnO layer, irrespective of the light irradiation.
The isolated and coarse Cu<sub>2</sub>O grains were deposited sparsely
on the FTO substrate, but the insertion of the n-ZnO layer induced
the change to a continuous and dense layer, irrespective of the light
irradiation. The flat-band potential was estimated to be at almost
constant values of 0.149 V versus Ag/AgCl for CuO layers prepared
at 0.4 to 0.7 V and approximately &#x02212;0.10 V for Cu<sub>2</sub>O layers prepared at &#x02212;0.4 to &#x02212;0.6 V. The 0.4 &#x003bc;m
CuO/1.1 &#x003bc;m Cu<sub>2</sub>O bilayers with characteristic grain
structures could be prepared by cathodic polarization at &#x02212;0.4
V, followed by an anodic polarization at 0.4 V, irrespective of the

continuous and defect-free 1.1 &#x003bc;m Cu<sub>2</sub>O/0.4 &#x003bc;m
CuO bilayers could be prepared by anodic polarization at 0.4 V, followed
by cathodic polarization at &#x02212;0.4 V under the light irradiation.
The mechanism for the photoelectrodeposition of CuO/Cu<sub>2</sub>O and Cu<sub>2</sub>O/CuO bilayers was discussed based on the energy
band alignments drawn based on the flat-band potentials and applied

reveals the ability to construct nanostructured oxide layers including

aqueous solution containing 80 mmol L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> zinc nitrate
hydrate at &#x02212;0.8 V referenced to an Ag/AgCl electrode and 335
K for an electric charge of 0.5 C cm<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> using a potentiostat
(Hokuto Denko, HAL 3000) connected with a Coulomb meter (Hokuto Denko,
HF 301). The solution was prepared using reagent grade chemicals and
distilled water purified with Milli Pore Ellix-UV-Advantage. F:SnO<sub>2</sub>/soda-lime glass (FTO, AGC Fabritech, Co. Ltd., 10 &#x003a9;
sq<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) was used as the substrate. Prior to the electrodeposition,
the FTO substrates were degreased by anodic polarizations in a 1 mol
L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> sodium hydroxide aqueous solution.</p><p>Cyclic
voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements were performed
using the polarization system (Hokuto Denko, HSV-110). The X-ray diffraction
patterns were recorded by a &#x003b8;/2&#x003b8; scanning technique with
monochromated Cu K&#x003b1; radiation operated at 40 kV and 200 mA using
a Rigaku RINT2500. The optical absorption spectra were measured by
recording the absorbance using a UV&#x02013;vis&#x02013;NIR spectrophotometer
(Hitachi, U4100) with an integrated sphere, and the bare substrate
was used as the reference. Electron microscopy observations were carried
out at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV using field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi, SU8000). An electrochemical
impedance measurement was performed in a 0.1 mol L<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> sodium sulfate aqueous solution at pH 6.0 at room temperature by
using VersaSTAT 3-100 (Princeton Applied Research), and Mott&#x02013;Schottky
plots were drawn by using a VersaStudio software (Princeton Applied
Research).</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes-1" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>The Supporting Information
