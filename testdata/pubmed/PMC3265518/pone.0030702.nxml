<italic>Dickeya dadantii</italic> (syn. <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic>) is a plant pathogenic bacteria that harbours a cluster of four horizontally-transferred, insect-specific toxin genes. It was recently shown to be capable of causing an acute infection in the pea aphid <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> (Insecta: Hemiptera). The infection route of the pathogen, and the role and <italic>in vivo</italic> expression pattern of these toxins, remain unknown. Using bacterial numeration and immunolocalization, we investigated the kinetics and the pattern of infection of this phytopathogenic bacterium within its insect host. We compared infection by the wild-type strain and by the Cyt toxin-deficient mutant. <italic>D. dadantii</italic> was found to form dense clusters in many luminal parts of the aphid intestinal tract, including the stomach, from which it invaded internal tissues as early as day 1 post-infection. Septicemia occurred soon after, with the fat body being the main infected tissue, together with numerous early infections of the embryonic chains showing embryonic gut and fat body as the target organs. Generalized septicemia led to insect death when the bacterial load reached about 10<sup>8</sup> cfu. Some individual aphids regularly escaped infection, indicating an effective partial immune response to this bacteria. Cyt-defective mutants killed insects more slowly but were capable of localisation in any type of tissue. Cyt toxin expression appeared to be restricted to the digestive tract where it probably assisted in crossing over the first cell barrier and, thus, accelerating bacterial diffusion into the aphid haemocel. Finally, the presence of bacteria on the surface of leaves hosting infected aphids indicated that the insects could be vectors of the bacteria.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aphids are known vectors of many plant viruses, a feature shared with some of their phloem-feeding relatives, such as whiteflies and scale insects. They are, however, less well known as hosts for pathogenic bacterial infections, although recent surveys have concluded that they universally harbor both obligate and non-obligate bacterial symbionts, referred to as secondary due to their variable prevalence in host species populations. The peculiarity of aphid relationships with their bacterial partners is that these associations are directed by symbiotic mutualistic interactions. Like other vascular-feeding insects, their nutritional ecology is typically dominated by a usually germ-free food, a not-so-common feature for non-parasitic insects. As a result of this situation, the aphid immune system has been shown to lack many homologous components of the pathways described in other insect genomes <xref rid="pone.0030702-Gerardo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The way in which aphids deal with bacterial pathogens, therefore, has been totally overlooked until now, and it is only just starting to be analysed <xref rid="pone.0030702-Nadarasah1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Recent reports have shown that several plant pathogenic bacteria (<italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, <italic>Pantoea stewartii</italic>, <italic>Erwinia aphidicola</italic> and <italic>Dickeya dadantii</italic>) can also behave as pathogens when they are ingested by the pea aphid. Interactions of these bacteria with the insect have been characterized. <italic>P. syringae</italic> multiplies up to a level of 3&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> colony forming units (cfu) per aphid and the insect succumbs within 48 h <xref rid="pone.0030702-Stavrinides1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The product of the <italic>fliL</italic> gene, involved in swarming motility, is necessary for full virulence but the reason why swarming is required has not been established. Toxin complex (<italic>tc</italic>) genes, present in the genome, seem to play a limited role in virulence. The excretion of bacteria-containing honeydew shows that the insect may not only be a host but also a vector of the bacteria <xref rid="pone.0030702-Stavrinides1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. <italic>P. stewartii</italic> accumulates in the gut of <italic>A. pisum</italic>, reaching titres of 5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> cfu, and aphids die within 72 h. The bacteria form aggregates in the hindgut which block the flow of honeydew. A mutant in the <italic>ucp</italic>1 gene, encoding a membrane protein, has a reduced virulence and fails to form aggregates <xref rid="pone.0030702-Stavrinides2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although their existence has been established for longer, the interactions between <italic>E. aphidicola</italic> and <italic>A. pisum</italic> are less well characterized. The bacteria seem to multiply in the gut and even though they may be resident without any pathogenic effects, as was initially sampled from established aphid colonies <xref rid="pone.0030702-Harada1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, these bacteria have been shown to induce acute pathogenicity in a comparative screening of phytopathogens virulent against the pea aphid <xref rid="pone.0030702-Grenier1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It has been suggested that the production of exopolysaccharides plays a role in this pathogenicity <xref rid="pone.0030702-Harada2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Artificial infection of <italic>A. pisum</italic> by <italic>D. dadantii,</italic> via an oral route, provokes the death of the insect in about four days. A search, within the bacterial genome sequence, for possible insect toxin genes revealed the presence of a cluster of four genes encoding pore-forming cytolytic toxins, homologous to the Cyt toxins from <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic>, which have probably been horizontally transferred from a GC-poor Gram-positive bacterium <xref rid="pone.0030702-Glasner1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The toxins seem to play a role only when infection occurs by ingestion since a mutant deleted of the toxin genes was as virulent as the wild type strain when infection was performed by injection, a feature frequent in virulence mutants of pathogenic bacteria. This led to the idea that other virulence factors are produced by the bacteria. Several specific and global regulatory mechanisms seem to be involved in the control of the expression of these factors <xref rid="pone.0030702-Costechareyre1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, nothing is known as regards how and where the bacteria multiply within the insects. Therefore, we designed the experiments presented here in order to trace infection by <italic>D. dadantii</italic> in orally contaminated pea aphids, with the following main objectives: i) to describe the timing and spatial development of this pathosystem; ii) to identify whether the bacteria are able to successfully infect aphid tissues beyond the initial containment within the intestinal lumen, and to detect whether some tissues are more prone to infection than others; iii) to characterize the pattern of infection of Cyt-defective mutants, in terms of tissue distribution or capacity to cross the first intestinal barrier, when compared to its wild-type counterpart and, finally, iv) to detect the tissue pattern of expression of the Cyt toxins of <italic>D. dadantii</italic>. The methodology used for these characterizations was mainly histochemical, relying on the specific detection of the bacteria through a constitutive surface antigen, the KdgM porin of <italic>D. dadantii</italic>, and the detection of Cyt toxin operon expression <xref rid="pone.0030702-Costechareyre1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, with an antibody raised against a purified CytC protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Bacterial development of <italic>D. dadantii</italic> in aphids</title><p>Our previous study <xref rid="pone.0030702-Grenier1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> showed that when aphids were fed, for 24 h, on AP3 medium containing 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria/ml and then replaced on plants, the survival curve varied according to whether the <italic>D. dadantii</italic> wild type strain (A3952) or the mutant deleted of the four cyt-like toxin genes (A4977) was used. With the wt strain, aphids began to die after 24 hours and, after 4 days, only 30&#x00025; had survived. With the <italic>&#x00394;cyt</italic> strain, aphids started to die after 3 days and 40&#x00025; had survived at the end of the experiment.</p><p>To determine whether the survivors had eliminated bacteria or whether they did not, in fact, ingest any, the number of bacteria was counted in aphids fed with AP3, containing 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria/ml of strain A3952, for 24 hours (day 1). All aphids (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20) contained bacteria, but their number showed great variability, ranging from 300 to 2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cfu. This confirmed, however, that all aphids had ingested bacteria. Next, the aphids were placed onto broad bean plants and a time-series of bacterial numeration was performed, counting the number of bacteria in aphids every day until no new deaths occurred. 24 hours later (on day 2) we found that about 10&#x00025; of the live aphids were free from <italic>D. dadantii</italic>. This percentage increased over the following days (about 30&#x00025; on day 3 and about 60&#x00025; on day 4) to reach 100&#x00025; of the surviving aphids on day 5. By this time, all the aphids that could not eliminate bacteria were dead. In summary, 30&#x00025; of the initial number of aphids were able to eliminate the infecting <italic>D. dadantii</italic>.</p><p>In infected aphids, the average number of bacteria was generally 10-fold higher on day 2 than on day 1, but the variability was still significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). After day 2, the number of bacteria continued to increase regularly but more slowly, and it reached a maximum value of about 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria/aphid on day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0030702-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0030702.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Bacterial population growth in aphids.</title><p>Numeration of <italic>D. dadantii</italic> populations within infected pea aphids. <italic>wt</italic>: infection with wild-type <italic>D. dadantii</italic>; <italic>&#x00394;cyt</italic>: infection with strain A4977, with the four <italic>cyt</italic> genes deleted.

This test confirmed, once again, that all the aphids had ingested bacteria. As for the wt strain, the average number of bacteria in infected aphids was 10-fold higher on day 2 than on day 1, but variability was still significant. After day 2, the number of bacteria increased continuously, though much slower than for the wild-type series, reaching a maximum value of 3&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> bacteria per aphid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g001">Figure 1</xref>). No new deaths were observed after day 7, and the surviving aphids (about 40&#x00025;) were always found to be devoid of bacteria and were considered as having escaped infection.</p><p>Finally, in none of the haemolymph samples collected at all stages of infection were we able to detect viable <italic>D. dadantii</italic> cells, probably indicating that the transfer of bacteria through haemolymph was a very transient state and, probably, no stable multiplication of <italic>D. dadantii</italic> cells occurred in the blood cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Histological localization of <italic>D. dadantii</italic> in infected aphids</title><p>In order to determine the localization of <italic>D. dadantii</italic> after oral ingestion of the bacteria, immunofluorescence detection of whole aphid mounts was carried out. In general, transverse sections of infected aphids were cut and then stained using an antibody raised against a <italic>D. dadantii</italic> outer membrane protein, the oligogalacturonate-specific porin KdgM. KdgM staining is very specific to this species, and no positive staining could be observed in the control non-infected insects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030702.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). We observed that bacteria were present in many somatic tissues, and that they could reach the reproductive system and potentially invade parthenogenetic embryos quite early on in the infection process.</p><p>During the very early stage of infection, when insects were still feeding on inoculated diets (day 1), bacteria infected the aphid by entering and multiplying within the gut lumen. At this point, they may infect gut cells and be detected within the cytoplasm of some cells, though this was not often observed at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2A, B, C</xref>). They were also spreading throughout the fat body in a limited number of cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). In a few aphids, <italic>D. dadantii</italic> was also detected in the fat body of embryos within the first day of contact with the insect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0030702-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0030702.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Pattern of aphid tissues infected with <italic>D. dadantii</italic>.</title><p>Immunostaining with anti KdgM antibodies of aphids infected with the wild type <italic>D. dadantii</italic> strain.

A heavy infection of <italic>D. dadantii</italic> is seen in all the maternal and embryonic fat bodies (2L), the gut tissue and lumen (2M), and large parts of the embryonic fat body (2N) and embryo gut cells, but not in the embryonic bacteriocytes (egc, eba, 2O).

They were always detected within the lumen of the gut, sometimes in deeply stained spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). They had also, very frequently, spread throughout the fat body, as shown in a typical transverse section of a whole aphid nymph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). In some aphids, gut cell cytoplasm showed intracellular fluorescence, signaling the presence of the bacterium within the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>), although extracellular gut lumen location was by far the most common position of the infecting bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>, left and right). <italic>D. dadantii</italic> was also occasionally observed in some brain cells (not all, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2H</xref> inlet), as well as in the cornicle of the aphid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2I</xref>). In those insects, almost all the body tissues were infected, corresponding to an effective septicemia. It should be noted that some tissues contained a much lower signal than the &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; infected tissues, such as the fat body, including the bacteriocytes and some large isolated cells identified as oenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2I</xref>). However, at a higher magnification, bacteriocytes showed some cytoplasmic autofluorescence (present in control insects) which prevents us from claiming a complete exclusion of <italic>Dickeya</italic> cells in these bacteriocytes, although the level of staining was always very much reduced compared with the gut and fat body cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2J, K</xref>). At this primary stage of infection, many embryos were infected, not only within the fat body but also in the gut cells and, less frequently, in the luminal embryonic gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2J, K,L</xref>).</p><p>Finally, during the late stage of infection (day 4 post-infection), staining revealed an even larger number of bacteria present in the gut lumen of aphids, with occasionally concomitant gut cell penetration showing parts of the gut, frequently the anterior mesenteron (often termed &#x0201c;stomach&#x0201d;) completely filled with <italic>D. dadantii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2M</xref>). Additionally, at this late stage, where mortality had already occurred in more than half of the infected individuals, <italic>D. dadantii</italic> extensively invaded the fat body and the embryos of all infected aphids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2L, 2N</xref>). Noticeably again, embryonic bacteriocytes from positively stained embryos never showed any positive staining, whilst the neighbouring gut cells and fat body tissue did (eba <italic>vs</italic> egc, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g002">Fig. 2O</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Expression of CytC toxin in <italic>A. pisum</italic>
</title><p>Expression of CytC has also been investigated by immunofluorescence, using an antibody raised against the toxin. The specificity of antibody was checked (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0030702.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Overall, when analyzed systematically on the same aphid samples as those used for <italic>D. dadantii</italic> detection of KdgM, visualization of the toxin was much more restricted. Although detected in one sample from the early infection stage (day 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), the toxin was more detected in later stages when the bacteria were visible as dense markings in the gut lumen. The most common location, by far, for toxin expression was the gut lumen, even when the bacteria were massively detected elsewhere in the aphid tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Generally no expression of the toxin was observed in the fat body, although some staining in partial areas of this tissue was occasionally detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Extensive staining outside the gut lumen only appeared exceptionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>), and even at late infection stages (day 4 to day 7), where bacteria were shown to be widespread in the aphid body (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g003">Fig. 3C</xref> left), the typical localization of the toxin stain was as high density signal areas within the gut lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030702-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>).

<italic>A. pisum</italic> interacts with different types of bacteria. The obligatory symbiont <italic>Buchnera aphidicola</italic>, contained within specialized bacteriocytes, provides the insect with essential amino acids. Facultative symbionts, such as <italic>Hamiltonella defensa</italic>, <italic>Regiella insecticola</italic> or <italic>Serratia symbiotica</italic> can also provide diverse benefits to their host <xref rid="pone.0030702-Oliver1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These bacteria are found either in the bacteriocytes or in the haemolymph. To co-exist with these bacteria, it has been proposed that A. <italic>pisum</italic> has a limited immune system which permits the maintenance of these bacteria but, as a consequence, this could render it more prone to microbial infections <xref rid="pone.0030702-Gerardo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Recently, several bacteria that are lethal to aphids have been described. These bacteria are either plant pathogens, such as <italic>P. stewartii</italic> or <italic>P. syringae</italic>, that may infect feeding insects, or the non-pathogenic model bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0030702-Stavrinides1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030702-Stavrinides2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030702-Altincicek1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the mechanism by which they kill the aphids is not yet understood. When the route of infection is ingestion, which is probably the natural way of infection, these bacteria multiply in the insect gut. They do not seem able to cross the gut epithelium and were not found in the insect body cavity. It seems that, at least in the case of <italic>P. stewartii</italic>, death occurs by accumulation of bacterial aggregates in the crop and the gut. Infection by <italic>D. dadantii</italic> seems to follow a different path. Initially the bacteria multiply abundantly in the gut but, by as early as one day post-infection, they have crossed the gut epithelium and can be found in the body cavity of the insect, with a preferential localization in the fat body. As infection progresses, other organs, such as the brain or the embryos, are invaded and it is probable that death is provoked by this septicemia. The means by which the bacteria spread so quickly is still not known since, surprisingly, no living bacteria have been found in the haemolymph. Laughton <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0030702-Laughton1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> have shown that the haemolymph contains granulocytes that phagocytose very efficiently any bacteria and destroy rapidly circulating cells. This cellular immunity may be the main reason for our inability to recover viable bacteria from haemolymph samples, as it is difficult to think of a rapid infection route to the fat-body or to the embryonic chain without any transit time in the general circulation. Due to the very rapid time-course observed, an alternative cell-to-cell route of infection seems unlikely.</p><p>Apart from the Cyt proteins, the genome of <italic>D. dadantii</italic> does not encode homologues of other known insect toxins. However, our results suggest that these toxins are not the main factor responsible for insect death. CytC was strongly detected in the gut but was barely visible in the body cavity at stages where it was full of bacteria. Our previous work showed that <italic>cyt</italic> gene expression was induced in a high osmolarity medium <xref rid="pone.0030702-Costechareyre1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Insects feed on phloem sap, or AP3 medium, that contains a high sucrose concentration. This could induce Cyt production in the gut. Once the gut epithelium has been crossed, bacteria are in lower osmolarity conditions and Cyt synthesis would go back to a basal level, which is no longer detectable by immunodetection. The fact that the bacteria present in the embryo gut do not produce CytC confirms that this expression depends on the feeding medium, and not on localization in a specific organ. <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic> Cyt toxins are viewed and classified, by homology, as haemolytic pore-forming toxins that could insert into the gut epithelial cell membrane and provoke the formation of holes, ultimately leading to cell death. Bacteria could use this pore-forming mechanism to enhance their epithelial penetration ability, as has been shown with Cry toxins from the same <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic>, which clearly exhibited such septicemia-enhancing properties in a specific host-pathogen context <xref rid="pone.0030702-Broderick1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030702-Graf1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030702-Mason1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, contrasting with its canonical cell-toxicity phenotype. It is possible that the role of <italic>D. dadantii</italic> Cyt toxins is the same since a <italic>&#x00394;cyt</italic> mutant is as virulent as the wt when infection is induced by injection <xref rid="pone.0030702-Grenier1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and we observe only a delay in the death of the insect aphids with the mutant, but with the same pattern of general infection. The precise factor responsible for the insect mortality has yet to be identified. It should be noted, however, that although virulence factors active against the pea aphid have been identified in <italic>D. dadantii</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0030702-Costechareyre1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, insect death may result from a complex physiopathological syndrome resulting from the impairment of central metabolic functions following infection, as has been discussed for the fruit fly <xref rid="pone.0030702-ShirasuHiza1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The generalized infection of the fat body, observed in our model, could reflect such a situation.</p><p>
<italic>D. dadantii</italic> is classified as a necrotrophic plant pathogen: its principal virulence factors are plant cell wall degrading enzymes, mainly pectinases, that destroy the pecto-cellulosic matrix that holds the cells together, leading to their death by osmotic shock <xref rid="pone.0030702-HugouvieuxCottePattat1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This gives the bacteria wide access to nutrients. Interactions with animal cells may occur differently. It has been shown that <italic>D. dadantii</italic> is able to adhere to, and kill, human adenocarcinoma cells <xref rid="pone.0030702-Duarte1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The Hrp type III secretion system seems to be involved in this phenomenon, suggesting that this phytopathogenic bacteria has animal-directed toxins. In the case of aphid infection there is no indication of tissue disorganization, which would be a sign of massive lytic enzyme secretion by a type II secretion system. Instead, toxins may be delivered by the type III Hrp secretion system or the type IV secretion system, present in the genome but of unknown function. No secretion signal whatsoever has been detected in the proteins from the <italic>cyt</italic> operon.</p><p>Most infection experiments finish with a low, though significant, proportion of individuals that have escaped infection. These aphids have always been shown to be devoid of viable <italic>D. dadantii</italic> cells, and this could reflect the fact that an efficient immune reaction was mounted against the pathogen. Despite the fact that genomic and experimental data have repeatedly shown that aphid immunity is somehow atypical among insects and lacking in many essential components, such as the <italic>imd</italic> pathway or an efficient peptide antibacterial response <xref rid="pone.0030702-Gerardo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030702-Altincicek1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, the aphids that escape infection, together with recent reports on the identification of immunocompetent cells in aphid haemolymph <xref rid="pone.0030702-Laughton1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, are clear indications that an immune response is active during bacterial infection of the pea aphid. The observation of a differential sensitivity of the tissues (eg. bacteriocytes versus fat body) is another indication of tissue-specific defense factors. An example of this is the highly expressed lysozyme gene that has been shown to dominate the expression pattern of aphid bacteriocytes <xref rid="pone.0030702-Nakabachi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030702-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The mode of transmission of pectinolytic enterobacteriae (<italic>Pectobacterium</italic> and <italic>Dickeya</italic>) is not clear. The role of soil, water and the agricultural methods used has been demonstrated <xref rid="pone.0030702-Helias1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> but a possible involvement of insects has received little attention, although studies have revealed the transmission of <italic>Pectobacterium</italic> to potato plants by <italic>Drosophila</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0030702-Kloepper1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We present evidence here that aphids can be not only hosts but also vectors of <italic>D. dadantii</italic>. Whilst infection can occur with as little as 100 bacteria, more than 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria deposited by honeydew may be found on leaves where infected aphids have fed and this could be a new source of contamination. Moreover, dead insects, that may fall on the soil or be disseminated by the wind, contain live bacteria for as long as one week.
