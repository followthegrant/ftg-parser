However, the mechanisms involved are still unclear. We hypothesized that the effects of SCFA are associated with activation of G-protein coupled receptor 41/43 (GPR41/43) and/or inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The expression and location of GPR41/43 and HDAC3 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were confirmed. HUVEC were pre-incubated with acetate, butyrate or propionate alone or in combination with GLPG0974 (GLPG, antagonist of GPR43) or &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate (SHB, antagonist of GPR41) and then exposed to LPS or TNF&#x003b1;. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 levels and VCAM-1 expression were measured. HDAC activity was measured after treatment with butyrate, propionate and trichostatin A (TSA, HDAC inhibitor). The peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) adhesive level was also determined after TSA treatment.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> GPR41/43 were expressed on the membrane of HUVEC and HDAC3 was located in cytoplasm and nucleus. The GLPG and/or SHB treatments restored the inhibitory effects of acetate on IL-6 and IL-8 production and the inhibitory effects of butyrate or propionate on IL-6 production, but not on IL-8. In contrast, GLPG and/or SHB treatments did not affect the inhibitory effects of butyrate or propionate on TNF&#x003b1;-induced VCAM-1 expression. TSA showed similar effects on IL-8 production and VCAM-1 expression as butyrate and propionate. In addition, TSA significantly inhibited the adhesion of PBMC to an endothelial monolayer.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Activation of GPR41/43 mediates the effects of acetate on IL-6 and IL-8 production and the effects of butyrate and propionate on IL-6 production. Furthermore, inhibition of HDACs mediates the effects of butyrate and propionate on IL-8 production, VCAM-1 expression, and PBMC adhesion to an endothelial monolayer. These data indicate the beneficial roles of SCFA in preventing vascular inflammation and relevant diseases by activation of GPR41/43 and inhibition of HDACs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SCFA</kwd><kwd>GPR41/43</kwd><kwd>HDACs</kwd><kwd>inflammatory cytokines</kwd><kwd>adhesion molecules</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Atherosclerosis, which is associated with chronic vascular inflammation, is an inflammatory disease with its most common pathological processes leading to cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Libby, 2002</xref>). The earliest event in atherosclerosis is increased monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, which is primarily regulated by vascular inflammatory factors including cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, chemokines such as IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and endothelial adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gwon et al., 2015</xref>). Since increases in these factors also characterize endothelial activation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Pober, 2002</xref>), regulating inflammatory reactions in the vascular endothelium is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of atherosclerosis (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Less endothelial activation and less low-grade inflammation have been associated, in clinical studies, with high fiber consumption (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Meijer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">van Bussel et al., 2015</xref>), which might be due to the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA). SCFA, predominant acetate, propionate and butyrate, are the main anaerobic bacterial metabolites fermentation of dietary fibers in the colon which not only regulate proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression in the colon but also have physiological relevance for the host outside of the gastro-intestinal tract (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Aoyama et al., 2010</xref>). SCFA have recently emerged as important signaling molecules regulating a variety of responses in the cardiovascular system (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Richards et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, as we have recently shown, SCFA play beneficial roles in decreasing endothelial activation leading to diminished cytokines production and expression of adhesion molecules (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). SCFA may regulate endothelial function either by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and/or activating G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs): GPR41 (also known as free fatty acid receptor3, FFAR3) and GPR43 (or FFAR2) and/or inhibition of HDACs (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Vinolo et al., 2011</xref>). However, the roles played in endothelial activation by GPRs and HDACs are not clearly understood.</p><p>GPR41 and GPR43 are differentially expressed on the membrane of cells (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Sina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Aoyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). GPR41 is mainly expressed in blood vessel on endothelial cells, and GPR43 is mainly expressed on immune cells (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2003</xref>). GPR41 and GPR43 can both be activated by SCFA, but their specificities and potencies for ligands are different. The order of potency of the GPR41 is propionate &#x02248; butyrate &#x0003e; acetate and for GPR43 is propionate &#x02265; acetate &#x02248; butyrate (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bindels et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that butyrate is more active on GPR41, propionate is the most potent agonist for both GPR41 and GPR43, and acetate is more selective for GPR43 (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2005</xref>). Increasing evidence indicates the anti-inflammatory effects of GPR43 activation on immune cells. For example, deficiency in GPR43 increases the production of inflammatory mediators and immune cell recruitment and results in an increased inflammatory response in models of colitis, arthritis and asthma (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Puddu et al., 2014</xref>). Their roles in endothelial activation remain unknown (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Histone deacetylases, a group of deacetylating enzymes, remove acetyl groups from both histone and non-histone proteins complexes that regulate gene expression (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Delcuve et al., 2012</xref>). HDACs are involved in atherosclerosis associated inflammatory processes (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Pons et al., 2009</xref>). HDAC inhibitors have shown potent anti-inflammatory activity in inflammatory diseases (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Das Gupta et al., 2016</xref>). For example, HDAC3, by regulating NF-&#x003ba;B activity, is involved in the expression of inflammatory genes and monocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Leus et al., 2016</xref>). A potent HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by attenuating the LPS-induced expression of NF-&#x003ba;B-regulated cytokines (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Leoni et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Inhibition of HDACs is also a molecular mode of action of SCFA, and butyrate and propionate but not acetate can act as HDAC inhibitors (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). It remains unclear whether HDACs are involved in the anti-inflammatory properties of SCFA in the process of endothelial activation.</p><p>We therefore investigated the roles of GPR41/43 and HDACs in the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFA on LPS- and TNF&#x003b1;-induced endothelial activation. This could offer new therapeutic ways to prevent the development of atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and Materials</title><p>Sodium butyrate, propionate, trichostatin A (TSA, a selective and reversible hydroxamate inhibitor of class I and II HDACs) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hebbel et al., 2010</xref>), sodium &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate (SHB, antagonist for GPR41 receptor) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kimura et al., 2011</xref>), and LPS (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 0111:B4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States.

We have previously demonstrated that SCFA pre-treatment could significantly inhibit IL-6 and IL-8 production as well as VCAM-1 expression on activated endothelial cells (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). However, the mechanisms involved in their anti-inflammatory effects remained unclear and an understanding of their mechanisms of action could be important for new therapeutic options for atherosclerosis and for related lifestyle adjustments. We confirmed the membrane expression of GPR41/43 and the intracellular location of HDAC3 on HUVEC, which indicate that the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFA on activated endothelial cells might be mediated by activation of GPR41/43 and/or inhibition of HDACs. Furthermore, we found that GPR41/43 are involved in cytokine production but not in adhesion molecule expression and that HDACs are involved in the butyrate and propionate-induced decrease in IL-8 production and VCAM-1 expression.</p><p>Inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 and IL-8, are crucial to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bi et al., 2016</xref>). IL-6 is an important upstream inflammatory cytokine in propagating the downstream inflammatory response for atherosclerosis (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hartman and Frishman, 2014</xref>). IL-8 is a prominent chemokine that triggers the adhesion, transmigration and retention of monocytes and macrophages to the atherosclerotic sites (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Boisvert, 2004</xref>). Therefore, decreasing IL-6 and IL-8 should be an important step in preventing the development of atherosclerosis. In the present study, acetate reduced IL-6 and IL-8 production in LPS- or TNF&#x003b1;-activated HUVEC, which were prevented by co-treatment with GPR41 or GPR43 antagonist. Furthermore, the effects of GPR43 antagonist seem more profound than those of the GPR41 antagonist, which corresponds with the activation potency order of acetate on GPR41 and GPR43 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bindels et al., 2013</xref>). Butyrate and propionate have effects on IL-6 production similar to those of acetate, but IL-8 production by stimulated HUVEC was unchanged by GPR41 or GPR43 antagonist treatments, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of butyrate and propionate on IL-8 production were not mediated by activation of GPR41/43. IL-8 is encoded on the CXCL8 gene, which is normally repressed due to histone deacetylation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Jundi and Greene, 2015</xref>), thus theoretically, inhibition of histone deacetylase results in hyper-acetylation of histones and, increases IL-8 production. However, in our study, butyrate and propionate inhibited IL-8 production and HDAC activity. Furthermore, TSA, as a potent HDACs inhibitor, also reduced IL-8 production. These findings are in agreement with previous studies that show a reduction in IL-8 gene expression by butyrate but accompanied with induced histone H4 hyper-acetylation in its inducible promoter (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hoshimoto et al., 2002</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that HDACs might be involved in the effects of butyrate and propionate on the IL-8 production.</p><p>In addition to the cytokines and chemokines, monocyte migration and adhesion to the inflammation site on endothelial cells is another essential cellular event for initiation of inflammatory processes associated with atherosclerosis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bozic et al., 2015</xref>). Cell adhesion is a multi-step process including rolling, firm adhesion, and transmigration of the endothelial monolayer and is regulated by a combination of endothelial cell surface adhesion molecules including VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and selectins (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Burris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of VCAM-1 expression has been shown to suppress atherosclerotic lesions in hyper-lipidemic mouse models (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Burris et al., 2014</xref>). This shows the importance of VCAM-1 in cell adhesion and the development of atherosclerosis. VCAM-1, also known as CD106, is extensively expressed on activated endothelial cells and mediates both rolling-type adhesion and firm adhesion steps during monocyte adhesion and transmigration (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Burris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Vogel et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, decreasing VCAM-1 expression might be beneficial in inhibiting inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis. In a recent study, we showed that VCAM-1 expression is inhibited by butyrate and propionate but not by acetate (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>VCAM-1 expression in TNF&#x003b1; stimulated endothelial cells has been shown to be regulated by the acetylation status and TSA increased intracellular acetylation leading to significantly suppress TNF&#x003b1;-induced VCAM-1 expression in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Inoue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of HDAC3 in HUVEC reduced VCAM-1 expression and hence suppressed monocyte adhesion (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cantley and Haynes, 2013</xref>). Such data demonstrates the involvement of HDACs, especially HDAC3, in regulating VCAM-1 expression. We found that acetate, which has no HDAC inhibitory activity (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Waldecker et al., 2008</xref>), showed no effect on TNF&#x003b1;-induced VCAM-1 expression (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, activation of GPR41/GPR43 did not mediate the suppression of VCAM-1 expression by butyrate and propionate. Finally, TSA, a potent HDAC inhibitor, significantly inhibited VCAM-1 expression, and this effect was more potent than butyrate and propionate. Furthermore, the PBMC adhesion level was significantly inhibited by TSA which showed effects similar to those of butyrate and propionate (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Based on our data, we conclude that the effects of butyrate and propionate on VCAM-1 expression were probably mediated by inhibition of HDACs thereby inhibiting the subsequent immune cell adhesion and preventing the development of atherosclerosis.</p><p>The present study offers novel insights into the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of SCFA in stimulated human primary endothelial cells and shows the different involvement of GPR41/43 and HDACs in the anti-inflammatory process of SCFA including inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokines production and down-regulation of adhesion molecule expression on HUVEC. We found that both activation of GPR41/43 and inhibition of HDACs are involved in decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines production, IL-6 and IL-8, in LPS- and TNF&#x003b1;-activated HUVEC. Inhibition of HDACs, and not activation of GPR41/43, significantly attenuated VCAM-1 expression in TNF&#x003b1;-activated HUVEC and consequently inhibited PBMC adhesion to endothelial monolayer. Thus, modulating GPR41/43 and/or HDACs might be a promising therapeutic pathway for the treatment of vascular inflammation relevant diseases, including atherosclerosis. Moreover, these findings argue for altering lifestyles in the direction of increased dietary intake of fibers that promote the production of SCFA.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>ML performed the experiments and analyzed the data and wrote the article.
