This study aimed at defining the role of cellular immunity for the clinical response to M-ILP in melanoma patients. It was observed that patients with enhanced cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell reactivity to common antigens (HCMV/EBV/influenza virus) prior to M-ILP were more likely to achieve a complete disappearance of macroscopic tumors (complete response). Following M-ILP treatment, the proportions of CD16<sup>+</sup> intermediate and non-classical monocytes in peripheral blood were significantly enhanced along with induction of HLA-DR on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. For further studies of the mechanism behind melphalan-induced immune activation an <italic>in vitro</italic> model, aiming at mimicking the clinical M-ILP protocol, was established, where PBMCs were co-cultured with melanoma cells, which had been pre-exposed to melphalan under mild hyperthermia. Upon exposure to melphalan, melanoma cells showed increased expression of immune-related markers including MHC class I and Hsp70. Moreover, when the melphalan-treated melanoma cells were co-cultured with PBMCs, this triggered an increased proportion of CD33<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>++</sup> non-classical monocytes among the PBMCs. Furthermore, the melphalan-treated melanoma cells stimulated the expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the co-cultured PBMCs. These cells produced enhanced levels of IFN-&#x003b3; and granzyme B and were capable of killing melanoma cells. To further verify an immunogenic role of melphalan, mice were vaccinated with melphalan-exposed murine melanoma cells. When challenged with live melanoma cells, vaccinated mice showed reduced tumor growth and enhanced infiltration of tumor-specific T cells into tumors. We conclude that melphalan-exposed melanoma cells trigger expansion of CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes and activate cytotoxic T cells and that these events may contribute to the antitumoral efficacy of M-ILP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>isolated limb perfusion</kwd><kwd>melphalan</kwd><kwd>monocytes</kwd><kwd>cytotoxic T cells</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="27"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7249"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>For patients with recurrence of malignant melanoma, ~5&#x02013;10% develop lymphatic dissemination referred to as in-transit metastasis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Singular lesions may be removed surgically but other treatments are warranted for patients with multiple lesions or when lesions rapidly reappear (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion with the alkylating agent melphalan (M-ILP) is a treatment option for in-transit melanoma metastases confined to a limb. During M-ILP, the affected limb is temporarily isolated from the systemic circulation and connected to a heart-lung machine. High doses of melphalan are perfused through the limb during 1 h under mild hyperthermia. During M-ILP, the concentrations of melphalan in the perfused tissue are at least 20 times higher than those achieved by the maximum tolerated dose after systemic administration (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). M-ILP induces a complete response (CR), defined as a total regression of melanoma lesions in 30&#x02013;80% of the patients (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The high local concentrations of melphalan achieved during M-ILP aim to induce apoptosis of melanoma cells while sparing host cells, including immune cells, in non-perfused regions. The reconstitution of normal circulation after perfusion entails a release of tumor antigens and possibly other immunostimulatory components, including danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). When these components come into contact with antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs), a tumor-specific T cell response likely evolve that may contribute to the response. Following M-ILP there is often a gradual regression of melanoma lesions over several months, and it can take up to 6 months before a complete response can be seen. This supports the hypothesis that part of the antitumoral effect seen by M-ILP is mediated by the immune system. This is further supported by previous research showing that melanoma patients with high counts of peripheral blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or high expression of the T cell activation marker HLA-DR prior to M-ILP were more likely to achieve CR (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In addition, M-ILP was reported to entail a striking induction of Melan-A specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in blood in a significant proportion of patients (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to further define the role of immune effector mechanisms for the antitumoral effects of M-ILP in melanoma. The results suggest that melphalan-exposed human melanoma cells trigger an activation of the immune system, as shown by expansion of CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytic cells and activation of cytotoxic T cells and that these events may contribute to the clinical efficacy of M-ILP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and sampling of PBMCs</title><p>Twenty patients with in-transit metastasis of malignant melanoma were recruited to the study and underwent M-ILP at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. For patients characteristics, see Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>. Details of the ILP procedure are accounted for in earlier publications (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Briefly, under general anesthesia the blood circuit of the limb was isolated by clamping and cannulation of the major artery and vein. The cannulas were connected to an oxygenated extracorporeal unit and remaining collateral vessels were compressed with an inflatable tourniquet or an Esmarch bandage. Melphalan (Alkeran&#x000ae;, 13 mg/l in upper limb, 10 mg/l in lower limb) was administered into the perfusion circuit during a 20 min infusion. The temperature was held at mild hyperthermia (40&#x000b0;C) with a total perfusion time of 60 min. One patient also received tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;, Beromun&#x000ae;, Boehringer Ingelheim) injected as a 1 mg bolus dose 30 min before the melphalan infusion.</p><p>Samples from peripheral blood were collected immediately before M-ILP and 1 month thereafter. For six patients, only pre-operative samples were collected. Blood cells were purified from BD Vacutainer&#x000ae; CPT&#x02122; cell preparation tubes (BD Biosciences, #362782) according to the manufacturer's protocol and subsequently cryopreserved. Clinical responses were evaluated according to the WHO criteria 3 months after M-ILP by the responsible physician and reported as CR (Complete Response, defined as disappearance of all lesions), PR (Partial Response, decrease of more than 50% of total tumor burden), PD (Progressive Disease, an increase of more than 25% in existing lesions or the appearance of new lesions) or SD (Stable Disease, where none of the criteria for CR, PR or PD were met). For all immunological analyses performed in this study, clinical responses were defined as either CR or Non-CR (i.e., PR, PD and SD). All patients gave written consent and the study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg, Sweden (No. 424&#x02013;14).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>The human melanoma cell lines A375, SK-MEL-5, and MeWo were obtained from CLS Cell Lines Service GmbH (Eppelheim, Germany). The murine melanoma B16-F1-OVA cell line was a kind gift from Kerstin Hoffmann and Andreas Thiel (BCRT&#x02013;Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies, Germany). Human cell lines were authenticated using Multiplex Cell Authentication by Multiplexion (Heidelberg, Germany) as previously described (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).

Antigens were pools of peptides covering complete sequences of three melanoma-associated antigens (Peptivator&#x000ae; NY-ESO-1, Melan-A/MART-1, gp100/Pmel17; Miltenyi Biotec, #130-095-380, #130-094-597, #130-094-449) or peptides from HCMV/EBV/influenza virus (Peptivator&#x000ae; CEF MHC plus I; Miltenyi Biotec, #130-098-426) as a positive control. From day four, cultures were supplemented with 1,000 U/ml IL-2 (Proleukin&#x000ae;, Novartis). At day 18 or 19, expanded T cells were co-cultured with new autologous PBMCs pre-pulsed with peptides (0.6 nmol/ml), at a ratio of 1:2 (T cells:PBMC), for ~5 h in presence of Brefeldin A (Golgiplug&#x02122;; BD Biosciences, # 555029). All cell cultures were kept at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2.</sub> Before co-culture of new PBMCs with expanded T cells, PBMCs were stained with CellTrace&#x02122; Violet (Life Technologies, # C34557) to discriminate new PBMCs from expanded T cells in the subsequent flow cytometric analysis. In order to determine an antigen-specific response (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), a stimulation index was calculated based on the percentage of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> cells among viable CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>Celltrace&#x02122; Violet<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (i.e., the expanded T cells) in a co-culture with T cells and peptide-pulsed PBMCs divided by the corresponding value in the co-culture with expanded T cells and unstimulated PBMCs. A stimulation index of two was set as a cutoff for a valid response against the positive control; samples with a stimulation index &#x0003c; 2 for the control peptide were therefore excluded from all further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> model of hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion</title><p>A375, MeWo and SK-MEL-5 cells were exposed to melphalan hydrochloride (Alkeran&#x000ae;) for 1 h at 40&#x000b0;C, to mimic the current clinical protocol used in M-ILP, at concentrations resulting in 20&#x02013;40% cell death (50 &#x003bc;M for A375, 200 &#x003bc;M for MeWo, 60 &#x003bc;M for SK-MEL-5). As a hyperthermic treatment control, cells were incubated at 40&#x000b0;C for 1 h without cytostatic drugs, while an additional control included non-exposed, non-heat treated cells. The A375 cells were also exposed to a sub-lethal concentration (0.2 &#x003bc;M, causing 15&#x02013;30% cell death) of daunorubicin hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, #30450) for 24 h. After 24 h the melanoma cells were analyzed for immune-related stress markers by flow cytometry. Alternatively, the cells were co-cultured with PBMCs as described below.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-culture of melanoma cells and PBMCs</title><p>Buffy coats from anonymous healthy donors were obtained from the blood center at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital. PBMCs were purified with dextran sedimentation followed by density gradient separation with Lymphoprep&#x02122; (Alere Technologies AS, #1114547). The PBMCs were cultured together with melphalan-exposed A375 melanoma cells in 48-wells plates with flat bottoms. After 48 h, a fraction of the PBMCs was analyzed with a myeloid panel by flow cytometry while the remaining cells were transferred to new plates for further cultivation in IMDM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml Fungin&#x02122; and 2 mM L-glutamine in the presence of 500 U/ml recombinant human IL-2 (PeproTech, #200-02) for 14 days.

The expanded PBMCs were also co-incubated with untreated A375 (CD8<sup>+</sup>:A375 ratio of 0.5:1) for 27 h at 37&#x000b0;C in IMDM with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin to assess the capability of the expanded T cells to kill melanoma cells. The cytotoxicity of the T cells was assessed with an XTT cell proliferation kit (Roche, #11465015001), wherein the XTT reagent was added after 22 h and left in the culture for an additional 5 h before the absorbance was detected at 492 nm, and 690 nm for the background signal, with a FLUOstar Omega (BMG Labtech) instrument. As a control for total lysis of the melanoma cells, Triton&#x02122; X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, #X100) was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Vaccine preparation</title><p>A melphalan-based cell vaccine for an <italic>in vivo</italic> murine vaccination model was generated by culturing B16-F1-OVA cells in 1200 &#x003bc;M melphalan for 1 h.

In a further analysis of T cell subpopulations it was observed that treatment with M-ILP entailed a significant expansion of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>, CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) in patient blood (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). The expanded T<sub>regs</sub> showed enhanced expression of the T cell inhibitory receptor PD-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>).

PBMCs obtained before and 1 month after M-ILP were cultured with presence of peptides from common viral antigens (HCMV/EBV/influenza virus) or melanoma-associated peptides (NY-ESO-1/Melan-A/gp100), supplemented with IL-2.

At this point in time, CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells constituted &#x0003e;95% of all cultured cells. For several of the patients, culture in the presence of common antigens (HCMV/EBV/influenza virus) triggered a robust expansion of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>).

When subsequently challenged with live melanoma cells, a significantly higher number of the mice treated with the melphalan-based vaccine failed to develop tumors compared to control mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Endpoint tumor size was also significantly reduced in the mice vaccinated with melphalan-exposed cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). To determine immunological changes within the tumor that may contribute to the antitumoral response induced by the melphalan-based vaccine, the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were analyzed in the tumors. Immune priming with the melphalan-exposed cells elicited a more robust adaptive immune response compared to control and mitomycin-exposed cells as reflected by a significantly increased percentage of total intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and an enhanced frequency of OVA-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Mice treated with a melphalan-based cell vaccine are protected from tumor growth.

The treatment is mostly used in malignant melanoma and entails CR rates of 30&#x02013;80% (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). After perfusion, metastases typically do not disappear until several months after treatment, thus suggesting that the cytostatic properties of melphalan are not solely responsible for the observed tumor regression, thus implying the contribution of other, yet undefined mechanisms.</p><p>For the present study, we hypothesized that T cell-mediated immunity may have contributed to the antitumor efficacy of M-ILP in patients with in-transit melanoma metastases. This assumption was based on earlier studies demonstrating that cutaneous melanoma is associated with multiple neoantigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, presumably as the result of a high mutational burden in melanoma cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Local killing of metastases during M-ILP may therefore result in the release of large amounts of antigens that elicit T cell response. Additionally, the dying melanoma cells after M-ILP may express and/or release danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that potentiate immune responses as previously shown for anthracyclines, which reportedly trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) by stimulating the DC engulfment of apoptotic bodies and by cross-presentation of antigens to cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>In support of an immune-activating mechanism of M-ILP, we observed that human melanoma cell lines exposed to melphalan under mild hyperthermia, aiming to mimic the clinical M-ILP protocol, showed increased surface expression of the heat shock protein Hsp70 but not the &#x0201c;eat-me&#x0201d; molecule calreticulin, which accords with a previous study (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). We also observed that exposure of melanoma cells to melphalan induced expression of immune-related markers such as MHC class I (HLA-ABC), which may be relevant for the ability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to detect and eliminate malignant cells, and PD-L1 that serves to target PD-1 and thus may limit the T cell-mediated destruction of healthy tissue. While the implications of these findings for the clinical benefit of M-ILP remain to be determined, mining of the TCGA database revealed that high melanoma cell RNA expression of MHC class I as well as PD-L1 was associated with longer survival. No such association was seen for the ICD-related markers calreticulin and Hsp70.</p><p>Despite the absence of calreticulin induction, melphalan-exposed melanoma cells triggered protective immunity in a murine vaccination model. Hence, while injected live melanoma cells readily formed tumors in na&#x000ef;ve mice, there were fewer measurable tumors in vaccinated mice. Tumors formed in vaccinated mice contained higher levels of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and a higher frequency of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. As a comparison to melphalan, mice were vaccinated with mitomycin C-exposed melanoma cells, prior to challenge with viable melanoma cells. While this vaccine likewise provided a degree of protective immunity, it was less efficient than the melphalan-based vaccine in preventing tumor growth and in triggering intratumoral antigen-specific T cells. These findings concur with studies demonstrating that mitomycin C is a relatively weak inducer of ICD (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>When including PBMCs in the <italic>in vitro</italic> model of M-ILP, a modest but significant induction of CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes was observed. A similar induction was noted in patients undergoing M-ILP but it did not prognosticate clinical outcome. While the functional significance of the observed induction of CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes requires further investigation, the CD14<sup>++</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> intermediate and the CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>++</sup>non-classical monocyte populations have been shown to accumulate during infections and inflammatory conditions and to produce higher levels of cytokines such as TNF and IL-1&#x003b2;, compared with the classical monocytes (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A recent study showed by single cell RNA-sequencing that while the classical and non-classical monocytes belonged to two distinct gene expression clusters (referred to as Mono1 and Mono2, respectively), the intermediate monocyte population was highly heterogeneous with cells scattered into the Mono1 and Mono2 clusters as well as into two smaller unique clusters, denoted Mono3 and Mono4 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The monocyte markers used in our study did, however, not allow for sub-characterization of the intermediate monocyte population. Of note, the murine counterpart of non-classical monocytes is assumed to be the Ly6C<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> patrolling monocytes that have been ascribed a role in reducing tumor metastasis in experimental cancer models, presumably be recruiting cytotoxic immune cells (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>In patients and in the <italic>in vitro</italic> M-ILP model there were also signs of T cell activation. <italic>In vitro</italic> exposure of melanoma cells to melphalan triggered a pronounced induction of expanded functional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that produced high levels of granzyme B, perforin, and IFN-&#x003b3; and also degranulated in the presence of melanoma target cells in a cytotoxicity assay. In M-ILP treated melanoma patients, T cell activation was evident by increased expression of the activation marker HLA-DR on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells along with induction of regulatory T cells.</p><p>In support for an immunogenic mechanism of tumor reduction in M-ILP, patients whose CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responded strongly to a cocktail of common viral antigens (HCMV/EBV/influenza virus) were significantly more likely to achieve CR. This finding extends the results of previous studies showing that patients who achieve CR harbor T cells expressing high levels of the T cell activation marker HLA-DR prior to M-ILP (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Only low levels of melanoma-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected in the blood of patients with no apparent differences observed between CR and non-CR patients. While the lack of detection of melanoma-specific T cell immunity may be multi-factorial, we hypothesize that activated antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may have entered the tumor microenvironment. In support of this hypothesis, blood drawn from mice in the vaccination study 1 week after inoculation of melphalan-treated melanoma cells showed no significant alterations in T cell populations (data not shown), while the population of intratumoral melanoma-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells increased significantly in mice treated with the melphalan-based cell vaccine.</p><p>From the <italic>in vitro</italic> M-ILP model it was obvious that the expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in PBMCs that had been co-cultured with melphalan-exposed melanoma cells was significantly enhanced by the presence of IL-2. Thus, it is possible that IL-2 treatment following M-ILP would enhance the number and cytotoxic function of T cells in melanoma patients.</p><p>It has previously been shown that the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 therapy was pronounced for melanoma patients with high blood levels of CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and the combination of isolated limb infusion and the CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab in a phase II trial improved response rates and was associated with an increased T cell infiltration (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Alternatively, the efficacy of M-ILP may be boosted by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment based on our results showing induction of PD-L1 on melphalan-exposed melanoma cells and induction of T<sub>regs</sub> expressing high levels of PD-1.</p><p>In summary, our results lend support to the notion that the antitumor efficacy of M-ILP may, in part, be related to activation of T cell-mediated immunity. We hypothesize that the addition of IL-2, anti-CTLA-4, or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 may reinforce CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function in the tumor microenvironment to further ameliorate antitumor efficacy of M-ILP.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with ethics 424&#x02013;14, with approval by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg, Sweden.
