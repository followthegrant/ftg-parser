Predominantly transmitted through person-to-person contact, respiratory droplets or contaminated objects, HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, other strains of non-polio enteroviruses have also been reported to be causative pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Clinical manifestations of HFMD includes fever, sore throat and mouth, small vesicles, ulcers and rashes on the skins and mucous membranes of the oral cavity. Most patients recover within 7&#x02013;10 days without any clinical attention due to its typically mild and self-limiting nature. However, systemic complications, including aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, brainstem encephalitis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, and acute heart failure, are not uncommon, especially when associated with EV71 infection [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Asian countries have seen an increasing number of HFMD epidemics in recent years. A total of 2,819,581 newly diagnosed HFMD cases, and 394 fatalities, were reported in China in 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], substantially more than 1,855,457 cases in 2013 and 2,198,442 in 2012 [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, the largest ever outbreak of HFMD in Singapore, resulting in 29,686 cases and one death, was observed in 2008 [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although there has been very few death case seen due to HFMD in Hong Kong, thousands of people were affected every year. For instance, 691 outbreaks were recorded in 2015 and a total of 4,194 persons were involved [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As of Jun 4<sup>th</sup> in 2016, there have been 285 institutional outbreaks observed and 249 hospital admissions have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Global efforts are still ongoing to identify the mechanism facilitating the continuous HFMD outbreaks observed in recent years [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Evidence of the seasonality of HFMD has been found in studies from many locations [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For countries with relatively higher latitudes, such as Finland [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Japan [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a single peak of HFMD has been seen, during the summer, and autumn months, respectively. However, two annual peaks have been observed in regions with subtropical and tropical climates including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and parts of mainland China [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>A relationship between meteorological factors and the incidence of various infectious diseases has been frequently observed [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and there are several plausible mechanisms whereby these factors could affect the breeding, growth, and transmission of pathogens, as well as human behavior. Several time series studies have found associations between HFMD and weather, but the results have been inconsistent [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For example, studies from Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Guangdong, Henan, Shandong and Beijing in China have reported a positive association between temperature and HFMD [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], whereas a negative association has also been found [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, disparity in the strongest effect of temperature was revealed as well, with an inverse-U relationship by one study, with 23&#x000b0;C (74&#x000b0;F) as the temperature with the maximum morbidity [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], while another study from Southern China reported more HFMD cases were associated with both high and low same-day temperature [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although reported associations with temperature have been inconsistent, a significant and positive relationship between relative humidity and HFMD has been consistently reported [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Other weather factors, such as precipitation [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], wind speed [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and sunshine [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], have been investigated as well. Extreme high precipitation was found to be associated with higher HFMD incidence among children in Hefei, China [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while a study from Singapore reported an inverse-U association between weekly cumulative rainfall and HFMD with a peak at 75mm [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, more HFMD cases were found to be associated with higher wind speed [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in a nationwide study from 342 locations in China and with less sunshine [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in Rizhao, China.</p><p>Using a long time series from a large database of cases from all public hospitals in Hong Kong, the current study aimed to quantify the association of daily weather variations and hospitalizations for HFMD in Hong Kong, a subtropical Chinese city, using modern regression methods and controlling for multiple environmental factors, long-term trends, and seasonality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Data Sources</title><p>A clinical database from Hong Kong public hospitals, covering roughly 83% of all the inpatient admissions in the city, with discharge diagnoses encoded using the International Classification of Diseases, 9<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD-9, code for HFMD: 074.3) from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority was used for abstraction of daily counts of HFMD hospitalizations during the period 2008&#x02013;2011. Daily values of meteorological variables, including mean daily temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, and total daily rainfall and global solar radiation, were obtained from the Hong Kong Observatory.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Time-series regression analyses were used to model daily HFMD cases as a function of meteorological variation in Hong Kong. Distributed lag non-linear models [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and generalized additive models (GAMs) [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], with a negative binomial distribution assumed to account for over-dispersion, were constructed to assess potentially non-linear exposure-response dependencies and delayed effects simultaneously. Taking the incubation period of 3&#x02013;7 days for HFMD into account, we defined the maximum lag for meteorological factors as 14 days. Partial autocorrelation plots were used to determine the necessary number of autoregressive terms in the models. To adjust for seasonality and long-term trend, thin plate regression splines with 6 and 4 degrees of freedom (<italic>df</italic>), respectively, were incorporated in the models. Day of week and public holidays were also adjusted as categorical variables in all models. The model family can be formulated as follows:

Several proposed factors, including pathogen infectivity outside the host, human behavior, and immune function fluctuations, are involved in the seasonal patterns of infectious diseases [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and these factors could also be responsible for the relationship between meteorological variations and HFMD. Our findings are generally in line with studies from different regions of Asia [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our study found a positive association between temperature and HFMD, with increasing trends for mean temperatures between 8&#x000b0;C and 20&#x000b0;C and above 25&#x000b0;C and a plateau between 20&#x000b0;C and 25&#x000b0;C. Similar results have been reported from Rizhao, China, although the plateau for Rizhao was between 10&#x000b0;C and 20&#x000b0;C. [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This discrepancy is possibly due to climatic differences between these two cities, given that Rizhao has a temperate, four-season climate. A positive association with temperature has also been reported in Singapore [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Japan [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Hong Kong [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Zhengzhou, China [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. There is virological evidence verifying the temperature-sensitive nature of enteroviruses [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and other human enteric viruses [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, warmer weather usually facilitates more outdoor activities, and thus could intensify HFMD transmission through increasing close contacts between individuals.</p><p>A hockey-stick effect was found for relative humidity, with significantly increasing risks over 80%, but no strong association below 80%. A positive relationship between humidity and HFMD has been found consistently in Japan, Hong Kong and Rizhao, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen in China [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Laboratory evidence has shown that enterovirus 70 survival is proportional to the RH level at both moderate and high temperatures (20&#x000b0;C and 33&#x000b0;C) [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Fecal-oral has been postulated to be the dominant transmission route for HFMD in developing countries, whereas respiratory pathways could be more important in industrialized countries, due to better personal hygiene and sanitation facilities [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Enteroviruses are favored by higher humidity which allows it to persist longer on inanimate surfaces [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>There could be additional potential delays for rainfall relative to other meteorological variables. Precipitation could have an adverse impact on water and food sanitation, and therefore on HFMD transmission. Moderate rainfall (50<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;90<sup>th</sup> percentile, 0 mm&#x0003c;rainfall&#x0003c;17.7 mm) was observed to be associated with an over two-fold higher risk for HFMD hospitalization relative to no rainfall. This is consistent with the finding of a study from Singapore, which reported that moderate precipitation below 75 mm was positively associated with HFMD relative to no rainfall, and that the association reversed when weekly cumulative rainfall was above 75 mm [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, two studies from China found greater rainfall was consistently associated with more HFMD cases [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161006.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Ground water could be the ideal natural reservoir for maturation and incubation of enteroviruses before its entry to the host. On the other hand, heavy downpours, which could break this transmission by reshaping reservoirs into water currents, could also serve as a protective factor against HFMD. In addition, evidence has shown that physical activity is negatively associated with rainfall [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, extreme precipitation could assist interrupting the transmission by reducing social contacts.</p><p>Wind speed and solar radiation were found to be positively associated with HFMD hospitalizations. A previous study in Hong Kong found higher wind speed was associated with more HFMD cases and the authors speculated that stronger wind advanced the spread of disease through airborne droplets [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, our study found a negative association between HFMD and wind speed for wind speeds above 33.6 km/h. A systematic review on the association between ventilation and infection suggested that higher ventilation rates could decrease infection rates or outbreaks of some airborne diseases [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Hence, it was likely that strong natural ventilation could serve as a barrier for the spread of respiratory droplets. To date, little is known about the impact of solar radiation on infectious diseases. A study in Hong Kong found solar radiation was positively associated with all respiratory disease hospitalizations [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Some vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, including Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, influenza, rotavirus infection, hepatitis A virus infection and hepatitis B virus infection, were also found to be differentially influenced by ultraviolet radiation from the sun through modulating vector reproduction [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, a preventive effect of indoor solar radiation on HFMD was presumed [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. One plausible reason is that higher solar radiation could also cause temperatures at ground level in urban areas to be higher than temperatures measured at weather stations. Our findings indicated solar radiation and temperature could act synergistically in ways that need further study in subtropical regions where the duration of high temperature and strong radiation are relatively long throughout the year.</p><p>Subgroup analyses by gender and age group found that both factors were effect modifiers of the associations between meteorological factors and HFMD. Notably, children aged 3&#x02013;14 years old were more sensitive to relative humidity and solar radiation than pre-school-age children, as were males compared to females, which could be possibly due to that males and older children tend to be active outdoors rather than be taken care of at home. Further study is needed for the underlying reasons for this disparity.</p><p>The present study provided a better understanding of linkages between severe cases of hand, foot and mouth disease, and climate variability in Hong Kong. Along with human behavioral adaptations, the life cycle of enteroviruses could be influenced, directly or indirectly, by meteorological factors, which could potentially affect both the frequency and intensity of HFMD outbreaks. Despite being not able to fully capture the complex disease dynamics in a causal perspective, our study could be serve as an effective tool for establishing an early warning system, in which short-term weather forecasts and environmental surveillance could be adopted to temporally or spatially identify high risk for HFMD outbreaks and thus to prevent epidemics on a local scale. Although it was almost impossible to make prediction on the disease scale based on studies on non-causal association, surveillance capacity could be intensified and also prevention and control strategy, such as health resources allocation, could be enhanced. Moreover, from a clinical perspective, a physician could be alerted when seeing a severe patient with the corresponding symptoms as well as a hot and humid day (or days before) that admission is necessary for the prevention of transmission to a larger population. In addition, global climate change could have a potential impact on the seasonality and interannual pattern of occurrence of infectious diseases as well as the emergence and evolution of new pathogens. The evidence from our study showed the HFMD epidemiology could be partially affected by long-term global warming, as we found higher temperatures were associated with more hospitalizations.</p><p>We assessed the relationship between meteorological factors and HFMD on a daily time scale, which could evaluate real-time and delayed effect accurately, given the incubation period for HFMD and time lags for the effect of weather predictors were relatively short. Furthermore, we modelled the cumulative effect of meteorological variables from the first day until the maximum lags. Cumulative risks are presented as they explicitly account for same day as well as lagged effects, and thus better reflect the true impact of meteorological variables. Notwithstanding, a few limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, we used the hospitalization data for analysis, which likely underestimated the overall incidence in Hong Kong, given that most HFMD patients recover without any clinical attention. However, our study captured the impact of weather variations on more severe HFMD cases that arguably are of more public health significance. Second, the information on separation of pathogens causing HFMD was not available in this study. Because CA16 and EV71 could have distinct yearly seasonality based on region [<xref rid="pone.0161006.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], HFMD induced by different types of enteroviruses could be influenced differentially by meteorological factors. Further study is desirable with laboratory-confirmed causes of disease. Third, the values of meteorological variables we used in the analysis were measured at a single central monitoring station in Hong Kong, which may not reflect the actual exposure of the majority in the target population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study provides quantitative evidence that short-term meteorological variations could be used as early indicators for potential HFMD outbreaks.
