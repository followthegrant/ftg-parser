Study of the effects of hypoxia therefore provides a model to identify mechanisms of adipocyte dysfunction. Hypoxia has diverse effects on cell metabolism but specific processes linking hypoxia to discrete metabolic functions in adipocytes are not well-defined. Hexosamine biosynthesis (HBS) has been implicated in adipocyte differentiation and systemic metabolic disease <xref rid="pone.0071165-Einstein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071165-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

These data are primarily derived from murine systems and involve study of glucose homeostasis. The role of HBS in regulating lipid metabolism in adipocytes and its relationship to hypoxia are unknown, and data from human systems is sparse.</p><p>The goal of these experiments was to define the effects of hypoxia on human adipocyte lipid metabolism and identify underlying mechanisms. We hypothesized that hypoxia mediates its effects on adipocyte lipid metabolism through regulation of HBS. Our data demonstrate that hypoxia regulates lipid metabolism in human adipocytes and suggest a mechanistic link between HBS and hypoxia-induced alterations in lipogenesis and lipolysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects, Ethics Statement</title><p>Obese subjects undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery were enrolled and written informed consent was obtained with OHSU Institutional Review Board approval consistent with applicable institutional and governmental regulations including the Declaration of Helsinki, as well as Title 45, US Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects, revised Jan. 15, 2009, effective July 14, 2009.

Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data demonstrate that hypoxia induces a modest increase FAO in visceral adipocytes but has no effect on FAO in subcutaneous adipocytes. While increased FAO is not consistent with our hypothesis of hypoxia-induced increased lipid overflow, it is important to note that relative to its effects on lipolysis, hypoxia exerted modest effects on FAO in visceral adipocytes and had no effect on FAO in subcutaneous adipocytes. Rather than any single aspect of lipid metabolism, it is net cellular lipid flux and the relative balance of lipogenesis, lipolysis, and FAO that determine adipocyte lipid output. Furthermore, systemic <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolic effects are dictated by the sum of the contributions of all adipose tissue depots, which manifest quantitative and qualitative differences in metabolism to a range of stimuli, including hypoxia, as our data demonstrate. The significance of these depot-specific differences in hypoxic responses at the systemic level is unclear, but in contrast to lipolysis and lipogenesis which were similarly regulated by hypoxia in adipocytes from both depots, the magnitude of the FAO response to hypoxia was modest in visceral adipocytes and absent in subcutaneous adipocytes, suggesting that with respect to total body adipose tissue stores, hypoxia instead has a more important role in regulating lipolysis and lipogenesis. A proportionally greater hypoxia-induced inhibition of lipogenesis and induction of lipolysis compared to induction of FAO, as observed in our data, would be consistent with increased lipid overflow from adipose tissue and shunting of lipid to other tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>HBS as an Underlying Mechanism of Hypoxia&#x02019;s Effects on Adipocyte Lipid Metabolism</title><p>We demonstrate that hypoxia inhibits HBS, and that inhibition of HBS mimics hypoxia&#x02019;s effects on adipocyte lipogenesis and basal lipolysis in normoxic conditions, inhibiting lipogenesis and inducing lipolysis.

This discrepancy may reflect differences in human and murine systems. As far as we know, no data studies the role of HBS in regulating lipolysis in adipocytes. The effects of HBS inhibition applied to both visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes in the case of lipogenesis, but only to visceral adipocytes in the case of lipolysis, suggesting qualitative depot-specific differences in the role of HBS in regulating lipolysis, similar to the observed depot-specific differences in hypoxia&#x02019;s regulation of FAO. These observations also suggest that unlike visceral adipocytes, subcutaneous adipocytes regulate hypoxia-induced lipolysis via mechanisms other than HBS. Taken together, these findings suggest that hypoxia mediates some of its effects on adipocyte lipid metabolism via inhibition of HBS.</p><p>Data is conflicting regarding whether HBS is metabolically detrimental or beneficial at the systemic level <xref rid="pone.0071165-Einstein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0071165-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and like hypoxia, HBS likely has both adaptive and maladaptive effects. Our data suggest that HBS promotes adipocyte lipid storage and inhibits free fatty acid release, consistent with a beneficial role for HBS with respect to adipocyte lipid metabolism via promotion of adipocyte buffering capacity.

These low magnitude effects may be explained in part by the intrinsic heterogeneity of human adipocyte cultures, which range from 60&#x02013;90% differentiation efficiency. In addition, variability between patient samples contributed to the low magnitudes of some signals, but with paired analysis, these differences were nonetheless statistically significant. Future experiments studying adipocytes derived from dedicated purified precursor subpopulations from subjects matched for clinical variables may provide more homogenous populations and increase assay signal. Finally and importantly, the effect of hypoxia on HBS was modest, mediating only a 0.8-fold decrease in HBS. Nonetheless, this effect was reproducible, statistically significant, and identical with two different assays (Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy). Furthermore, the effects of azaserine and glucosamine on adipocyte lipid metabolism, while statistically significant, were of similarly low magnitudes. These low magnitude effects suggest that HBS is likely one of many factors that mediates hypoxia&#x02019;s effects on adipocyte lipid metabolism. Off-target effects of azaserine and glucosamine may further contribute to these modest effects.
