Discovery of synthetic nucleic acid regulatory elements has been a long-standing goal of chemical biologists. Availability of vast genome level genetic resources has motivated efforts for discovery and understanding of inducible synthetic genetic regulatory elements. Such elements can lead to custom-design of switches and sensors, oscillators, digital logic evaluators and cell&#x02013;cell communicators. Here, we describe a simple, robust and universally applicable module for discovery of inducible gene regulatory elements. The distinguishing feature is the use of a toxic peptide as a reporter to suppress the background of unwanted bacterial recombinants. Using this strategy, we show that it is possible to isolate genetic elements of non-genomic origin which specifically get activated in the presence of DNA gyrase A inhibitors belonging to fluoroquinolone (FQ) group of chemicals. Further, using a system level genetic resource, we prove that the genetic regulation is exerted through histone-like nucleoid structuring (H-NS) repressor protein. Till date, there are no reports of <italic>in vivo</italic> selection of non-genomic origin inducible regulatory promoter like elements. Our strategy opens an uncharted route to discover inducible synthetic regulatory elements from biologically-inspired nucleic acid sequences.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>18 March 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Synthetic biology aims to control and decipher structure and operation of biological systems by developing bioengineering tools such as functional genetic circuits. However, designing reliable and predictable gene networks of synthetic origin is difficult due to unexpected behaviour and non-cooperation from RNA and protein synthesis machinery of the host cells (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Synthetic regulatory elements that dictate the transcriptional control have led to custom-design of switches and sensors, oscillators, digital logic evaluators and cell&#x02013;cell communicators, etc (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Deciphering the underlying mechanism of such design principles will help tailor the genetic machinery toward applications in biosensing, bioremediation, metabolic engineering and clinical testing (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A prerequisite for the above proposed explorations is to establish basic rules for construction of such genetic circuits. One of the limiting factors in the development of synthetic genetic system is the lack of novel promoter elements which respond to specific stimuli. Combinatorial approaches can facilitate the evolution of desirable genetic regulatory elements by engineering prokaryotic promoters (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Directed evolution of native promoters has been achieved by promoter engineering for isolating constitutive promoters with precise strength and regulation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, there is a dearth of studies which report the isolation of inducible promoter sequences of non-genomic origin. Such inducible regulatory biological &#x02018;parts&#x02019; will behave predictably and will allow for the continuous control of gene expression at molecular level. We show here that by using a novel screening strategy, ligand inducible promoters can be discovered via combinatorial engineering.</p><p>Bacteria respond to stress by activating specific genes in a highly regulated manner. These responses not only protect bacteria from the offending stress, but also manifest changes in the cell (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Sigma factors (&#x003c3;) play an important role in controlling the expression of genes which are involved in combating various stresses (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Mechanistically, the stress sigma factors (&#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>24</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>s</sup> etc.) bind to cognate regulatory elements and activate the gene expression (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The genetic elements involved in the regulation of stress genes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> have been used to design genetic circuits that can sense the environmental toxicants and also reprogram the bacterial cells by tuning gene expression (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the present study, potential of stress responsive promoters was explored by designing a combinatorial library inspired by &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>32</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>24</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>s</sup> promoters. Design of the initial library based on stress related sigma factors provided an opportunity for discovery of both constitutive and inducible promoters. An efficient reporter gene is central to the selection of inducible genetic elements. Extant reporter systems based on green fluorescent protein (GFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), luciferase (lux) and &#x003b2;-galactosidase have led to successful isolation of constitutive promoters of varying strengths (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). As compared to directed evolution of native promoters, combinatorial strategy poses challenge of managing large diversity of clones. In an attempt to isolate both inducible and constitutive promoter elements from a pool of a combinatorial library, we used a GFP based reporter system. However, failure to isolate inducible promoters prompted us to devise a selection strategy based on <italic>E. coli</italic> toxic peptide (IbsC) as a reporter (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This reporter system efficiently reduced the noise of constitutive promoters. Screening of &#x0223c;10 000 clones led to isolation of an inducible genetic element which responded specifically to fluoroquinolone (FQ) category of antibiotics. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis revealed that the selected DNA sequence is of non-genomic origin. Further, characterization of the regulatory element revealed regular features of prokaryotic promoters like; &#x02212;10, &#x02212;35 and spacer sequences. A set of genetic and biochemical experiments were used to investigate the regulatory mechanism of the FQ-responsive genetic element. We have established that the repression of this fluoroquinolone responsive promoter is mediated through a histone-like nulceoid structuring protein (H-NS).</p><p>In this study, an <italic>in vivo</italic> live and dead cell selection strategy has been adopted for the first time to discover an inducible regulatory element of non-genomic origin. The strategy allows minimum background while targeting inducible gene regulatory elements and is applicable to other ligands. This study adds a new dimension to the protein based regulatory elements for engineering inducible synthetic gene circuits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Strains and Media</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strains RFM443 (generous gift from Prof. Shimshon Belkin, Hebrew University, Israel), <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; and <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 DE3 were used for routine transformation experiments.

While designing, the frequency of different nucleotides at various extant positions in promoter region was taken into consideration. This approach deals with diversifying the stress responsive natural promoter sequence with the objective of evolving a promoter with new characteristics. Multiple sequence alignment of the stress responsive promoters revealed sparse conservation at &#x02212;10, &#x02212;35 and the spacer region. Even though alignment did show presence of conserved nucleotide sequence in the &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 promoter elements, there were always some exceptions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Supplementary Figure S1). A degenerate &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 promoter oligonucleotide library was designed. Since the spacer region was A or AT-rich, a bias for both polyA and AT richness was created in the spacer region. In essence, the design of the stress-promoter library appeared to be almost random barring few A or AT-rich regions.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-3"><title>Construction of toxic peptide and GFP-based reporter systems</title><p>We developed two reporter systems; based on toxic peptide IbsC and GFP as reporters.

This reporter system provides advantage over the positive selection system because the expression of the toxic peptide leads to killing of the bacterial cells which eventually screens out the background clones harboring constitutive promoters. We cloned the combinatorial library sequences upstream of ibsC gene as p<italic>NYL::ibsC</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic> RFM443 strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This strategy ensured that following transformation, the surviving cells harbor either inducible genetic elements or non-functional sequences. Due to strong bactericidal effect of the peptide, the reporter system selects against leaky and constitutive promoters. To discover the inducible regulatory elements from this pool, replica plates of about 10 000 clones from the library were screened with chemicals from following categories &#x02013; DNA damaging, protein damaging and heavy metals at sub-lethal concentrations (Supplementary Figure S2A&#x02013;B).</p><p>This screening strategy led to the discovery of a clone harboring nalidixic acid responsive genetic element. Nalidixic acid responsive recombinant plasmid was isolated from the clone and re-transformed in the host strain <italic>E. coli</italic> RFM443 strain to confirm the effect of the cloned DNA fragment. Further, the growth kinetics of <italic>E. coli</italic> RFM443 strain harboring reporter plasmid and a control plasmid (p<italic>Rx::ibsC</italic>) were studied in presence of 5 &#x003bc;g/ml nalidixic acid. It was observed that the growth profile of uninduced p<italic>Nal::ibsC</italic> and p<italic>Rx::ibsC</italic> was nearly similar but 5 &#x003bc;g/ml of nalidixic acid was able to induce the expression of toxic peptide which resulted in inhibition of growth of p<italic>Nal::ibsC</italic> harboring <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Though there was some reduction in the growth of induced p<italic>Rx::ibsC</italic> cells attributable to the antibacterial effect of nalidixic acid at 5 &#x003bc;g/ml concentration, no growth was visible for p<italic>Nal::ibsC</italic> containing cells. Notably, this is the first report where a toxic peptide has been successfully used for the discovery of inducible regulatory elements from a diverse pool of sequences.

Further, the genetic element was inducible at 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml of nalidixic acid as compared to 5 &#x003bc;g/ml in the latter case (Supplementary Figure S6A&#x02013;B).</p><p>Inducible regulatory elements are required for controlling gene expression continuously for processes like expression of recombinant proteins, development of biosensors for environmental monitoring and discovery of novel antibacterial compounds with predefined mode of action (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). FQ-responsive regulatory elements discovered in this study can be optimized for some of the above processes. For example, toxic peptide based reporter system (p<italic>Nal::ibsC</italic>) can be used as a tool to discover gyrase A inhibitors from small molecule libraries of synthetic and natural origin.

In <italic>E. coli</italic>, a typical promoter is recognized by RNA polymerase based on its &#x02212;10 (TATAAT) and &#x02212;35 (TAGACA) consensus regions which are separated by a stretch of &#x0223c;15&#x02013;16 spacer nucleotides (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) except for &#x003c3;54 promoters that contain &#x02212;12 and &#x02212;24 signature consensus sequence. The putative &#x02212;10 TATA box (3&#x02032;-TATATG-5&#x02032;) and &#x02212;35 box (3&#x02032;-CATAAA-5&#x02032;) consensus sequences of FQ-responsive genetic element were identified using prokaryotic promoter prediction software, PePPER (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Interestingly, the spacer region in the selected sequence was predominantly rich with thymine nucleotides (T). In order to ascertain if the putative &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 sequences conform to their conventional positions, we replaced the toxic peptide reporter with GFP and tested the response of the FQ-responsive genetic element (shown as Nal<sub>W</sub> in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The enhanced GFP fluorescence in the presence of 5 &#x003bc;g/ml nalidixic acid confirmed that the response was not limited to expression of toxic peptide only. Following this, two partially random oligonucleotide libraries at &#x02212;35 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">B</xref>) and &#x02212;10 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>) were synthesized and cloned in GFP reporter plasmid to study the regulatory role of &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 regions in FQ-responsive element. Variation of sequence at putative &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 boxes led to either total abrogation of promoter activity (Nal-mut5, Nal-mut6 and Nal-mut7) likely due to lack of interaction with RNA polymerase or the promoter lost its inducibility and turned constitutive (Nal-mut1, Nal-mut2, Nal-mut3 and Nal-mut4). The results of the mutants with extreme activities are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>. Further, the role of spacer region was investigated by synthesizing two mutant variants; one with all thymine &#x02018;all T&#x02019; and another with all adenine &#x02018;all A&#x02019; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Interestingly, the loss in the regulation through nalidixic acid occurred for &#x02018;all T&#x02019; variants as inducible nature of promoter was converted into constitutive nature.

Taken together, it appears that the nucleotide sequence of the spacer, &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 regions of the selected promoter are important for gene regulation which may be indirect effect of FQ on modulating the H-NS binding on promoter.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Architecture analysis of FQ responsive promoter.

We hypothesized that the regulation of FQ inducible promoter might be mediated by a repressor or an activator protein. To explore the regulatory pathway of the promoter, we used a genetic strategy involving over-expressed ASKA and Keio knock out library of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We selected a panel of previously reported <italic>E. coli</italic> regulatory proteins which play a significant role in regulation of stress response (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). To identify the activator protein involved in the regulation of Nal-promoter, p<italic>Nal::ibsC-amp</italic> (test) and p<italic>Rx::ibsC-amp</italic> (control) were co-transformed separately in the selected ASKA library overexpressors. The co-transformed <italic>E. coli</italic> cells harboring p<italic>Nal::ibsC-amp</italic> and pCA24N ASKA overexpressor plasmids were induced with IPTG during the early log phase. No noticeable difference between the growth of induced cells was observed which ruled out the role of inducer protein in regulation of the FQ-responsive promoter (data not shown). Further on, we focused on the possibility of repression based gene regulation of this promoter. To investigate the repressor proteins, we used Keio knockout library and transformed p<italic>Nal::ibsC-amp</italic> and p<italic>Rx::ibsC-amp</italic> fusion system in the selected panel of deletion mutants of <italic>E. coli</italic> stress regulators (Supplementary Figure S7).

H-NS is a nucleoid associated protein which preferentially binds to the AT-rich sequences. It is also known to bind to the horizontally acquired foreign DNA sequences (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The genetic evidence from the above experimental results suggested that H-NS plays a pivotal role in regulation of FQ-responsive promoter likely by binding and repressing the promoter.</p><p>The mechanism of regulation of the selected FQ-responsive promoter may be hypothesized on the basis of global role of H-NS as stress repressor coupled with FQ mediated stress response in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Our experimental data are also in line with this hypothesis. H-NS binds preferentially to DNA with intrinsic curvature (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). H-NS contains an amino-terminal oligomerization domain, a carboxyl-terminal nucleic-acid-binding domain and a flexible linker that connects these two functional modules. Due to its structural features, H-NS forms dimers and has the ability to create DNA&#x02013;protein&#x02013;DNA bridges both between separate DNA strands and between different portions of the same DNA strand (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). H-NS&#x02013;DNA nucleoprotein structures can impede the movement of RNA polymerase and thus H-NS can repress transcription through its DNA-binding and bridging activities (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The bridging activity of H-NS makes the protein sensitive to the structure of DNA, as a result of which it binds to the promoter DNA leading to transcription repression. In our case, sub-lethal concentration of FQ inhibits the strand resealing DNA activity of gyrase A but not the nicking activity. Consequently, this concentration of fluoroquinolone induces topological changes in the DNA strands. We hypothesize that the FQ-induced relaxation of DNA alters the intrinsic curvature of promoter DNA that leads to the inability of H-NS to remain bound to the promoter leading to the turning-on of the promoter. Our proposed model in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> is in agreement with the repressive H-NS promoter complex based gene regulation proposed in recent studies (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>A model illustrating the repression mechanism of FQ-responsive promoter by H-NS.

H-NS protein was able to bind to the promoter in a concentration dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). In order to determine the binding affinity of selected regulatory element with H-NS protein, the data from gel-shift experiments were analyzed. The apparent binding constant (Kd) of H-NS interaction with the selected regulatory element was calculated to be 399 nM. It is well documented that H-NS binds to DNA in a sequence-independent fashion, yet it shows a strong preference for regions of intrinsic curvature (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Architecture analysis of Nal promoter variants at &#x02212;10, &#x02212;35 and spacer regions already established that the selected genetic element is a unique inducible promoter. Interestingly it has been observed that the inactive and constitutive variants of spacer regions (&#x02018;all A&#x02019; and &#x02018;all T&#x02019;, respectively) failed to show any binding in the mobility shift assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">C</xref>).

We observed that the Nal variants had lost the curvature nature which affected the H-NS repressor binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">C</xref>). The DNA sequence of FQ-responsive promoter showed an accentuated curvature, possibly favoring the interaction with H-NS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Analysis of other stress related <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters (<italic>grpE</italic> and <italic>recA</italic>) revealed that the curvature of these promoter sequences was insignificant (data not shown). Repression was most effective at spacer regions of the promoter because repressor protein was able to bind at spacer regions hence interfering with RNA polymerase binding (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Also, the <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of variants of spacer region (&#x02018;all A&#x02019; and &#x02018;all T&#x02019;) was found not to favor the intrinsic curvature.

Such non-genomic sequences bearing no homology with the bacterial genome can prove to be more stable due to lack of recombination with genomic sequences. Use of GFP-based reporter system for isolation of inducible genetic regulatory elements from a pool of diverse oligonucleotide library proved to be complicated. The library screening and background issues associated with conventional reporters were resolved by developing a simple, robust and universally applicable screening methodology. This led to the isolation of a novel regulatory element which specifically responded to fluoroquinolones (DNA gyrase A inhibitors). The methodology is a noise-free selection strategy and opens a new route to discover ligand-responsive novel gene regulatory elements from diverse oligonucleotide sequences. The FQ-responsive regulatory sequence contained attributes of a promoter. We used genetic and biochemical assays to confirm and validate that regulation of the selected genetic elements occurs through the transcriptional silencer, H-NS. This study also establishes and confirms findings by other groups that H-NS protein preferentially regulates curved and acquired functional DNA sequences.
