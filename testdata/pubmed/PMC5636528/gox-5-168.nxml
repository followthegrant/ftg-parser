The goals of treatment of the burned ear are to prevent chondritis, maintain form and function and salvage auricular structure. We propose a classification system and management algorithm for ear burns to better treat these injuries.</p><p><bold>METHODS:</bold> A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who were seen and diagnosed with ear burns at The University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC) from 2007&#x02013;2013. Charts were reviewed and searched for key phrases, including &#x0201c;ear&#x0201d; &#x0201c;burn&#x0201d; &#x0201c;chondritis&#x0201d; &#x0201c;cartilage&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;sulfamylon&#x0201d;. Microbiology and pathology data were examined for details regarding infections and chondritis. Patients with ear burns were initially managed similarly with topical sulfamylon, removal of pillows to prevent direct pressure on ears, hydrotherapy, and bedside debridement. They then progressed down the algorithm taking into account the depth of burn and amount of exposed cartilage.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> From 2007&#x02013;2013, 109 patients with at least 1 ear burn were treated at UCMC. Of these, 77 (70.6%) were male and 32 (29.4%) were female. Patients ranged from 5 months to 75 years old. 27 patients had operative interventions for their ear burns. All ear burns requiring operative intervention had exposed or burned cartilage. Operative intervention occurred an average of 8.8 days after admission, with a range of 1&#x02013;42 days. Closure methods included complete or partial primary closure (8 patients), STSG coverage (24 patients), or a combination of these approaches. Most patients required only 1 surgery to treat their ear burns, while one patient required a total of 5 surgeries. The incidence of suppurative chondritis in our patient population was 0.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> Although chondritis is a serious complication of ear burns, our protocol has effectively eliminated chondritis in patients with ear burns admitted to UCMC. Ear burns were classified by depth of injury, presence of viable perichondrium, amount of exposed cartilage, and presence of burned cartilage. Our approach to ear burns involves minimizing pressure to the ear, wound care involving sulfamylon, hydrotherapy treatment for nonoperative debridement and early operative intervention for burns with exposed/burned cartilage, with coverage methods that range from primary closure to local flap closure, depending on the amount of cartilage exposed.</p></body></article>
