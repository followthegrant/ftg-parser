Loud, impulsive sounds from seismic surveys have been associated with impacts on many marine taxa including mammals, crustaceans, cephalopods, and fish. However, impacts across large spatial scales or multiple species are rarely considered. We modelled over 8,000&#x02009;hours of cetacean survey data across a large marine ecosystem covering&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;880,000 km<sup>2</sup> to investigate the effect of seismic surveys on baleen and toothed whales. We found a significant effect of seismic activity across multiple species and habitats, with an 88% (82&#x02013;92%) decrease in sightings of baleen whales, and a 53% (41&#x02013;63%) decrease in sightings of toothed whales during active seismic surveys when compared to control surveys. Significantly fewer sightings of toothed whales also occurred during active versus inactive airgun periods of seismic surveys, although some species-specific response to noise was observed. This study provides strong evidence of multi-species impacts from seismic survey noise on cetaceans. Given the global proliferation of seismic surveys and large propagation distances of airgun noise, our results highlight the large-scale impacts that marine species are currently facing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Behavioural ecology</kwd><kwd>Conservation biology</kwd><kwd>Ecosystem ecology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Anthropogenic activities influence marine ecosystems in every part of the world&#x02019;s oceans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, and marine species have long been exposed to their detrimental effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Over 60% of the global oceans experienced increases in human impacts in the five years leading up to 2015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Within this context, impacts from underwater noise pollution have been recognized as significant environmental issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, with human activities such as commercial shipping, seismic surveys, and sonar being major sources of marine noise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Airguns fired aboard seismic survey vessels are used for seabed mapping and hydrocarbon exploration, and produce pulsed, high intensity sounds. Sound source levels of 248&#x02013;255&#x02009;dB re 1 &#x000b5;Pa-m, zero-to-peak, are typical of full scale seismic arrays, with levels of at least 10&#x02009;dB less when measured horizontally around vessels compared to downward directed sounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Global spending on seismic data acquisition has been steadily increasing over the past 20 years, with almost US$10 billion spent on marine seismic surveys in 2013 alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Despite this method of exploration being commonly employed globally for over 40 years, more knowledge is needed on its broad-scale ecological impacts.</p><p id="Par3">The impacts of seismic survey noise, at scales immediately surrounding the sound source, have been recorded in a diverse range of species, including fish, invertebrates, plankton, and reptiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, the low frequency sounds generated by seismic airguns, commonly below 200&#x02009;Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, may extend over large distances, particularly in deeper waters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These sounds have been recorded at locations up to 4,000&#x02009;km from the source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and can &#x02018;blanket&#x02019; areas of up to 300,000 km<sup>2</sup> with noise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Generally, the dominant frequencies of seismic airguns overlap with those of the communication signals of baleen whales (10&#x02009;Hz&#x02013;1&#x02009;kHz) and seismic sounds may be audible to toothed whales at distances up to 100&#x02009;km away<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

Available evidence suggests that seismic survey noise may influence the behaviour of cetaceans in a number of ways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> potentially leading to reduced sighting rates e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

Similar effects have also been noted by studies focused on toothed whale species; including displacement of sperm whales (<italic>Physeter macrocephalus</italic>), short-term displacement of harbour porpoise (<italic>Phocoena phocoena</italic>) close to the noise source, and avoidance behaviours by Atlantic spotted dolphin (<italic>Stenella frontalis</italic>) in response to seismic noise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Notwithstanding this growing body of evidence supporting the negative effects of seismic surveys on cetaceans, most studies to date have focused on individual species, were carried out at relatively small spatial or temporal scales, and often lacked non-seismic-control data to accurately determine impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The Northeast Atlantic is a diverse marine environment both in term of habitat and species richness, and is home to over 40 species of marine mammal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, many of which are considered either endangered, threatened or data deficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. These animals are likely attracted to areas of significant biological productivity such as the Celtic-Biscay Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Over the last ten years, substantial levels of seismic survey activity have been carried out across much of this area, providing an opportunity to examine the effect of seismic activity on acoustically sensitive marine mammals over a broad and diverse spatial scale. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the effect of seismic surveys, and in particular, airgun activity, on the sighting density of cetaceans (both baleen and toothed whales) across multiple species and habitats. To do this we used cetacean sightings data collected on seismic vessels during operations, and comparable data collected from control (non-seismic) vessels. Cetacean sightings were modelled using an additive Generalised Estimating Equations-Complex Region Spatial Smoother (GEE-CReSS) model that included temporal and environmental variables in addition to a spatial component. This study is the first to combine cetacean surveys from seismic survey vessels with other cetacean surveys as control data, taking a multi-species, large-scale approach to examining the effect of seismic surveys on cetaceans, while also accounting for the potential influence of spatial, environmental and temporal variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par6">Approximately 8,000 hrs of survey effort data was incorporated in the analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) including 1,020 hrs of control data and 6,980 hrs of seismic data (seismic data did not include pre-shooting, soft-starts, ramp-up or airgun testing periods) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

As a result, the effects of increasing anthropogenic disturbance in this vast environment is rapidly becoming an ecological issue of global significance. Against a backdrop of increasing anthropogenic disturbance in our oceans, dwindling fossil fuel reserves are driving the search for hydrocarbon resources further offshore. Therefore, assessing the impact of seismic surveys across diverse and relatively inaccessible habitats is of great importance. This study examined the effect of seismic surveys on cetaceans in an extensive and bathymetrically diverse offshore region of the Northeast Atlantic. Our results suggest a significant effect of seismic surveys across multiple cetacean species, with consistent decrease in sightings, particularly in the offshore waters to the west and southwest of Ireland, an area identified as of relative importance for cetaceans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">Baleen whales are generally assumed to be more vulnerable to disturbance from seismic airgun noise than toothed whales due to a greater overlap with the frequency ranges of their communication signals and hearing sensitivities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, we also noted a similar reduction in toothed whale sightings across species and habitats in this study. Although very little information on the seasonality of cetacean distribution is available for offshore Eastern Atlantic waters, current literature suggests a low temporal overlap between seismic surveys (concentrated between June and August) and the timing of peak occurrences of baleen whales in our study LME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Despite this, the results of the baleen whale control model found a significant reduction in sightings associated with seismic activity, and the seismic model indicated that although the overall sighting densities of baleen whales remained unaffected, some redistribution of these animals occurred. In contrast to baleen whales, the peak occurrences of many offshore toothed whales may coincide more closely with the peak in seismic activity in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. As a result of this temporal overlap, toothed whales may be more regularly exposed to seismic noise than baleen whales in the Northeast Atlantic, and for longer time periods, potentially resulting in the significant reduction in sightings densities observed in this study. With the exception of common dolphins, highly represented species did not influence overall model outputs suggesting that while there may be variability in the thresholds required to elicit a behavioural response and in the spatial/temporal scale of impact, the response of cetaceans to seismic survey noise is somewhat ubiquitous. While our results are consistent with previous findings of localised spatial avoidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and temporary displacement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> of whale species in response to seismic noise, they also highlight the importance of timing of the seismic activity in mitigating against the disturbance.</p><p id="Par13">While we noted a significant difference between control surveys and both active and inactive airgun periods of seismic surveys, we found no effect of airguns on baleen whale sightings within seismic surveys (active <italic>versus</italic> inactive periods). While this may be indicative of a temporal effect relating to species-specific movement or susceptibility to disturbance as inactive airgun periods often occur between active periods, we argue that they cannot be considered representative of baseline conditions and should not be used as a control when assessing impacts of seismic surveys. The scale and scope of this study allowed us to examine the effects of seismic surveys on cetaceans across a large marine ecosystem whilst accounting for spatial and environmental factors, and conclusively found reduced cetacean sightings as a result of seismic survey activity. However, the limitations of the available data are such that although differences in detectability resulting from distance between the survey vessel and the animals were accounted for, low overall sighting numbers meant that it was not possible to calculate detectability at the level of individual observers, or to account availability bias of the animals (i.e. the proportion of time spent submerged and therefore unavailable for detection). Furthermore, the data are unsuited for quantifying the spatio-temporal scale of impacts outside the visual range and observation periods of the observers, or to conclusively identify the nature of the effect, i.e. displacement from the area or a behavioural change (for example decreased surfacing rates) resulting in reduced detectability. While detection functions for seismic surveys showed higher probability of detection further from the trackline than for control surveys, whether this is a behavioural response due to cetaceans avoiding areas of highest noise along the trackline remains speculative.</p><p id="Par14">Sound propagation models for seismic survey noise accounting for bathymetry, sediment, water temperature/salinity and ambient noise, show that the noise &#x02018;footprint&#x02019; (i.e. the area where seismic survey noise frequencies detectable by cetaceans above ambient noise) of seismic surveys is potentially large in deep waters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and can be at levels consistent with temporary threshold shifts and behavioural responses in marine mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In addition, studies have shown that airgun activity along the continental margins propagates into the deep ocean and is a significant component of low-frequency noise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. While permanent hearing threshold shifts are less likely to occur at ranges beyond 500&#x02009;m from the sound source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, it is likely that received noise levels may exceed thresholds for eliciting behavioural responses in cetaceans over much larger distances than the visual range of observers on survey vessels. However, more research is needed to specifically quantify species-specific behavioural response thresholds under different social and environmental conditions and determine the spatio-temporal scale of the effect. The increasing global coverage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, large noise propagation distances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and documented impacts of seismic airgun noise across a range of vertebrate and invertebrate species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> suggests that seismic survey effects on marine biota are likely to increase.

The area contains a diverse variety of habitats, including shallow shelf waters approximately 200&#x02009;m in depth, underwater sea cliffs and canyon systems, deep water environments such as troughs, and abyssal plains which reach depths of over 4000&#x02009;m. Over the last ten years there have been substantial sea floor mapping surveys, as well as exploration for oil and gas deposits in the Northeast Atlantic (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Seismic survey vessels carry MMOs as part of mitigation practices. MMOs undertake visual surveys for cetaceans prior to the commencement of operations (the start of air-gun generated noise), and regularly continue surveying throughout seismic operations. However, inactive periods during seismic surveys are generally surrounded by active periods, and as a result cannot be considered a true baseline of cetacean encounter rates. Therefore, between April 2015 and July 2017 a control data acquisition programme was undertaken (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

A single experienced observer, located on the viewing platform of the survey vessel, scanned out to the horizon with the naked eye for presence of marine mammals. Binoculars with reticles or range finding sticks were used to estimate distances from the survey vessel and confirm sightings or species identifications. MMOs were at similar heights onboard both seismic and control vessels (mean seismic vessel observer height 14.37&#x02009;m&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.96&#x02009;SD, mean control vessel observer height 14.74&#x02009;m&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.64&#x02009;SD). Seismic observers scanned a 360&#x000b0; zone around the vessel, while control observers scanned a 180&#x000b0; zone forward of the vessel, with the difference accounted for within the effort term (offset in the sighting density models) described below. Observers recorded the GPS track of the vessel, the duration of all survey effort periods, and sightings data. Survey data was quality checked and any observations missing accurate vessel locations, observer effort, cetacean id or group size were not included in the analysis. This was more likely to occur in older surveys where less strict reporting requirements were in place.

Each of the four detection function global models included the covariates for Beaufort sea state, group size, and individual survey ID (an ID assigned to each individual control and seismic survey) to account for inherent differences in detectability between survey types (seismic/control), individual surveys (i.e. individual vessel/observer combinations), and in different weather conditions. Model fit was confirmed using standard goodness-of-fit tests for distance sampling, and hazard or half-normal detection function and variable selection was based on Akaike&#x02019;s Information Criterion (AIC) scores (all three covariates were retained in all four final models).

Previous studies have used inactive airgun periods as a control for the effect of active airguns. However, inactive periods are often surrounded by active airguns, such that inactive periods may have already been subject to behavioural responses such as movement away from the area. We specifically tested for this by using control vessels as a baseline for cetacean occurrence. However, we were also interested in differences in sightings rates between active and inactive airgun periods. We therefore performed two analyses; one comparing data from seismic survey vessels and non-seismic vessels (control models), and another comparing active and inactive periods of seismic surveys (seismic models). The models included one factor covariate, survey activity, which included two levels for seismic models; active (airguns operating on full-power on a seismic survey vessel), and inactive (no airgun activity on a seismic survey vessel), and three levels for the control models; active, inactive, and control (no airgun activity on a non-seismic vessel) (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
