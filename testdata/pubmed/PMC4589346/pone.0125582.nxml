The goal of the Highly Active Anti-retroviral Treatment (HAART) is to achieve and maintain viral suppression, preserve immune function and stop HIV progression. A major complication of the HAART is side effects, which go from diarrhea and nausea to skin rash, lipodisthrophy and hyperglicemia among others [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Drug resistance is also a major concern. When a patient misses doses, the virus can become resistant to the regimen and the condition is likely to progress to AIDS. Since the HAART regimen was first used in 1996, the morbidity and mortality rates of people living with HIV/AIDS have decreased substantially, making HIV a chronic condition [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Great efforts have been made to make HAART available to patients; however, optimal HAART adherence is critical, but problematic [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0125582.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>As of January 2014, in Puerto Rico (PR) there have been reported 45,788 HIV/AIDS cases and 25,896 reported deaths of people living with HIV/AIDS (approximately PR population, 3.5 million habitants) [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A total of 19,896 people are living with HIV/AIDS in Puerto Rico and, out of these, 58.5% have progressed to AIDS [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to a report published by the Puerto Rico Department of Health titled &#x0201c;<italic>Puerto Rico Unmet Needs 2012</italic>&#x0201d;, approximately 70.94% of people living with HIV/AIDS in Puerto Rico (N = 13,748) received primary medical care during the year 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the other hand, the Ponce health region of Puerto Rico, a mostly rural zone, is the third region with most HIV/AIDS cases (15% of cases, N = 6,923) when compared to the San Juan (24% of cases) and Bayamon (18%) regions located in the metropolitan area of northern Puerto Rico. In the Ponce region, however, the number of AIDS cases is significantly higher (84%, N = 5,858) when compared to the rest of the island [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While a number of factors contribute to progression from HIV to AIDS in Puerto Rico and Ponce region (eg. late HIV testing), poor medication adherence may account for many cases. For example, informal discussions with health care providers and HIV case managers in Southern Puerto Rico suggest that some patients, especially women, tend to miss their monthly routine and fail to pick up their prescription refills. Also, patients from distant regions travel to the southern region of the island for treatment to avoid being recognized as HIV positive patients and sometimes the distance prevents them from having timely access to their medication.</p><p>A meta-analysis conducted by Mills et al (2006) reported significantly lower adherence rates in North America (55%; 95% CI, 49% -62%) when compared with Sub-Sahara Africa (77%; 95% CI, 68% -85%) [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Various bio-psychosocial factors have been associated with poor medication adherence: complex drug regimen, side effects, perceived stigma, depression, self-efficacy, social support and a negative social context [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (i.e. poverty-associated conditions [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). For example, Dilorio et al (2009) tested a psychological model to explain HAART adherence and found that medication-taking behaviors are affected by the interaction of self-efficacy, depression, stigma, patient satisfaction and social support, all potentially modifiable variables [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, Penn, Watermeyer and Evan (2011) concluded that even though some barriers in HAART adherence seem to be universal, others may be culturally specific such as the socio-cultural (i.e. myths and rumors), economic (i.e. poor financial security) and systemic factors (i.e. poor communication between hospital and clinics) [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Former models of medication adherence have focused on patient level barriers, however, the field is moving forward with more systemic models in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this problem [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was to identify perceived barriers and facilitators for HAART adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS in Southern Puerto Rico. The data presented in this article is part of a three-phase, mixed method study aimed at determining predictors of HAART non-adherence in Puerto Rican people living with HIV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>We used qualitative methods (key informant interviews) and a social ecological framework to gain in-depth understanding of perceived system barriers (i.e. individual, micro-system, meso-system, exo-system, macro-system and crono-system.) associated with HAART adherence. The purpose was to focus on the phenomenological aspect of voluntarily missing doses in the context of a systemic socio-ecological perspective. Thus, instead of the quantification of medication adherence we inquired about the subject&#x02019;s perceived experience regardless of time and frequency. Findings will report on the development of a HAART model of adherence and future interventions to reduce HIV/AIDS disparities in Puerto Rico.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethic Statement</title><p>Ethical approval was granted by the Ponce School of Medicine and Health Science (protocol number 120522-EC) and the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Science Campus (protocol number A8160112). Prior to the interview, the study was explained to the participant and an opportunity to ask questions was provided. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Confidentiality was kept by using a study identification number, rather than subjects' names. During the interviews, participants were asked to change their name in order to minimize risk of identification, however, all of them decided not to mention their name during the interviews. Since there were no names recorded during the in-depth interviews subjects were identified as &#x0201c;participant #1&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;participant # 2&#x0201d;, etc. Data was kept in a locked filing cabinet and was available only to the researcher.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Study sample</title><p>A mixed purposeful sampling method was employed (stratified and criterion) in order to facilitate data triangulation [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Participants were stratified by gender (6 women and 6 men) and risk group (injection drug user (n = 4), men who have sex with men (n = 4), heterosexual (n = 4)). Considering the phenomenological nature of the study, the recruited sample size provided enough data to reach a descriptive saturation. The inclusion criteria were: 1) 21 years of age and older, 2) receiving HAART treatment at the time of the study, 3) a history of HAART non-adherence for at least one month as reported by the health care provider or case manager based on clinical record notes and, 4) willing to provide voluntary consent. Participants were recruited from clinics and community and government based organizations (C/GBO) that provide health services to patients living with HIV/AIDS in the southern region of Puerto Rico. Before beginning the recruitment process, the principal investigator met with the clinic administrators, health care providers and case managers to discuss the study objectives, inclusion/exclusion criteria and to design a recruitment process. Case managers and health care providers who invited patients to participate in the study identified potential participants. The principal investigator discussed the informed consent and conducted all the interviews.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Interview guide</title><p>The principal investigator and three members of the research team, with expertise in qualitative research design, developed the interview guide (<xref rid="pone.0125582.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

The interview guide was pilot-tested with two adult HIV patients for clarity and relevance of the questions, which resulted in slight modifications of some of the questions and the addition of prompts. Questions were open ended in order to facilitate participants&#x02019; insightful response and prompts were used to assist in focused elaboration and depth in participants&#x02019; responses. Questions addressed patient-perceived barriers and facilitators of HAART adherence at various systems&#x02019; levels (e.i. individual, micro-system, meso-system, etc.).</p><fig id="pone.0125582.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0125582.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Interview guide (Prompt questions not included).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0125582.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Data Collection</title><p>Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted using an open-ended question guide to ask about the barriers for HAART non-adherence at different system levels (individual, micro-system, meso-system, etc.). It also inquired about the facilitators to HIV treatment adherence in order to identify opportunities for interventions. This process took approximately 40 minutes. A $15 stipend was provided to participants to compensate for their time and effort. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed by a research assistant for analysis and translated into English for publication purposes.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Transcribed interviews were analyzed using a combination of hand coding and Atlas TI (Hapberg, Germany), a software program designed to facilitate the analysis of qualitative data. Content analysis was performed for each transcribed interview by three independent coders (the principal investigator and two trained research assistants) as a form of investigator triangulation. An initial list of themes was identified and coded by the principal investigator, a process guided by the theoretical framework described above. A codebook was developed to further define and operationalize each of the themes. New themes and concepts were added to the codebook as they emerged from the transcripts. Two additional members of the research team with expertise in qualitative data analysis coded each transcript independently, coders subsequently met to discuss codes and categories and to further establish the inter-coder agreement. In other words, after all members finished coding the transcript, they met to compare their analysis and discuss discrepancies. Disagreements were discussed until consensus was reached. Using Atlas TI, super-codes and families were generated to facilitate the categorization tree. Categories and sub-categories (i.e. Micro-system level barriers and peer influence, etc.) were derived from initial codes. Grounded analyses and density estimates were also performed. Grounded analysis (G) is the number of quotations assigned to each code. Density (D) is the number of codes assigned to each category.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec013"><title>Results</title><p>Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted with HIV/AIDS patients who voluntarily missed medication doses at any time during the course of their treatment (6 women and 6 men)<bold>.</bold> Participants&#x02019; characteristics are summarized in <xref rid="pone.0125582.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

Other barriers have been less studied, for example, peer influence, a good or bad health status perception, and illegal medication selling [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, medication side effects and treatment regimen (e.g. inconvenient scheduling), among other factors, may lead to treatment fatigue and subsequent non-adherence; yet, this phenomenon is not widely addressed [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Studies on medication side effects and regimen as proxies for HAART treatment fatigue and adherence, and opportunities for interventions are warranted. Depression is a very common barrier identified in the literature. As such, Gonzalez et. al. conducted a study looking at the psychosocial and cultural factor associated with depression in a sample Hispanic men diagnosed with HIV [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The investigators identified several correlates of depression such as stress, self-esteem, substance abuse and physical violence, and recommended further research to determine how interactions of these variables impact medication adherence. Regarding perception of health status, Cardarelli and collaborators found that HIV patients (including Hispanics) when rating their general health as fair/poor were 4 times more likely to be non-adherent to HAART (odds ratio [OR], 4.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19&#x02013;15.79) [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>HIV treatment non-adherence has been studied widely [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and efforts are currently concentrated in the creation and implementation of interventions to promote adherence [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], including the incorporation of technology-assisted interventions [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The field has moved forward significantly but, in order to maximize these efforts and become more efficient, it is imperative to incorporate a systemic approach for a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon and, thus, develop more effective intervention [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Our findings suggest that HAART medication non-adherence is a complex problem engaging multi-level system factors into the equation. For example, patient level barriers manifest and interact with other systems as in the case of patients with depression (patient level) encountering stigmatizing discrimination (exo-system) and lack of social support (micro-system), sinking deeper into depression, thus, engaging in HAART treatment non-adherent behavior. Another hypothetical example is when a drug addict patient (patient level) takes peer advice of not taking the medication (micro-system), and gets access to an illegal antiretroviral medication market (meso-system), thus, becoming a burden to the health system (exo-system). Even though these are hypothetical cases they depict the complex, interacting multi-level factors interweaving with the problem of HAART non-adherence.</p><p>One way we analyzed the data was by looking at the number of quotations assigned to a code or category (G = grounded analysis).

The two most cited barriers for adherence were mental health factors (e.g. depression, substance abuse, G = 35) and treatment regimen (G = 28) which are also common barriers to non-adherence. Depression has been identified as one of the most difficult barriers for medication adherence not only for antiretroviral treatment [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but for the treatment of other medical conditions as well [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A systematic review conducted by Lowther et. Al (2014) revealed a high point prevalence of depression (33.6%) among people living with HIV under treatment, thus, increasing the risk of HAART non-adherence [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. On the other hand, addiction is another common challenging barrier for optimal antiretroviral adherence [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Surprisingly, the third most commonly cited barrier was related to the health system (e.g. medication access, medication co-payment, etc.). This finding warrants further exploration considering that health system level barriers are not under the patient or even health care provider&#x02019;s control. For example, one of the situations cited by participants was that they had to wait for the medication to be available in the pharmacy, thus, not being able to take their medication. Another situation was related to health insurance coverage, particularly being unable to cover medication co-payment. Verification of these stories was out of the scope of the study; however, future projects should include the perspective of health system administrators or stakeholders for a more comprehensive exploration of this apparent barrier. Other commonly cited barriers were related to interpersonal relations (e.g interpersonal conflict, peer pressure, G = 16) and stigma (e.g. social and internalized, G = 12). Interpersonal relations is a factor that needs further exploration as it suggests interpersonal conflict or peer pressure as a potential proxy for non-adherent behavior. This factor should not be explored by itself but as part of a cluster of other system level factors (personal, macro-system, etc.) that may be potentiating a synergistic effect for treatment non-adherence. Stigma, on the other hand, has been widely proven to be a risk factor for HAART non-adherence [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>One of the goals of this study was to identify HAART adherence facilitators. Different from adherence barrier, adherence facilitator fell into two system level categories: patient level and micro-system level facilitators. One reason this might have happened is that the interview guided participants in barrier categories to talk about their experiences by responding to questions already contextualized into each system level, while using a single question to ask for facilitator experiences (refer to <xref rid="pone.0125582.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). A recommendation for future studies is to explore the existence of other system level facilitators for HAART treatment adherence by incorporating other types of questions or interviewing stakeholders or actors representing multiple systems (e.g. clinicians, administrators, etc.).</p><p>Adherence facilitator categories were also subject of grounded analysis. As expected, social support was the most common cited facilitator for adherence (G = 18) by participants. Other studies have identified social support as a potential HAART adherence facilitator. For example, a cohort study conducted by Achieng et. al. (2012) looking for facilitators of retention in care and antiretroviral treatment adherence in Kenya found that among other factors, participation in support groups predicted better adherence, and time to treatment failure reduction [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. One interesting finding about adherence facilitators was the emergence of concerns with health status (G = 10). These concerns were either imaginary (fear of health deterioration) or real (actual health deterioration). The fact that some participants waited until their health deteriorated to take their medication is like playing at the &#x0201c;Russian roulette&#x0201d;. It represents a very dangerous facilitator because the patient&#x02019;s life is placed at risk, and it further complicates their care. Patients relying on this facilitator are probably using the psychological defense mechanism of denial, making contact with the reality of their diagnosis only when the physical signs of an opportunistic condition appear. The development of effective strategies to identify and tackle this dangerous facilitator is recommended.</p><p>Questions about primary health care (PHC) interactions were added in this study in an effort to expand our understanding of PHC recommendation adherence among participants. Some participants identified patient level barriers, such as fear or shame about certain clinical procedures and substance abuse, as well as exo-system level barriers, such as transportation problems. However, we did not find enough evidence of saturation of barriers to PHC recommendations, as most participants stated they followed their primary health care recommendations. The identified barriers are common in the general populations as well [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. One potential explanation is that some PHC services provided to the patients were incorporated in the clinic where recruitment took place, thus, facilitating access and further adherence of such recommendations.</p><sec id="sec025"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>One of the strengths of this study is the use of a social ecological model to provide a comprehensive view of the HAART non-adherence phenomenon. This approach has been recommended elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0125582.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and we have received a broader response from participants by using a comprehensive interview guide. A limitation of the study was having only one recruitment site, thus limiting the emergence of other system barriers or facilitators attached to other site realities. Another limitation was the sample size. Although twelve is an acceptable number of participants for a descriptive study, it may not be enough to reach saturation of certain phenomena; such was the case of PHC recommendation barriers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study suggest the interconnection of HIV treatment adherence barriers at various system levels. Future studies on HIV treatment barriers should explore these interactions and investigate the possible synergistic effect on non-adherent behavior. Studying multiple system levels of barriers to HIV treatment adherence can better guide the development of more comprehensive interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0125582.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Raw Qualitative Data.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0125582.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The project described was supported by Grant Number S21MD001830 and Award Number U54 RR026139 from the NCRR and the Awards Number 8U54MD 007587&#x02013;03 and 2-G12-MD007579-29 from the NIMHD.
