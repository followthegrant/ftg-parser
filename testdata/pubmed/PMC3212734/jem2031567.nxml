To assess the role of D<sub>H</sub> RF1-encoded tyrosine and glycine in regulating CDR-H3 content and potentially influencing B cell function, we created mice limited to a single D<sub>H</sub> encoding asparagine, histidine, and arginines in RF1. Tyrosine and glycine content in CDR-H3 was halved. Bone marrow and spleen mature B cell and peritoneal cavity B-1 cell numbers were also halved, whereas marginal zone B cell numbers increased. Serum immunoglobulin G subclass levels and antibody titers to T-dependent and T-independent antigens all declined. Thus, violation of the conserved preference for tyrosine and glycine in D<sub>H</sub> RF1 alters CDR-H3 content and impairs B cell development and antibody production.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: &#x00394;D-DFL, depleted D<sub>H</sub> locus with single DFL16.1 gene segment; &#x00394;D-iD, depleted D<sub>H</sub> locus with a single, mutated DFL16.1 gene segment containing inverted DSP 2.2 sequence; CDR-H3, complementarity determining region 3 of the immunoglobulin heavy chain; DEX, &#x003b1;(1&#x02192;3)-dextran; i-RF, inverted D<sub>H</sub> reading frame; NP<sub>19</sub>-CGG, [4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl] acetyl-chicken &#x003b3; globulin; RF, reading frame; TT, tetanus toxin.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Unlike H chain complementarity determining regions 1 and 2, which are entirely encoded by the V<sub>H</sub> gene segment, CDR-H3 is created de novo by the VDJ rearrangement process (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Imprecision in joining these gene segments permits exonucleolytic loss as well as palindromic (P junction) gain of terminal V<sub>H</sub>, D<sub>H</sub>, and J<sub>H</sub> sequence. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) catalyzed insertion of N nucleotides at the sites of joining permits the inclusion of nongermline sequence into CDR-H3 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Together, these mechanisms create a CDR-H3 repertoire that ranges from unmodified and intact germline-encoded sequence to rearrangements where extensive nibbling and N addition no longer permit identification of the original D<sub>H</sub>. The extensive range of diversity available to CDR-H3 has functional consequences because its location at the center of the antigen-binding site, as classically defined, permits this interval to often play a significant role in antigen recognition and binding (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Flanked on both sides by 12-base spacer recombination signal sequences, each D<sub>H</sub> gives the developing B cell access to six reading frames (RFs) of distinctly different germline sequence. In practice, from shark to mouse to human, sequences encoded by RF1 generated by deletion dominate the mature B cell repertoire (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). RF1 is typically enriched for tyrosine and glycine codons. Together, these two neutral amino acids contribute &#x0223c;40% of the amino acids in the CDR-H3 loop (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>To test the role of germline RF1 sequence in determining CDR-H3 amino acid usage and to test whether a mouse starting with altered germline sequence could recreate a wild-type CDR-H3 repertoire by somatic means, we replaced central codons for RF1-encoded tyrosine and glycine in DFL16.1, the most J<sub>H</sub>-distal D<sub>H</sub>, with codons for arginine, histidine, and asparagine and deleted the intervening D<sub>H</sub>. We found that B lineage cells in the bone marrow of these mice maintained their preference for RF1 through the mature, recirculating IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup> B cell stage of development. As a result, usage of arginine, asparagine, and histidine content in mature CDR-H3 loops tripled, whereas tyrosine and glycine content was reduced by one half.</p><p>This change in CDR-H3 amino acid content had functional consequences. Homozygous mutant mice exhibited a consistent reduction in total B cell numbers, a redistribution of peripheral B cell subsets, and a decrease in total and antigen-specific antibody levels. These findings confirm the power of the mechanisms used to regulate RF usage (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and demonstrate a significant role for the D<sub>H</sub> gene segment in controlling CDR-H3 amino acid composition.

The inclusion of termination codons in <italic>iD</italic> RF3 limited its usage. Rearrangement by deletion remained favored over inversion. Together, these mechanisms maintained the preference for use of RF1 in spite of the change in the coding sequence of the mutant D<sub>H</sub>.</p><p>These mechanisms were not an absolute blockade for the generation of alternative CDR-H3 sequence. Inversions of <italic>iD</italic> that created WT tyrosine-enriched CDR-H3 sequence were observed. N nucleotides were introduced at random, and exonucleolytic nibbling did occur to the extent that 5% of the CDR-H3 sequences did not contain identifiable <italic>iD</italic> sequence. As a result of the deletion of all but one D<sub>H</sub> gene segment, our model did not allow us to test whether selection for D-D fusions could have corrected the change in the sequence of the mutant D<sub>H</sub>. However, D-D fusion is a very rare event, and none of the 902 WT sequences with identifiable D<sub>H</sub> contained a recognizable D-D fusion using our threshold of D<sub>H</sub> identification. This suggests that D-D fusion would be unlikely to contribute &#x0201c;ameliorated&#x0201d; sequences at a higher rate than that observed for <italic>iD</italic> inversion.</p><p>Because sequences with WT characteristics generated by <italic>iD</italic> inversion or by a combination of terminal sequence loss and N addition were detected in early B cell progenitors, selection for these alternative sequences could have recreated a &#x0201c;WT&#x0201d; CDR-H3 repertoire in mature B cells. We had previously documented selection during development for a specific range of CDR-H3 lengths, amino acid content, and average hydrophobicity in both WT (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and <italic>&#x00394;D-DFL</italic> mice (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), thus this seemed a likely outcome in <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic>. However, <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> RF1-encoded arginine, histidine, and asparagine CDR-H3 remained overrepresented at all stages of bone marrow B cell development examined, including the mature, recirculating CD19<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup> pool. Somatic selection did not shepherd the repertoire toward the WT range, even though the end result was a reduction in mature B cell numbers and antibody production. These data suggest that the somatic mechanisms normally used to select the repertoire can be subordinate to evolutionary conservation of germline sequence in regulating CDR-H3 content even though B cell function may suffer.</p><p>Early B cell development in the <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> mice followed a pattern similar to that observed in <italic>&#x00394;D-DFL</italic> mice, which are limited to a single D<sub>H</sub> of normal, tyrosine- and glycine-enriched sequence (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). This pattern included an accumulation of fraction B pro&#x02013;B cells, normalization of the number of fraction C early pre&#x02013;B cells, and a reduction in fraction D late pre&#x02013;B and fraction E immature B cell numbers. The decreased efficiency with which developing <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> B cells transit through the bone marrow appears to reflect the loss of D<sub>H</sub> locus sequence rather than the change in the sequence of the remaining D<sub>H</sub>.</p><p>A potential mechanism that could have affected early repertoire development is incomplete access or altered use of the full germline array of <italic>V<sub>H</sub></italic> and <italic>J<sub>H</sub></italic> gene segments. We chose V<sub>H</sub>7183 as the representative V<sub>H</sub> family because all of the family members encoded by the IgH<sup>a</sup> allele have been defined previously (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), key patterns of individual V<sub>H</sub>7183 gene segment utilization are well established (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), it accounts for a manageable 10% of the active repertoire (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and V<sub>H</sub>7183 gene segments have been shown to contribute to both self- and nonself-reactivities (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>With a few limited exceptions, V<sub>H</sub>7183 gene segment use, including use of <italic>V<sub>H</sub>81X</italic> (<italic>7183.1</italic>), proved similar to WT controls at both early and late stages of development. V<sub>H</sub> usage appeared minimally affected by the central coding sequence of D<sub>H</sub> or by the global alteration of CDR-H3 loop amino acid content.</p><p>Compared with WT, <italic>J<sub>H</sub>4</italic> usage was depressed and the use of <italic>J<sub>H</sub>1</italic> was enhanced. This pattern matched that previously observed among <italic>&#x00394;D-DFL</italic> sequences, suggesting that the alteration in J<sub>H</sub> usage was independent of the change in the coding sequence of the single, remaining D<sub>H</sub> (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). <italic>J<sub>H</sub>4</italic> and, to a lesser extent, <italic>J<sub>H</sub>3</italic> usage has been previously shown to be diminished in VDJ rearrangements from mice lacking DQ52 together with cis-regulatory sequence immediately upstream of this J<sub>H</sub>-proximal gene segment (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the alteration in J<sub>H</sub> usage is the result of the deletion of the remainder of the D<sub>H</sub> locus, perhaps, as previously suggested (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), as a result of a loss of the ability to engage in secondary D-J rearrangements.</p><p>Efficient transition from fraction B, primarily pro&#x02013;B cells, to fraction C, early pre&#x02013;B cells, is associated with successful creation of a functional H chain (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Accumulation of pro&#x02013;B cells has been observed in the context of a deletion of <italic>DFL16.1</italic> through <italic>J<sub>H</sub>1</italic>, inclusive, in C57BL/6 mice (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and in the context of the <italic>&#x00394;D-DFL</italic> deletion in BALB/c (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Preliminary analysis of hybridomas obtained from <italic>&#x00394;D-DFL</italic> BALB/c mice has shown that the nonfunctional <italic>&#x00394;D-DFL</italic> allele is frequently found in a germline, unrearranged state (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Inefficiency in the initiation, progression, or completion of D&#x02192;J rearrangement as a result of D<sub>H</sub> locus deletion may be the cause of the relative increase in the number of fraction B cells as well as in the alteration of J<sub>H</sub> usage.</p><p>Progression from fraction C, early pre&#x02013;B cells, to fraction D, late pre&#x02013;B cells, requires successful assembly of a pre&#x02013;B cell receptor (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Potential mechanisms for the decrease in the absolute number of cells in fraction D include an impaired ability to associate with surrogate light chain, as well as altered reactivity of the pre-BCR, including autoreactivity. Passage to fraction E, which contains immature B cells, then requires both in-frame light chain rearrangement and successful association of the rearranged L chain with its H chain partner (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Fraction E cells may lose surface IgM expression during receptor editing or may be released from the bone marrow to undergo maturation in the periphery, which is associated with surface coexpression of IgD. Potential mechanisms for the decrease in the absolute numbers of cells in fraction E include failure to undergo proper L chain rearrangement, leading to (a) a block in the progression from D to E; (b) a more rapid progression from E to the transitional cell population in the periphery as a result of enhanced success of H-L partnering; or, conversely, (c) enhanced receptor editing (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) as the result of functional failure of H-L partnering, causing inflation in the numbers of cells identified as fraction D. This latter scenario seems less likely because fraction D numbers were also depressed. Formal testing of these hypotheses will require kinetic evaluation of developing B cell populations in both <italic>&#x00394;D-DFL</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> mice (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>Although the initial pattern of B lineage cell production in <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> proved similar to that observed in <italic>&#x00394;D-DFL</italic>, a striking divergence in B cell numbers was observed among the splenic follicular and MZ populations, and among recirculating B cells in the bone marrow. The decrease in numbers in the <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> T3 transitional population paralleled the reduction in mature, follicular B cells. It has been hypothesized that the antibody repertoires expressed by mature B cells in the follicles and MZ of the spleen are shaped by selection for antigen specificity (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), including negative selection of B cells bearing autoreactive antibodies (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and positive selection in both the recirculating mature B cell pool and the MZ (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Highly charged CDR-H3 sequences, especially long arginine-containing CDR-H3, are thought to be more likely to generate self-reactive antibodies (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>); and preliminary studies indicate that IgG anti-DNA antibodies are more common in the sera of young <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> mice than WT (unpublished data). It is possible that the increase in MZ cell numbers and the decrease in follicular and recirculating mature B cell numbers reflect a redirection of <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> B cells as a consequence of altered patterns of autoreactivity. Analysis of the extent and quality of self-reactivity among <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> B cells is being actively pursued in our laboratory.</p><p>Although it remains unclear whether the T3 subset consists of precursors to the mature, follicular compartment, these data would suggest that the cells in this compartment have suffered the same selective block as that experienced by splenic mature B cells. The sequence composition of immunoglobulin CDR-H3 repertoires in the spleen is a current focus of investigation.</p><p>In the peritoneal cavity, the numbers of <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> B1a and B1b cells are reduced. This effect is most pronounced for the B1a population, which is enriched for sequences derived from perinatal progenitors that tend to be more heavily influenced by germline sequence as the result of diminished N addition (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> B2 population, which is derived from the same pool of conventional B cells that circulate through the blood and into the spleen and bone marrow (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), achieved slightly higher absolute numbers than WT. It is unclear whether this represents a compensatory increase in numbers as a result of an increase in available physiologic space or whether the altered repertoire facilitates homing into the peritoneal cavity. Kinetic studies to address this question are currently ongoing in our laboratory.</p><p>A preference for tyrosine and glycine in the CDR-H3 loop is common to jawed vertebrates (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Tyrosine is 10-fold overrepresented in CDR-H3 repertoires when compared with protein sequence in general, and tyrosine and glycine typically provide approximately 4 out of every 10 amino acids in the CDR-H3 loop (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Raaphorst et al. (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) have proposed that use of highly charged sequence in CDR-H3 might reduce H chain stability. By extension, charged sequence could also have adversely affected binding to surrogate light chain or L chain. Persistence of highly charged sequences through the mature B cell stage in the <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> mice described in this paper suggests that structural stability is unlikely to be the primary force driving the preservation of tyrosine and glycine in CDR-H3.</p><p>Another hypothesis to explain preference for tyrosine and glycine in CDR-H3 is that repertoires enriched for these amino acids might facilitate achievement of optimal humoral immune responses to antigen (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Although homozygous <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> mice expressed normal serum concentrations of IgM and IgA, serum levels of all four IgG subclasses were reduced, indicating that the ability of homozygous <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> B cells to respond properly to a broad range of antigens might have been compromised. We tested this hypothesis by challenging the mice with DEX, a T cell&#x02013;independent antigen, and with NP<sub>19</sub>-CGG (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and r<italic>Salmonella</italic>-Tox C (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), both T cell&#x02013;dependent antigens. After immunization, IgM titers to DEX and IgG titers to NP and TT were significantly lower than controls. Tyrosine and glycine in CDR-H3 may be required for production of efficient antigen-binding sites. Correlations between the change in CDR-H3 amino acid content to the antigen specificity or affinity of their host immunoglobulin will require in vitro production of representative antibodies followed by analysis of their structures and antigen-binding characteristics.</p><p>Our studies indicate that the sequence of D<sub>H</sub> RF1 establishes CDR-H3 amino acid usage. Somatic selection was not sufficient to recreate a &#x0201c;primary&#x0201d; repertoire enriched for tyrosine and glycine, even though B cell and antibody production was impaired. We conclude that there are limits to the power of somatic selection of the expressed repertoire that require prior selection on a genomic or evolutionary scale. Thus, it might be said that the D<sub>H</sub> locus of &#x0201c;diversity&#x0201d; gene segments can also be considered a locus of &#x0201c;delimiting&#x0201d; elements, wherein the D<sub>H</sub> gene segment serves not only to diversify but also to constrain the composition of CDR-H3 into a range more likely to yield optimal immune function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Generation of targeted ES cells and the <italic>&#x00394;D-iD</italic> mouse.</title><p>The RI-2 charon phage containing the BALB/c DFL16.1 locus was a gift from Y.
