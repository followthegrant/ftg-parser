Tubules are propelled by actin-based tubule motility (ABTM) to overcome membrane or tissue barriers in insect vectors. To further understand which insect factors mediate ABTM, we utilized yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays to test interactions between tubule protein Pns10 of rice dwarf virus (RDV), a plant reovirus, and proteins of its insect vector, the leafhopper <italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic>. Tropomodulin (Tmod), vitellogenin, and lipophorin precursor of <italic>N. cincticep</italic> displayed positive and strong interaction with Pns10, and actin-associated protein Tmod interacted with Pns10 in pull-down assay and the co-immunoprecipitation system. Further, we determined Pns10 tubules associated with Tmod in cultured cells and midgut of <italic>N. cincticep</italic>. The expression dynamic of Tmod was consistent with that of Pns10 and the fluctuation of RDV accumulation. Knockdown of Tmod inhibited the Pns10 expression and viral accumulation, thus decreasing the viruliferous rates of leafhopper. These results suggested that Tmod was involved in viral spread by directly interacting with Pns10 tubules, finally promoting RDV infection. This study provided direct evidence of plant reoviruses utilizing an actin-associated protein to manipulate ABTM in insect vectors, thus facilitating viral spread.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Plant reoviruses encode a non-structural protein which assembles into tubules by self-interaction, for example, southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) from the genus <italic>Fijivirus</italic> encodes the protein P7-1, rice dwarf virus (RDV) and rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) of the genus <italic>Phytoreovirus</italic> encodes Pns10 and Pns11, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. These tubules approximately 85&#x02009;nm in diameter, regularly fix the viral particles on the inner surface, and exploit the actin-based tubule motility (ABTM) to positively facilitate viral spread in insect vectors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Studies on infected cultured cells of insect vectors show that the virions-packaging tubules, which are propelled by the power from the ABTM, insert the actin-based filopodia and extend into the neighboring insect cells for viral cell-to-cell dissemination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In alimentary canal of the insect vectors, the growing tubules take advantage of ABTM to pass through actin-based microvilli of the epithelium into the lumen, or cross the basal lamina from the initially infected epithelium, or traverse the tight junctions between epithelial cells for facilitating viral intercellular spread<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The tubules further move along the actin-based visceral muscles of the whole intestine for viral lateral spread in the aid of ABTM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Therefore, by means of ABTM, tubules serve as a powerful and efficient tool for the spread of plant reoviruses by overcoming membrane or tissue barriers within insect vectors. However, the underlying mechanism involved in the ABTM, the interaction between the virus-containing tubules and the actin-based cellular machinery of the insect vectors for efficient transmission of the virus still remains unclear.</p><p>RDV, a member of the <italic>Phytoreovirus</italic> genus in the family <italic>Reoviridae</italic>, contains 12 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments (S1-S12) encoding seven structural proteins (P1, P2, P3, P5, P7, P8 and P9) and five nonstructural proteins (Pns4, Pns6, Pns10, Pns11 and Pns12)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. RDV is mainly transmitted by the leafhopper vector, <italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic>, in a persistent-propagative manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>, the infection route of RDV has been revealed as follows: RDV virions are ingested and access to the alimentary canal via the stylet and esophagus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The viral particles specifically recognize and bind to the receptors on the epithelium of filter chamber, and subsequently enter the epithelial cells via endocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Replication of the virus is initiated after the nonstructural proteins Pns6, Pns11 and Pns12 aggregate together to form the viroplasm matrix<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. The Pns12 protein serves as a principal regulator for viral replication and infection in its insect vector, while Pns4, a phosphoprotein forms minitubules and localizes around the viroplasm matrix, essential for viral infection and replication in insect vector<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Pns10 proteins assemble to form a tubule into which the progeny virions maturing at the periphery of viroplasm are packaged. In the initially infected epithelial cells of the filter chamber, virus-containing Pns10 tubules pass through actin-based microvilli into the lumen and extend to neighboring cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. After passing through the basal lamina, Pns10 tubules move along the actin-based circular muscles and longitudinal muscles for lateral spread of RDV throughout the gut<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Therefore, RDV utilizes Pns10 tubules to overcome multiple barriers in the infection route from intestine to salivary glands of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Moreover, the RDV isolate deficient in Pns10 protein expression fails to be transmitted by the leafhopper vector<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, suggesting Pns10 to be responsible for viral spread and transmission by the insect vector. Recent studies suggest that the interaction between Pns10 and cytoplasmic actin of efficient vector <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> is correlated with insect vector specificity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, suggesting that Pns10 tubule is capable of employing components from its vector to overcome membrane or tissue barriers for viral transmission. Nevertheless, the mechanism of Pns10 tubule exploiting the actin-based cellular machinery in the insect body to spread and transmit virions is still unknown.</p><p>This study investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the spread of RDV Pns10 tubules, by applying various molecular techniques such as yeast two-hybrid assay (YTH), bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), pull-down assay, the co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and RNA interference (RNAi). Putative interactors from the leafhopper vector with the viral non-structural protein Pns10 were screened, and 6 putative proteins have been examined for their interaction with Pns10 in different interaction systems. An actin-associated protein was identified to strongly interact with Pns10, and served as a positive regulator for the spread of Pns10 tubules.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of putative interactors from <italic>N. cincticeps</italic></title><p>A YTH assay was performed to screen for putative candidates interacting with RDV Pns10.

The average insert size was 1.5&#x02009;kb, meeting the requirement of a standard cDNA library.</p><p>The gene of RDV Pns10 was cloned into the pGBKT7 to generate the bait pGBKT7-Pns10. Mating yeast containing bait pGBKT7-Pns10 and positive prey plasmid resulted in reporter gene activation, then caused the colonies turn blue on Quadruple dropout media (QDO) plates containing X-&#x003b1;-Gal. Finally, 232 positive colonies were picked from this library screen, and 149 colonies were randomly sequenced. Of these, 47 sequences were annotated using the BLASTX searching method in the GenBank (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The species distribution associated with best match for each sequence annotated was depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1a</xref>. The screening frequency of the sequences displayed a high representation for putative vitellogenin (Vg), followed by enzymes, transcription factors and ribosomal RNA genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1b</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) annotation analysis demonstrated that these proteins were classified into 16 molecular function groups: 25% with transporter activity, 12.5% with protein binding or translation regulator activity, 9.4% with nucleic acid binding activity, 6.3% with transcription factor activity, and 3.1% with endonuclease activity or others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). The function of putative candidates with the highest percentage was transporter activity, which was consistent with the role of Pns10 tubules in the spread of virions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pns10 interacts with putative candidate vector proteins <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Based on molecular functions and high screening frequency, 6 putative candidates which possibly played roles in viral spread in leafhopper vector were taken for further analysis. These included tropomodulin (Tmod), Vg, vigilin, lipophorin precursor (LP), mitochondrial porin (Mito P), and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Six prey plasmids were identified in the YTH system again, and showed strong interaction with RDV Pns10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p>To validate the interactions of Pns10 with these 6 putative candidates, BiFC assays were carried out by co-expressing Pns10-YC and Tmod-YN, Pns10-YC and Vg-YN, Pns10-YC and LP-YN, Pns10-YC and vigilin-YN, Pns10-YC and Mito P-YN, or Pns10-YC and AIF-YN in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaf cells. The strong BiFC signals were detected within the cytoplasm from the combinations of Pns10 and Tmod, Pns10 and Vg, or Pns10 and LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, vigilin-YN, Mito P-YN, or AIF-YN did not show clear BiFC signals after co-expression with Pns10-YC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Our results indicated that Tmod, Vg and LP of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> could specifically interact with the tubule protein Pns10 of RDV in the YTH system and BiFC assays.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pns10 interacts with actin-associated protein Tmod</title><p>Among three putative interactors of Pns10 <italic>in vitro</italic>, Tmod is a capping protein which partly regulates the length and dynamics of actin-tropomyosin filament by binding to the pointed end<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Therefore, it was reasonable to assume that this actin-associated protein might contribute to regulating Pns10 tubules growth, and hence we took it for further study.</p><p>The mouse polyclonal antibodies against the Tmod fused with His-tag were firstly prepared, and the specificity was tested using Western blotting assay. As expected, His-Tmod fusion protein was detected as a 46-kDa protein in extracts from virus-infected cultured cells and insect vectors, but not in the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), confirming the specificity of antibodies against the Tmod of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>.</p><p>We subsequently performed GST pull-down assays and Co-IP experiments to understand whether Pns10 indeed interacted with Tmod. The results of GST pull-down assays were presented in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), and indicated that the purified GST-Pns10 protein had the ability to pull down His-Tmod from cell lysates <italic>in vitro</italic>, while no such interaction was observed with the purified GST-green fluorescence protein (GFP). The results of Co-IP assays showed that when the anti-Pns10 antibodies were immobilized, the presence of Tmod was detected in immunoprecipitate by Western blotting using anti-Tmod antibodies as primary antibody and anti-mouse IgG antibodies as secondary antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In contrast, Tmod was not detected in the eluent of control resin without antibodies. We also verified the presence of Pns10 in immunoprecipitate by Western blotting using anti-Pns10 antibodies after immobilization of the anti-Tmod antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To test interaction of Pns10 with Tmod was not caused by nonspecific binding, mock-infected cultured cells were utilized as negative control. Tmod was neither detected in the anti-Pns10 immunoprecipitates, nor was Pns10 detected in the anti-Tmod immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Thus, we concluded the interaction of Pns10 with actin-associated protein Tmod.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Co-localization of Tmod and Pns10 in <italic>N. cincticeps</italic></title><p>Then, immunofluorescence assays were performed to detect the expression and location of Tmod. At different hour post inoculation (hpi), infected cultured cells were treated with Tmod-specific IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Tmod-FITC) and Pns10-specific IgG conjugated to rhodamine (Pns10-rhodamine), and then examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. In mock-infected cells, Tmod localized the filopodia extending toward neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), while in infected cells, Pns10 tubules protruded to adjacent cells along with the filopodia, as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. At 18&#x02009;hpi, Pns10 tubules co-localized with Tmod on the filopodia, to penetrate the cytoplasm of adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). At 44&#x02009;hpi, with the accumulation of Pns10, more Tmod and Pns10 tubules co-localized on filopodia and cellular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Thus, Tmod associated with Pns10 tubules in cultured cells of insect vector.</p><p>We further examined the co-localization of Tmod and Pns10 in viruliferous leafhopper vector. In non-viruliferous insects, Tmod localized the microvilli along the surface of epithelia cells in the midgut and visceral muscles on the outer side of the midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The longitudinal and circular muscle fibers were immunolabeled by Tmod antibodies, displaying a lattice pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In the viruliferous <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>, Pns10 tubules of RDV extended from or passed through the Tmod-labled microvilli, and a few tubules successfully crossed into the gut lumen at 6-day post-first access to diseased plants (padp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). These results were consistent with the previous study revealing that Pns10 tubules associate with and pass through the actin-based microvilli in the midgut of viruliferous leafhoppers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. At 12-day padp, abundant Pns10 tubules located Tmod-labled visceral muscles on the outer side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Thus, these co-localization studies confirmed that Pns10 tubule interacted with Tmod in cultured leafhopper cells and in intact insects.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tmod positively regulates the expression of Pns10</title><p>We then investigated whether the expression of Pns10 of RDV could be mediated by its interaction with Tmod during viral infection in insect vector. The relative mRNA expression of Tmod in RDV-infected cultured cells was analyzed in 6 days post inoculation using RT-qPCR assay, by normalizing its expression levels in RDV-infected cells at 1&#x02009;day post inoculation (dpi) as 1. RT-qPCR assay demonstrated that the relative expression levels of Tmod, Pns10 and outer capsid protein P8 of RDV were up-regulated at 4&#x02009;dpi, and then synchronously decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The expression levels in viruliferous insects also displayed similar trends for Tmod, Pns10 and P8 of RDV in 8 days padp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These results indicated that the expression profiles of Tmod tended to be similar to the dynamics of Pns10 expression and RDV accumulation in cultured cells and intact insects during viral infection.</p><p>We then used RNAi experiments to investigate the effect of reduced Tmod expression on viral infection in leafhopper vector. The cultured leafhopper cells were treated with dsRNAs specific for Tmod (dsTmod) and for GFP as control via Cellfectin-based transfection. The viability tests revealed that transfection reagent and dsRNAs caused the absence of toxicity to cultured cells (data not shown). Relative expression of Tmod, Pns10 and P8 of RDV in 5 days post infection was analyzed using RT-qPCR assay. The result showed a significant decrease in the relative Tmod expression in the dsTmod treatment when compared to the dsGFP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). The relative expressions of P8 and Pns10 in the dsTmod treated cultured cells were also lower than those in the dsGFP treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), revealing that knockdown of Tmod reduced the expression of Pns10 and accumulation of RDV in cultured cells.</p><p>In insect vectors, the effect of dsTmod on Pns10 expression and RDV infection was more significant in 8 days padp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The relative expression of Tmod, Pns10 and RDV P8 significantly reduced in dsTmod-treated insects, suggesting that Tmod expression was positively associated with Pns10 expression and viral accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Together with the results that Tmod interacted with Pns10 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, it revealed that Tmod specifically regulated Pns10 expression and indirectly affected viral infection. The viruliferous rate of insects was also detected using RT-PCR assay after a circulative transmission period of 14 days. The results demonstrated that knockdown of Tmod significantly reduced the viruliferous rate by more than 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Our results suggested that the knockdown of Tmod inhibited Pns10 expression and viral accumulation, resulting in the decrease of the viruliferous rate of leafhopper vectors. To summarize, these results suggested that RDV infection up-regulated the Tmod expression, which was beneficial for facilitating viral infection in insect vectors.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The actin filament is an important cytoskeleton protein involved in cellular motility and architecture, and also plays a role in the spread of rice reoviruses in insect vectors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.

In the process of actin-based tubule trafficking, actin-binding proteins such as myosin or cofilin may be recruited by tubule proteins to facilitate viral spread<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, these interacting proteins have not been further examined in the insect body using molecular techniques, and hence there is lack of direct evidence to support the biological function of these interactors. In this study, putative candidates interacting with RDV Pns10 were screened using YTH assay. The molecular functions of positive colonies with annotated sequences revealed several putative candidates possessing transporter activity, which possibly assisted or guided Pns10 tubule spread (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figs S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">S2</xref>). Based on the high screening frequency and molecular functions of the screened proteins, the following 6 candidates Tmod, Vg, vigilin, LP, Mito P and AIF, were selected for further validation. In the YTH and BiFC assays, positive and strong interactions of Pns10 with insect Vg, LP and Tmod were confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Vg is a major yolk protein precursor in insects for the developing oocytes to meet the nutrient requirements during egg development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This female-specific protein is synthesized in the fat body and release into the hemolymph, from where it is absorbed by the growing oocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The transportation of Vg in the circulatory system and endocytosis by the developing oocytes is a rapid and convenient means for viral dissemination and infection. Rice stripe virus (RSV) entry into the oocyte is mediates by direct interaction of Vg with the outer capsid protein of RSV, which is thought to contribute to the transovarial transmission of RSV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. RDV is also transovarially transmitted by the leafhopper<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, however, whether Vg mediated RDV spread or entry into oocytes has not been investigated yet. Our study showed that Vg interacted with Pns10 in YTH system and BiFC assay, suggesting that Pns10 tubules possibly exploited Vg for rapid spread from the fat body to the hemolymph, and also for entry into the oocytes. Transmission electric microscopy and immunofluorescense assays would be required to provide further confirmation.</p><p>Lipophorin, a lipid-transport protein, is yet another major yolk protein precursor. Like Vg, lipophorin is synthesized in the fat body, carries lipids in the hemolymph, and is finally taken up by the developing oocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In our study, LP, a precursor of lipophorin, showed 83% identity with the lipophorin precursor of <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>, and interacted with Pns10 in YTH system and BiFC assay. Whether LP carries virus-packaging Pns10 tubules for rapid spread in the hemolymph, or assists virus entry into the oocytes for transovarial transmission also requires further investigation.</p><p>Due to Tmod being an actin-associated protein, we focused on the role of Tmod in the spread of Pns10 tubules of RDV in leafhopper vector. We identified Tmod as a credible interactor with Pns10 both in insect cultured cells and intact insect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). Moreover, Tmod positively regulated Pns10 expression via facilitating the spread of virus-containing tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref>). Tmod is a dynamic capping protein which partly regulates the association and dissociation of the actin subunit, by binding to the pointed end of actin-tropomyosin filament, thus controlling length and stability of the filament<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In previous experiments, we have determined that the elongating of Pns10 tubules depended on the assembly of the actin-tropomyosin filament<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Based on these invstigations, we proposed a model that Tmod likely protected the actin-tropomyosin filament from depolymerization, and thus facilitated the elongation of Pns10 tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). We thus determined that Tmod was involved in the process of ABTM for providing power to propel Pns10 tubules to overcome the membrane and tissues barriers in leafhopper vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). This interaction may be a conserved strategy evolved by tubules of other plant reoviruses that utilize ABTM for viral efficient spread and transmission by insect vectors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cells, viruses and vectors</title><p>The non-viruliferous individuals of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> were collected from Fujian Province, China and propagated for several generations at 25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in the laboratory.
