NB arises from cells of the sympathetic nervous tissue and primary tumors are typically found in the adrenal gland, but can also be found along sympathetic nerves in the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. NB tumors are highly invasive and often metastasize to secondary sites including bone, lymph nodes, liver, and bone marrow [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. High risk NB patients are characterized by <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification, age greater than 18 months, unfavorable histology, and aggressive metastatic disease [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With multimodal treatments these patients can achieve remission but many who go into remission will relapse, at which point long term survival is less than 10% [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Studies have shown that polyamines play an important role in many cancers including NB [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The rate limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis is Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). The <italic>ODC</italic> gene is found upstream of <italic>MYCN</italic> [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and since <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification is seen in 30% of neuroblastoma, <italic>ODC</italic> overexpression is common in NB patients and correlates with poor outcomes [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ODC's specific function is to convert the polyamine precursor ornithine into the polyamine putrescine. Putrescine is then converted to the polyamines spermidine and spermine in the polyamine metabolism pathway. Little is known about the specific functions of polyamines; however, preclinical and early studies targeting polyamines in cancer have yielded promising results [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>One specific function of spermidine has been identified. Spermidine is a substrate needed for post-transcriptional modification of the translation initiation factor eIF-5A, a process called hypusination [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recent studies show that eIF-5A is a direct regulator of the LIN28/Let-7 pathway [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which is important in a number of cancers, including NB, and was recently identified as a pathway of particular importance in tumor initiating cells [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. LIN28 is a miRNA binding protein that is highly expressed in undifferentiated cells and has reported oncogenic properties [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Let-7 is a miRNA that acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting oncogene transcription [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. LIN28 and Let-7 are highly regulated throughout development and interact via a double negative feedback loop in which LIN28 inhibits Let-7 and vice versa [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that high <italic>LIN28B</italic> expression is associated with worse survival outcomes in NB patients and that deletion of <italic>LIN28B</italic> significantly reduces NB cell growth [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, the LIN28 and Let-7 are both linked to MYCN protein expression, therefore the LIN28/Let-7 pathway may be particularly important in high risk, <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified NB patients [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>A recent study showed that the LIN28/Let-7 axis directly regulates glycolytic metabolism [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], a process that is important in both cancer cells and stem cells. In this study, LIN28 enhanced glucose uptake via an increase in insulin-PI3K-mTOR signaling, which regulates glycolytic metabolism. Let-7 was shown to suppress this pathway, thereby reducing glucose uptake and downregulating glycolytic metabolism [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Elevated glycolytic metabolism is a characteristic common in many cancers, including NB [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, targeting the LIN28/Let-7 axis may be a beneficial method for decreasing tumor metabolic activity in these cancers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A) Patient PET scans</title><p>Patient treated on Phase I study of DFMO tablets with 1000mg/m2 twice daily shows reduced tumor metabolic activity after one cycle of DFMO treatment, indicated by decreased <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in tumors. After starting DFMO treatment, the patient's tumor was still present, although showed negative PET avidity. Decreased PET activity is an indication of reduced glycolytic metabolism. B) Proposed pathway of DFMO effects on LIN28/Let-7 axis and glycolytic metabolism in NB. DFMO reversibly inhibits ODC, leading to reduced hypusination of eIF5A and a reversal of the LIN28/Let-7 axis. Changes in LIN28/Let-7 axis likely contribute to reduced glycolytic metabolic activity seen in NB cells treated with DFMO.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-06-196-g001"/></fig><p>Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is a drug that inhibits polyamine biosynthesis, thus impacting the LIN28/Let-7 axis. DFMO was originally developed over 30 years ago as chemotherapeutic agent and has since been widely used as a treatment for parasitic diseases. Although early clinical studies with DFMO were disappointing, more recent trials using DFMO in combination with other chemotherapies or as a single chemopreventative agent have shown promising results [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. DFMO works by irreversibly binding to and inhibiting ODC. When ODC is inactive, ornithine cannot be converted to putrescine, which hinders the downstream production of spermidine and spermine and prevents the hypusination of eIF-5A [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Studies have shown that DFMO treatment effectively reduces polyamine levels of NB cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and clinical trials are currently underway using DFMO to treat cancer, including NB.</p><p>Recent anecdotal clinical cases have shown that DFMO treatment reduces glycolytic metabolic activity of tumors in patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In three separate cases, NB patients enrolled in a Phase I DFMO clinical trial had reduced tumor metabolic activity as measured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans after starting DFMO treatment and exhibited prolonged stabilization of disease [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In light of these clinical observations and recent studies linking polyamines to the LIN28/Let-7 axis [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and LIN28/Let-7 to glycolytic metabolism [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we hypothesize that treatment with DFMO will restore balance to the LIN28/Let-7 axis, thereby reducing glycolytic metabolism in NB. We also believe that, due to the direct interaction between LIN28 and MYCN [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], NB cell lines that have high <italic>LIN28B</italic> and <italic>MYCN</italic> expression will be more sensitive to DFMO treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title><italic>LIN28B</italic> and <italic>MYCN</italic> genes are variably expressed in NB cell lines</title><p>Microarray analysis was used to assess relative levels of LIN28B and MYCN RNA expression in three NB cell lines: BE(2)-C, SMS-KCNR, and CHLA90.

This is demonstrated by the decrease in LIN28B protein levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and increase in Let-7 miRNA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) seen with DFMO treatment. This change in the LIN28/Let-7 axis also appears to affect MYCN protein expression since MYCN is seen to decrease in the two cell lines tested which overexpress MYCN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). An interesting finding was that higher LIN28B and MYCN gene expression levels correlate with greater sensitivity to DFMO in NB cell lines. BE(2)-C cells, which have high LIN28B and MYCN expression (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), were the most sensitive to DFMO treatment in all <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Conversely, CHLA90 cells had low expression for both LIN28B and MYCN (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and were consistently the most resistant to DFMO treatment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The lack of change in MYCN protein expression seen in the CHLA90 cell line was expected since CHLA90 cells have baseline low MYCN gene expression. SMS-KCNR cells had high MYCN and moderate LIN28B expression relative to BE(2)-C and CHLA90 cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and had consistent moderate sensitivity to DFMO treatment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These data are consistent with other studies showing that DFMO treatment affected LIN28/Let-7 in colorectal cancer [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and that changes in MYCN protein expression were seen with changes in the LIN28/Let-7 axis in other studies of NB at these doses [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These changes occur at doses correlating to established IC50's within range of those previously reported in NB [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These results reinforce claims that polyamines play an important role in the LIN28/Let-7 pathway [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], since those cell lines with the greatest LIN28B and MYCN gene expression were most sensitive to a treatment that depletes polyamine levels. The findings also indicate that DFMO treatment may be more effective for NB patients with overexpression of genes that play a role in the LIN28/Let-7 axis. As such, genomic analysis of patient tumors may be beneficial in predicting response to DFMO therapy.</p><p>Changes in bioenergetics of NB cell lines treated with DFMO, as measured by ATP/cell, suggest that DFMO treatment may result in a reduction of glycolytic metabolism in NB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Many cancer cells are reprogramed to produce ATP primarily via glycolytic metabolism as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation, a phenomenon termed the &#x0201c;Warburg effect&#x0201d; [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Because this phenomenon is well documented in NB [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we used ATP/cell as a measure of glycolytic metabolic activity in NB. BE(2)-C and SMS-KCNR cell lines had decreased ATP/cell levels when treated with DFMO. These data indicate that DFMO treatment reduces metabolic activity in these cell lines. This reduction in glycolytic metabolism can be attributed to the restoration of balance in the LIN28/Let-7 axis caused by DFMO treatment. A recent study showed that changes in the LIN28/Let-7 signaling pathway led to changes in glycolytic metabolism in NB [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, higher levels of LIN28 protein correlated with greater phosphorylation of AKT and S6, both of which play important roles in the insulin-PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway that regulates glycolytic metabolism. This indicates that the LIN28/Let-7 axis plays a significant role in regulating glycolytic metabolic activity in NB.</p><p>To further validate that DFMO treatment reduces glycolytic metabolism in NB, we tested the effects of DFMO treatment on <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake of NB tumors through an <italic>in vivo</italic> microPET study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). It has been proven that PET scans provide a quantifiable measure of glycolytic metabolism in living tumors by measuring the breakdown of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG (<sup>18</sup>F radiolabeled glucose analogue) [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It has been previously established that administration of 2% DFMO in drinking water resulted in optimal reduction in both tumor cell polyamine levels and tumor size in melanoma models [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In our model, there was a significant reduction in <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in these tumors as well. These data, along with the PET scans from patients enrolled in the phase I DFMO clinical trial [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], indicate that DFMO treatment has a substantial impact on glycolytic metabolism in tumors. This study also suggests that because tumor activity changed with little change to tumor volume, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET imaging may be a tool to consider in the evaluation of the therapeutic response to DFMO treatment in both pre-clinical and clinical settings.</p><p>Interestingly, recent studies have shown that <italic>LIN28</italic> is an important oncogenic driver in cancer stem cells [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] which may evade standard chemotherapeutic approaches and cause relapse in patients. Additionally, studies have shown that cancer stem cells depend on glycolytic metabolism for ATP production [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Neurosphere formation requires the presence of cancer stem cells within wells. In the presence of DFMO, inhibition of neurosphere formation suggests that DFMO has affected the stem cells ability to form neurospheres. Since our findings show that DFMO affects these important cancer stem cell pathways and inhibits neurosphere formation in NB, we will further elucidate the effects of DFMO on NB cancer stem cells in future studies.</p><p>Overall, our work shows that inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis with DFMO treatment effectively restores balance to the LIN28/Let-7 axis. These results have exciting clinical implications. The reduction in glycolytic metabolism via DFMO treatment holds promise for reducing tumor metabolic activity in NB. Additionally, cells with higher <italic>LIN28B</italic> and <italic>MYCN</italic> gene expression are more sensitive to DFMO treatment, so DFMO may prove an effective therapy for aggressive, <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified NB. Finally, these results provide a new perspective on the use of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET imaging in pre-clinical and clinical DFMO studies. Since tumor activity may change significantly with little or no change to tumor volume, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET may offer more meaningful information in DFMO studies than other imaging tools, both for planning treatment and monitoring disease progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Inhibitor</title><p>The ODC inhibitor DFMO (kindly provided by Dr. Patrick Woster, Medical University of South Carolina) was dissolved at 1 M in H<sub>2</sub>O.
