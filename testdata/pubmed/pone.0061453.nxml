Therefore, we investigated the fine specificity of anti-CENP-A antibodies as a first step to understanding their role in systemic sclerosis pathology. We focused on the amino-terminal portion of CENP-A spanning amino acids 1 to 17 (Ap<sup>1-17</sup>), which represents, along with Ap<sup>17-30</sup>, an immunodominant epitope of the protein. Peptide Ap<sup>1-17</sup> was used to purify antibodies from 8 patients with systemic sclerosis. Anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> antibodies specifically reacted with human CENP-A but did not cross-react with CENP-B or Ap<sup>17-30</sup>. Panning of a phage display peptide library with anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> antibodies from 2 patients identified two novel, partially overlapping motifs, &#x0003c;<sup>5</sup>Rx(st)xKP<sup>10</sup>&#x0003e; and &#x0003c;<sup>9</sup>KPxxPxR<sup>15</sup>&#x0003e; as the result of the alignment of specific phage clone insert sequences. Anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> IgG from the 8 patients had different reactivities to isolated phage clone insert sequences. Scanning the Swiss-Prot database revealed a large number of different types of proteins containing the two Ap<sup>1-17</sup> antigenic motifs. These data show that anti-CENP-A<sup>1-17</sup> antibodies are generated independently from anti-CENP-B antibodies and display great heterogeneity in their specificity by recognizing different motifs within that peptide sequence. This finding, along with the widespread interspecies and human tissue distribution of the two motifs, suggests that the number of motif-expressing proteins which can be the potential target of these antibodies is markedly higher than that estimated from the peptide-based epitope spreading model.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant &#x0003c;BIOTECNOTER 2011-12&#x0201d; from Apulia region and by a grant from University of Bari, Medical School.

In SSc, the combination of vascular abnormalities, collagen deposition and autoimmunity leads to widespread tissue and organ fibrosis.</p><p>Autoimmunity in SSc is demonstrated by the presence of an oligoclonal T cell response in the early stages of the disease <xref rid="pone.0061453-DePalma1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) in the sera of &#x0003e;95% of patients <xref rid="pone.0061453-Guy1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mehra1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. ANAs recognize a wide variety of self-antigens, including DNA topoisomerase-I (topo-I or Scl70), RNA-polymerase III, Th/To and several heterologous centromeric-associated proteins (CENP-A, CENP-B and so on) <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mehra1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Subsets of ANAs have been associated with different clinical manifestations and various degrees of SSc severity <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mehra1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0061453-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. For instance, anti-topo-I antibodies (Abs) are associated with more diffuse cutaneous involvement <xref rid="pone.0061453-Giordano1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Steen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, pulmonary fibrosis <xref rid="pone.0061453-ScusselLonzetti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Weiner1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, renal involvement and, possibly, higher disease severity <xref rid="pone.0061453-Guy1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, whereas anti-CENP Abs are more common in patients with pulmonary hypertension <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mitri1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Hudson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Anti-CENP Abs have also been found in over 80% of patients with limited cutaneous involvement, but in only 10% of patients with diffuse cutaneous involvement <xref rid="pone.0061453-Guy1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Giordano1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-ScusselLonzetti1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Weiner1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Despite the association of these ANA subsets with different SSc clinical features, their direct or indirect role in the pathophysiology of SSc is for the most part unclear; two exceptions are anti-topo-I Abs, which recognize and activate fibroblasts <xref rid="pone.0061453-Henault1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and anti-CENP-B Abs, which react with endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0061453-Servettaz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. On the other hand, the pathogenetic role of anti-CENP-A Abs remains elusive.</p><p>One way of assessing the functional role of anti-CENP-A Abs is to define their fine specificity and determine whether proteins other than CENP are their real target or can prime them. Peptide scanning analysis of CENP-A with sera from anti-CENP Ab-positive patients identified the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 45 amino acid region as the reactive site <xref rid="pone.0061453-Muro1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mahler1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Within this region, two major antigenic determinants were found be the dominant epitopes of anti-CENP-A Abs, namely the region spanning residues 17 to 30 (CENP-A<sup>17-30</sup>) and that from amino acid 1 to 17 (CENP-A<sup>1-17</sup>) <xref rid="pone.0061453-Akbarali1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Within these two immunodominant epitopes, a mutational analysis study identified the motif GPXRX <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mahler2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Since this motif was also expressed on the amino terminal portion of CENP-B (<sup>2</sup>GPXRX<sup>6</sup>), it was thought that this more abundant protein could also trigger anti-CENP-A Abs.</p><p>Using a different methodological strategy which makes use of a phage display peptide library (PDPL), we previously defined two amino acid contact sites (motifs) of anti-CENP-A<sup>17-30</sup> Abs <xref rid="pone.0061453-Perosa1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, different from GPXRX. One of these motifs (PTPxxGPxxR) was found to also be expressed by the forkhead BOX E3 transcription factor (FOXE3), which had never previously been described as a potential target of anti-CENP-A Abs.</p><p>In the present report we extend this analysis to the anti-CENP-A Abs that target the other immunodominant epitope, namely CENP-A<sup>1-17</sup>. Using anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> IgG purified from the sera of SSc patients, we identified two new motifs and found that anti-CENP-A Ap<sup>1-17</sup>Abs display a great heterogeneity in their fine specificity that is almost unique for each patient, despite the fact that these Abs recognize the same segment of CENP-A.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and controls</title><p>Frozen serum samples from 57 patients affected with SSc and satisfying the preliminary American College of Rheumatology and Canadian Scleroderma Research Group criteria for the classification of the disease <xref rid="pone.0061453-Subcommittee1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Hudson2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> were obtained from serum bank at the Department of Internal Medicine, University of Bari and at Department of Clinical and Experimental Internal Medicine, University of Naples.

Therefore, all of them could be a source of anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> Abs. For convenience, anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> Abs were affinity-purified from the sera of the eight ACA<sup>+</sup> patients with the highest anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> Ab titers (pt1, pt4, pt5, pt7, pt8, pt9, pt14, and pt15). The eight anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> Abs preparations had variable extents of contamination with human serum albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061453-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The IgG concentration for each preparation was therefore corrected to allow for the percentage of contaminating albumin, calculated following density scanning of Coomassie-stained gels. Following this correction, the Ap<sup>1-17</sup>-specific Ab recovery ranged from 367 &#x000b5;g/ml (pt4) to 84 &#x000b5;g/ml (pt14). The specificity of the preparations for Ap<sup>1-17</sup> was verified in indirect ELISAs. All anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> Abs dose-dependently reacted with KLH-conjugated Ap<sup>1-17</sup> (KLH-Ap<sup>1-17</sup>) but displayed differences in relative avidity (expressed as the highest reactivity to peptide at the lowest concentration of IgG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0061453-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

High numbers (&#x0003e;90) of pt4 and pt14 motif-containing proteins were detected in the central nervous system, cardiovascular system and gastrointestinal system, while low numbers (&#x0003c;40) were detected in the peripheral nervous system, in the cutaneous and hematopoietic apparatuses, and in the mesothelium. Overall, there was a strong correlation between the numbers of proteins with the two motifs in the different apparatuses (linear regression R<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.7). Regarding specific tissues, it is interesting to note that for the pineal gland, optical nerve, liver, cartilage, ovary, inner ear, iris and lens no or very few (&#x02264;2) proteins were found to either motifs. For the other tissues, the ratio of numbers of pt4 to pt14 motif-containing proteins was highest in muscle (ratio&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3), blood (2.33), bone (2.14), and lung (1.78) and lowest in ciliary body (0.13), dorsal root ganglion (0.25), hypophysis (0.27), myocardium (0.4) and diencephalon (0.44). Finally, qualitative analysis of the proteins showed that pt4 and pt14 motifs retrieved two different sets of proteins for each specific tissue (data not shown). This molecular analysis demonstrates that there is a wide motif-sequence distribution among species and human tissues, and it suggests that the motifs are ancestral conserved. These results suggest, therefore, that anti-CENP-A<sup>1-17</sup> IgG may cross-react with a wide variety of proteins in different human tissues and from different pathogenic species.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0061453-t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0061453.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Numbers of human proteins expressing the pt4 and pt14 antigenic motifs, by organ system (apparatus) and specific tissue.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0061453-t003-3" xlink:href="pone.0061453.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Apparatus</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Specific tissue</td><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">No. of proteins expressing the motif<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt106">a)</xref>

Three lines of evidence indicate that peptide Ap<sup>1-17</sup> effectively mimics recombinant CENP-A and is efficient in purifying antibodies relevant to the proposed study. First, Ap<sup>1-17</sup> reacted almost exclusively with sera from patients in the ACA<sup>+</sup> group (all identified on a routine basis with anti-CENP-B ELISA), efficiently discriminating this group from the ACA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> control groups, and reproducing the high concordance rate (94.3%) of sera reactivity to either CENP-A (Ap<sup>1-17</sup> in our study) or CENP-B previously reported in a larger cohort of ACA<sup>+</sup> SSc patients <xref rid="pone.0061453-Hanke1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Second, the IgG purified with Ap<sup>1-17</sup> specifically reacted with the cognate peptide and human recombinant CENP-A and not with Ap<sup>17-30</sup>, recombinant CENP-B and CBp<sup>1-13</sup>; it also produced a centromeric punctuate pattern in immunofluorescence assay similar to that of whole sera. The nuclear dots obtained with some anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> IgG were not as sharp as those obtained with serum, probably due to the recognition of only one specific CENP-A epitope rather than multiple epitopes. Lastly, the coupling of KLH to Ap<sup>1-17</sup> did not change its antigenic properties in terms of conformation or structure, since free peptide and KLH-conjugated peptide both competed for the binding of anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> IgG to KLH-Ap<sup>1-17</sup>.</p><p>Analysis of Ab-selected phage clones expressing 12-mer linear peptides allowed us to identify two specific, partially overlapping motifs: the pt4 motif <sup>9</sup>KPxxPxxR<sup>16</sup> and the pt14 motif <sup>5</sup>Rx(ST)xKP<sup>10</sup>. Amino acids K<sup>9</sup> and P<sup>10</sup> are the most critical for binding in that they are present at the same position of all peptides selected with pt4 and pt14 IgG. Despite the overlapping nature of the motifs, there was no cross-reactivity between one patient's IgG and the other's motif. Furthermore, there was limited cross-reactivity with the other SSc patients' IgG: some pt4-specific phage clones (pc4.22, pc4.26, pc4.33 and pc4.40) were recognized to a variable extent by anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> IgG from pt5, pt7 and pt9, while none of the 11 pt14-specific clones reacted with the other patients' anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> IgG. These results indicate that although pt4 and pt14 IgG recognize the same CENP-A segment, they have unique specificities.</p><p>One might argue that these unique specificities only reflect the recognition by phage particle inserts (phage PIII protein-fused peptide) of antigenic determinants outside the antigen-combining site of anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> IgG, as demonstrated in another Ag/Ab system using anti-idiotypic mAb <xref rid="pone.0061453-Perosa5" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This possibility was excluded by the ability of Ap<sup>1-17</sup> to specifically inhibit the binding of phage clone particles to anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> IgG. As a similar inhibitory effect was obtained using the same peptide conjugated to KLH, it is reasonable to conclude that peptide conformation was not influenced regardless of whether it was free or coupled to KLH, both forms of peptide competing with the binding of phage protein III-coupled peptides. Furthermore, the specificity of phage clone particles was not influenced by the possible presence of naturally occurring auto-anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> Abs <xref rid="pone.0061453-Kaveri1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mannoor1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> in IVIG, used during PDPL panning to remove phage particles specific for isotypic and allotypic determinants. Indeed, IVIG did not react in ELISA with Ap<sup>1-17</sup> and no anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> Abs could be affinity purified from IVIG. The absence of naturally occurring anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> Abs in IVIG suggests that these Abs are more likely induced by a T cell-mediated, Ag-driven immune response, in agreement with the association between the presence of ACA in SSc patients and polar amino acids at position 26 of HLA-class II allele DQB1 <xref rid="pone.0061453-Reveille1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Arnett1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The fact that no pt4 or pt14 phage clones reacted with pt1, pt8 and pt15 anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> IgG suggests that additional motifs may be involved in the binding of these IgG with CENP-A. It is unlikely that these three patients' anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> IgG recognize the motif G/APXRX, previously identified by means of mutational analysis <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mahler1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mahler2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and found to be expressed both by CENP-B (<sup>2</sup>GPKRR<sup>6</sup>) <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mahler2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and by CENP-A in its two immunodominant epitopes (Ap<sup>1-17</sup> and Ap<sup>17-30</sup>). Indeed, pt1 and pt8 IgG did not react with CENP-B in western blotting nor did pt1, pt8 and pt15 IgG bind human recombinant CENP-B, CBp<sup>1-13</sup> and Ap<sup>17-30</sup> (also expressing the motif G/APXRX) in ELISA (binding and inhibition). These data confirm our previous findings in which anti-CENP Abs specific for the Ap<sup>17-30</sup> portion of CENP-A displayed no cross-reactivity with CENP-B <xref rid="pone.0061453-Perosa1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that CENP-A Abs are generated independently from anti-CENP-B Abs and that the previously reported motif G/APXRX is not responsible for any cross-reactivity between anti-CENP-A and -CENP-B Abs <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mahler2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mahler3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Supporting this conclusion are the results by Mahler <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0061453-Mahler4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, who reported a lack of cross-inhibition between anti-CENP-A and anti-CENP-B Abs, using an amino terminal CENP-A-derived peptide (sequence not reported) and recombinant CENP-B as inhibitor.</p><p>The identification of these two novel and partially overlapping motifs, the differential cross-reactivity of pt5, pt7 and pt9 IgG with some pt4-specific phage clones, and the lack of reactivity of seven patients' IgG preparations with any pt14-specific phage clones together suggest that there is great heterogeneity in the fine specificity of anti-Ap<sup>1-17</sup> IgG from patient to patient. Given the great diversity in their specificity, it is possible that these IgG are highly somatically mutated, probably as the result of a constant antigenic selective pressure. Furthermore, it will be interesting to search for any correlation between the fine specificity of these Abs and any single disease manifestation. Indeed, Tamby et al. <xref rid="pone.0061453-Tamby1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> reported an association between the presence of Abs directed to an unknown 40 kDa protein and pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with idiopathic and scleroderma-associated pulmonary hypertension. Accordingly, since the present investigation identified 4 different profiles based on the IgG reactivity (or lack of reactivity) with the pt4 and pt14 motifs, it will be interesting to assess the possible associations of each reactivity profile with the extent of cutaneous and gastrointestinal involvement and with the presence (or absence) of pulmonary hypertension (or fibrosis). If successful, this approach should provide more specific predictive and prognostic clinical information than is currently possible through the detection of anti-CENP-A and &#x02013;CENP-B Abs using the whole recombinant proteins in ELISA or LIA, which appeared only to slightly increase the diagnostic sensitivity for SSc compared to the detection of anti-CENP-B only <xref rid="pone.0061453-Hudson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Hanke1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Finally, this study permits the development of a model to explain the phenomenon of epitope spreading <xref rid="pone.0061453-Racanelli1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This phenomenon occurs when Abs, either naturally occurring in the sera <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mahler3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> or raised following peptide immunization <xref rid="pone.0061453-Disis1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, cross-react with another region of the same protein (intra-molecular epitope spreading) <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mahler3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Vanderlugt1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> or even with a different protein (inter-molecular epitope spreading) <xref rid="pone.0061453-Mahler3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061453-Disis1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The pt4 and pt14 IgG analyzed here both recognize the same CENP-A-derived peptide (Ap<sup>1-17</sup>). Even so, because they recognize different motifs, they may cross-react with two completely different sets of proteins. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that scanning the UniProtKB database using the two motifs as search terms retrieved two completely different sets of proteins with wide interspecies and human tissue distributions. Future investigations will hopefully define the proteins that effectively are involved in priming anti-CENP-A Ab.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0061453.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
