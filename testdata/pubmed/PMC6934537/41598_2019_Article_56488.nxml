Meanwhile, OPCs require survival factors from the extracellular microenvironment. In other tissues, laminins, heterotrimetric (&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;) extracellular matrix proteins, promote cell migration and survival. However, the expression pattern and functions of laminins in OPC development remain poorly understood. In the present study, we first investigated the expression of laminin &#x003b1; chains, which bind to cell surface receptors such as integrins, in the postnatal murine brain. We found that laminin &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 chains were expressed around blood vessels and OPCs attached the laminin &#x003b1; chain-positive vessels. We then evaluated the effect of these laminins on OPCs activity using recombinant laminin E8s (LME8s) that are minimally active fragments of the laminin isoforms. OPCs attached on LM211E8, LM411E8, and LM511E8, containing laminin &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 chains, respectively, through integrin &#x003b2;1. Further, these three LME8s promoted migration of OPCs, and OPC survival was prolonged on either LM411E8 or LM511E8 via the activation of focal adhesion kinase. Together, our findings suggest that laminins expressed surrounding blood vessels positively regulate migration and survival of OPCs through the integrin &#x003b2;1-FAK pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Glial progenitors</kwd><kwd>Oligodendrocyte</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16K09667</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>Nobuharu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), alternatively called O2A cells, NG2 cells, or polydendrocytes, are one of glia cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are differentiated into oligodendrocytes in the white matter for myelination, which accomplishes rapid salutatory conduction of nerve impulses and contribute to axonal integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. OPCs can differentiate into not only oligodendrocytes but also astrocytes in the ventral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, indicating that OPCs are required for providing these glia cells depending on conditions of tissues. In particular, under the pathological condition with demyelination, the replenishment of OPCs is required for remyelination. OPCs arise from the ventricular/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) in the CNS tissues and migrate to the targeted areas for their differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Throughout this dynamic process, OPCs need to obtain survival signal from growth factors or cytokines and from cell adhesion on extracellular matrix proteins.</p><p id="Par3">Laminins are extracellular matrix proteins in basement membranes and regulate cell proliferation, migration, differentiation/morphogenesis, and survival in various tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Laminins are one of the major basement membrane proteins and composed of three different subunits, &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3; chains (e.g.: laminin, consisting of &#x003b1;1, &#x003b2;1, and &#x003b3;1 chains, is called laminin-111). To date, five &#x003b1;, four &#x003b2;, and three &#x003b3; chains have been identified, and at least 19 laminin isoforms are found <italic>in vivo</italic> with various combinations of the trimetric chain assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Laminins bind to specific cellular receptors, including integrins, through the C-terminal globular domain of the &#x003b1; chains, and exert various biological activities via cell adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A previous study revealed that the expression of laminin &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b3;1 chains, which are components of major laminin isoforms, was analyzed in the brain tissue at the early postnatal stage, when oligodendrogenesis dynamically occurs, and OPC survival was reduced in laminin &#x003b1;2 deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, the expression pattern of laminin &#x003b1; chains in the postnatal brain and the function of the other &#x003b1; chains in OPC development remain unknown.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we investigated the expression pattern and biological activities of laminin &#x003b1; chains in OPCs using anti-laminin &#x003b1; chain specific antibodies and recombinant laminin E8 fragments (LME8s) that possess the integrin binding activity equal to intact laminins, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

Further, LME8s containing laminin &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 chains promoted OPC attachment and migration, and OPC survival was activated on &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 chains via focal adhesion kinase (FAK).

Using the tissue sections, immunostaining with antibodies against laminin &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 chains was performed. As a result, the expression of laminin &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 chains, but not &#x003b1;3 chain, was observed in basement membranes surrounding blood vessels, and Venus positive OPCs contacted the vessels that expressed these laminin &#x003b1; chains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). We confirmed these results by immunostaining with antibodies against laminin &#x003b1; chains and an OPC marker Olig2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) and identified blood vessels using an antibody against an endothelial cell marker CD31 in the WT tissues (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). We also observed that laminin &#x003b1;4 chain was expressed around all of the CD31-positive vessels, while the percentages of laminin &#x003b1;1-, &#x003b1;2-, and &#x003b1;5-positive vessels out of all the vessels were 4.94%, 15.09%, and 15.75%, respectively. In addition, the expression of laminin &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 chains was found in pia and neighbor vessels, and some of Venus positive OPCs attached to the laminin-positive pia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>).

When the phosphorylation of Tyr397 in FAK, which is the most critical tyrosine residue in FAK activation, was examined in OPCs cultured on LME8s, LM511E8 elevated the phosphorylation level of FAK (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d,e</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

Further, we tested an inhibitor of FAK in the OPC culture on LM411E8 and LM511E8. The FAK inhibitor substantially increased the number of dying apoptotic cells labeled by cleaved caspase-3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f,g</xref>). These experimental data indicated that laminin &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 chains activated FAK for survival of OPCs. We finally examined a difference of the activities between LM411E8 and LM511E8, since the phosphorylation level of FAK in OPCs on LM511E8 was higher than that on LM411E8 although there was no difference in cell survival. The phosphorylation levels of Akt, a critical downstream molecule of FAK for cell survival, were similar between LM411E8 and LM511E8 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). However, we found that the cell process formation with filopodia-like protrusions was higher on LM511E8 than on LM411E8, accompanying with an increase of filamentous actin-positive area (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). These results suggested that laminin &#x003b1;5 chain activated the signaling of actin polymerization, probably through the activation of FAK, for cell process formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par11">In this study, we showed that the expression of laminin &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 chains was observed surrounding blood vessels at the early postnatal brain and OPCs attached to the vessels expressed these laminin isoforms. The expression of laminin &#x003b1; chains in basement membranes around vessels is known in other tissues. The blood vessels are distinguished into four types with its distinct structures: arterioles, capillaries, postcapillary venules, and venules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Arterioles and venules are surrounded by endothelial and perivascular basement membranes located beneath endothelial cells and peripherally smooth muscle cells, respectively. Capillaries and postcapillary venules are underlain only by endothelial basement membranes that embed pericytes. Laminin &#x003b1;4 chain is expressed in all of the basement membranes, while the expression of &#x003b1;2 chain is observed in only perivascular basement membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Laminin &#x003b1;5 chain is found in most of the basement membranes but its expression is patchy in endothelial basement membranes around postcapillary venules and venules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Here we found that laminin &#x003b1;4 chain was expressed in all of CD31-positive vessels in the postnatal brain, while about 15% of the vessels were positive for &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;5 chains, indicating that laminin &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 chains may be expressed with similar pattern to that in the other tissues. We also detected the expression of laminin &#x003b1;1 chain in some of the vessels, whereas LM111E8 did not show attachment activity of OPCs. Laminin &#x003b1;1 chain may possess different functions from the other chains. In the previous report, laminin &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b3;1 were found in the VZ/SVZ, in addition to vascular basement membranes, at P1, while the expression of laminin &#x003b1; chains was not investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In the VZ/SVZ of the adult mouse brain, laminins are detected in basement membranes of fractones, which are the extravascular protrusion-like structure, and provide a niche for neural stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. During the postnatal stages, the protein expression of laminin &#x003b1;5 chain was detected in the SVZ fractones at P3, but not at P0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In the present study, we could not detect the clear expression of laminin &#x003b1; chains in the VZ/SVZ at P2. However, there is a possibility that the initiated expression of laminin &#x003b1; chains in fractones may influence on OPC activity.</p><p id="Par12">Laminins exert biological activities, such as cell migration and survival, through cell adhesion mediated by integrins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment of the cell attachment assay revealed that LME8s containing laminin &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 chains promoted OPCs adhesion and anti-integrin &#x003b2;1 antibody inhibited the adhesion. From these data, integrin &#x003b2;1 was significantly involved in the attachment to the laminins on OPCs. In the present study, integrin &#x003b1; chain as a partner of integrin &#x003b2;1 to recognize the laminins on OPCs was unable to be determined. It is possible that a combination of more than two different &#x003b1; chains tested here formed heterodimers with integrin &#x003b2;1 and function as receptors for these laminins, or OPC adhesion to the laminins was mediated via the other integrin &#x003b1; chain, which we did not examine in this study.</p><p id="Par13">LM211E8, LM411E8, and LM511E8 promoted OPC migration, and LM411E8 and LM511E8 maintained the number of OPCs through the suppression of apoptosis, but not promotion of cell proliferation. During the embryonic stages, OPCs migrate to their destination along on blood vessels as rails<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Laminin &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 chains may have an activity for guiding OPCs to the location where they need to settle. OPC survival is prolonged by growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which were contained in the medium used in this study. Binding of laminins to cell surface integrins induces the formation of the molecular platform, such as focal contact including FAK, for intracellular signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The growth factor receptors are recruited to the platform, and efficiently bind to the growth factors and activate downstream pathways for cell survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Our data showed that the FAK inhibitor increased apoptotic OPCs on LM411E8 and LM511E8. These evidences suggest that laminin &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 chains enhance OPC survival, presumably on blood vessels, with positively regulating the downstream FAK signaling. Furthermore, the more elevated activation of FAK in OPCs on LM511E8 than on LM411E8 likely activated cell process formation with actin polymerization. OPCs probably choose the signaling from these different laminin &#x003b1; chains, depending on their requirements.</p><p id="Par14"><italic>In vivo</italic> functional study of laminin &#x003b1;2 chain in the postnatal OPC development has been previously carried out. OPC survival, but not proliferation, is reduced in the VZ/SVZ of laminin &#x003b1;2 null mice during the early postnatal stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In the present study, the number of OPCs on LM211E8 was more than that on the control PDL after the 3 day-culture, though without a statistical difference. Also, no significant difference in the ratio of cleaved caspase-3-positive OPC numbers was observed between LM211E8 and PDL. These observations suggest that laminin &#x003b1;2 chain promotes OPC survival, but some <italic>in vivo</italic> factors are required for exerting the activity. Knockout mice of laminin &#x003b1;4 chain exhibit defects in Schwann cell development and nerve fasciculation in the peripheral nervous system, in addition to the abnormalities in neuromuscular junction formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, no defects were found in the laminin &#x003b1;4 deficient CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. To explain this, laminin &#x003b1;5 chain probably compensates for the deficiency of laminin &#x003b1;4 chain, since an ectopic expression of laminin &#x003b1;5 chain is observed around all vessels instead of laminin &#x003b1;4 chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, double knockout of laminin &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 chains in the CNS tissue would be required for analyzing the postnatal development of OPCs, whereas it is technically difficult due to the embryonic lethality of laminin &#x003b1;5 knockout mice and the expression of laminin &#x003b1;5 chain in multiple cell types in the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">During the differentiation from OPCs to oligodendrocytes, the signaling of laminin &#x003b1;2 chain, which is expressed on axon surface in the brain stem and cervical spinal cord, has been characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Differentiating oligodendrocytes adhere to the axonal surface via the binding of integrin &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 to laminin &#x003b1;2 chain (laminin-211), which results in the switching of intracellular signaling from the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway for proliferation to the mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway for survival, in the presence of soluble neuregulin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. From these observations and our data in the present study, laminin &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 chains surrounding vessels regulate migration and survival of OPCs, but later, laminin &#x003b1;2 chain on axonal surface promotes oligodendrocyte survival during the differentiation and myelination stage, particularly together with neuregulin-1, which is expressed and released from axons.</p><p id="Par16">Fibronectin is an extracellular matrix protein that promotes cell adhesion as well as laminins. However, fibronectin does not promote the survival of differentiating oligodendrocytes, whereas laminin-211 does as mentioned above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Previously, Hu <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that the proliferation, survival, and migration of OPCs were increased on fibronectin, similar to laminin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In their study, however, laminin-111, whose E8 (LM111E8) did not exhibit attachment activity of OPCs in our present study, was used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Also, our data showed that fibronectin was less active than LM411E8 in both cell attachment and survival assays. From these, laminins, but not fibronectin, are a positive regulator in the survival of either OPCs or oligodendrocytes. It is interesting to note that fibronectin as one of components of extracellular vesicles, which are secreted from microvascular endothelial cells, promotes the uptake of the vesicles into OPCs for their proliferation and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Fibronectin may exert its activity as a component of the vesicles, but not as a matrix protein. In addition, rather than promoting effect, fibronectin negatively regulates process outgrowth in differentiating oligodendrocytes, which is associated with an attenuation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Lafrenaye and Fuss discussed that the coordination of these opposed functions between laminin-211 and fibronectin was required for progression of the oligodendrocyte differentiation with proper timing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The balances of the coordinated activities of these extracellular proteins probably determine OPC and oligodendrocyte behaviors and their fate.</p><p id="Par17">In this study, we used LME8s, instead of intact laminins. LME8s possess the integrin binding activity with the same level as intact laminins, and can be prepared more easily and efficiently than intact laminins. Under the pathological condition such as demyelination, the replenishment of OPCs with their migration and survival is required for remyelination. Previous studies revealed that OPCs population was depleted after acute demyelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and are not able to catch up the fast demand of OPCs under chronic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. LME8s may be useful reagents to facilitate an improvement of the pathological condition. In conclusion, our study revealed biological functions of laminin &#x003b1; chains on survival and migration of OPCs. This is the first investigation that evaluated all the laminin &#x003b1; chains in OPC development and revealed their activities. The results in this study will give better understanding of OPC biology and development of OPC culture methods and of therapeutic reagents for OPC related disorders.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par18">P2-3 pups from the previously reported <italic>Sox10</italic>-Venus mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and P2 WT mice were euthanized by decapitation as described in the International Animal Care and Use Committee and the previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and were used for the experiments.
