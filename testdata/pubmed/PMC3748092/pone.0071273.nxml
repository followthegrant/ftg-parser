It is well known that the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and glycan of cell surface glycoproteins play pivotal roles in tumor metastasis. The goal of this study was to identify HCC metastasis related differential glycan pattern and their enzymatic basis using a HGF induced EMT model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>HGF was used to induce HCC EMT model. Lectin microarray was used to detect the expression of cell surface glycan and the difference was validated by lectin blot and fluorescence cell lectin-immunochemistry. The mRNA expression levels of glycotransferases were determined by qRT-PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After HGF treatment, the Huh7 cell lost epithelial characteristics and obtained mesenchymal markers. These changes demonstrated that HGF could induce a typical cell model of EMT. Lectin microarray analysis identified a decreased affinity in seven lectins ACL, BPL, JAC, MPL, PHA-E, SNA, and SBA to the glycan of cell surface glycoproteins. This implied that glycan containing T/Tn-antigen, NA2 and bisecting GlcNAc, Sia&#x003b1;2-6Gal/GalNAc, terminal &#x003b1; or &#x003b2;GalNAc structures were reduced. The binding ability of thirteen lectins, AAL, LCA, LTL, ConA, NML, NPL, DBA, HAL, PTL II, WFL, ECL, GSL II and PHA-L to glycan were elevated, and a definite indication that glycan containing terminal &#x003b1;Fuc and &#x000b1; Sia-Le, core fucose, &#x003b1;-man, gal-&#x003b2;(&#x003b1;) GalNAc, &#x003b2;1,6 GlcNAc branching and tetraantennary complex oligosaccharides structures were increased.

The high mortality is caused by tumor recurrence, metastasis and lack of effective therapeutic response. Metastasis is the major obstacle of HCC treatment efficacy, so it is urgent to discover better biomarkers that predict HCC metastasis. Recent studies demonstrated that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step of tumor metastasis <xref rid="pone.0071273-Turley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. EMT is a developmental process during which cells switch from an epithelial phenotype to a mesenchymal phenotype and gain the ability to migrate. This process accompanied by the down-regulation or loss of the epithelial cell markers, such as E-cadherin, cytokeratin, mucin; and up-regulation of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, transcription factors snail and slug, etc <xref rid="pone.0071273-Zeisberg1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. EMT phenomenon was discovered in the cells, animal models and clinical studies of HCC; the occurrence of EMT was related to the metastasis and chemotherapy drug resistance of HCC <xref rid="pone.0071273-Polyak1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In human HCC, EMT is highly correlated with invasive tumors, intrahepatic metastasis, and poor survival <xref rid="pone.0071273-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. As well known a wide variety of growth factors including transforming growth factor &#x003b2;(TGF-&#x003b2;), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) could up-regulate the expression of EMT-regulating transcription factors <xref rid="pone.0071273-Peinado1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, ultimately promoting the occurrence of EMT. In this study, we used HGF induced EMT of human Huh7 HCC cells.</p><p>Glycosylation is the most common post-translational modification. The carbohydrate structures of cell surface glycoconjugates play an important role in many physiological and pathological events, including cell growth, differentiation, and transformation <xref rid="pone.0071273-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Many studies have reported that protein glycosylation was related to tumor development, invasion and metastasis, and found that characteristic glycoprotein biomarker showed an increasingly important role in diagnosis. Some glycoproteins with aberrant glycosylation have been used as biomarkers for HCC diagnosis, such as AFP-L3 <xref rid="pone.0071273-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL)-reactive &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin <xref rid="pone.0071273-Comunale1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, &#x003b1;-1,3 fucosylated multiantennary glycan on hemopexin <xref rid="pone.0071273-Debruyne1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. But there were poor glycan of glycoprotein as biomarkers for HCC metastasis. Therefore, studies focusing on dynamic glycoproteomic alteration during cancer metastasis can help to clarify the mechanism of HCC metastasis and may provide potential markers for HCC metastasis.</p><p>In this study, we used HGF-induced HCC EMT model in vitro, and then analyzed the profile of cell surface protein glycosylation by lectin microarray. Alterations of cell surface glycoconjugates on benefit for tumor cells to escape from immune surveillance as well as metastasis <xref rid="pone.0071273-MonzaviKarbassi1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The goal of this study was to profile HCC metastasis-specific, lectin reactive glycan of glycoproteins with comparisons to that of its primary cancer. It may provide the critical insight for the effective control of HCC metastases and improve patient survival rate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human HCC Huh7 cells (obtained from Cell Bank, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DMEM) medium (Sigma, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA), 100 U/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37&#x000b0;C.

In contrast, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) could add the GlcNAc &#x003b2;1-6 branches to N-glycan at the Man &#x003b1;1-6 side of the trimannosyl core and encoded by <italic>Mgat5</italic> gene, it was strongly associated with cancer metastasis <xref rid="pone.0071273-Taniguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Fucosylation was very common in a variety of diseases and core fucose structures catalyzed by &#x003b1;1, 6-fucosyltransferase (FuT8). FuT8 transfers a fucosyl residue to the asparagine-linked GlcNAc residue of complex type N-glycan, it could recognized by LCA. We have previously observed that bisecting GlcNAc was decreased and &#x003b2;1,6 GlcNAc branching structures and fucose were increased in HGF-induced EMT cells.

Research has revealed that EMT may be induced either by environmental stresses or by a number of extracellular mediators. HGF is a multifunctional cytokine secreted by hepatocytes, it can induce EMT that could weaken tumor cell adhesion and enhance invasion in some tumor models. Purified HGF can stimulate invasive ability in various cancer cells in vitro <xref rid="pone.0071273-Nagai1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In the present study, we used HGF induced EMT metastasis model in Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells for exploring the mechanism of HCC metastasis. As expected, the HGF induced cells became spindle shape, increased cell migration and weakened adhesion ability, and EMT-related molecular, E-cadherin decreased both in mRNA and protein level, the expressions of N-cadherin, Slug, Snail, Twist, Vimentin and &#x003b1;-SMA were raised after HGF stimulating, all of the changes were in line with EMT. Our data showed the same results as previous study using HGF induced EMT in HCC cell lines (17).</p><p>Cell surface glycan signature can vary during cell-cell interactions, growth regulation and differentiation. Altered glycan signatures are also observed on tumor cells, and play a critical role in the escape of tumor cells from immune surveillance as well as metastasis. Tumor cell metastasis may alter cell membrane properties determined by cell surface glycoconjugates. For example, cell surface sialylation and &#x003b2;1-6 branching of N-linked oligosaccharides are strongly correlated with differentiation and metastatic of cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0071273-Dennis1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071273-Dennis2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. There are various analytical techniques for glycan structure, such as affinity chromatography, mass spectrometry or NMR; none of them are suitable for a global survey. Lectin microarray is a novel, rapid, high-throughput and high-sensitivity glycan profiling method. Many previous studies using lectin microarray were detected &#x0201c;cell extracts&#x0201d; rather than intact cells, but the highly multivalent and diverse nature of glycan on each cell surface may be damaged during the process of cell lysates and failed to profile the intact cell surface glycan <xref rid="pone.0071273-Tateno1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Here we used this technology to analyze the cell-surface glycan signature of whole cells directly. Cy5-labeled cells were applied in situ to the lectin microarray. After washing, bound cells were directly detected by a fluorescent scanner. This lectin microarray was established by our laboratory using gel-slide as solid support. There was a linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the coefficient of variation of fluorescence signal was controlled within 10%. The lectin microarray results were verified by identifying the differences in glycan chain of standard glycoprotein:asialofetuin and fetuin. This lectin microarray can identify the N-glycan compositions of alpha-fetoproteins (AFPs) from different sources <xref rid="pone.0071273-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The preliminary data confirms that our lectin microarray system was reliable.</p><p>Glycan remodeling is a major aspect of the cell differentiation process, immune activation. Previous studies have reported some glycan structural changes associated with cells differentiation and tumor progression. Guan found glycosphingolipids (GSLs) was down-regulated and GalNAc-type O-glycosylation was up-regulated in TGF-&#x003b2; induced EMT process <xref rid="pone.0071273-FreiredeLima1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071273-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Kevin discovered 40 glycogens related with TGF-&#x003b2; induced EMT <xref rid="pone.0071273-Chammas1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. There poor studies systematically and exhaustively research the major glycan structural changes in cell migration. In this case, we analyzed the glycan alterations in EMT by lectin microarray and found some abnormal glycosylation structures as indicators for cell migration; the data were showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071273-g005">Figure 5</xref>. A large number of studies have shown that the alterations of glycan related to HCC progress closely. We observed the cells with EMT could have more stranger affinity to PHA-L than that to PHA-E, this two lectin specific identificated &#x003b2;1-6 branched structure and NA2 and bisecting GlcNAc respectively. GnT-III was a key glycosyltransferase in N-glycan biosynthetic pathway and could suppress the formation of &#x003b2;1,6 GlcNAc branching structure catalyzed by GnT-V <xref rid="pone.0071273-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In a tumor context, GnT-III and GnT-V have antagonistic effect, GnT-III and its bisecting GlcNAc structure can suppress tumor metastases whereas GnT-V and its &#x003b2;1,6 GlcNAc branching structure increased malignancy and metastasis <xref rid="pone.0071273-Taniguchi2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Previous studies had suggested that GnT-III prevented metastasis via enhance cell-cell adhesion (E-cadherin glycosylation) and down-regulated cell-ECM adhesion (Integrin glycosylation), the overexpression of GnT-III increased the bisected GlcNAc structure of E-cadherin and regulated the cell-cell adhesion of E-cadherin-mediated. Meanwhile, the bisects structure of GnT-III catalytic inhibited &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin binding the laminin in extracellular matrix and involved in cell migration <xref rid="pone.0071273-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

Xu discovered that a decrease in GnT-III expression led to reduce the bisected N-glycan, but the expression of GnT-V was enhanced in the TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced EMT, over-expressed GnT-III can inhibited TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced EMT, nuclear localization of &#x003b2;-catenin and cell migration <xref rid="pone.0071273-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

In GnT-V transgenic mice, GnT-V overexpression promoted EMT and keratinocyte migration by enhancing EGF receptor signaling <xref rid="pone.0071273-Terao1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In our studies, we captured the classic metastasis-associated carbohydrate chain structures by corresponding lectin, then lectin blot and fluorescence cell lectin-immunochemistry were both confirmed this result, which was consistent with previous research <xref rid="pone.0071273-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>T/Tn antigens were specific tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen markers of cell surface mucin. Lectin ACL, BPL, JAC and MPL can bind this structure. Tn has a simple structure composed of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine with a glycosidic &#x003b1; linkage to serine/threonine residues (GalNAc&#x003b1;1-O-Ser/Thr) and was catalyzed by polypeptide &#x003b1;-N-acetylgalactosaminyl -transferases (ppGalNAcTs) in Golgi. Then Tn antigen was modified by T-synthase extended to the core 1 O-glycan Gal&#x003b2;1-3GalNAc&#x003b1;1-OSer/Thr (T antigen). Cumulative studies reported that the Tn antigen has high levels in human cancer, common in colon and breast cancer <xref rid="pone.0071273-Itzkowitz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071273-Konska1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, it also correlates with metastatic potential and poor prognosis. We found T/Tn antigens were reduced in EMT model; it provided reference data for the research in HCC and its metastasis. Many studies have demonstrated that fucosylation associated with the biological aggressiveness of tumor. &#x003b1;-1, 6 fucosylation is a significant glycan modification of HCC metastasis. Fucosylated AFP, AFP-L3 as a specific marker was used to diagnosis HCC <xref rid="pone.0071273-Aoyagi1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The finding that AAL, LTL and LCA lectin signals were enhanced in the EMT model prompted an increase in fucosylation and Sia-Le during HCC metastasis, a result consistent with those from the lectin blot and fluorescence cell lectin-immunochemistry. Further studies implied that the up-regulation of fucosylation may be due to the increased of FUT8 expression in the HCC EMT metastasis model. Dai et.al <xref rid="pone.0071273-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> found that core fucose extent increased with hepatoma cells metastatic potential. Studies have shown that FUT8 can promote tumor cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis and is closely related to the occurrence and development of HCC. &#x003b2;3Gal-T5 was required for the synthesis of the Sialyl Lewis a antigen (sLe<sup>a</sup>), the epitope of CA19-9, which is a well-known tumor marker for gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers. SLe<sup>a</sup> is associated with the adhesion and invasion of tumors, sLe<sup>a</sup> on the cell surface are associated with the dissemination of the tumors as it can recognize E-selectin of vascular endothelial cells and mediate the adherence of tumor cells to vascular endothelial cells. A higher level of expression of sLe<sup>a</sup> indicates stronger tumor invasion <xref rid="pone.0071273-Takada1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Consistent with previous study <xref rid="pone.0071273-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, the <italic>&#x003b2;3GalT5</italic> glycogene was increased in the HCC EMT model; it implied that <italic>&#x003b2;3GalT5</italic> and its product may play an important role in the development and metastasis of HCC.</p><p>We also used lectin microarray technology to discover that the Sia&#x003b1;2-6Gal/GalNAc and terminal &#x003b1; or &#x003b2;GalNAc structures were down-regulated, and that the structures of mannose, gal-&#x003b2; (&#x003b1;) GalNAc and&#x003b1; (&#x003b2;) &#x02013; GlcNAc were up-regulated in the HCC EMT metastasis model. Consistent with the previous result, the Sia&#x003b1;2-6Gal/GalNAc was reduced in HCC with metastasis than in HCC without metastasis <xref rid="pone.0071273-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and there was an increased GlcNAc structure in highly metastatic HCCLM3 <xref rid="pone.0071273-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and serum glycoprotein of HCC with metastatic <xref rid="pone.0071273-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. There are also reports of increased mannose structural modification in human and rat HCC GGT <xref rid="pone.0071273-Furmanski1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. On the contrary, sialic acid changes have been reported in many tumor metastases, its increases may reduce tumor cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. The causes of inconsistent results regarding the cell EMT transformation mechanism are not entirely clear, as many factors are involved in this process. Future work will aim to identify the glycoprotein of the structures identified here by lectin microarray and seek to determinate biosynthetic pathways and the mechanism of glycan alterations in EMT.</p><p>This is the first study to analyze the nature of glycan alterations in cancer EMT using intact cell surface glycoprotein by lectin microarray. The T/Tn-antigen, NA2 and bisecting GlcNAc, Sia&#x003b1;2-6Gal/GalNAc, terminal &#x003b1; or &#x003b2;GalNAc structures were reducing markers, while terminal &#x003b1;Fuc and &#x000b1; Sia-Le, &#x003b1;-or &#x003b2;-linked GalNAc, core fucose, &#x003b2;1,6 GlcNAc branching structures and tetraantennary complex oligosaccharides were increasing markers for HCC EMT. The specific genes and proteins which control these glycan structures may be targets to prevent or reverse EMT. These findings provide important information for future research on the prevention of HCC metastases and drug resistant forms of HCC cells.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0071273-Parkin1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
