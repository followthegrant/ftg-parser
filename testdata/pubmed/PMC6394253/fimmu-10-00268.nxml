The relationship between these phenotypes is yet to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of ERS in mitochondrial damage and IL-1&#x003b2; production in macrophages during infection with a virulent <italic>M. bovis</italic> strain. We found that ERS activates the inflammasome via NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)-caspase-8 and that IFN-inducible protein absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) triggered mitochondrial damage. ERS increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promoted translocation of the inflammasome to the mitochondria. NLRP3, but not AIM2, was involved in the ERS-induced cleavage of caspase-8 and Bid, leading to mitochondrial damage, which was required for the production of mature IL-1&#x003b2;. Our data suggest that ERS induces macrophages to produce mature IL-1&#x003b2; during infection with virulent <italic>M. bovis</italic> through a positive feedback loop between mitochondrial damage and inflammasome activation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the involvement of ERS and mitochondrial damage in inflammasome activation during <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic></kwd><kwd>ERS</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial damage</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd><kwd>IL-1&#x003b2;</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="47"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="10470"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) is the primary causative agent of human tuberculosis and is found worldwide. <italic>M. bovis</italic>, a member of the <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> complex, causes tuberculosis in humans and a broad range of animal species. In humans, the host immune response induced by <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection resembles that induced by <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). <italic>M. bovis</italic> mainly infects and replicates within host macrophages, which are important effector cells in the regulation of the protective innate immune response to resist intracellular bacterial multiplication.</p><p>Interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; is one of the key proinflammatory cytokines that play a critical role in innate immune responses. Mice defective in IL-1R or IL-1&#x003b2; are more sensitive to mycobacterial infection and have an increased bacterial burden (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The increase in susceptibility of IL-1R-deficient mice results from the recruitment of defective immune cells to the site of infection and a deficiency in the formation of proper granuloma (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); these changes indicate the vital significance of IL-1&#x003b2; signaling to fight against mycobacterial infection. Mature IL-1&#x003b2; is formed in the cytoplasm from the precursor of IL-1&#x003b2;, pro-IL-1&#x003b2;, which is a biologically inactive form of IL-1&#x003b2;. The maturation of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; is dependent on the activation of a multiprotein complex signaling mechanism, which is referred to as inflammasome activation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The activated inflammasome cleaves pro-IL-1&#x003b2; by cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (caspase-1), an enzymatic reaction that is followed by the secretion of the mature active IL-1&#x003b2; into the extracellular matrix (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The explicit mechanisms of inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x003b2; production during <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection are yet to be elucidated.</p><p>Mitochondrial damage or destabilization is potentially crucial for activation of the inflammasome by numerous impetus (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Different types of cell stress result in damage of the mitochondria, which initiates the inflammasome activation. Consistently, the NLRP3 inflammasome is recruited to the mitochondria, allowing it to function as a mitochondrial check framework compared to the apoptosome. Moreover, inflammasome recruitment to the mitochondria, and activation intensifies mitochondrial destabilization or dysfunction. Thus, mitochondrial damage and inflammasome activation form a positive feedback loop, which amplifies cellular stress signals.</p><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complicated, delicate organelle capable of protein folding, calcium stockpiling, and lipid or carbohydrate metabolism (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The ER is highly sensitive to perturbation. Diverse cellular stresses, such as microbial infection, destabilization of calcium homeostasis, or redox imbalance, cause ER stress (ERS), which is characterized by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. The ER establishes a connection to the mitochondria through a specialized structure, which is often referred to as mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). Interestingly, in the context of diverse ER signals, MAMs play a crucial role in the modulation of mitochondrial shape, redox status, and permeability, a process that is profoundly involved in a many cellular mechanisms, from inflammasome activation to cell death (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The ER may serve as a bridge between stress-inducing elements and mitochondrial damage associated with inflammasome activation.</p><p>Three pathways, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), induce ERS reactions (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), a homeostatic signaling network that controls the physiological outcomes of the stressed cell (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Toll-like receptors (TLR), which distinguish mycobacterial ligands, selectively trigger IRE1 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Virulent <italic>M. bovis</italic> strains interact with the ER and induce X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) mRNA splicing, a process suggestive of IRE1 activation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In addition, our previous studies suggest that infection with virulent <italic>M. bovis</italic> strains induce inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in macrophages (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Moreover, infection of macrophages by <italic>M. bovis</italic> leads to inflammasome-dependent mitochondrial damage (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The early published data drove us to theorize that, upon <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection, ERS triggers a positive feedback loop between mitochondrial damage and inflammasome activation, resulting in IL-1&#x003b2; production, as described in the current study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animal Infection Model</title><p>Six-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China).

We assessed whether caspase-8 was activated during <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection through the measurement of cleaved active caspase-8. A relative increase in the expression of caspase-8 cleavage was observed in <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected BMDMs at 6 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). We then probed the lysates from no inhibitor-treated and 4-PBA-treated infected BMDMs to investigate the role of ERS in caspase-8 activation. We found that ERS induced caspase-8 cleavage during <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). To determine whether NLRP3 and AIM2 acted upstream of caspase-8, control, NLRP3-silenced, and AIM2-silenced BMDMs were infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> and probed for cleaved caspase-8. Caspase-8 cleavage significantly decreased in infected NLRP3-silenced BMDMs, although the silencing of AIM2 had no clear effect on the cleavage of caspase-8 compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E,F</xref>). We then investigated whether NLRP3 was required for ERS initiation through the measurement of the expression of ERS markers. No significant decrease in Bip or phosphorylated IRE1&#x003b1; was observed in infected NLRP3-silenced BMDMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Figures 2C,D</xref>). Subsequently, we investigated the mitochondrial recruitment of active caspase-8 and its role in mitochondrial dysfunction. We detected that cleaved caspase-8 was recruited to the mitochondrial fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>), but that this recruitment was abolished by 4-PBA treatment or in NLRP3-silenced macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4H,I</xref>), but not in AIM2-silenced macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>). BMDMs treated with z-IETD-fmk, a caspase-8 inhibitor, released less mitochondrial content into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4K,L</xref>).

We hypothesized that under ERS, NLRP3, and caspase-8 might induce Bid truncation, which leads to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization.

To determine the role of Bid in ERS-derived mitochondrial dysfunction, we probed lysates from infected BMDMs in the presence or absence of 4-PBA treatment for tBid; with etoposide (ET) used as a positive control. 4-PBA treatment decreased tBid in <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected, but not in ET-treated BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).

The results of our study have provided mechanistic insights into the relative role of ERS, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammasome activation in the regulation of IL-1&#x003b2; during <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection. The principal findings of this study were: (1) ERS induced by <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection was involved in IL-1&#x003b2; production; (2) ERS damaged mitochondria through an inflammasome-dependent mechanism during <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection; and (3) damaged mitochondria drive inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x003b2; production through the release of DAMPs, mtDNA, and cytochrome c. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the role of <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection-induced ERS in mitochondrial damage and inflammasome activation that lead to IL-1&#x003b2; production.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling may be a common mechanism by which diverse stressors, including K<sup>+</sup> efflux, ROS, and lysosome destabilization, activate inflammasomes (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Lee et al. added Ca<sup>2+</sup> to lysates of LPS-stimulated macrophages and observed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the NLRP3 inflammasome complex directly facilitated the co-immunoprecipitation of ASC and NLRP3. The study of Lee et al. showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers inflammasome activation independent of mitochondrial function (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In the context of our study, inflammasome activation by <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection-induced ERS was essentially dependent on the release of mitochondrial content. To reconcile the contradiction between our data and previously reported results, we speculated that the concentration of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> might be critical role in the dependence of inflammasome activation on mitochondrial dysfunction. Stress that induced significant elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration might induce inflammasome activation without mitochondrial damage. Stress that results in a weak induction of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration might be more dependent on mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>ROS may induce the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome as well as recruiter molecules, which results in the translocation of NLRP3 to the mitochondria, and leads the NLRP3 inflammasome to cleave Bid and trigger mitochondrial damage. Notably, our studies have shown that in <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected macrophages, AIM2 inflammasome activation did not require ROS (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, the recruitment of AIM2 inflammasome to mitochondria was essentially dependent on ROS. Upon recruitment, NLRP3 binds the exposed mitochondrial phospholipid, cardiolipin (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), or the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, MAVS, which serve as &#x0201c;scaffolding&#x0201d; for complex assembly (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Hence, it will be of interest to determine whether cardiolipin and MAVS were more broadly involved in binding to other inflammasomes, including AIM2.</p><p>The NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes recruit and cleave pro-caspase-1; subsequently, active caspase-1 leads rapidly to lytic death, referred to as pyroptosis. Our study indicated that <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection induced caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), but the mechanism through which caspase-1 triggers cell death is still unknown. Caspase-1 is reported to drive mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to pyroptosis (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, a recent report indicated that caspase-1 was not involved in mitochondrial dysfunction in response to ERS (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), which agreed with our data in BMDMs, suggesting that an alternative caspase, other than caspase-1, is the key proteinase that induces mitochondrial damage. To reconcile these contradictory data, we speculated that caspase-1 and caspase-8 might catalyze common substrates (i.e., Bid and pro-IL-1&#x003b2;), and that the catalytic efficiency might differ for different substrates. In contrast with caspase-1, caspase-8 strongly catalyzes Bid cleavage and weakly catalyzes IL-1&#x003b2; production. Stimuli that activate caspase-8 might allow the cleavage of Bid, followed by mitochondrial dysfunction, without a requirement for caspase-1. Stimuli that cannot trigger caspase-8 activation might be dependent on caspase-1 for Bid truncation. Consistent with our speculation, in conditions in which caspase-1 is not activated, caspase-8 is utilized as the major IL-1&#x003b2;-converting protease (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial infection induces complex stresses on host cells that are not completely explained for most microorganisms; however, they are known to incorporate oxidative stress, organelle perturbations, K<sup>+</sup> efflux, and nutrient deprivation. Early studies reported that microorganisms induce ERS (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), whereas ERS and NLRP3 are important regulators of the protective immune responses against microbial infection (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These observations indicated that the modulation of ERS may offer a promising strategy for the resistance to infection through the regulation of inflammatory responses. Importantly, as ERS is associated with sterile inflammatory diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, Crohn's disease, and cancer (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), and the production of various cytokines, it may be important in the investigation of whether the NLRP3-caspase-8 axis and mitochondrial dysfunction are more intricately engaged with these mechanisms.</p><p>NLRP3 has emerged as a mediator of mitochondrial damage and ERS. The role of ERS in the NLRP3-caspase-8-induced mitochondrial dysfunction has still not been elucidated. NLRP3 is recruited to mitochondria, suggesting that the recognition of mitochondrial lipids or proteins, which may serve as DAMPs, by NLRP3, together with the subsequent interaction between these molecules, might be a possible mechanism that leads to NLRP3 activation and caspase-8 cleavage. It will be of interest to determine the role of ERS in mitochondrial lipid/protein synthesis and translocation during <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection. We found that AIM2 was activated and recruited to mitochondria during <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection. Unexpectedly, AIM2 was not critically important for caspase-8 cleavage or Bid truncation. The most probable explanation is that cells exploit numerous parallel or redundant pathways, including but not limited to the caspase-8-Bid pathway, to trigger mitochondrial dysfunction. z-IETD-fmk is a selective and cell-permeable caspase-8 inhibitor. Unexpectedly, z-IETD-fmk partially inhibited the cleavage of caspase-3 (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). We speculated that the inhibitory effect of z-IETD-fmk on cleavage of caspase-3 was not a direct effect, but was mediated through the inhibition of caspase-8 cleavage. The inhibition of caspase-8 activation induced a decrease in cytochrome c release, a process that is responsible for the inhibition of the activation of apoptotic caspases. Yue et al. (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) showed that caspase-3 activation and Bid cleavage formed a positive feedback loop that is engaged by hyperosmotic shock to induce apoptosis in Xenopus oocytes. The exploration of the existence of such a caspase-3/Bid loop in <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected macrophages would be an intriguing research topic.</p><p>We observed that 4-PBA treatment aggravated <italic>M. bovis</italic>-induced lung lesions, which indicated the protective role of ERS during infection. In addition, our results suggested that ERS enhanced the production of IL-1&#x003b2;. An emerging body of evidence suggests that IL-1&#x003b2; plays a key role in the control of mycobacterium infection (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), it is reasonable to speculate that ERS boosts immunologic defense through IL-1&#x003b2; secretion after <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection. The level of IL-1&#x003b2; secretion into the extracellular matrix is dependent on pro-IL-1&#x003b2; expression and inflammasome activation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We observed that 4-PBA exerted no influence on the expression of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; in <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected BMDMs, which suggested that ERS-induced IL-1&#x003b2; production was not dependent on the expression of the precursor, but the activation of the inflammasome. However, in <italic>M. bovis</italic>-infected lung tissue, ERS inhibitor significantly decreased pro-IL-1&#x003b2; expression, which suggested that ERS increased the level of mature IL-1&#x003b2; through precursor generation and the possible activation of the inflammasome. We speculated that these contradictory results might result from the different mechanisms engaged by different cell types. IL-1&#x003b2; may be derived from several cell types such asmacrophages, epithelial cells, and neutrophils) and each cell type may have a partly-overlapping, yet unique, mechanism that mediated ERS and IL-1&#x003b2; production. The induction of ERS in macrophages might trigger IL-1&#x003b2; production through inflammasome activation, but not pro-IL-1&#x003b2; expression, whereas the induction of ERS in other cells might boost mature IL-1&#x003b2; through precursor augment and/or inflammasome assembly.</p><p>Moreover, the effect of 4-PBA on bacillary uptake other than the effect on IL-1&#x003b2; production is worthy of consideration. Although the treatment of 4-PBA did not influence the phagocytosis of BMDMs, other types of phagocytic cells may engage different phagocytosis mechanisms, which require 4-PBA for bacillary uptake. ERS and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion was inhibited by 4-PBA administration; in addition, bacillary uptake and pathological changes also increased in the infected lung tissues. Moreover, several important questions remain unanswered; for example, the nature of the particular mechanism mediating ERS and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion from other cell types <italic>in vivo</italic>; the involvement of ERS in the regulation of bacillary uptake in infected tissues; the role of ERS in the induction of potential inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and IFN-&#x003b2;); and how these cytokines interact to regulate IL-&#x003b2; production and phagocytosis? The development of drug-like ERS inducers in the future may allow us to explore these questions and such drugs may be useful for in anti-tuberculosis therapy.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggested that ERS-induced NLRP3-caspase-8 activation contributed to mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn triggered NLRP3-caspase-1 activation and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion. These findings contribute to the understanding of the innate immune mechanisms during mycobacterial infection and lay the groundwork for the investigation of ERS regulation as a therapeutic strategy for infectious and sterile inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All protocols and procedures were performed according to the Chinese Regulations of Laboratory Animals&#x02014;The Guidelines for the Care of Laboratory Animals (Ministry of Science and Technology of People's Republic of China) and Laboratory Animal Requirements of Environment and Housing Facilities (GB 14925&#x02013;2010, National Laboratory Animal Standardization Technical Committee).
