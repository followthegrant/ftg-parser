By implementation of PHC in rural areas, Iran was one of the leading countries in the world. With all progress in rural areas, little success was achieved in providing primary health care in urban regions and services in the second and third levels faced with numerous challenges and difficulties (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Family Medicine is considered by the WHO as the center of global efforts to improve the quality, effectiveness, equity and reduce the cost of health care systems (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, in order to solve the problems of the referral system, develop PHC in rural areas, implement active services in urban areas and ultimately, greater public benefits, family physician program was adopted by Iran&#x02019;s Islamic Consultative Assembly and implemented in rural and urban areas with a population less than 20000 residents since 2005. Based on numerous studies on family physician programs in rural and urban areas, it seems that after 8 years of implementation in rural areas and 2 years in urban areas in the provinces of Fars and Mazandaran, the program has faced numerous challenges and there are considerable differences with what should have been implemented (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in the provision of health care, is the issue of the day in many countries and new and creative thinking in health promotion (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). PPP is a combination of public and private organizations created to finance and provide health services to increase efficiency and more health (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). One example of successful PPP in the health system is health care cooperatives were designed at the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. They were created in 1998 with cooperation of the Ministry of Cooperatives in order to create a good relationship with the private sector and encourage them to move in line with the government's macroeconomic policies to improve health (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Considering the general policies in the health system transition map in terms of leveling of services, family physician and referral system, changes in the structure, attitudes, and policies towards the use of resources seems inevitable (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Hence, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences framed health complexes for overcoming the existing problems and finding a pathway for realization of UHC and it was implemented in the form of a pilot project in Tabriz suburban area.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This protocol study describe the establishment of new primary health care model in Iran. For the design of Health Complexes (HC), previous experiences of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in commissioning health care cooperatives, national experiences in family physician program and experiences of numerous countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Turkey, Netherland, Sweden, etc. were reviewed and positive aspects of each were extracted. Eventually, the health complex plan was developed with the ultimate goal of universal health coverage promotion, public health promotion and increasing the satisfaction of recipients and providers of health services.</p><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Objectives</title><p>Tabriz Health Complex Project (THCP) was designed in 2013 in the provincial health center of East Azerbaijan and it was implemented with the participation of other departments of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences like: Education affair, Logistic affair, Treatment affair and organization of Iranian health insurance and private sector.</p><p>Specific objectives were as follows: Expanding services coverage, expanding population coverage, expanding financial protection, reforming the structure and procedures to benefit from the resources, modification of the payment methods, improving behavior of health care providers and patients, improving quality of services.</p><p>Therefore, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences as a custodian of health services at the provincial level could create a major change in providing services, accountability to the people within the framework of family physician program, and referral system with a bold mindset change from &#x0201c;governmental service delivery&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;ensuring standard service delivery&#x0201d;.

Monitoring and evaluation are performed through 2 ways: Public oversight and experts&#x02019; evaluation. Public oversight is based on the services expected from the health complexes provided to all families in the form of booklets. The booklet included service type, address for centers, main features of services, customer service flowchart and customer rights.</p><p>Specialized monitoring and evaluation are based on the service packages and the expected standards in the evaluation checklist performed at three steps. The first step includes self-assessment in which staff will assess their services monthly. The second step is the internal evaluation where the management of the center evaluates the health centers every two months. Finally, the third step is the external evaluation performed by experts from district health center in collaboration with the provincial health center every three months. The remaining 30% of per capita will be paid to the health complexes&#x02019; based on the results of external evaluation. Internal evaluation is done by observers in the health complex. In each complex, there are 3&#x02013;4 supervisors who received training on the monitoring and service processes. External evaluation is carried out by the supervisor of the Tabriz health center.</p></sec><sec><title>Financing</title><p>In order to better manage the financial resources, avoidance of multiplicity in financial decisions and standardization of payments, all credits of insurance organizations and the Ministry of Health will be pooled in the same fund and administered by provincial policy and executive committee.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tabriz Health Complex Project with a unique structure is a strategy to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and establishment of reformed family physician program (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The highlight features of THCP that contributed in improvement of the health care system and solving the major problems of the current PHC system (Increased out of pocket payments, lack of providing comprehensive services, false policy making and etc.) are as follows:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Baseline evaluations with taking account a control group is one important feature of health complexes. The community-based evaluation was used for assessing health complexes. In other words, all people should inform about provided services by health complex in order to ask for the required services. The content of monitoring and evaluation are as follows: client satisfaction, employee satisfaction, quantity and quality of services at all levels, medication, paraclinical, compliance with clinical guidelines, and referrals. Improving public-private partnership and participation of the private sector in the provision of primary health care (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Actually, changing the direction of university from service delivery to ensure optimal service delivery. In India, one of the important reform strategies was collaborating with the private sector in the form of PPP. In the health sector, the PPP, as a social entity, pools the best features of the two merging authorities of government and private sectors already shown their potential for accountability (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Suitable, transparent and coordinated communication between different levels of services by establishing appropriate and responsive referral system; therefore, participation and commitment of three levels of services are provided to improve quality and deliver all society needed services.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Providing a comprehensive package of services at different levels (education, research and services) as well as development of the service packages (including health promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation) to all defined population with concentrated financial support. Therefore, governments have been asked to move toward increasing the coverage of services, increasing coverage of people and reducing out of pocket payments (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient detection and basic visits are important aspects of this intervention. According to determined service packages, responsibility and accountability are also increasing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Developing a comprehensive electronic health file, health record and report system are the other characteristics of THCP. Electronic health records and reporting systems used in many developed countries (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), leads to many benefits, including fast, convenient and effective referrals, safer clinical data transmission, not missing referral papers during transfer, receiving a standard set of data on each patient, easy access to general practitioners, logistic and support system for general practitioners and managers, improving the quality of referred information because of more readable and more completed information, integrated system with existing family practice systems and improving patient safety and quality of care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Establishing a systemic thinking and integrated stewardship in health system are other important aspects of health system reform. In the other words, administrative roles of health system such as supervision, monitoring, evaluation, delegation, coordination and etc. could be transferred from district to regional authorities and service purchasing from public/private sector.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The reform of provider payment methods (mixed payment method) and establishing a pay for performance system (pay for care of each condition in the right way, not necessarily the same way for all conditions (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and strategic purchasing of services are other important features. With strategic purchasing of basic health services, limited health resources are used to provide maximum efficiency in the health system. Fairness in distribution of health care is possible, resources are targeted, quality of health services is improved, payment methods be reformed, demand (especially in the field of medicine and laboratory services) is managed, and induced demand and out of pocket payments are reduced (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Social Emergency Referral System (SERS) and control of social factors are provided in this system. Nowadays, more than 9% of the total population of East-Azerbaijan Province are in the elderly age group. They have specific health care needs and require planning and implementation of specific health care programs. In THCP, some health centers are selected as &#x0201c;Elderly friend centers&#x0201d;. These centers work in the field of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the elderly, with the aim of increasing the social living conditions of this group and use of their valuable experiences and capabilities.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Specific attention to Non-communicable disease (NCDs) and chronic disease is another specification of THCP. Since the non-communicable diseases had the greatest burden in recent years (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), we created a surveillance and care system for selected chronic diseases (heart disease, chronic respiratory, depression and anxiety, diabetes, hypertension). Moreover, physiological risk factors such as blood sugar disorders, BMI, lipid profile and behavioral risk factors like nutrition, alcohol and smoking, physical activity and unsafe sex are monitored and controlled.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Empowerment of managers and staff of health complexes in relation to regional health management is very important strength of THCP. In this area, continuous training offered to providers about management of health data, monitoring, planning, quality improvement, epidemiology, research, and other required educations.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Besides the strengths, this new system has some limitations and weakness taken into consideration as follows: Resistance of some organizations and authorities in primary steps of project that needed to doubled efforts by research members and holding multiple meetings with all stakeholders (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Health complex is effective and efficient model of public-private participation and practical solution to address many of the problems in the primary care system of the country. The project can organize the PHC system and family medicine program and realize the national vision of 20 years in the health sector (benefiting the health, welfare, food security, dignity and rights of human beings).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical issues (Including plagiarism, informed consent, misconduct, data fabrication and/or falsification, double publication and/or submission, redundancy, etc.) have been completely observed by the authors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank the East Azarbaijan Provincial Health Center, Tabriz Health Services Management Research Center at Tabriz University of Medical Sciences and Eastern Azerbaijan Governor General for financial support.
