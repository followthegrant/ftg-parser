Only cases of isolated supraspinatus tears with retraction of less than 3 cm were included in this series. The PRP used was obtained by apheresis. It was applied on liquid consistency in its activated form, with the addition of autologous thrombin. Patients were evaluated after 12 months of the surgical procedure. The Constant-Murley, UCLA and VAS scales were used, and the retear rate was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: Fourteen patients were evaluated (14 shoulders). The mean Constant-Murley score was 45.64 &#x000b1; 12.29 before the operation and evolved to 80.78 &#x000b1; 13.22 after the operation (p &#x0003c; 0.001). The UCLA score increased from 13.78 &#x000b1; 5.66 to 31.43 &#x000b1; 3.9 (p &#x0003c; 0.001). The patients&#x02019; pain level decreased from a median of 7.5 (p25% = 6, p75% = 8) to 0.5 (p25% = 0, p75% = 3) (p = 0.0013) according to the VAS score. None of the patients presented complete retear. Three patients (21.4%) showed partial retear, without transfixation. Only one patient developed complications (adhesive capsulitis). Conclusion: Patients submitted to arthroscopic rotator cuff repair augmented with PRP showed significant functional improvement and none of them had complete retearing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Rotator Cuff</kwd><kwd>Plaletet-Rich Plasma, Arthroscopy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Tears of the rotator cuff have a high prevalence in the general population<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(1)</sup></xref>.

Two studies did not show any difference between groups<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. However, a lower index of rerupture<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(24)</sup></xref> and better functional results<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(22)</sup></xref> have been evidenced with the use of PRP. The PRP preparation and application methodology has also been controversial<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(25)</sup></xref>, and none of the previously published studies evaluated the efficacy of the compound obtained by apheresis and applied in its activated form, with the addition of thrombin. The objective of this study is to evaluate the functional results and the index of rerupture for arthroRRC with the use of PRP, and to describe the technique for its preparation and application.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>We conducted a prospective case series evaluating the result of arthroRRC combined with the use of PRP in patients with an isolated rupture of the supraspinatus tendon with less than 3 cm of retraction. The research protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the institution, and all patients signed an informed consent form. The procedures were performed by the same surgeon and at the same institution (IOT-HCFMUSP) during the period of September 2008 to March 2011.</p><sec id="cesec30"><title>Selection of subjects</title><p>The inclusion criteria were complete rupture of the supraspinatus tendon with less than 3 cm retraction and lack of rupture of the subscapularis and infraspinatus, confirmed by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (preMRI); failure of conservative therapy performed for at least three months; fatty degeneration of RC muscle lower than Goutallier grade 2; absence of glenohumeral osteoarthritis or rotator cuff arthropathy; platelet concentration greater than or equal to 150,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; absence of coagulopathy or chronic use of anticoagulants; skeletally mature, with no age limits; absence of psychiatric disorders, fibromyalgia, painful cervical spine disorders, un-compensated clinical comorbidities, active or recent infection; absence of fractures or previous surgery in the affected shoulder.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were intraoperative observation of rupture of the tendon of the subscapularis or infraspinatus requiring repair, or supraspinatus tears with retraction greater than 3 cm; lesions not amenable to complete repair; patients who did not undergo postoperative clinical evaluations.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>PRP Collection</title><p>A Haemonetics MCS+ 9000<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> cell separator and a 994-CFE apheresis-specific set (Haemonetics Corp., MA, USA) were used to prepare the PRP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Approximately 400 mL of blood were drained to a device for separation under 5800RPM continuous centrifugation for 15 minutes through a peripheral access. Sodium citrate was used as an anticoagulant at a ratio of 1 ml for every 9 ml of blood. In this device, after the separation of blood components by density gradient, an optical analyzer identified the platelet layer by its refraction characteristics and separated it into a sterile collection bag, obtaining about 30 ml of PRP. The remaining blood was returned to the patient by the same venous access, resulting in no loss of the other blood components.</p><p>Ten milliliters of PRP plus 400 mm<sup>3</sup> of 10% calcium chloride were used for the formation of thrombin from an autologous source, which was used with the activator of the coagulation cascade. After gel formed in the sample, the supernatant, which was rich in thrombin, was collected.</p><p>The material necessary for the subsequent application of PRP in its activated form was packaged in syringes: two aliquots of PRP (10 mL each) and two fractions of thrombin and 10% calcium chloride (1.5 and 0.8 mL each, respectively) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The entire collection procedure was performed after anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Rotator cuff repair</title><p>The patients were operated in the beach chair position under general anesthesia combined with an interscalene block. Bursectomy, acromioplasty, and coracoacromial ligament release were performed in all cases, as well as cruentation of the greater tubercle. No patient underwent resection of the distal clavicle.</p><p>The tendon of the long head of the biceps was approached through tenodesis when it presented instability, partial lesions larger than 50% or insertional lesions (SLAP lesions) types 3 and 4. Tenodesis was performed using one of the more anterior ends of the anchor wire used in RCR through a single stitch fixing the supraspinatus tendon together with the long head of the biceps. The RC was repaired with 5-mm bioabsorbable anchors doubly loaded with high strength wires. Tendon-tendon sutures were performed when necessary.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Application of PRP</title><p>The technique for applying the PRP was based on a study by Randelli et al<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(20)</sup></xref>. Upon completion of the RCR, suture of the arthroscopic portals was performed except the posterior portal, which was maintained for visualization. A number 14 long needle was then introduced through the skin, and not by one of the previously created portals. The position of needle insertion was located at a point between the anterior and the lateral portals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The needle tip was then positioned in the tendon and bone interface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The saline infusion was then closed and the remaining liquid in the subacromial space was aspirated, while maintaining visualization. The platelet concentrate was then applied. Each 10 ml of PRP collected was mixed with 1.5 ml of autologous thrombin and 0.8 ml of 10% calcium chloride and injected in liquid form through the previously placed needle. During this phase, an assistant obstructed the already sutured portals with their fingers to minimize leakage of the injected material (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Five minutes after the application, the assistant ceased to block the portals and the posterior portal was sutured in the same way as the others.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Postoperative care</title><p>Immobilization with mesh Velpeau was maintained for a total of six weeks, and in the first three weeks no movements were performed with the shoulder.

The comparison between pre- and post-surgical scores on the Constant-Murley and UCLA scales can be seen in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Only one patient developed clinical complication (adhesive capsulitis). There were no cases of infection or allergic reaction.</p><p>A curved acromion occurred in 11 patients (78.6%). Hooked and flat acromions were observed in two (14.3%) patients and one (7.1%) patient, respectively.</p><p>Regarding the pattern of injury, five (35.7%) were &#x0201c;C&#x0201d;, five (35.7%) were &#x0201c;L&#x0201d;, and four (28.6%) were &#x0201c;V&#x0201d;. The subscapularis tendon was intact in 12 (85.7%). In the other two cases, there was a partial joint injury that did not require repair. Tenodesis of the long head of the biceps was performed in two patients (14.3%). In the other cases the biceps was intact.</p><p>An anchor was used in 10 patients (71.4%), and two anchors were used in four (28.6%). Two patients (14.3%) received additional tendon-tendon sutures.

Among the comparative studies evaluating the use of PRP in arthroRRC, three did not observe any clinical difference between the groups<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Randelli et al.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(22)</sup></xref>, however, note less pain in the first month and better evaluations according to the Constant-Murley scale at the end of the third month in cases that used PRP in their report. Evaluating a subgroup of patients with small- and medium-sized tears, they observed that those with the addition of PRP performed better in all functional scales at the end of the first quarter, and significantly better values for the Constant-Murley scale at 12 months and external rotational strength at three, six, 12 and 24 months.</p><p>With respect to structural integrity, we observed that all the comparative studies on the effect of PRP in arthroRRC<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> demonstrated a lower incidence of rerupture with the use of platelet concentrate. However, only Barber et al<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(24)</sup></xref> observed a statistically significant difference between groups. Evaluating only isolated ruptures of the supraspinatus smaller than 3cm, Castricini et al<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(21)</sup></xref> found only one rerupture in 40 patients (2.5%). Randelli et al.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(22)</sup></xref> analyzed a subgroup of patients with small and medium-sized tears, and observed reruptures in 14% of patients.

Our study did not show any complete reruptures, which was an inferior result to studies using PRP<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> as well as those that did not use PRP<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. It is worth noting that we performed the MRI at 12 months postoperatively, a time earlier than that of other publications<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Furthermore, we evaluated only isolated lesions of the supraspinatus with less than 3 cm retraction, unlike other authors, who have included large and extensive ruptures in their evaluations<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>.</p><p>There is great heterogeneity in the methods of obtaining PRP described in literature, and they are divided into two groups: apheresis<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(26)</sup></xref> and centrifugation<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(27)</sup></xref>. The apheresis method employed in this study presents higher platelet levels and lower leukocyte concentrations<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(28)</sup></xref>, as the PRP obtained in this manner is considered more pure<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(25)</sup></xref>. Centrifugation, currently used by most companies, has the advantages of having a lower cost and requiring simpler materials<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(27)</sup></xref>. Among the arthroRRC studies, only Jo et al<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(23)</sup></xref> used PRP obtained by apheresis.</p><p>The manner of applying the PRP varies between studies. We used concentrated liquid form, as described by Randelli et al<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(20)</sup></xref> and subsequently used by Randelli et al<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(22)</sup></xref> in their clinical trial. Other authors, however, use the PRP in gel form, and push it along the anchor wires prior to suturing<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. We believe that this method can lead to loss of GF and parts of the clot, as it is performed with saline infusion, unlike the form used by us, in which the application is performed after closing the infusion, at the end of the procedure. Among the advantages of the application in a solid consistency, we can cite the fact that the PRP can conceivably be placed effectively between the tendon and bone, unlike what occurs with the liquid consistency, in which the PRP spreads through the subacromial space, even when positioning the needle at the tendon-bone interface.</p><p>Another source of confusion and heterogeneity between the studies is the application of concentrate that is activated or not. In our study, we use the PRP that has been activated by the addition of thrombin and calcium chloride. Mazzucco et al<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(29)</sup></xref> and Han et al<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(30)</sup></xref> describe that the activation of PRP with thrombin leads to an immediate release of GF, and that a slower and more prolonged release could increase the beneficial effects of PRP. Moreover, Virchenko et al<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(31)</sup></xref> show that the use of thrombin increases the effectiveness of PRP in tendon repair. Only two studies<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> have used thrombin, and the other authors have applied non-activated PRP<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Our study is unique in that it evaluates the use of PRP in arthroRRC using material obtained by apheresis and applied with the addition of thrombin.</p><p>A Haemonetics MCS+ 9000<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> cell separator and a 994-CFE apheresis-specific set (Haemonetics Corp., MA, USA) were used to prepare the PRP. This same method was used in two other studies performed at our institution<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, and has proven to be effective in obtaining high platelet concentrations. O'Neil<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(32)</sup></xref> and de Almeida et al<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>(14)</sup></xref> observed an average concentration of 1,420,000 and 1,185,166 platelets/mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Thus, we chose not to measure the number of platelets in our study.</p><p>We can cite the small sample, clinical follow-up of only 12 months, and a non-comparative design as the main limitations of the study. A prospective randomized clinical trial is currently being conducted at our institution, with which we hope to get more consistent answers about the real effectiveness of the method. Clinical and MRI evaluation in all patients at the end of the follow-up time conducted in a standardized way are favorable points, besides addressing a homogeneous sample, with strict inclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec id="cesec150"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Patients undergoing arthroRRC associated with the use of PRP showed a significant functional improvement and no cases of complete
