During this process, the maximum imbalance in the active microbial fraction occurred later (day 14) than the greatest change in the total microbial fraction, which reached a minimum biodiversity and richness on day 11; additionally, major metabolic changes occurred at day 6. Gut bacteria respond to ABs early by activating systems to avoid the antimicrobial effects of the drugs, while &#x02018;presumptively&#x02019; attenuating their overall energetic metabolic status and the capacity to transport and metabolise bile acid, cholesterol, hormones and vitamins; host&#x02013;microbial interactions significantly improved after treatment cessation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This proof-of-concept study provides an extensive description of gut microbiota responses to follow-up &#x003b2;-lactam therapy.

Accordingly, the human colon can be viewed as an anaerobic bioreactor in which trillions of microorganisms add a vast catalogue of genes to the genetic resources of the host to provide complementary metabolic pathways for energy harvest, food digestion, detoxification, the production of bioactive compounds and the assimilation of otherwise inaccessible dietary nutrients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3 R4 R5">1&#x02013;5</xref> Recent studies have shown that each individual harbours a unique and relatively stable gut microbiota, generally dominated (over 90%) by the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, in addition to minorities of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, the majority of which have not yet been isolated or characterised.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> However, this well engaged bacterial machinery can be disrupted by external factors such as antibiotic (AB) treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7 R8 R9">7&#x02013;9</xref> AB therapy has been successfully used for many years to treat bacterial infections, but the emergence of AB-resistant bacteria has caused enormous public health problems. Moreover, resistant species can persist in the human gut for years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>

</p><p>AB therapies affect not only the target microorganism but also the host-associated microbial communities, particularly those in the intestine. In recent years, the effects of distinct ABs on the gut microbiota have been evaluated, primarily by 16S rRNA analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>

</p><p>The understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms underlying functional changes in the microbiome in response to AB treatments remains limited, primarily because most research to date has relied on indirect evidence from DNA-based approaches that fail to provide information on actual gene expression, protein synthesis and metabolite composition and variation. Moreover, no integrated metatranscriptomic, metaproteomic or metametabolomic surveys on AB-treated human microbiota have been performed. Specifically, in the gut ecosystem, few studies have focused on metatranscriptomics. Turnbaugh <italic>et al</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> focused on gene expression analysis in faecal samples from a monozygotic twin pair, whereas Booijnk <italic>et al</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> and Gosalbes <italic>et al</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> studied the faecal metatranscriptomes of healthy volunteers using cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism and pyrosequencing, respectively. Proteomic platforms have also been used to separate and identify thousands of proteins in faecal samples from healthy individuals,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21 R22 R23 R24">21&#x02013;24</xref> but these analyses have not uncovered the effect of ABs on the stability or expression of core proteins or their functions. Finally, metabolic changes in mouse&#x02014;but not human&#x02014;gut microbiota following treatment with the broad-spectrum AB enrofloxacin were recently evaluated using nuclear magnetic resonance based metabolomics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> However, this study yielded limited information because the faecal samples were only analysed for changes in eight metabolites, including increased levels of amino acids and urea caused by the loss of microbial proteases and ureases, and reduced levels of acetate, butyrate and propionate generated by lactate-using bacteria.</p><p>In this study, we provide the first report of AB-treatment related changes in the faecal microbiota, including the total microbiota, active microbiota, metagenome, metatranscriptome, metametabolome and metaproteome. This multi-omics approach yielded a global picture of the microbial community structure and the metabolic status of the gut ecosystem, which is paramount to understanding the total effect of a given AB and to establishing correlations with host physiology. This study of one patient constitutes a proof of concept for this approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Fresh faecal samples were collected from a patient who had not taken ABs within the previous 3&#x02005;months. The patient (a 68-year-old man) was admitted to the Department for Internal Medicine at the University Hospital Kiel (Germany) due to an infected cardiac pacemaker. A clinical examination identified inflamed skin and subcutaneous tissue around the pacemaker, and laboratory findings revealed an elevated C-reactive protein level (CRP 19.7&#x02005;mg/litre; normal value &#x0003c;8&#x02005;mg/litre) and a full blood count within normal ranges. The patient did not present any intestinal disorders. The pacemaker had been placed to treat the patient's sick sinus syndrome, first diagnosed in 1994. His cardiovascular risk factors were arterial hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient was regularly taking amlodipine, ramipril, hydrochlorothiazide and glimepiride on a daily basis and Marcumar according to his international normalised ratio values. AB therapy was initiated with a combined intravenous therapy of ampicillin/sulbactam and cefazolin on the day of admission as a single dose and continued with intravenous cefazolin alone for the next 14&#x02005;days. The patient's CRP level returned to normal within 1&#x02005;week after the beginning of AB therapy. Faecal samples were collected on the day of admission, prior to AB treatment (day 0, FS-0), on days 3, 6, 11 and 14 of AB treatment (FS-3, FS-6, FS-11 and FS-14, respectively) and 40&#x02005;days after AB therapy (FS-40). Fresh faeces were collected, frozen immediately and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further processing. Informed consent was obtained from the patient, and the study was approved by the Ethical Board of the Medical Faculty of the Christian-Albrecht-University, Kiel, Germany. The patient provided written informed consent. Full descriptions of the materials and methods used for the following are available in the Materials and Methods in the online supplement: nucleic acid and RNA extraction; 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA sequencing; metagenome sequencing; mRNA purification, amplification and sequencing; metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis; protein extraction, separation and identification and data processing; and metabolite extraction, separation and identification and data processing.

In the first days of treatment, the majority of the total microbiota comprised species from the phylum Firmicutes, with the exception of FS-11 (11 days after AB treatment), which exhibited a remarkable shift towards Bacteroidetes (<italic>Parabacteroides</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> genera) and a significant increase in Betaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2012303184F1">figure 1</xref> and figure 1 in online supplement). The Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families constituted the most abundant taxa on days 3 and 6 of AB treatment. Meanwhile, the Firmicutes represented the most abundant active phylum in most samples. However, the shift towards the Bacteroidetes was even more distinct and occurred later, at the 14th day (FS-14) of AB treatment, among the active bacteria, with the <italic>Parabacteroides</italic> genus (74%) being the predominant taxa.</p><fig id="GUTJNL2012303184F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Total and active bacterial composition based on 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA analyses, respectively, in the follow-up study.

The FS-40 sample corresponds to the materials collected 40&#x02005;days after cessation of the AB treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gutjnl-2012-303184f01"/></fig><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2012303184F1">figure 1</xref>, there was a general tendency towards the restoration of the original (day 0) untreated total and active bacterial composition at 40&#x02005;days after cessation of the AB treatment. However, certain taxa, such as Actinobacteria (<italic>Slackia</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> genera), Betaproteobacteria (<italic>Gemmiger</italic> genus), Streptococcaceae (<italic>Streptococcus</italic> genus), Lachnospiraceae (<italic>Roseburia</italic> genus), Porphyromonadaceae (<italic>Barnesiella</italic> genus) and Clostridiales (<italic>Eubacterium</italic> and <italic>Subdoligranulum</italic> genera) were lost. The heat map and clustering analysis (see figure 1 in online supplement) results support the restoration of the microbiota because untreated samples clustered together regardless of whether we considered the total bacterial composition or the active bacterial composition. The results of a correspondence analysis of the relative abundance of each taxon in the total and active microbiota fractions are shown in figure 2 in the online supplement. Approximately 55.90% of the total variation can be bundled in two axes (CA1 and CA2), each of which contributed a similar degree of variation. CA1, bundling 23.81% of the variation, indicates how divergent a given sample is from the average abundance of taxa, whereas CA2, bundling 22.09% of the variation, clearly differentiates the composition of the total (DNA) and active (RNA) microbiota.

Thus, the aims of this study were as follows: to provide a proof of concept for an integrated workflow to assess the nature of such changes in the intestines of patients undergoing AB treatment at the structural and functional levels; and to evaluate whether there is a relationship between these types of changes. For instance, changes in the total composition at a given time point may also be associated with changes in the AB-resistant bacteria, although not necessarily at the same moment or during the same interval. Two major active factors that modulate changes in the microbiota should be considered. First, it is important to understand how AB treatment determines the emergence of bacterial species that are resistant to &#x003b2;-lactams (such as ampicillin and cephalosporins) and how the microbiota recovers once ABs have been removed. Second, the speed at which such changes are observed according to the different levels under consideration should be carefully evaluated.</p><p>In our study, we demonstrated that the greatest change in the active microbial fraction occurred later (day 14) than that in the total microbial fraction, which reached a minimum biodiversity and richness on the 11th day of AB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2012303184F1">figure 1</xref>). Further, oscillatory population dynamics were observed (at both the DNA and RNA levels). An early reduction in Gram-negative bacteria at day 6 and an overall collapse in diversity was followed by possible colonisation of the upper gut by naturally resistant Bacteroidetes by day 11, a consequent increase in the colonisation of the lower gut with dominance at 11&#x02013;14 days and eventual re-growth of the Gram-positive bacteria at day 14. Various studies based on 16S rDNA analysis revealed important variability in the recovery of the baseline bacterial composition after AB therapy depending on the individual and the AB used (type and dose).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> The large fluctuations in the relative abundances of the various bacterial taxa for the total and active microbiota throughout the follow-up study were most likely associated with an additive effect of ampicillin/sulbactam and the first-generation cephalosporin cefazolin as well as the widespread development of &#x003b2;-lactamases (for details, see the Discussion in the online supplement).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
</p><p>The apparent oscillations in the population dynamics were shown to further influence the biodiversity and richness of metabolites and active proteins; these changes, some of which may play essential roles in protection against ABs (for details, see the Discussion in the online supplement), may also have important ecological implications. In our study, we observed a drastic shift 6&#x02005;days after the onset of AB treatment, at which time the predominantly active taxa were mainly members of the Streptococcaceae, Clostridiaceae and Bacteroidaceae, and at 40&#x02005;days after the end of AB treatment, when the most abundant active bacteria were members of the Burkholderiaceae (Proteobacteria phylum). Thus, these bacteria may have contributed to the distinct functional profiles and metabolic statuses of colonic bacteria during the follow-up therapy.</p><p>A notable finding in this study was that protein expression appeared to decrease as a consequence of AB treatment; furthermore, the production of proteins needed for glycolysis, pyruvate decarboxylation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glutamate metabolism, iron uptake, GTP hydrolysis and translation termination were enhanced at the initial stages of AB treatment (day 6), most likely to cope with an intermittent nutrient supply and the stress caused by the ABs, but decreased at later stages and after treatment cessation. Together, these results suggest for first time that AB treatment may &#x02018;presumptively&#x02019; negatively affect the overall metabolic status of the colonic space (for an example, see the Discussion in the online supplement), although further studies may be required to further confirm this hypothesis. Additionally, the expression levels of all the genes belonging to the &#x02018;mobile and extrachromosomal element functions&#x02019; category were decreased during treatment, and all of them were associated with clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). These genes encode a system that functions as a type of bacterial adaptive &#x02018;immune&#x02019; response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> Specifically, the genes that belong to the CRISPR/Cas system are involved in protecting cells from invasion by foreign DNA (viruses and plasmids) through an RNA-interference-like process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> Thus, the decreases in the expression of these genes may render the bacteria more susceptible to the acquisition of foreign DNA. This could provide an advantage in an AB-containing environment because it increases the likelihood of obtaining resistance genes by horizontal gene transfer.</p><p>Of major metabolic significance was the observation that the production of metabolites that are known to be produced by the host and further metabolised by colonic bacteria, such as derivatives of bile acids, cholesterol and hormones, was altered during the AB treatment and was significantly improved after treatment cessation. In essence, this finding suggests that AB treatment altered the continual interplay between the liver/pancreas and bacterial enzymes operating in the colonic space and that AB therapy may have a positive long-term effect in human biology. This result is consistent with the finding that the biological production of host-beneficial molecules such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and the uptake of key metals such as Co<sup>2+</sup> by colonic bacteria were affected by AB therapy because the expression of genes and proteins associated with those functions was restored after treatment cessation. This is particularly important because it has been demonstrated that the microbiota from the distal guts of different individuals exhibit partial functional redundancy in addition to clear differences in community structure in the absence of ABs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> By contrast, although further experimental evidence is required, our results suggest that the presence of ABs per se may have additional &#x02018;presumptive&#x02019; collapse effects in key metabolic pathways independent of the community structure and that functional replacement events may be affected under AB stress.</p><p>Although, the investigation reported here was for a single patient and should generally be considered qualitative, it constitutes a proof of concept for an integrated, multi-omics approach towards unravelling the dynamics and mechanisms underlying the response of intestinal microbiota to AB treatment. A &#x02018;presumptive&#x02019; model related to the follow-up effects of ABs on bacterial and metabolic composition is summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2012303184F8">figure 8</xref>. These data may help to identify specific strains of gut microbiota with potential benefits in human health or to design specific therapies to decrease intestinal inflammation or normalise dysfunctions of the gut mucosa; for example, minor bacterial taxa such as Proteobacteria have been shown to play a significant, active role in overall gut metabolism and host interaction despite their low number. Further studies investigating different ABs and (un)related individuals are required to better ascertain the link between bacterial producers and the presence of particular proteins and molecules, and the metabolic consequences of AB treatment; this may serve as a promising focus for therapeutic interventions or the treatment of pathogenic infections and diseases.</p><fig id="GUTJNL2012303184F8" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;8</label><caption><p>The &#x02018;presumptive&#x02019; model related to the follow-up effect of antibiotics (ABs) on the microbial and metabolic composition of the human gut. The model is based on the combination of experimental multi-omics data. The biliary excretion of ABs triggers a cascade of metabolic events. At the earlier stages of AB therapy, the bacteria respond by promoting systems to avoid the antimicrobial effects of the drugs (expressing beta-lactamases, antimicrobial peptide transporters and multidrug efflux pumps and producing glycero(lyso)phospholipids&#x02014;G(L)PL) and to cope with an intermittent nutrient supply while decreasing polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production. Genes involved in cell envelope biosynthesis and the degradation of peptidoglycan-like components are increasingly expressed until the end of AB treatment but with a time delay compared with other drug-detoxifying mechanisms. Finally, the bacterial metabolism of the bile acid, hormones and cholesterol synthesised in the liver and pancreas is attenuated by AB therapy, thus possibly affecting entero-hepatic recirculation and systemic lipid metabolism, that is, the emulsification, absorption and transport of dietary fats; however, after treatment cessation, the metabolism of these factors improved significantly. Similarly, the pool of vitamins that are directly synthesised by gut bacteria was significantly improved after treatment cessation. The nutrient supply mechanisms, such as glycolysis, pyruvate decarboxylation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutamate metabolism, and iron uptake, that are induced at earlier stages (day 6) become attenuated during the late stages of the therapy and become significantly attenuated after treatment cessation, suggesting that the entero-hepatic recirculation system may contain a lower amount of iron, sugars, branched amino acids, short organic acids and pyruvate produced or transported by colonic bacteria. At the active bacterial structure level, an apparently oscillatory population dynamic was further observed, with the initially predominant active Bacteroidaceae becoming replaced by Burkholderiaceae after treatment cessation. The broken line indicates the overall trend in each of the gut bacteria components during the follow-up treatment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gutjnl-2012-303184f08"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="loca-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gutjnl-2012-303184-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1069" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Loreto Ferr&#x000fa;s and Manuela Kramp for their excellent laboratory work.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> The authors made the following contributions to the study.
