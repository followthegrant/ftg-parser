As there is an observed increase in prevalence in areas where prevalence was previously low, the global burden of asthma and wheezing, however, continues to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]; with the most significant increase noted among children between one to five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Due to difficulties in demonstrating airflow limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in young children, it is recommended to avoid the term &#x02018;asthma&#x02019; in preschoolers with wheezing and airway inflammatory reactions and to use the term &#x02018;wheezing illnesses&#x02019; instead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Wheezing illnesses affect the health, wellbeing and quality of life of the affected, impose a substantial burden on the family and the healthcare system, and can be particularly troublesome to diagnose and treat, especially when occurring in younger children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As a result they have poorer symptom control and lower quality of life than older children with wheezing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Research evidence on prevalence of wheezing illnesses and associated host or genetic and environmental factors among children of preschool age is sparse in low and low-middle income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">In Sri Lanka in 2012, diseases of the respiratory system were the third leading cause of hospitalization and accounted for 14.4% of deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] among 1,750,912 one to five year olds in the country, which comprises 8.6% of the total population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. According to the Global Burden of Disease study, in 1990, asthma led to 33,000 total years of life lost (YLLs) in the country (involving 1% of the total population) and was ranked as the 23rd cause of YLLs in the country. With a staggering 75% increase, the rank for asthma rose to the 11th position in 2010, with a total of YLLs increasing to 57,000 involving 1.8% of the total population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In Sri Lankan studies, the prevalence and factors associated with asthma and wheezing illnesses have mainly been conducted among children of five to 14&#x000a0;years age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Though statistics indicate a rising trend, there is a dearth of surveys in the younger preschool child.</p><p id="Par13">The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) is a densely populated area of 37.3&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> in a rapidly urbanized location. The estimated resident population is 665,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and a &#x02018;floating population&#x02019; of 400,000&#x02013;500,000 commute daily for employment and education purposes (Colombo Municipal Council Data, 2012, unpublished). The CMC also has the largest concentration of poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] living in designated under-served settlements (USS) situated in and around open sewers, waste disposal sites, and in proximity to industrial plants with toxic emissions and polluted environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Up to date no surveys have been carried out in underserved communities to assess its burden of childhood asthma, wheezing illnesses or associated factors, particularly in children of the preschool age.</p><p id="Par14">In this background, the objective of this article is to present the burden of wheezing illnesses and its associated factors among children aged three to five years living in urban low-income conditions in Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka. As the age category of three to five years and geographically demarcated USS are areas which have hitherto not received much attention of research, this study was carried out to generate new information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par15">This was a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out in the USSs of the CMC from May 2015 to December 2015.</p><p id="Par16">The study populations were children aged three to five years living in households in USS and their caregivers. A child-caregiver pair living in a household in the USS of the CMC where the child was aged three to five years and where the caregiver had been living with the child for one year or more was included. A caregiver was defined as an adult living in the same household who identified herself or himself as the person responsible for the care of that child. Child-caregiver pairs in which the child did not possess the Child Health Development Record (CHDR) and in which the caregivers could not be contacted to be interviewed even after three attempts during the period of data collection were excluded from the study.</p><p id="Par17">The estimated sample size was 460. In the absence of estimates of prevalence of wheezing in children aged three to five years in Sri Lanka, the sample size was calculated based on 34% global prevalence of wheezing in children aged one to five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] using an absolute precision of 5%, a design effect of 1.2 based on literature with a 10% non-response rate. The CMC is subdivided into six &#x02018;districts&#x02019; which are further divided into 47 municipal &#x02018;wards&#x02019;. This study was carried out in two randomly selected &#x02018;districts&#x02019; and in all of the 20 municipal &#x02018;wards&#x02019; of the selected two districts. The study units were selected using cluster sampling method. Each municipal &#x02018;ward&#x02019; formed a cluster and thus there were 20 clusters requiring 23 study units to be drawn from each cluster. Within each cluster, the starting point for the cluster survey was selected by dropping a pin on a detailed road map showing the underserved settlements and selecting the road on which the pin head fell. From the first household on the right hand side of the randomly selected road 23 study units were recruited continuously until the required cluster size was obtained. Only one eligible child-caregiver pair per household was selected and, in houses where there was more than one, random selection was carried out.</p><p id="Par18">Three study instruments were used to collect data in the study: a structured, pre-tested, interviewer-administered questionnaire, a pre-tested observation checklist to facilitate assessment of the indoor and outdoor environment and a data extraction form to note the birth weight and immunization status from the CHDRs of the child selected for the study.</p><p id="Par19">Two pre-intern doctors with previous experience in data collection in the field were recruited for data collection purposes. They were trained on: the objectives of the study, obtaining informed consent from the participants, administering the questionnaire and other study instruments with minimal disturbance of day-to-day activities and on obtaining reliable and accurate data.</p><p id="Par20">The operational definitions of &#x02018;ever-wheezing illness&#x02019; and &#x02018;current-wheezing illness&#x02019; used in the survey were, a physician&#x02019;s diagnosis of wheezing/whistling of the chest in their lifetime and a physician&#x02019;s diagnosis of wheezing/whistling within the past twelve months, respectively.</p><p id="Par21">In operationalizing the variables on potential factors associated with wheezing illness, &#x02018;low birth weight' was defined as a birth weight of less than 2500g. Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) was considered as &#x02018;clean&#x02019; fuel while use of firewood and kerosene were amalgamated together as &#x02018;unclean&#x02019; type of cooking fuel. &#x02018;Unsatisfactory ventilation&#x02019; was considered if there were no openings or having small openings the size of a lid of a standard bottle of jam to the size of a standard brick, in the cooking and sleeping areas. Ventilation was considered as &#x02018;satisfactory&#x02019; if there were windows or exhaust fans. &#x02018;Exposure to pets&#x02019; was defined if there had been cats, dogs or birds in the household for more than twelve months prior to the study. &#x02018;Tendency for mould formation&#x02019; was defined as &#x02018;higher tendency&#x02019; if there was damp walls, leaking roof or both in the household while lower tendency if there were no problems. Either daily or at least four times a week usage of mosquito coils was defined as &#x02018;exposure to irritant smoke from mosquito coils&#x02019;. Use less than four times a week or occasionally used was considered as less exposed. &#x02018;Exposure to vehicular emissions&#x02019; was considered if the house was located either on a main road, or near a by-road with heavy or infrequent traffic. If the house was located in an enclosed locality called &#x0201c;watta&#x0201d; or &#x02018;garden&#x02019; with an access road with no traffic, it was considered less exposed. &#x02018;Exposure to emissions from activities/industries was defined as positive if there were places of work/activities/industry generating emissions located within 150&#x000a0;m from the household.</p><p id="Par22">To find out the history of presence of &#x02018;severe&#x02019; wheezing symptom episodes the following question was included in the questionnaire: &#x02018;has this child ever developed severe symptoms- with marked difficulty in breathing and audible wheezing/ whistling of the chest?&#x02019; For information on episodes with &#x02018;mild&#x02019; symptoms the following question was included in the questionnaire: &#x02018;has this child ever developed mild symptoms- with mild difficulty in breathing with or without wheezing/whistling of the chest?&#x02019;</p><p id="Par23">Prevalence estimates were also estimated for &#x02018;ever wheezing illness&#x02019; and &#x02018;current wheezing illness&#x02019; among children aged three to five years according to age and sex distribution of the children in the study.</p><p id="Par24">All the prevalence estimates are presented along with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Though some researchers have used a modified version of the ISAAC questionnaire adapted to the preschool age and study setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], its validity is not well researched. Furthermore, the present study did not consider preschool wheezing as the same entity as asthma as there is lack of chronicity which is expected in asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

Globally, the prevalence of asthma and wheezing illnesses is higher in the younger children than the older children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Higher estimations could also be attributed to the study setting being urban and underserved.

Of those who had a history of wheezing occurring more than one year ago, a majority had had their wheezing in infancy. Wheezing in infancy is purported to have causal and risk factors which are different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] to the associated factors of wheezing illnesses in late preschool children. The assessment of factors associated in the preceding 12&#x000a0;months gives those which are related more recently to the wheezing illness and hence, useful in preventing exacerbations. Therefore, this information will be useful for healthcare workers of the area in identifying factors that can be modified to avoid exacerbations. In addition, the period of recall is also more likely to be valid and reliable. As the scope of this study was to assess the factors associated with &#x02018;current wheezing illness&#x02019; the analysis was confined to those who had wheezing occurring within the 12&#x000a0;months period prior to the study.</p><p id="Par41">In the present study, introduction of formula milk before six months of age was found to be protective through both bivariate and multivariate analyses.

Furthermore, observation of houses revealed that 91% of households did not have a chimney in the area of cooking. Through bivariate analysis unsatisfactory ventilation in kitchen area was found to be significantly associated with &#x02018;current wheezing&#x02019;.

Time activity studies conducted by Klepeis and others in 2001 show that younger children can spend up to 90% of their time indoors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Thus, the place of cooking combined with the living area, along with lack of chimney can contribute to the development or triggering of wheezing among younger children who spend a greater part of their time indoors. Bed nets as well as soft toys can trap dust particles and thus, trigger wheezing. In the multivariate analysis, playing with soft toys (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.004) and unsatisfactory ventilation in the sleeping area (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) were found to be significantly associated with &#x02018;current wheezing&#x02019; as well.

Interventions should also focus on the indoor environmental factors that were found to be associated with wheezing illnesses, in order to avoid exacerbations.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CHDR</term><def><p id="Par6">Child Health Development Record</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMC</term><def><p id="Par7">Colombo Municipal Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISAAC</term><def><p id="Par8">International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LPG</term><def><p id="Par9">Liquid Petroleum Gas</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USS</term><def><p id="Par10">Under-served settlements</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Authors wish to thank the study participants for their enthusiasm, time and patience.
