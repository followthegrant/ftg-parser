Due to the well-known antibacterial effect of silver ions, materials used for their controlled release have been widely studied for point-of-use water disinfection. However, even if it is in principle known that chloride anions can suppress the antibacterial efficiency of silver, the majority of previous studies, surprisingly, have not focused on chloride concentrations relevant for freshwaters and thus for practical applications. Here, we prepared low-cost nanocellulose-aluminium oxyhydroxide nanocomposites functionalized with silver nanoparticles. Field samples obtained from Chennai, India were used as a guideline for choosing relevant chloride concentrations for the antibacterial studies, i.e., 10, 90, and 290 ppm. The antibacterial performance of the material against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> was demonstrated and the influence of chloride concentration on the antibacterial effect was studied with <italic>E. coli</italic>. A 1&#x02009;h contact time led to bacterial reductions of 5.6 log<sub>10</sub>, 2.9 log<sub>10</sub>, and 2.2 log<sub>10</sub>, respectively. This indicates that an increase of chloride concentration leads to a substantial reduction of antibacterial efficiency, even within chloride concentrations found in freshwaters. This work enables further insights for designing freshwater purification systems that utilize silver-releasing materials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Sustainability</kwd><kwd>Antimicrobials</kwd><kwd>Nanoscale materials</kwd><kwd>Organic-inorganic nanostructures</kwd><kwd>Synthesis and processing</kwd><kwd>Materials chemistry</kwd><kwd>Nanocomposites</kwd><kwd>Chemistry</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Business Finland</institution></funding-source><award-id>1203/31/2016</award-id><award-id>1203/31/2016</award-id><award-id>1203/31/2016</award-id><award-id>1203/31/2016</award-id><award-id>1203/31/2016</award-id><award-id>1203/31/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehtonen</surname><given-names>Janika</given-names></name><name><surname>Hassinen</surname><given-names>Jukka</given-names></name><name><surname>Honkanen</surname><given-names>Riina</given-names></name><name><surname>Kettunen</surname><given-names>Anu</given-names></name><name><surname>Pahimanolis</surname><given-names>Nikolaos</given-names></name><name><surname>Ikkala</surname><given-names>Olli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>307332</award-id><award-id>307332</award-id><award-id>307332</award-id><award-id>307332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehtonen</surname><given-names>Janika</given-names></name><name><surname>Hassinen</surname><given-names>Jukka</given-names></name><name><surname>Rojas</surname><given-names>Orlando J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ikkala</surname><given-names>Olli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Waterborne diseases caused by micro-organisms are a major cause of death worldwide and a grand challenge remains to find sustainable solutions for their control and elimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The need for affordable, efficient, eco-friendly, and easily applicable technologies for removing micro-organisms is urgent. Point-of-use (POU) water treatment is often used when drinking water is retrieved from untreated natural sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> where centralized water treatment facilities are not available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Chlorine treatment is a generic method for household water disinfection, but the formation of toxic byproducts makes it problematic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, resulting in a need for alternative methods. Nanotechnology and especially nanoparticles have been studied as a possible solution to challenges related to water disinfection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The use of silver as an antibacterial agent dates back already to the first century BC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Nowadays, nanosilver is used in a variety of consumer products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and these products are generally based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) that can be produced by chemical reduction of silver salts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Several different materials containing silver in its colloidal form, particularly nanoparticles, have been studied for POU water treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Chitosan cryogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, cellulosic material such as paper filters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, alginate beads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, ceramic cubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and filters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, poly (sodium acrylate) cryogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and cotton textiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> loaded with AgNPs have been demonstrated for POU water treatment. However, research in the field still involves subtleties of e.g. controlling the concentration of released silver ions and the economic feasibility of the materials.</p><p id="Par3">A low-cost material based on chitosan and aluminium oxyhydroxide embedded with AgNPs has previously been developed for a gravity-driven filtration unit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Inspired by that work, and to improve the economic feasibility of the product, we synthesized and characterized a composite material comprising of commercially available cationic cellulose nanofibrils (cCNF) and aluminium oxyhydroxide, which can retain AgNPs. Nanocellulose, including cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), is a renewable high strength nanoscopic material with interesting properties such as relatively high aspect ratio and broad range of easily applicable chemical modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, making it, e.g., an attractive reinforcing component for nanocomposites. CNFs are commonly prepared by mechanical treatments combined with chemical treatments and the resulting nanofibrils have lateral dimension in the order of 5&#x02013;50&#x02009;nm, depending on the source and preparation method. The chemical modification results in functionalization of the fibrils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, as for example in this work, with cationic quaternary ammonium groups. Importantly, cCNF was chosen as the starting material instead of unmodified CNF due to its inherent antibacterial properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, thus further promoting the intended function of the composite material. The fabricated materials act as carriers for the AgNPs and release Ag<sup>+</sup> when brought into contact with water.</p><p id="Par4">The mechanism of action of AgNPs for causing antibacterial effect is not yet fully understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, there is consensus that the oxidation of metallic silver to silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>) is required for achieving an antibacterial effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, although nanoparticle-specific effects have also been considered as one cause of toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. AgNPs have been shown to be non-toxic to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> when conducting tests under strictly anaerobic conditions, where Ag<sup>+</sup> release is precluded, thus suggesting that antibacterial activity of AgNPs would solely be due to Ag<sup>+</sup> release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Factors affecting the release kinetics of Ag<sup>+</sup> from AgNPs include size of particles, temperature, shape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, the surface ligand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and the composition of the surrounding medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Silver ions can form complexes with different anions commonly present in freshwaters, thereby reducing the amount of free Ag<sup>+</sup> in water. Chloride concentration ([Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>]) has been recognized as a significant factor decreasing the antibacterial performance of silver ions due to the low solubility product of AgCl. In addition, complexation with e.g. sulfide and organic matter in freshwaters can result in decrease of free Ag<sup>+</sup> concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In freshwaters, [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] can vary significantly. Still, this factor has not been properly considered when investigating the efficiency of silver-releasing materials for POU water purification. An objective of this study was first to screen realistic chloride concentrations relevant for applications and then to explore the effect of salinity in simulated freshwaters and more specifically, [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>], on the antibacterial effect of the composites on <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a bacterium typically used as a biological indicator of drinking water safety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> was also used as a reference for a gram-positive model bacterium.</p><p id="Par6">Unfortunately, the antibacterial tests of silver-releasing materials in laboratory conditions are often conducted in solutions with [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] irrelevant to freshwaters in rural areas. The tests are often performed in very low [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>], such as highly diluted buffer solution or deionized water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, or very high [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] such as undiluted PBS buffer where [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] is typically around 5000 ppm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. When silver concentration is high, charged silver polychloride complexes are formed, which can contribute to the antibacterial activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Additionally, several studies where the influence of [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] on AgNP toxicity has been considered, do not use [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] occurring in freshwaters as a basis for choosing the studied conditions, resulting in studies with low concentrations such as 12.5 ppm and high concentrations such as around 5000 ppm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Therefore, the fact that [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] can vary significantly in freshwater sources and that this can affect silver-based water disinfection is the main issue we highlight in this work.</p><p id="Par7">In this work, we used simulated freshwaters with [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] in the range relevant to possible rural drinking water sources. Two different contact times (1&#x02009;h and 2&#x02009;h) between the composite and water were used. First, the antibacterial activity against <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was compared and tests were continued with <italic>E. coli</italic> to study the influence of [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>] on the antibacterial activity. Silver release from the composite as a function of time was also studied. Finally, based on our observations, we give an evaluation of the potential of the composites for use in water disinfection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization</title><p id="Par8">The cCNF (see Methods) was provided by Betulium Ltd. and was first imaged by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

It should also be noted that the experiment was conducted within two weeks after the preparation of the material. The antibacterial activity of the material was found to decrease during long-term storage of the composite in ambient conditions, which is likely explained by the oxidation of AgNPs over time leading to passivation of the AgNP surfaces.
