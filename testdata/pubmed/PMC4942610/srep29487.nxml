While highly efficacious directly-acting antiviral agents have been developed in recent years, their high costs and relative inaccessibility make their use limited. Here, we describe new 1-(&#x003c9;-phenoxyalkyl)uracils bearing acetanilide fragment in 3 position of pyrimidine ring as potential antiviral drugs against HCV. Using a combination of various biochemical assays and <italic>in vitro</italic> virus infection and replication models, we show that our compounds are able to significantly reduce viral genomic replication, independently of virus genotype, with their IC<sub>50</sub> values in the nanomolar range. We also demonstrate that our compounds can block <italic>de novo</italic> RNA synthesis and that effect is dependent on a chemical structure of the compounds. A detailed structure-activity relationship revealed that the most active compounds were the N<sup>3</sup>-substituted uracil derivatives containing 6-(4-bromophenoxy)hexyl or 8-(4-bromophenoxy)octyl fragment at N<sup>1</sup> position.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) has infected 150 million people worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. It has the propensity to cause chronic infection in the majority of individuals that can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is estimated that HCV causes from 350,000 to 500,000 deaths each year, representing a significant health problem.</p><p>HCV is a positive single-strand RNA virus, belonging to the <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> genus in the family <italic>Hepaciviridae</italic>. Its genome is ~9.6&#x02009;Kb long encoding a single polyprotein of 3000 amino acids that is processed into structural (Core, E1 and E2) and non-structural (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) proteins by viral and cellular proteases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The virus particle consists of the RNA genome packaged in a capsid (Core) that is surrounded by a lipid envelope presenting viral glycoproteins (E1 and E2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Several lipoproteins including apoE, apoC1 and apoB are associated with the virus particle forming a lipid cloak. During infection, the virus initially attaches to the cell through weak interactions with GAGs or LDLR on the cell surface followed by interactions with numerous (co-)receptors; key proteins include SR-B1, CD81, Claudin-1 (CLN1) and Occludin (OCLN)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The virus is then internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and undergoes uncoating following acidification in the early endosomes. The viral genome released into the cytosol is translated by cellular ribosomes into a single polyprotein that is then processed into mature proteins as described above. The incoming RNA is firstly replicated by virus and host proteins into negative-strand RNA that is then used as template to synthesize the progeny of positive-strand RNA. Viral RNA replication occurs in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where a portion of the freshly synthesized RNA is packaged into nascent particles that acquire their envelope in the ER and are then released from cells likely using the secretory pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>There is no vaccine available to date. Until recently, standard hepatitis C treatments consisted of a combination of PEGylated interferon alpha and Ribavirin for a period of 24 or 48 weeks, depending on HCV genotype (gt). Cure rates were between 70 and 80% for gt 2 and 3, respectively, and 45 to 70% for other genotypes. The first directly acting antiviral agents (DDA) (i.e. inhibitors of HCV NS3/4A protease Telaprevir and Boceprevir) were introduced in 2011. Combining either Boceprevir or Telaprevir with Ribavirin and PEGylated interferon alpha improves antiviral response. Unfortunately, this benefit is limited to hepatitis C gt 1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and is offset by a greater rate of adverse effects, especially in case of patients with liver fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, requiring additional medical surveillance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>FDA approved Sofosbuvir in 2013 as a highly active inhibitor of HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It is the first drug to be used in combination with Ribavirin for treatment of hepatitis C genotypes 2 and 3 without PEGylated interferon. Sofosbuvir, Simeprevir (also approved by FDA in 2013 as inhibitor of HCV protease) and Ribavirin combination has success rates of around 90% for all viral genotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Combinations that contain HCV NS5A inhibitors Daclatasvir and Ledipasvir show even higher success rates of 93 to 100% depending on viral genotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In the end of 2014 a new cocktail was approved called Viekira Pak that includes Ombitasvir, Paritaprevir, Ritonavir and Dasabuvir<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Viekira Pak showed very promising results in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. However, access to directly acting anti-HCV therapies is severely limited since these regimes are very expensive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>; moreover, some drugs have not entered all the regional markets, such as Sofosbuvir in Russia, where the treatment of adults is not covered even by existing drugs. So newly developed drugs may have niche regional markets. In addition, their clinical usage faces development of drug resistant HCV strains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Hence, the development of novel anti-HCV agents to increase effectiveness, shorten treatment periods and widen availability (and affordability) is an urgent task for the modern healthcare.</p><p>Recently, we synthesized a series of 1-[&#x003c9;-(phenoxy)alkyl]uracil derivatives, which showed potent anti-human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) activity in cell culture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In this paper, we describe the anti-HCV properties of their analogues bearing an amide fragment at position 3 of the uracil residue.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>Compound library was synthesized by alkylation of 1-substituted uracil derivatives <bold>1</bold> with 2-chloroacetanilides <bold>2</bold> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>. Synthesis of the starting uracil derivatives <bold>1</bold> was described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. 2-Chloro-<italic>N</italic>-(4-phenoxyphenyl)acetamides and their analogues <bold>2</bold> were prepared according to earlier published method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Methylation of Z263 to obtain Z431 was performed as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p><p>To assess the effect of compounds on HCV infection, we used three protocols: Protocol 1 where Huh7-J20<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> cells were pre-treated for 1&#x02009;h and exposed to the cell culture infectious HCV (HCVcc) gt 2a strain JFH-1 in the presence of 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M drug or equivalent DMSO (as a vehicle control) for 3&#x02009;h. The cells were then washed and re-fed with fresh medium (without drug) for 72&#x02009;h. Thus, this model allows investigating a possible effect on HCV entry. In the second protocol, Huh7-J20 cells were pre-treated, infected with JFH-1 HCVcc for 3&#x02009;h in the presence of drugs or DMSO and then exposed to the compounds for a further 72&#x02009;h; this model is commonly used to test effect of compounds on full viral life cycle. In the third protocol, we first infected Huh7-J20 cells with JFH-1 HCVcc for 3&#x02009;h and replaced the inoculum with fresh medium containing the drug or DMSO to determine if the effect of the drug is exerted post-viral entry (e.g. RNA replication and/or virus assembly). Cell viability assays were performed in parallel. Several compounds showed a good inhibitory effect on virus entry, particularly the compound Z401 which inhibited virus infection by 80% relative to the DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Interestingly, Z401 was also strongly effective post-entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>, top panel). Most compounds, however, showed a strong antiviral activity on both the post-entry or full life cycle model, with no or little adverse effect on cell viability except compound Z431 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Together, these data suggest that most of the compounds affect virus genome replication.</p><p>To further test the effect on HCV entry, we used the surrogate retrovirus-based pseudoparticle (HCVpp) model. HCVpp consist of retroviral particles, expressing HCV JFH-1 glycoproteins E1 and E2 on their surface and with firefly luciferase as transgene. The results showed that just 2 drugs were able to inhibit HCVpp by more than 50%; Z431 strongly blocked HCV entry (84% inhibition), while Z432 showed a moderate effect (62%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). While Z401 was a potent inhibitor of HCVcc entry (80% inhibition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>), it had a moderate effect on HCVpp infection (50%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p>Our results above indicate that most of our compounds target virus replication. To confirm this, all the drugs were tested for their ability to inhibit replication of a viral sub-genomic replicon. Huh7 cells, electroporated with JFH1-luc replicon RNA, were seeded and incubated for 24 h in the presence of the drugs before measuring luciferase signal. Interestingly, almost all the compounds showed a good inhibition of viral RNA replication, with some compounds being able to block up to 95% of replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). These data confirm the hypothesis that these compounds are able to inhibit HCV replication as previously observed in HCVcc experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In this model, the cell viabilities were up to 10% less compared to those in previous experiments, possibly due to an increase in drug uptake resulting from electroporation.</p><p>The inhibitory effect above, observed on Huh7 cells transiently transfected with the HCV sub-genomic replicon, was then confirmed using the stable replicon cell line Huh7-J17<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Cells were plated in the presence of the drugs and incubated for 24, 48 or 72&#x02009;h. Results confirmed the previous observation, with a good number of drugs showing high inhibition of the viral replicon RNA in a time-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Moreover, 9 drugs (Z385, Z387, Z401, Z400, Z176, Z421, Z430, Z431, Z432) showed a strong inhibition, up to 95% compared to DMSO-treated cells. Interestingly, all the compounds induced toxicity effects similar to those observed on electroporated cells.</p><p>We next obtained dose-response curves for each compound to determine their IC50 and CC50 values. These experiments were conducted testing all the compounds with concentrations starting at 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;M and decreasing with 3-fold dilutions. Huh7-J20 cells were treated and infected with HCV following the second protocol described above. IC50 and CC50 values were collected 3 d post-infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Interestingly, most compounds showed good IC50 values (&#x0003c;5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M), with some drugs conferring inhibition at nM scale (underlined in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Their CC50 values ranged between 2 &#x003bc;M to 60 &#x003bc;M. Considering a SI cut-off of 3, almost all the compounds passed this limit, with many of them showing extremely higher values. Notably, compounds Z385 and Z387, and Z400 and Z401 exhibited SI values &#x0003e;100 and &#x0003e;200, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, these 4 compounds were selected for further evaluation.</p><p>To test the antiviral efficacy of these compounds on other HCV genotypes, we performed dose response experiments as described above on cells electroporated with sub-genomic replicons derived from the gt1b Con1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and the gt3a S52<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> viral isolates. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>, all 4 compounds showed strong inhibition on the gt1b replicon, with IC50 values ranging between 2 and 23&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. Interestingly, a more potent antiviral effect was detected on gt3a replicon, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging between 1 and 0.6&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Together, these data strongly indicate that the anti-HCV activity of compounds Z385, Z387, Z400 and Z401 is likely to be pan-genotypic.</p><p>To rule out the possible effect of secondary infection in our experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, we tested the viral RNA replication inhibitory activity of these compounds in the Huh7-Lunet CD81 cells. These cells do not express CD81, a host factor essential for virus entry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. While these cells remain competent for viral RNA replication and assembly upon direct introduction of its genome into the cells, they are refractory to virus entry and spread of infection. As such, these cells can be used to investigate the inhibitory effect of antiviral compounds in a single-cycle infection assay. As control, we used Huh7L-H/EF, a Huh7 Lunet CD81-derived cell line over-expressing human CD81<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Both cell lines were electroporated with the gt2a HCVcc JFH-1 RNA, seeded in the presence of the drugs and incubated for 72&#x02009;h before measuring intracellular RNA levels, and those associated with the viral progeny secreted into the medium of electroporated cells. The latter was performed following digestion with RNAse A to remove any residual untransfected viral RNA. All 4 compounds strongly inhibited virus replication in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In parallel, we also measured the progeny virus release by quantifying viral RNA into the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In keeping with the results obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>, there was a drastic reduction in virus progeny levels in the medium of cells infected in the presence of all compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that compounds Z385, Z387, Z400 and Z401 affect virus RNA replication.</p><p>To assess whether our compounds could trigger viral escape, they were evaluated over a long period on the replicon cell line using a concentration of 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, in order to reduce the cytotoxic effect. Huh7-J17 cells were treated with Z385, Z387, Z400, Z401 and DMSO and cultured for 20 days. Replication levels were measured at different time point on the same number of cells. Noteworthy, all the compounds showed a significant level of inhibition, with Z401 able to block up to 90% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Moreover, the antiviral activity was evident through the entire period of the experiment, with no rebound observed.</p><p>To further confirm antiviral activity, we tested Z385, Z387, Z400, and Z401 on a cell culture adaptive derivative HCV JFH-1<sub>DSGCSL</sub> strain that consistently replicates to high titres<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Huh7 cells were infected with HCVcc JFH-1<sub>DSGCSL</sub> in the presence of drugs as per Protocol 3 described above and RNA was collected 72&#x02009;h post-infection. Total RNA and the viral RNA were quantified as above. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>, compounds Z385, Z387, Z400 and Z401 reduced the total viral RNA levels by 90%. Similar results were obtained with the parent HCVcc JFH1 strain where a concurrent decrease in virus replication levels was seen in our reporter cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>To explore the possibility that these compounds may affect HCV-encoded enzymes, Z385, Z400 and Z401 were tested for inhibition of recombinant viral NS3 helicase/NTPase and NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. Notably, we tested both primer-dependent and <italic>de novo</italic> polymerase activities of RdRp that was derived from both 1b (isolate Con1) and 2a (isolate JFH1) genotypes. However, none of the compounds tested exhibited any notable inhibitory activity towards either of the viral enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplement, Fig. S4</xref>). These data suggest that the compounds likely target one or more cellular factors that are critical for virus RNA replication.</p><p>Our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref> suggest that these compounds may be acting at an early stage of viral replication. Compound Z401 in particular showed a partial effect that could be explained by a rapid inhibition of viral replication. To explore this idea, we tested the ability of the 4 selected compounds to inhibit viral replication under a slightly modified condition in which cells were treated only during the first hours after RNA transfection. Briefly, immediately after electroporation with SGR-JFH-luc RNA Huh7 cells were treated with drugs for a time ranging from 1 to 5&#x02009;h. The cells were then washed, and incubated in fresh medium in the absence of drugs 24 or 48&#x02009;h. The results at 24&#x02009;h post transfection, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>, confirmed a block of approximately 50% to 60% for Z385, Z387 and Z400 and 80% for Z401. However, data obtained 48&#x02009;h post transfection showed a massive rebound of viral replication, with no effects observed for all the compounds except a small inhibition in 5&#x02009;h treatment; only Z401, exhibited a persistent antiviral activity of 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>). In parallel, these compounds were tested on Huh7 cells electroporated with the viral NS5B-defective SGR-JFH-GND-luc RNA, a sub-genomic replicon with a mutation in the GDD domain that blocks the viral NS5B polymerase activity and hence RNA replication. However, this mutant RNA is expected to be translation-competent, at least up to 8&#x02009;h post-transfection. Huh7 cells, electroporated with JFH-GND-luc RNA and plated in the presence of the compounds, showed no significant effects on the levels of luciferase, indicating that viral RNA translation was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Moreover, no inhibition was observed when the compounds were tested similarly on the stable replicon cell line (data not shown) which persistently replicates viral RNA. Together, these results indicate that the compounds tested exert their antiviral effect mainly during the initial stage of viral replication. Finally, we tested these compounds using trans-complemented pseudo-typed HCV replicon particles (TCP). Based on a system described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, we generated TCP encapsidating our N17 subgenomic replicon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> in the medium of Huh7-J17 replicon cells that had been transfected with a plasmid construct expressing the VSV-G protein. The TCPs produced thus are capable of infecting and delivering replication-competent N17 replicon into na&#x000ef;ve Huh7 cells without generating progeny virus. Thus, TCPs represent a good model to investigate single-cycle infection allowing analyses of antiviral compounds in the absence of secondary infection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>, all 4 compounds efficiently inhibited the replication of the N17 replicon in cells infected with the VSV-G pseudotyped TCPs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using cell-based assays involving three different protocols, we show that most of our compounds inhibit HCV genome replication. Our initial data indicated that they had a moderate effect on the gt2a HCVcc entry. However, a further analysis using HCVpp, which is a well-established virus entry model, identified only Z431 as an HCV-specific entry inhibitor. Treatment of cells post-infection showed that most of the compounds inhibited viral genome replication by up to 95%. We excluded their possible effect on the translation of viral RNA by testing them during the translation phase of a replication-defective subgenomic viral replicon post-electroporation. That most of the compounds targeted viral genome replication was unequivocally confirmed using the viral sub-genomic replicon system. Interestingly, we found a significant difference in the antiviral activity of the compounds when tested in the stably established replicon cell lines as opposed to in cells that had been freshly electroporated with the replicon RNA. In the latter case, a stronger inhibitory activity was detected, indicating that these compounds likely act on <italic>de novo</italic> RNA synthesis thus affecting early stages of HCV replication. Our analysis of the effects of the selected compounds in the TCP system further reinforces this hypothesis.</p><p>Most of the compounds exhibited IC<sub>50</sub> values in the micromolar scale and a good cell viability profile. The antiviral activity of the compound Z401 was in the nanomolar range. The Selectivity Index, expressed as the ratio of CC<sub>50</sub> on IC<sub>50,</sub> indicated that most of the compounds have high values (&#x0003e;10) and are therefore good candidates for further studies. Here, we selected four compounds for further studies based on an SI cut-off of 100. The selected compounds also inhibited replication of gt1b and gt3a replicon (with their IC50 values ranging from micromolar to nanomolar, respectively), confirming their pan-genotypic potential.</p><p>To further validate the mechanism of action of the selected compounds, we evaluated their effect on viral RNA levels in infected cells. We used well-established methods to quantitate both total RNA from infected cells and the positive-strand viral RNA from the released virion progeny. We used a cell line defective in the virus entry factor, CD81, thus excluding the possible effect of secondary infection and allowing analyses in a single cycle infection setting. As expected, compounds Z385, Z387, Z400 and Z401 efficiently inhibited the viral RNA and this inhibition corresponded to the reduced levels of viral genomic RNA (and hence virus release) in the cell medium. Moreover, in the HeF cells, in which CD81 expression was restored, a better inhibition was observed for all the compounds, probably due to their antiviral activity on secondary infection. These data indicated that our compounds act at an early stage of viral replication. To confirm this, we treated the electroporated cells for a short time (1&#x02013;5&#x02009;h) and then waited 24 or 48&#x02009;h before evaluating viral replication. All the compounds showed viral inhibition, with Z401 being able to inhibit by up to 80%. However, a rebound in viral replication, especially after 48&#x02009;h, was observed for all the compounds except Z401. Indeed, Z401 proved to be the most active compound blocking the replication of different HCV genotypes, 1b, 2a and 3a, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.2, 0.092 and 0.69&#x02009;&#x003bc;M respectively. Overall, these data show that our compounds are highly efficient in blocking viral replication at an early stage and that their effects are stable. That compounds Z385, Z400 and Z401 do not act as direct inhibitors of HCV-encoded enzymes indicates that they may affect host factor(s) that are crucial for virus RNA replication. We are currently investigating this possibility.</p><p>SAR study has shown that the nature and position of R<sub>1</sub> substituent have a significant effect on the inhibitory properties. Thus, unsubstituted compound Z436 (R<sub>1</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;H) characterized with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 3.62&#x02009;&#x003bc;M and mediocre SI due to the relatively high cytotoxicity. Introduction of bromine atom at the <italic>para</italic>-position (compound Z263) led to some activity increase (IC<sub>50</sub> 3.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) and 5-fold SI increase. Replacement of the bromine atom with a cyano-group (compound Z434) or a phenyl residue (compound Z438) led to an increase in both the anti-HCV activity and cytotoxicity, which negatively affects the SI. At the same time, displacement of the bromine atom from 4- to 3-position (compound Z421) allowed to increase both the inhibitory activity (3 times) and SI (10 times) as compared to the unsubstituted Z436.</p><p>The nature of the spacer also plays a crucial role in the anti-HCV activity manifestation. Strong correlation is observed between spacer length and antiviral properties. While compounds Z397 and Z263, comprising four and five methylene units, respectively, show approximately the same level of anti-HCV activity, 6 methylene compound Z400 show an order of magnitude higher activity (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.243&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) and tremendously increased SI of 273. 8 Methylene compound Z401 show even higher level of inhibitory properties &#x02013;&#x02009;50% protective effect is evident at the 0.0924&#x02009;&#x003bc;M concentration. However, concomitant increase of cytotoxicity led to some reduction in SI (244).</p><p>Apparently, the position of the oxygen atom in the spacer is also important. Shift of the oxygen from the aromatic moiety increase the activity twice (compound Z432). However, almost 3-fold increase in cytotoxicity is also observed. In turn, introduction of a second oxygen atom (compound Z422) results in a significant drop in the inhibitory properties and increased cytotoxicity. Replacement of the oxygen atom of Z436 with a methylene group in compound Z437 had little impact on activity.</p><p>Alkyl substituents in the uracil residue had practically no effect on the level of cytotoxicity, however, they influenced antiviral activity in a positive way. Thymine derivative Z376 is markedly more active than the parent Z263, while the 5-methyl-6-ethyluracil analogue (Z433) exceeded Z263 by two orders. In contrast, the introduction of an iodine atom in the 5-position of uracil residue (compound Z439) did not change the level of the inhibitory properties. At the same time, there was a marked increase in cytotoxicity.</p><p>Introduction of the R<sub>3</sub> substituent also proved to have a favorable effect. Chlorine atom increased the activity 6-fold (compound Z385), a fluorine atom &#x02013; nearly 5 times (compound Z414), methyl group &#x02212;&#x02009;10 times (Compound Z413) as compared to the unsubstituted compound Z263. However, for the latter two cases, there was a two-fold increase in cytotoxicity.</p><p>The study of influence of the nature of the linker fragment Y showed that optimal virus-inhibitory properties can be achieved with a methylene group (Z387). It provides the best activity and selectivity among the tested oxygen atom (Z263), carbonyl (Z430), or oxymethylene group (Z377).</p><p>Methylation of the acetanilide nitrogen atom increased the antiviral activity, but also led to a sharp increase in cytotoxicity (compound Z431) making impractical further modifications in this direction. Also it seems unfavorable to replace the long spacer with a methylene group (compound Z176). Due to the high cytotoxicity compound has a low SI.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Chemistry</title><p>General methods and techniques were applied to the synthesis of target compounds according to prior publications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.
