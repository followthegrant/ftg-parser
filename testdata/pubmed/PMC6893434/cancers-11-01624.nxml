This channel is inactivated via different mechanisms, including protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-27 and Ser-30 or Ser-34, respectively, which shapes the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to agonists. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> calmodulin-activated adenylyl cyclase type 8 (AC8) was reported to interact directly with Orai1, thus mediating a dynamic interplay between the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways. Here, we show that the breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 exhibit enhanced expression of Orai1 and AC8 as compared to the non-tumoral breast epithelial MCF10A cell line. In these cells, AC8 interacts with the Orai1&#x003b1; variant in a manner that is not regulated by Orai1 phosphorylation. AC8 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells, using two different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), attenuates thapsigargin (TG)-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and also Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mediated by co-expression of Orai1 and the Orai1-activating small fragment (OASF) of STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule-1). Conversely, AC8 overexpression enhances SOCE, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, in cells co-expressing Orai1 and OASF. In MDA-MB-231 cells, we found that AC8 overexpression reduces the Orai1 phosphoserine content, thus suggesting that AC8 interferes with Orai1 serine phosphorylation, which takes place at residues located in the AC8-binding site. Consistent with this, the subset of Orai1 associated with AC8 in na&#x000ef;ve MDA-MB-231 cells is not phosphorylated in serine residues in contrast to the AC8-independent Orai1 subset. AC8 expression knockdown attenuates migration of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, while this maneuver has no effect in the MCF10A cell line, which is likely attributed to the low expression of AC8 in these cells. We found that AC8 is required for FAK (focal adhesion kinase) phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells, which might explain its role in cell migration. Finally, we found that AC8 is required for TNBC cell proliferation. These findings indicate that overexpression of AC8 in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells impairs the phosphorylation-dependent Orai1 inactivation, a mechanism that might support the enhanced ability of these cells to migrate.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>orai1&#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>adenylyl cyclase 8</kwd><kwd>store-operated calcium entry</kwd><kwd>breast cancer cells</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-cancers-11-01624"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in women worldwide. Among the different subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is more aggressive and exhibits a poorer prognosis than other types of breast cancer. Immunohistochemically, TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors or excess HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) expression. Consequently, this type of cancer is resistant to hormonal therapies and chemicals that target the HER2 receptor [<xref rid="B1-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Studies in TNBC cells revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is remodeled and plays a key functional role [<xref rid="B2-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. TNBC cells overexpress Orai1, which is responsible for the activation of store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) [<xref rid="B6-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Orai1 is a well-characterized regulator of the proliferation and migration of many TNBC cells, including the MDA-MB-231 cell line [<xref rid="B7-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Orai1 is the pore-forming subunit of the highly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective CRAC (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release activated Ca<sup>2+</sup>) channel, the best characterized store-operated channel [<xref rid="B10-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The CRAC channel is activated by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor STIM1 upon discharge of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, and the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the channel is modulated by the regulation of STIM1 by proteins like SARAF (SOCE-associated regulatory factor) [<xref rid="B13-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as well as by CRAC channel inactivation. CRAC currents undergo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation to prevent excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Two different mechanisms, termed fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (FCDI) that occurs within milliseconds [<xref rid="B16-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and slow Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (SCDI) that commences tens of seconds after Orai1 activation [<xref rid="B17-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], were described, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. Two variants of Orai1, generated by alternative translation initiation, were recently identified [<xref rid="B18-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a long form termed Orai1&#x003b1; of approximately 33 kDa and a short form, Orai1&#x003b2;, lacking amino acids 1&#x02013;63, of approximately 23 kDa. Orai1&#x003b1; exhibits a greater FCDI, thus suggesting that the N-terminal 63 amino acids might play a relevant role in this process [<xref rid="B11-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A recent study reported direct interaction of Orai1 with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> calmodulin-activated adenylyl cyclase type 8 (AC8) [<xref rid="B19-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Willoughby et al. specifically identified interaction of the N-terminal region of AC8 with residues 26&#x02013;34 of the Orai1 N-terminus [<xref rid="B19-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This sequence, exclusively present in the Orai1&#x003b1; variant, overlaps with three Orai1 phosphorylation sites, Ser-27, -30, and -34. Ser-27 and -30 are phosphorylated by PKC in vivo and in vitro, leading to strong inactivation of CRAC channel function and SOCE [<xref rid="B20-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the other hand, a recent study demonstrated that AC8 mediates CRAC inactivation by phosphorylation of Orai1 at Ser-34 [<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The functional interaction between AC8 and Orai1 reveals a finely regulated interplay between the cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways.</p><p>Here, we show that TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells overexpress Orai1 and AC8, with predominant overexpression of AC8 over Orai1. Interaction of AC8 with Orai1 interferes with phosphorylation of the latter, probably due to overlapping of the phosphorylation sites with the AC8-binding sequence of Orai1. In MDA-MB-231 cells, silencing of AC8 results in attenuation of SOCE, while AC8 overexpression enhances Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, thus suggesting that AC8 impairs the inactivation of Orai1. AC8 was also found to be required for breast cancer cell migration, thus suggesting that AC8, by enhancing cAMP levels and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, plays an important functional role in breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-cancers-11-01624"><title>2.

The increased expression of Orai1 in the breast cancer cell lines is consistent with the high expression of this protein in cancerous tissue [<xref rid="B22-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f001">Figure 1</xref>c,d, Western blot analysis of whole-cell lysates from MCF10A, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 cells with a specific anti-AC8 antibody revealed that this protein is scarcely expressed in the non-tumoral cell line, while it is highly expressed in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The Orai1 and AC8 expression normalized to the &#x003b2;-actin content indicates that Orai1 expression was 371 &#x000b1; 12 and 393 &#x000b1; 22% of that in MCF10A cells in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, while the AC8 expression was 611 &#x000b1; 75 and 621 &#x000b1; 98% of that in MCF10A cells in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively; therefore, the quantitative analysis indicated that AC8 overexpression in breast cancer cells is significantly greater than that of Orai1. Previous studies revealed a functional relationship between Orai1 and AC8 [<xref rid="B19-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; hence, we next explored the interaction between both proteins in the non-tumoral and tumoral breast cell lines by co-immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-Orai1 antibody, followed by Western blotting with anti-AC8 antibody. The experiments were performed in resting cells as this interaction was previously shown to be constitutive [<xref rid="B19-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our results indicated that, while a detectable interaction was appreciated in non-tumoral cells, the co-immunoprecipitation between Orai1 and AC8 was significantly greater in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f001">Figure 1</xref>e,f; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <italic>n</italic> = 6). </p><p>AC8 was reported to bind to an N-terminal sequence of Orai1 located between amino acids 26 and 34, which contains three serines (27, 30, and 34) [<xref rid="B23-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This sequence is only present in the mammalian-specific full-length Orai1&#x003b1; variant and is absent in the short Orai1 variant, Orai1&#x003b2; [<xref rid="B18-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; thus, AC8 was reported to interact solely with Orai1&#x003b1; [<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We assessed the expression of Orai1&#x003b1; and Orai1&#x003b2; in the three breast derived cell lines. The native Orai1 variant expression was analyzed by Western blotting after protein deglycosylation with PNGaseF. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f001">Figure 1</xref>g, two distinct bands with lower molecular weight than glycosylated Orai1 were detected, corresponding to Orai1&#x003b1; and Orai1&#x003b2;. Our results indicated that both Orai1 variants were highly expressed in the breast cancer MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines as compared to non-tumoral MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f001">Figure 1</xref>h; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <italic>n</italic> = 6). Furthermore, we found that the expression of Orai1&#x003b1; was significantly greater in MDA-MB-231 cells than in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f001">Figure 1</xref>h; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) while no differences were detected in the Orai1&#x003b2; expression among the cancer cell lines investigated. The latter might explain the greater Orai1&#x003b1;/Orai1&#x003b2; expression ratio in MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f001">Figure 1</xref>i; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <italic>n</italic> = 6). The analysis of the expression ratio between the Orai1 variants indicates a greater expression of Orai1&#x003b2; in all the cell types investigated and, interestingly, a greater Orai1&#x003b1;/Orai1&#x003b2; expression ratio in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells than in non-tumoral MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f001">Figure 1</xref>i; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <italic>n</italic> = 6). We further explored the interaction of AC8 and Orai1&#x003b1; in MDA-MB-231 cells by co-immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-AC8 antibody, followed by treatment of the immunoprecipitates with PNGaseF and Western blotting with anti-Orai1 antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f001">Figure 1</xref>j, our results indicate that Orai1&#x003b1;, but not Orai1&#x003b2;, co-immunoprecipitates with AC8 in resting conditions, confirming previous results [<xref rid="B19-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This interaction was not modified by treatment for 1 min with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin (TG; 1 &#x000b5;M), which is in agreement with a previous study by Willoughby and coworkers suggesting a constitutive interaction between both proteins [<xref rid="B19-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-cancers-11-01624"><title>2.2. The Interaction between Orai1 and AC8 Is Partially Dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> Influx and Orai1 Phosphorylation at Ser-27 and -30</title><p>In order to explore the mechanism regulating the Orai1&#x02013;AC8 interaction, we tested the possible Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependency of this event. To address this issue, we assessed the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from the intracellular stores and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Orai1 in the Orai1&#x02013;AC8 co-immunoprecipitation. Hence, we tested Orai1&#x02013;AC8 interaction in resting cells or in cells treated with TG, to induce net Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, suspended either in the presence of 1 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> or in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium. When indicated, cells were loaded with dimethyl BAPTA, and suspended either in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium, to prevent rises in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>) induced by both Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and entry, or in the presence of 1 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, to prevent rises in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release but allowing rises in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the vicinity of the Orai1 channels.</p><p>Our results indicated that, in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, there was a detectable Orai1&#x02013;AC8 association, which was unaffected by BAPTA loading or treatment with TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b; <italic>n</italic> = 6), as previously reported [<xref rid="B19-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f002">Figure 2</xref>c&#x02013;e depict a detectable increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the Orai1 vicinity in cells not loaded with BAPTA, as well as, with less intensity but still significant, in BAPTA-loaded cells as detected with G-GECO1.2-Orai1 [<xref rid="B24-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <italic>n</italic> = 6), and similar results were obtained using the near plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator fura-FFP18 (the initial slopes of the increase in fura-FFP18 fluorescence ratio were 1.0299 &#x000b1; 0.1325 and 0.3793 &#x000b1; 0.0205 in control and BAPTA-loaded cells, respectively, and the maximal fura-2 fluorescence ratios were 0.20 &#x000b1; 0.01 and 0.11 &#x000b1; 0.01 in control and BAPTA-loaded cells, respectively, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cancers-11-01624">Figure S1, Supplementary Materials</xref>), which demonstrate that detectable rises in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the Orai1 microdomain due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via Orai1 were still detectable in BAPTA-loaded cells. Cell loading with dimethyl BAPTA was without a significant effect on the resting fura-FFP18 fluorescence ratio (the resting ratios were 0.60 &#x000b1; 0.03 and 0.61 &#x000b1; 0.01 in control and BAPTA-loaded cells, respectively). When Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was not allowed, treatment with TG resulted in a reduction in the Orai1&#x02013;AC8 interaction, a response that was maintained when the rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux from the stores was prevented by BAPTA loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b; <italic>n</italic> = 6). These findings suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion itself plays an inhibitory role in the Orai1&#x02013;AC8 association that was overcome by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via Orai1 channels. Therefore, upon agonist stimulation, the Orai1&#x02013;AC8 interaction is strongly dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the channel.</p><p>Orai1 is phosphorylated by PKC at residues Ser-27 and Ser-30, an event that negatively regulates Orai1 function [<xref rid="B20-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As both serine residues are located within the Orai1 AC8-binding region, we explored whether phosphorylation at Ser-27 and Ser-30 alters Orai1&#x02013;AC8 interaction. To investigate this issue, cells were transfected with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-Orai1, the non-phosphorylatable Orai1S27A/S30A mutant, or the phosphomimetic Orai1S27D/S30D mutant, or they were mock-treated, and the Orai1&#x02013;AC8 interaction was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation from cell lysates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f003">Figure 3</xref>, bottom panel, depicts that expression of YFP-Orai1 produced a band of the predicted size (approximately 60 kDa). Furthermore, expression of the Orai1S27A/S30A and Orai1S27D/S30D mutants yielded several bands, one at the size of the native Orai1 and other small size bands which might be attributed to Orai1 without post-translational modifications. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f003">Figure 3</xref>, our results indicated that AC8 was able to co-immunoprecipitate with YFP-Orai1, as well as with the Orai1S27A/S30A and Orai1S27D/S30D mutants. Therefore, these findings indicate that phosphorylation of Orai1 at Ser-27 and Ser-30 is unlikely to interfere with Orai1 binding to AC8.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-cancers-11-01624"><title>2.3.

Hence, we explored the functional role of the interaction between Orai1 and AC8 in these cells. To assess the role of AC8 in SOCE, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with two different commercial small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for AC8 or scramble plasmids to analyze their effect on TG-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f004">Figure 4</xref>a,b, transfection with both plasmids attenuated the AC8 expression by about 50% in 48 h.

By contrast, attenuation of AC8 expression by transfection of the siAC8 plasmids reduced TG-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in the presence of 1 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f004">Figure 4</xref>f,h,i; the initial slopes of the increase in fura-2 fluorescence ratio were 0.0065 &#x000b1; 0.0004, 0.0036 &#x000b1; 0.0003, and 0.0040 &#x000b1; 0.0002 in cells transfected with scramble plasmid, siAC8#1, or siAC8#2, respectively, while the initial peak fura-2 fluorescence ratios were 0.93 &#x000b1; 0.02, 0.64 &#x000b1; 0.03, and 0.65 &#x000b1; 0.02, in cells transfected with scramble plasmid, siAC8#1, or siAC8#2, respectively). As TG-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> release was unaffected by attenuation of the AC8 expression, this effect should be attributed to a reduction in TG-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. If we consider the area under the curve (AUC) or the entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulated by TG, corrected by subtraction of the response to TG in the absence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, transfection of the siAC8#1 and siAC8#2 plasmids significantly reduced SOCE by 40 &#x000b1; 2% and 31 &#x000b1; 2%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f004">Figure 4</xref>j; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Similar results were observed when we estimated TG-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> add-back protocol.

MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for pEYFP-Orai1 and pEYFP-OASF in combination with the siAC8 or scramble plasmids. Expression of Orai1, OASF, or both in the absence or presence of the siAC8 plasmids did not significantly alter the resting fura-2 fluorescence ratio (resting ratios were 0.30 &#x000b1; 0.01, 0.32 &#x000b1; 0.01, 0.30 &#x000b1; 0.01, 0.32 &#x000b1; 0.01, 0.30 &#x000b1; 0.01, and 0.31 &#x000b1; 0.01 in cells transfected with scramble plasmid, Orai1, OASF, Orai1 + OASF, Orai1 + OASF + siAC8#1, and Orai1 + OASF + siAC8#2, respectively).

Co-expression of Orai1 and OASF resulted in a robust activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry independently of Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion as compared to mock-treated cells, which did not display a significant constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry induced by co-expression of Orai1 and OASF was impaired by AC8 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f005">Figure 5</xref>e,f,g; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), thus suggesting that AC8 directly modulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Orai1 in MDA-MB-231 cells.

AC8 Prevents Phosphorylation of Orai1 at Ser-27 and -30</title><p>We further explored the mechanism involved in the regulation of Orai1 channel function by AC8. A recent study reported that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via Orai1 results in the activation of AC8, which, in turn, generates cAMP and activates PKA. The latter phosphorylates Orai1 at Ser-34, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation of the channel [<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, Orai1 phosphorylation at Ser-27 and -30 is associated with suppression of Orai1 channel function [<xref rid="B20-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As phosphorylation of Ser-27, -30, and -34 is associated with Orai1 inactivation, and as these residues are located within the Orai1 AC8-binding sequence, we further evaluated whether interaction with AC8 prevents phosphorylation of Orai1 at serine residues. To investigate this issue, we assessed the phosphoserine content of the AC8-associated and AC8-independent Orai1 subsets in MDA-MB-231 cells. Resting cells and cells stimulated with TG were used to elucidate the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion in Orai1 Ser-27 and Ser-30 phosphorylation. To analyze Orai1 phosphorylation in the AC8-associated and independent Orai1 subsets, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-AC8 antibody, and the supernatants (AC8-independent Orai1 fraction), as well as the proteins eluted from the pellet (AC8-bound Orai1), were immunoprecipitated again with anti-Orai1 antibody, followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphoserine antibody. Our results showed a detectable phosphorylation of the AC8-independent Orai1 fraction at serine residues in resting cells, which was maintained upon treatment with TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f007">Figure 7</xref>, pellet (3); <italic>n</italic> = 6).

Discussion</title><p>Orai1 was reported to play a major role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. SOCE, a major mechanism for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in this cell type, was found to be strongly dependent on Orai1 [<xref rid="B6-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], whose plasma membrane expression is modulated by TRPC6 channels [<xref rid="B3-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Orai1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels play an important functional role in breast cancer cells supporting a number of cancer hallmarks such as migration, proliferation, or survival [<xref rid="B33-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The Orai1 N-terminal intracellular region contains several phosphorylation sites. Ser-27 and -30 are the main phosphorylation sites targeted by PKC&#x003b2;1 [<xref rid="B20-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while Ser-34 was found to be a target of protein kinase G (PKG) [<xref rid="B36-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and, more recently, Zhang and coworkers revealed that Ser-34 is also a PKA phosphorylation site [<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Phosphorylation of Orai1 at any of these serine residues was demonstrated to result in Orai1 channel inactivation and reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. These three serines are located in the Orai1 AC8-binding sequence (amino acids 26&#x02013;34). Here, we show that AC8 binding to Orai1 attenuates Orai1 serine phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells, leading to enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through the channel. This statement is based on different observations. First of all, we found that AC8 and the Orai1&#x003b1; and Orai1&#x003b2; variants are overexpressed in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells as compared to non-tumoral breast epithelial cells. Secondly, Orai1&#x003b1;, but not Orai1&#x003b2; lacking the N-terminal 63 amino acids, constitutively interacts with AC8. Thirdly, while the subset of Orai1 not associated with AC8 is phosphorylated in serine residues both under resting conditions and upon stimulation with the SERCA inhibitor TG, the AC8-associated Orai1 subset is not serine-phosphorylated, thus suggesting that AC8 interaction might interfere with Orai1 phosphorylation at Ser-27, -30, and -34. Fourthly, AC8 overexpression impairs Orai1 serine phosphorylation. Lastly, AC8 expression silencing significantly reduces TG-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mediated by co-expression of Orai1 with the STIM1 OASF region in these cells; conversely, AC8 overexpression leads to enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in cells co-expressing Orai1 and OASF, as well as TG-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</p><p>A recent report by Zhang and coworkers showed an elegant functional interaction between Orai1 and AC8, where AC8 activation mediates an Orai1 inactivation mechanism driven by local cAMP and PKA activation that, in turn, phosphorylates Orai1 at Ser-34 [<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, we show that binding of AC8 to Orai1, at the sequence between amino acids 26 and 34, impairs phosphorylation of Orai1 at Ser-27, Ser-30, and Ser-34, the Orai1 phosphorylation sites characterized at present [<xref rid="B20-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B36-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, according to previous results [<xref rid="B21-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the Orai1 subset associated with AC8 should be involved in the inactivation of the AC8-independent Orai1 channels. In na&#x000ef;ve cells, with a normal AC8 expression, AC8 is expected to promote inactivation of a large subset of Orai1 channels; however, in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, which predominantly overexpress AC8 over Orai1, the AC8/Orai1 stoichiometry is shifted in favor of AC8 and, subsequently, the subset of AC8-independent Orai1 is expected to be reduced, and the AC8-induced Orai1 inactivation is, thus, impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-11-01624-f012">Figure 12</xref>).</p><p>We further explored the functional relevance of the AC8&#x02013;Orai1 interaction in MDA-MB-231 cells. In breast cancer cells, Orai1 was reported to play an important role in migration [<xref rid="B37-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the present study provides evidence for a role of AC8 supporting breast cancer cell migration. Silencing AC8 expression attenuates migration of resting and agonist stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells, while the same experimental maneuver was without effect in the non-tumoral breast epithelial MCF10A cell line, an observation that is likely attributed to the low AC8 expression in this cell line. The role of AC8 in cell migration is not specific to TNBC cells, as similar results were observed in the luminal breast cancer MCF7 cell line, which exhibits some common features with the MDA-MB-231 cell line, such as AC8 and Orai1 overexpression. While the role of AC8 in cell migration might be attributed to impairment of Orai1 inactivation and, thus, the support of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, we cannot rule out the possibility that cAMP generation by AC8 also plays a role in breast cancer cell migration, as PKA activation in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells by the cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cAMP per se enhances cell migration and, conversely, pharmacological PKA inhibition attenuates it. </p><p>Finally, we investigated the mechanism underlying the role of AC8 in MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Focal adhesion turnover is essential for cell migration, and the cytosolic tyrosine kinase FAK plays a central role in the dynamics of focal adhesions [<xref rid="B39-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Hence, we assessed whether the role of AC8 in cell migration might be attributed to the regulation of FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397, which is used as an indicator of FAK activation [<xref rid="B40-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our results indicate that FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 is strongly dependent on AC8 expression, thus suggesting that FAK activation might underlie the participation of AC8 in MDA-MB-231 cell migration. </p><p>We further observed that AC8 plays a relevant role in TNBC cell proliferation, another cellular function regulated by SOCE in breast cancer cells [<xref rid="B3-cancers-11-01624" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4-cancers-11-01624"><title>4.
