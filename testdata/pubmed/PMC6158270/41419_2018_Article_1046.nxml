Trifluoperazine (TFP) is an approved antipsychotic drug with good bioavailability in brain and had shown anticancer effect in several types of cancer. It drives us to investigate its activities to suppress TNBC, especially the brain metastasis. In this study, we chose three TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and 4T1 to assess its anticancer activities along with the possible mechanisms. In vitro, it induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest via decreasing the expression of both cyclinD1/CDK4 and cyclinE/CDK2, and stimulated mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In vivo, TFP suppressed the growth of subcutaneous xenograft tumor and brain metastasis without causing detectable side effects. Importantly, it prolonged the survival of mice bearing brain metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis of Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 indicated TFP could suppress the growth and induce apoptosis of cancer cells in vivo. Taken together, TFP might be a potential available drug for treating TNBC with brain metastasis, which urgently needs novel treatment options.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of malignancy death among women in America and its incidence is increasing globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. About 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed and nearly 40,450 women died of this disease in the United States in 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Although lots of time and funds had been put into the research of TNBC and some new targets emerged, metastatic TNBC is still difficult to treat for lack of effective specific target, resulting in extremely poor survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The current conventional therapeutic strategies for treating TBNC failed to achieve a satisfactory result<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Brain metastasis is the end stage of the devastating disease in breast cancer progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Currently there is no effective treatment option available including radiotherapy, which could only prolong patients&#x02019; lives by a few months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Brain metastasis is a great challenge in this new era of personalized targeted cancer therapies. Therefore, it urgently needs great effort to discover effective therapeutic strategies and actionable molecular targets to cure TNBC patients with brain metastasis.</p><p id="Par3">Dysregulation of cell cycle is a hallmark of cancer. Cell cycle is an accurate process responsible for the proper division of&#x000a0;one cell&#x000a0;into two daughter cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The genetic control of cell division is dysfunctional in cancer, leading to an unrestricted cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Disrupting cell cycle can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of tumor, in favor of the therapy of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Apoptosis is a programmed process of cell death, which plays an important role in eliminating unwanted cells in damaged multicellular organism. It also works in a variety of biological process, including cell differentiation and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Dysregulation of apoptosis leads to numerous diseases including cancer and is another hallmark of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, compounds that could block cell cycle and induce apoptosis might be effective therapeutic agents for treating TNBC.</p><p id="Par5">Nowadays, the development of anticancer drugs is more difficult than before. It is accompanied with some big challenges caused by increasing failure rates, high cost, poor bioavailability that cannot be solved, unwanted safety and limited efficacy in clinical trials. Exploring approved noncancer drugs for their anticancer activities could decrease the failure of development and save time and money<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Some studies showed schizophrenic patients using neuroleptic agents have less risk of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Trifluoperazine (TFP) is a phenothiazine derivative commonly used as antipsychotic drug. Limited studies have reported that TFP has anticancer efficacies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, there were few reports about the investigation of TFP in treating TNBC. Antischizophrenic agent like TFP could easily penetrate the blood&#x02212;brain barrier (BBB) to achieve a high concentration in brain, leading us to investigate its activities to treat TNBC and the brain metastasis.</p><p id="Par6">The aim of our study was to obtain some insight into the activities of TFP against TNBC in vitro and in vivo along with the underlying mechanisms. We found that TFP could induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of TNBC cells via decreasing the expression level of cyclinD1/CDK4 and cyclinE/CDK2 complexes. It could also induce apoptosis of the cancer cells via the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#x02013;mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Moreover, TFP could suppress TNBC cells migration and invasion. Importantly, TFP inhibited the growth of established subcutaneous xenograft tumor and the brain metastasis of TNBC without causing obvious side effects.</p><p id="Par7">To the best of our knowledge, there was no report about TFP&#x02019;s potential application in treating established TNBC brain metastases. Given it&#x02019;s an approved drug, TFP could be rapidly advanced into clinical trial. Our results suggested that TFP may be a potential antitumor candidate and its further investigation is warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>TFP inhibited TNBC cells proliferation</title><p id="Par8">To evaluate the effects of TFP on cell viability, several cell lines were exposed to TFP.
