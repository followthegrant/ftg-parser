In Spain, too, the &#x0201c;state of alarm&#x0201d; declared on 14 March 2020 has led to drastic changes in the fabric of our daily lives from both a personal and a professional point of view. Absolutely, all economic activities and professions in our society have been affected to a greater or lesser extent. Some have seen their activity diminish, as certain jobs could not and even still cannot be performed normally and may continue to be seriously compromised in the coming months, while other professions were affected by overwork and, above all, by overcommitment.</p><p id="par0010">In all European countries and in a very special way in Spain, the enormous burden of responsibility and work imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic on the healthcare system is borne mainly by the staff of public hospitals, and the term &#x0201c;health emergency&#x0201d; is now used by both the general public and by the media to introduce the most important pandemic-related daily news. But what is the health emergency specifically, and who exactly does it affect? Which groups are behind this health emergency? At the end of March 2020, the emergency departments of the vast majority of public hospitals witnessed an unprecedented influx of patients, mostly Covid-19 carriers. Healthcare systems were overwhelmed to the point of collapse both in terms of physical space and their ability to treat patients to the expected quality standards. This was compounded by the loneliness inherent in the pandemic, as patients could not be accompanied during their emergency visits or hospital stays. The social distancing required for safety between patients themselves and health personnel proved impossible to implement and increased contagion rates.</p><p id="par0015">In the first wave of this new entity (which continues to surprise us), the most dominant clinical manifestation has been severe life-threatening respiratory involvement. Patients were presenting in emergency rooms with asthenia, chest pain, fever, and severe dyspnea that often became impossible to control with conventional measures within less than 48&#x0202f;h, generating the need for ventilatory support and invasive measures.<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Across the country the country, the demand for intensive care unit (ICU) admission exceeded capacity in the first week, so existing resources had to be expanded with the support of anesthesiology departments. Within less than a fortnight, these departments were also overwhelmed, particularly in cities where the availability of ICUs beds was rapidly exhausted. At this point, respiratory medicine departments with their experience in non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) began to play key role.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>
</p><p id="par0020">During this period, pulmonologists provided ventilatory support to hundreds of patients either because their underlying conditions ruled out invasive measures, or simply because there were no ICU beds available. NIMV offered a significant number of patients relief from their respiratory failure, while for others it provided life support while awaiting admission to an ICU.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Pulmonologists are still battling Covid-19, offering unfailing support to ICUs by performing bronchoscopies to free the airways of secretions and facilitating the early discharge of patients, also thanks to NIMV.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Many patients have already been discharged with potential sequelae which have not yet been determined, but which we suspect will develop. The situation is worrying, so dedicated outpatient clinics are now being set up in all hospitals to closely monitor and follow-up these patients.</p><p id="par0025">This scenario has highlighted the importance of pulmonology in Spain and its relevance and impact on the control of the Covid-19 pandemic in recent months. We would like to emphasize that many of the patients presenting with dyspnea and found to have respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> are now either in standard hospital wards, having been discharged from the ICUs or Intermediate Respiratory Care Units (IRCUs), or else back home, thanks in large part to the efforts of the pulmonologists working in various Spanish public hospitals.</p><p id="par0030">We believe that this experience, coupled with the possibility of new waves of Covid-19 pneumonia and the need to monitor for sequelae, has shown that pulmonology, with its specific diagnostic and therapeutic tools, in particular bronchoscopy, lung function testing, and thoracic ultrasound,<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> should be considered a major specialty in modern medicine. Furthermore, we pulmonologists are best qualified to supervise the monitoring and follow-up of the possible respiratory sequelae of these patients.</p><p id="par0035">We hope that together we will be able to take advantage of this opportunity that has been given to all health professionals dedicated to the management of patients with chronic and acute respiratory diseases, such as Covid-19. It is up to us to to take advantage or to take the maximum benefit the maximum benefit from the lessons learned by the pandemic in order to develop and affirm the position and relevance of pulmonology and respiratory departments in our society; after all, no one can live &#x02013; let alone survive &#x02013; without breathing. As a scientific society, it is our responsibility to call on the health authorities to provide us with the material and human resources we need to carry out our professional work to the required standards of care to minimize the consequences of this disease and to continue to serve patients with respiratory diseases, patients with other respiratory diseases.</p><sec id="sec0005"><title>Funding</title><p id="par0040">None declared.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p id="par0045">None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mendoza Ferradas</surname><given-names>F.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Garc&#x000ed;a del Barrio</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bastarrika</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Extent and quantification of inflammation burden in COVID-19 by computed tomography</article-title><source>Arch Bronconeumol [article in English, Spanish]</source><year>2020</year><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.arbres.2020.03.020</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cinesi G&#x000f3;mez</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pe&#x000f1;uelas Rodr&#x000ed;guez</surname><given-names>&#x000d3;</given-names></name><name><surname>Luj&#x000e1;n Torn&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Egea Santaolalla</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Masa Jim&#x000e9;nez</surname><given-names>J.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Garc&#x000ed;a Fern&#x000e1;ndez</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical consensus recommendations regarding non-invasive respiratory support in the adult patient with acute respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection</article-title><source>Arch Bronconeumol [article in English, Spanish]</source><year>2020</year><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.arbres.2020.03.005</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0015"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>P&#x000e9;rez</surname><given-names>R.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>&#x000c1;lvarez</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>llanos</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ares</surname><given-names>A.N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Viedma</surname><given-names>E.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>D&#x000ed;az-P&#x000e9;rez</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>SEPAR and AEER consensus recommendations on the use of bronchoscopy and airway sampling in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection</article-title><source>Arch Bronconeumol [article in English, Spanish]</source><year>2020</year><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.arbres.2020.03.017</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0020"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0020"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>P&#x000e9;rez Pallar&#x000e9;s</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Flandes Aldeyturriaga</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cases Viedma</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cordovilla P&#x000e9;rez</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>SEPAR-AEER consensus recommendations on the usefulness of the thoracic ultrasound in the management of the patient with suspected or confirmed infection with COVID-19</article-title><source>Arch Bronconeumol [article in English, Spanish]</source><year>2020</year><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.arbres.2020.03.019</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list><fn-group><fn id="d33e209"><label>&#x02606;</label><p id="npar0005">Please cite this article as: Barreiro E, Jim&#x000e9;nez C, Garc&#x000ed;a de Pedro J, Ram&#x000ed;rez Prieto MT.
