Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 loss is common across a broad range of malignancies, and is implicated in immune escape. The N-terminally extended isoform, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 alpha (PTEN&#x003b1;), regulates cellular functions including protein kinase B signaling and mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production. Here we constructed HSV-P10, a replicating, PTEN&#x003b1; expressing oncolytic herpesvirus, and demonstrate that it inhibits PI3K/AKT signaling, increases cellular adenosine triphosphate secretion, and reduces programmed death-ligand 1 expression in infected tumor cells, thus priming an adaptive immune response and overcoming tumor immune escape. A single dose of HSV-P10 resulted in long term survivors in mice bearing intracranial tumors, priming anticancer T-cell immunity leading to tumor rejection. This implicates HSV-P10 as an oncolytic and immune stimulating therapeutic for anticancer therapy.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Oncolytic viruses are a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.

Our findings disclose that a PTEN&#x003b1; expressing virus efficiently lyses the bulk tumor mass while creating an ATP-rich immune stimulating microenvironment during infection, and also decreases cell surface PD-L1 expression on the surface of tumor cells after treatment. We conclude that reconstitution of PTEN&#x003b1; expression during oncolysis enhances the development of antitumor immunity in a multi-mechanistic manner, and hence improves response to virotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Construction of PTEN&#x003b1; expressing virus: HSV-P10</title><p id="Par7">We constructed a <italic>PTEN&#x003b1;</italic> expressing oncolytic virus, HSV-P10, using a modified <italic>PTEN&#x003b1;</italic> gene sequence, whereby we mutated the <italic>PTEN&#x003b1;</italic> CUG start codon to AUG to enhance translation of the full-length N-terminally extended protein, and the internal canonical <italic>PTEN</italic> AUG start codon to AUA to abrogate canonical PTEN expression from the construct (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

Western blot analysis of infected cells revealed increased phosphorylation of AKT upon infection with control HSVQ virus in all breast and glioma tumor cell lines tested, while HSV-P10 infected cells revealed reduced phosphorylated AKT compared with control virus infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Apart from functioning as an intracellular lipid phosphatase that can regulate PI3K signaling, PTEN&#x003b1; has been shown to be secreted and then re-enter adjacent cells to inhibit PI3K signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and also to activate the mitochondrial electron transport chain through hyper-activation of cytochrome C, resulting in increased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. HSV-P10 infection did result in a small amount of secreted PTEN&#x003b1; that could be detected in concentrated (20&#x000d7;) conditioned medium of infected U87&#x02206;EGFR cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Additionally, immunofluorescent staining of pAKT in Met1 and DB7 cells infected with HSVQ or HSV-P10 revealed that while HSVQ infection increased pAKT staining within GFP positive cells, HSV-P10 infection did not (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Spectral quantification of immunofluorescent images across a straight line encompassing two cell widths of two representative adjacent cells, confirmed an increase in pAKT (red) staining within GFP positive (green) HSVQ-infected cells compared with neighboring GFP negative cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> middle panel). HSV-P10 infection did not reveal infection associated induction of pAKT (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> bottom panel). Similar results were observed in the DB7 murine breast cancer cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Next we tested the impact of HSV-P10 on mitochondrial membrane potential using membrane-permeant JC-1 dye. This dye shows a potential-dependent mitochondrial accumulation resulting in aggregates that display a fluorescence emission shift from green (~529&#x02009;nm) to red (~590&#x02009;nm). Consistent with the known function of PTEN&#x003b1;, we observed an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential in three (LN229, U87&#x00394;EGFR, and DB7) out of four cell lines infected with HSV-P10 relative to control HSVQ-infected cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). U251T3 glioma cells possessed a high mitochondrial membrane potential prior to infection, and did not show a further change after HSV-P10 infection. The HSV-P10 induced change in mitochondrial membrane potential positively affected overall ATP production observed in both secreted conditioned medium (Fig.<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) and cell lysates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). To evaluate the significance of HSV-P10 mediated inhibition of AKT phosphorylation on increased ATP production we repeated the above experiment in cells treated with and without LY294002 a PI-3 Kinase inhibitor. Western blot analysis confirmed the reduction of pAKT in LY294002 treated infected and uninfected cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). While HSV-P10 treatment increased ATP production over HSVQ, treatment with LY294002 did not increase ATP release (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Collectively these results show that HSV-P10 expressed PTEN&#x003b1;, retained both mitochondrial targeting and PI3K inhibitory functions of PTEN, and that the ATP release mediated by HSV-P10 was independent of its effect on AKT phosphorylation.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>HSV-P10 AKT inhibition. <bold>a</bold> Western blots of lysates from the indicated cells infected with HSVQ (Q) or HSV-P10 (P) or left untreated (NV).

While both HSVQ and HSV-P10 showed evidence of rapid virus spread through the culture in U251 cancer cells, this was highly attenuated in primary normal HUVEC cell cultures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>).

The differentiated neurons and MDA-468 cells were infected with HSVQ or HSV-P10 with MOI 0.1 or MOI 0.5 for 72&#x02009;h. As expected both HSVQ and HSVP-10 could infect primary human neurons, and consistent with increased HSV-P10 spread in cancer cell cultures, a greater number of MDA-MB-468 cells were positive for GFP at either MOI, with HSV-P10 relative to HSVQ (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>).

Approximately 42% (16 out of 38) of mice treated with HSV-P10 were long-term survivors, showing no indication of tumor burden 90 days post tumor implantation (by MRI). Complete response was confirmed in these mice by MRI imaging (day&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90 after tumor implant), which revealed an absence of visible tumor in the brains of HSV-P10 mice that survived greater than 90 days after tumor implant (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). The presence of long-term survivors after treatment with HSV-P10 in an immune-competent animal model indicated the engagement of the host antitumor immune response in animals treated with HSV-P10.

Thus we hypothesized that overexpression of PTEN&#x003b1; in tumor cells had the potential to enhance T-cell response to therapy via downregulation of cell-surface PD-L1. To test this, we infected a panel of tumor cell lines with HSVQ or HSV-P10 and measured cell surface PD-L1 expression using flow cytometry (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>). HSVQ virus infection of tumor cells revealed an induction of cell-surface PD-L1 expression on three of four breast cancer cell lines tested. HSV-P10 treatment showed a reduction of PD-L1 expression relative to HSVQ in all four cell lines tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>). Consistent with the observation of increased PD-L1 observed in melanoma patients receiving oncolytic HSV virotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, HSVQ virus infection of tumor cells revealed an induction of cell-surface PD-L1 expression on 3 of 4 breast cancer cell lines tested. HSV-P10 treatment showed a reduction of PD-L1 expression relative to HSVQ in all four cell lines tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>). Analysis of PD-L1 expression in GFP negative uninfected cells revealed a significant induction of PD-L1 expression in cells adjacent to control HSVQ-infected cells. This increased expression of PD-L1 in adjacent uninfected cells was significantly mitigated in cultures treated with HSV-P10 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). Since PTEN&#x003b1; is thought to retain both lipid phosphatase and mitochondria modulating functions we evaluated the contribution of PTEN&#x003b1;&#x02019;s lipid phosphatase function in modulating tumor cell expressed PDL-1. Briefly, DB7 tumor cells were infected with HSVQ or HSV-P10 with or without LY294002, a PI3K antagonist that can reduce pAKT levels, and were evaluated for cell surface PDL-1 expression by fluorescent associated cell cytometry (gating strategy shown in Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Consistent with Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, we observed increased PDL-1 expression upon HSVQ infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref> left panel). This induction of cell surface PDL-1 was significantly rescued when cells were treated with HSVQ in combination with the LY294002. PI3K inhibition did not further reduce PDL-1 expression in tumor cells infected with HSV-P10 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref> right panel).

Both HSVQ and HSV-P10 treatments induced NK cell recruitment (black arrow heads highlight areas of NK cell influx), and staining was observed closely surrounding infected tumors. However, the total number of infiltrating NK cells was much lower in comparison to other immune cell types.

Little to no T-cell staining was observed at distal sites within the brain, indicating that the T-cell response was localized to areas of tumor cell implantation or virus injection.

At 7 days post virus infection, ~2.5% of the immune cells in HSV-P10 treated brains were NK cells, and 10% were CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T-cells. Conversely, HSVQ treated animals recruited approximately 1% NK cells and 4% CD8 T-cells, neither of which differed significantly from saline treated control mice. HSVQ infection induced a significant influx in macrophage infiltration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>), and both HSV-P10 and HSVQ treatment resulted in a significant reduction in CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;T-cell (CD3&#x02009;+&#x02009;, CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;) infiltration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8h</xref>) into infected brain hemispheres.

To test our hypothesis that T-cells were primarily responsible for the long-term survival benefit of HSV-P10 treatment, we evaluated the therapeutic benefit of HSV-P10 in mice depleted of CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;or CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T-cells using intraperitoneal injections of anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 depleting antibodies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>).

The FDA approval of one such oncolytic herpesvirus, Talimogine laherparepvec (T-VEC), in October 2015 for non-resectable metastatic melanoma has underscored the potential significance of this therapeutic modality. A recent study demonstrated that while T-VEC shows robust immune stimulating capacity in vivo, it also induces the T-cell suppressor molecule PD-L1 on infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, which can blunt antitumor immunity post oncolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

In the brain, metastatic melanoma and breast cancer lesions frequently lose PTEN protein expression, while it is retained in the primary tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.

As a secreted protein it has the ability to re-enter adjacent cells and retain its function as a lipid phosphatase to reduce PI3K/AKT signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. HSV1 infection is known to induce AKT phosphorylation during infection through viral proteins VP11 and VP12, suggesting that signaling through the AKT pathway may be important for virus replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, we also observed increased AKT phosphorylation in tumor cells after infection with control oncolytic HSV. Here we created and tested the efficacy of an oncolytic HSV expressing PTEN&#x003b1;. While functionality of PTEN&#x003b1; expressed by HSV-P10 as a lipid phosphatase antagonizing PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was confirmed in infected cells, we also observed secretion of PTEN&#x003b1; from tumor cells after infection with HSV-P10. Our results showed that HSV-P10 improved the kinetics of virus spread in culture in the cell lines we tested. Since this did not appear to significantly correlate with PTEN status or activated AKT status of the cells in vitro, future studies would focus on uncovering the mechanism by which PTEN expression could augment viral replication.</p><p id="Par18">Interestingly, a recent report suggests that PTEN&#x003b1; induces antiviral immunity, resulting in reduced HSV infection and increased clearance by aggravating type 1 IFN responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In our studies, we did not observe any inhibitory impact of PTEN&#x003b1; production by HSV-P10 on virus infection and/or replication.

HSV-P10 infection of tumor cells resulted in loss of infection induced upregulation of PD-L1. Thus PTEN restoration might have the potential to activate antitumor immunity. Here we tested the impact of PTEN gene therapy in conjunction with oncolysis in an immune-competent brain metastases model. A single injection of HSV-P10 led to a statistically significant increase in survival of tumor-bearing mice with almost 50% of the mice displaying a complete response. We tested the ability of HSV-P10 treatment to harness a memory response against tumor cells by re-challenging long-term survivors treated with HSV-P10 with tumor implantation in the contralateral brain hemisphere. All HSV-P10 treated mice rejected the second tumor implantation, while age-matched control mice all succumbed to tumor burden.</p><p id="Par20">Enhanced therapeutic efficacy and long-term antitumor immunity were accompanied by increased CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T-cell infiltration into HSV-P10 treated tumors, and treatment of mice with the combination of HSV-P10 and anti-CD8 depleting antibody resulted in rescue of the survival advantage (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0036), while the depletion of CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;cells in mice did not affect antitumor efficacy of HSV-P10. These data clearly implicate CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T-cells as a major modulator of HSV-P10&#x02032;s antitumor effects. CD4&#x02009;+&#x02009;T-cells are responsible for activating B-cells which then mature into plasma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, and for memory T-cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. In both HSVQ- and HSV-P10-treated immunocompetent animals, we detected serum antibodies recognizing both virus and infected and uninfected DB7 tumor cell lysates, indicating that infection with either virus is capable of inducing the maturation of plasma cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that HSV-P10 enhances overall survival of brain tumor-bearing mice using a two-pronged approach: lytic tumor cell death accompanied by immune cell education and activation against the tumor. The incorporation of PTEN&#x003b1; into an oncolytic virus was able to induce a robust antitumor immune response after a single intratumoral injection, which was shown in vitro to affect tumor cell PD-L1 expression. In conclusion this study demonstrates that HSV-P10 suppresses AKT/mTOR activation, induces ATP release, and decreases PD-L1 cell membrane expression, allowing for an increased CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T-cell mediated antitumor immune response (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Conversely, HSVQ induces AKT/mTOR activity and PD-L1 expression, which diminishes the antitumor immune response observed with HSV-P10 infection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). This observation could pave the way for a paradigm shift in immunotherapy, where immune checkpoint inhibition occurs locally within the tumor rather than globally using neutralizing antibodies. This combination could significantly reduce the cost of therapy and possibly eliminate side effects associated with systemic immunotherapy by requiring only a local injection of the therapeutic virus.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of HSV-P10 antitumor activity: HSVQ (blue) infection (bottom cell) activates AKT/mTOR signaling, initiating the induction of cell surface PDL-1 that provides an immunosuppressive signal to immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Upon infection with HSV-P10 (red), PTEN&#x003b1; expression in infected cells reduces the ratio of Phosphatidyl inositol triphosphate to Phosphatidyl inositol bi phosphate (PIP3/PIP2), and thus consequently negatively regulates AKT/mTOR pathway. PTEN&#x003b1; also homes to the mitochondria resulting in increased ATP release from the tumor cells infected with HSV-P10, which activates a robust antitumor immune response. The increased infiltration of activated macrophages, neutrophils, and CD8&#x02009;+&#x02009;T-cells results in a more efficient tumor cell lysis, and translates to a better therapeutic efficacy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2018_7344_Fig10_HTML" id="d29e1512"/></fig></p><p id="Par21">It is important to note that patients with heterozygous PTEN mutations are at risk for developing autoimmunity and lymphoplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. PTEN expression in Treg cells has been shown to be important for their immunosuppressive phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> such that either genetic or pharmacologic ablation of PTEN in this cell population interferes with their suppressive properties. The tumor localized expression of PTEN by HSV-P10 likely bypasses the immunosuppressive effect of PTEN expression in Treg cells, and provides an advantage over its therapeutic modulation of this pathway. Viral infections have the power to divert immune suppressive tumor education of its microenvironment to awaken antitumor immunity: this can be a double-edged sword wherein antiviral effects can also expedite clearance of the viral therapeutic. In general we believe the antiviral effects would be limited to the virus and/or infected cells and could be considered detrimental to virotherapy as they would likely increase virus clearance from the tumor and have minimal effect on uninfected tumor cells. Antitumor immunity would enhance therapeutic benefit by synergizing with the virus for tumor cell clearance. Since we observed a complete rejection of a subsequent uninfected tumor cell challenge in mice that survived HSV-P10 treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>), and T-cells isolated from HSV-P10 treated tumor-bearing mice compared to naive mice were able to harness a significantly higher cytotoxicity against uninfected DB7 tumor cells without an enhanced virus clearance in vivo, we believe that antitumor effects contribute to the enhanced antitumor efficacy imparted by HSV-P10.</p><p id="Par22">In conclusion, this study highlights the benefits and translational significance of arming oncolytic herpesviruses with PTEN&#x003b1;.
