This study systematically compared the anti-hyperglycaemic properties of the four major commercial cinnamon types used around the world (Chinese; <italic>Cinnamomum cassia</italic> [CC], Indonesian; <italic>C. burmanii</italic> [IC], Vietnamese; <italic>C. loureirii</italic> [VC], and Ceylon; <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> [SC]). LC-MS analysis showed distinct diffrences in the phytochemical profiles of cinnamon with SC showing the lowest coumarin concentration. CC and IC had the highest polyphenol levels and antioxidant potential, and all four types differed significantly in their content (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). All cinnamon types showed potent species-specific effects on starch digestion enzyme activity inhibition (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), CC was most effective against &#x003b1;-amylase and all four strongly inhibited &#x003b1;-glucosidase compared to acarbose. Cinnamon significantly reduced starch breakdown during oral (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006) and gastric (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.029) phases of gastro-intestinal digestion with IC and SC showing consistent effects. No effects of cinnamon were seen in the intestinal phase. IC, VC and SC showed the greatest potential to inhibit formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) during digestion. In conclusion, cinnamon demonstrates anti-hyperglycaemic properties, however effects are species-specific with best overall properties seen for Ceylon cinnamon.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1007/s11130-019-00760-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cinnamon</kwd><kwd>Species</kwd><kwd>Anti-diabetic</kwd><kwd>Enzyme inhibition</kwd><kwd>Starch digestibility</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011310</institution-id><institution>Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Dietary approaches for managing hyperglycaemia centre around regulating carbohydrate digestion, absorption and glucose uptake rates. Much research has been devoted to natural products that can modulate these mechanisms as they are considered safer and more economical than drugs, and cinnamon has been studied extensively in this regard driven by its use as an antidiabetic agent in traditional medicine systems. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies suggest cinnamon exerts antidiabetic effects through inhibiting gastro-intestinal enzymes, modulating insulin response and sensitivity, improving glucose uptake, inhibiting gluconeogenesis and increasing glycogen synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Human studies assessing <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of cinnamon have shown mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, there is yet no clear consensus on the antidiabetic potential of cinnamon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and this highlights the importance of further research.</p><p id="Par3">The lack of clear evidence could be due to the diverse test materials used in studies, which vary in type (bark powder, water extracts, distillates), quantity and variety. Cinnamon variety in particular has received little research attention, and this is evident from the number of studies assessing antidiabetic effects with no mention of the variety used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The genus cinnamomum consists of over 250 varieties of which four are widely used as a spice, Chinese cinnamon (<italic>C. cassia</italic>; CC), Indonesian cinnamon (<italic>C. burmanii</italic>; IC), Vietnamese cinnamon (<italic>C. loureiroi</italic>; VC) and Ceylon cinnamon (<italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>; SC). To date no studies have attempted to systematically compare the antidiabetic properties of these four cinnamon types, despite evidence of differing compositions. A clearer understanding of their relative antidiabetic properties would be beneficial for better elucidating the potential of cinnamon as an antidiabetic agent. The objective of this study was to compare the anti-hyperglycaemic properties of the above four cinnamon types, focusing on properties related to reducing carbohydrate digestion. The specific aims of the study were to compare the bioactive, polyphenol and antioxidant profiles of cinnamon extracts, their effects on <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-amylase and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>- glucosidase enzyme, and their impact on the glycaemic potential of white bread during simulated gastro-intestinal digestion. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) exacerbate diabetic complications through increasing oxidative stress, inflammation and islet cell injury, and there is increasing focus on reducing their incidence. Both endogenously produced and dietary AGES are significant contributors to circulating pools and natural products have been shown to curtail their generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Natural products can also help reduce AGEs generation in the gastro-intestinal lumen during digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, a secondary aim was to assess the qualitative effects of cinnamon on advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) generation during gastro-intestinal digestion. The study hypothesised that the biochemical and functional characteristics of cinnamon will be species-specific, and therefore also their anti-hyperglycaemic properties.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Test Material and Preparation of Extracts</title><p id="Par4">Cinnamon bark powders were purchased from commercial suppliers (CC: Biovea Natural Foods, Scottsdale, AZ, USA; IC: Garrfen Ltd., Bradford, UK; VC: Costco Wholesale Corporation, Crick, UK; SC: Buy Whole Foods Online, Ramsgate, UK) and used to prepare freeze dried aqueous extracts as described by Cheng <italic>et al</italic>.

The PDAD scanned three channels at 280, 365, and 520&#x000a0;nm. Samples were eluted on a gradient of 5% acetonitrile (0.1% FA) to 40% acetonitrile (0.1% FA) on a Synergi Hydro C18 column (2.0&#x000a0;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;mm; Phenomenex Ltd., Macclesfield, UK) over 30&#x000a0;min at a flow rate of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L/min. The mass spectrometer used an electrospray ionization interface and the samples were analysed in negative-ion mode with two scan events: full-scan analysis followed by data-dependent MS/MS of the most intense ions (normalised collision energies of 45% arbitrary units) in wideband activation mode.

Studies have shown that hydro-ethanolic extracts demonstrate the best antioxidant and functional properties compared to fractions obtained by other methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although cinnamon bark powder is consumed widely in foods, the small quantities involved are often inadequate to provide physiologically relavent levels of bioactives, which is further hampered by poor bioavailability due to the cellulose matrix. The current study used an ethanol-water fraction to maximise the extraction of organic and water-soluble bioactives and minimise polysaccharide extraction. All four cinnamon types produced dried extract powders with good reconstitution properties. Extract yields varied between types with CC, IC, VC and SC showing yields of 17, 5, 3 and 2% respectively (g dry extract powder/100&#x000a0;g of dry bark powder). The higher extract yield of CC was noteworthy compared to the other three types, and similar levels have been previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Except for SC all other cinnamon types produced a tar-like substance when ethanol was evaporated which may be indicative of high levels of lipophilic compounds. However, all of the extracts freeze dried to a dry free-flowing powder and were readily redissolvable.</p><p id="Par16">The cinnamon extracts showed characteristic compositions by LC-MS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

There were clear differences in composition between the cinnamon types (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), especially SC which showed low levels of the hepatotoxin coumarin.

Whilst variations in starting material, extraction methods, analytical methods and data units preclude meaningful comparisons with the literature, the trends suggest that IC consistently has higher polyphenol and antioxidant contents, and this may be partly due to the greater proanthocyanidin content. However, CC showed low levels of proanthocyanidins and despite this showed an increased antioxidant and polyphenol level compared to the other cinnamon species, indicating the presence of other contributing compounds. Cinnamaldehydes have shown poorer effects on antioxidant potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and our data appears to agree with this where VC and SC demonstrated lower FRAP values despite having substantial contents of cinnamaldehyde and methoxy cinnamaldhyde. In addition, cinnamon contains other minor compounds such as, saponins, anthraquinones, and alkaloids which could contribute to its antioxidant potential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title><italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-Amylase and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-Glucosidase Enzyme Activity Inhibition</title><p id="Par20">Inhibiting digestion enzyme activity is a favoured therapeutic approach for reducing postprandial glycaemia through retarding starch digestion.

A limitation to the use of Cassia type cinnamons is their high coumarin content (5800&#x000a0;mg/kg for CC and up to 9000&#x000a0;mg/kg for IC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and current European guidelines recommend an intake cap of 0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg of body weight to avoid possible hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects.

This confirms the inhibitory effects of cinnamon on <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-amylase activity and agrees with our inhibition assay results. However, the data also shows that all three extract types curtailed starch digestion to similar degrees when used at the same concentration despite having differing amylase IC<sub>50</sub> values, and this may indicate a lower importance of absolute IC<sub>50</sub> values.

Although enzyme activity should be reduced by the low pH, the buffering effects of foods can retain activity in gastric conditions for up to 30&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and may explain the sustained effects of cinnamon on starch digestion. No studies have assessed the effects of gastric pH on cinnamon constituent functionality and this is an important area worthy of study.</p><p id="Par27">Cinnamon did not show noteworthy effects in curtailing starch digestion during the intestinal phase. This lack of effect was not reflective of our observations in the enzyme inhibition assays and one explanation may be a reduced efficacy due to dilution effects. The volume in the intestinal digestions was 72&#x000a0;mL compared to 20 and 38&#x000a0;mL in the oral and gastric phases, respectively, and the resulting reduction in extract concentrations (to 6%) may have precluded significant inhibitory effects. Although this needs to be confirmed, its practical implications are worth considering as significant dilution of food occurs in the digestive lumen due to the secretion of fluids, and this may be influencing the functionality of natural products. Furthermore, the chyme is a complex mixture where factors such as viscosity, particle size, food and secretion compositions can affect the activity of functional compounds.</p><p id="Par28">Polyphenols could influence the ratios of starch fractions such as RDS, SDS and RS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], however this study did not show any effects of cinnamon on them (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05) (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Table 2</xref> in supplementary material). The RDS by definition is the glucose released in the first 20&#x000a0;min of intestinal digestion and is indicative of the early glycaemic response phase, SDS is that digested between 20 and 120&#x000a0;min and RS that remains undigested at the end of 120&#x000a0;min. Therefore, a starch profile favouring higher SDS and RS contents could be indicative of a lower glycaemic response. Comparative data is unavailable as the effects of cinnamon on starch fractions has not been previously measured, and therefore further confirmatory studies are required.</p><p id="Par29">We also measured AGEs in digesta samples as a qualitative measure to assess effects of cinnamon on the generation of Maillard reaction products during gastro-intestinal digestion. The analytical method used in the current study only quantified fluorescent AGEs which are a less stable group of reaction products. This is evident from the large standard deviations observed in the data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), and therefore is a method best used for obtaining indicative data. The results suggest that all four cinnamon types retard AGEs formation in the oral phase of digestion compared to the control. Indonesian cinnamon, VC and SC showed the best effects in reducing AGEs, and the latter in particular. This agrees with previous data showing a beneficial effect of SC on AGEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Interestingly all cinnamons showed a peak in AGEs in the gastric phase contrary to what could be expected. The effect of pH on AGEs generation is complex and although the rate of the initial step of the Maillard reaction with the amino groups is decreased there is an increased reactivity with carbonyl groups of reducing carbohydrates at low pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The beneficial effects of cinnamon on AGEs have been ascribed to catechin, epicatechin and particularly proanthocyanidins acting as reactive carbonyl scavengers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Loss of the inhibitory activity of the extracts in the gastric phase may be due to changes in molecular conformation at the lower pH affecting the susceptibility for glycation and also the types of products formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Generation of advanced glycation end-products during gastro-intestinal digestion.

These amounts are approximately equivalent to consuming 640&#x000a0;mg of cinnamon extract with an 80&#x000a0;g portion of white bread. The promising effects observed with this relatively low level of supplementation suggests room for safely increasing levels and possibly enhancing physiological effects, however this remains to be confirmed in dose response studies.</p><p id="Par31">To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically compare the four most commercially relevant cinnamon types for some of their anti-hyperglycaemic properties. The distinct phytochemical profiles observed for the four types highlight the importance of considering cinnamon on a species-specic basis rather than as a generic whole. All four cinnamon types showed strong evidence of digestive enzyme inhibition and confirms this as a mechanistic pathway for potential antidiabetic effects. Chinese cinnamon showed the strongest activity against <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-amylase, and all four types potently inhibited <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-glucosidase activity. At practically relevant concentrations cinnamon extracts, particularly Indonesian and Ceylon types retarded starch digestion in the oral and gastric phases of gastro-intestinal digestion, however none showed effects during small intestinal digestion.
