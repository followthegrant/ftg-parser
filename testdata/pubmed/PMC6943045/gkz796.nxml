Gephebase aims to compile studies where the genotype&#x02013;phenotype association (based on linkage mapping, association mapping or a candidate gene approach) is relatively well supported. Human clinical traits and aberrant mutant phenotypes in laboratory organisms are not included and can be found in other databases (e.g. OMIM, OMIA, Monarch Initiative). Gephebase contains more than 1700 entries. Each entry corresponds to an allelic difference at a given gene and its associated phenotypic change(s) between two species or two individuals of the same species, and is enriched with molecular details, taxonomic information, and bibliographic information. Users can easily browse entries and perform searches at various levels using boolean operators (e.g. transposable elements, snakes, carotenoid content, Doebley). Data is exportable in spreadsheet format. This database allows to perform meta-analyses to extract global trends about the living world and the research fields. Gephebase should also help breeders, conservationists and others to identify promising target genes for crop improvement, parasite/pest control, bioconservation and genetic diagnostic.

Identifying the DNA sequence modifications that drive phenotypic changes is a primary goal of modern genetics, and could greatly improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind biodiversity and adaptation. However, this research program would be most successful if it reaches comparative capacity, for instance by allowing us to detect trends across the Tree of Life (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Advances in genome sequencing and editing are accelerating the rate of discovery of the loci of evolution at a quick pace, making data integration increasingly challenging, and it is now crucial to develop a universal, single resource integrating this body of knowledge. As of today, compilations of genotype&#x02013;phenotype relationships are available for a limited number of species in taxon-specific databases, for example OMIA for animals (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), OMIM for humans (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), TAIR for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), FlyBase for <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), or the Monarch Initiative across the main laboratory animal model species (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). To date, there are no databases that consolidate genotype&#x02013;phenotype relationships related to natural evolutionary cases across all Eukaryotes. For example, evolutionary changes in tigers, butterflies, monkeyflowers, or any non-traditional model organism are lacking from existing genotype&#x02013;phenotype databases, preventing comparative insights on the diversity and similarities of sequence modifications that fuel the generation of observable differences in the living world.</p><p>To fill this gap, we developed Gephebase, a manually curated database that gathers published data about the genes and the mutations responsible for evolutionary changes in all Eukaryotes (mostly animals, yeasts and plants) into a single website. The content of Gephebase was developed over the past 10 years, with previous versions of the dataset published as supplementary spreadsheet files associated to two review articles, which successively compiled 331 entries (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), and 1008 entries (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). These datasets have been used by various authors to highlight several trends regarding the genetic basis of natural variation. For example, based on these compilations it was found (a) that the mutations responsible for long-term evolution have distinct properties than the mutations responsible for short-term evolution (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), (b) that certain types of mutations are more likely to be fixed than others during the course of evolution (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), (c) that independent evolution of similar traits in distant lineages often involves mutations in the same orthologous gene (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), (d) that current data are biased towards a limited number of model organisms (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)&#x000a0;and (e) that the cis-regulatory tinkering of signaling ligand genes is a recurring mode of morphological evolution (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>We have now created an online version of the Gephebase database, accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gephebase.org">www.gephebase.org</ext-link>, and we describe here its various features.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2"><title>SNAPSHOT SUMMARY</title><p>In short, Gephebase is a searchable, manually curated knowledge-base of the genetic loci of phenotypic variation. Each entry is a pair of alleles associated to a trait variation, be it naturally existing (inter- or intraspecific), selected by breeders (domestication), or occurring during a bout of experimental evolution in the lab. For instance, forward genetic studies have determined that independently derived null mutations of the <italic>Oca2</italic> gene have caused an amelanic phenotype in at least two subterranean populations of cavefish (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and in a breed of corn snake that has been selected for the pet trade (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A Gephebase search for the <italic>Oca2</italic> gene name reveals these findings, accessible in summary tables (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) or in a more detailed output (entry view, and CSV spreadsheet format). Gephebase also indicates that some <italic>Oca2</italic> allelic variants have been identified by Genome-Wide Association Studies of pigment variation. Importantly, the focus of Gephebase is always on genetic variations that emerge naturally - it never includes laboratory variants that were generated by random or directed mutagenesis. Thus the <italic>Oca2</italic> CRISPR knockout phenotypes that have been generated in frogs (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) do not have a dedicated Gephebase entry; the cavefish <italic>Oca2</italic> CRISPR/TALEN knockout phenotypes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) do not have a dedicated entry either, but are used as Additional References to support the functionality of the two natural <italic>Oca2</italic> null alleles in Gephebase. This makes Gephebase complementary to the Monarch Initiative database, which compiles gene-to-phenotype relationships in humans, as well as in laboratory organisms and mutants generated by reverse genetics, but does not include non-model species such as cavefishes and corn snakes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>A snapshot view of the potential of Gephebase for comparative genetics. Part of the Summary Output Table of a gene name search for &#x02018;oca2&#x02019; is provided here as an example, with a montage of Gephebase summary outputs, pictures, and annotations in color. Interestingly, the cavefish studies reveal that the <italic>Oca2</italic> null alleles also affect catecholamine metabolism in cavefish. Gephebase can be used as a hypothesis generator: by juxtaposition of these entries, one may expect similar effects in the corn snake <italic>Oca2</italic> mutants that remain to be tested. &#x02018;N&#x02019; means that the mutation is <italic>null</italic>. &#x02018;D&#x02019; means that Taxon B is inferred to bear the <italic>derived</italic> trait.

Gene expression levels (eQTL) and DNA methylation patterns are not included. All kinds of traits above this level, whether morphological, physiological or behavioral, are included. For example, we include &#x02018;Recombination rate&#x02019;, &#x02018;Telomere length&#x02019;, &#x02018;Hematopoiesis&#x02019;, &#x02018;Hybrid incompatibility&#x02019;.</p><p>Cases of genomic regions associated with a trait for which the underlying gene(s) is unclear are not included in Gephebase. Cases where the gene has been identified, but not the exact mutation, are included. Stringent inclusion criteria are used so that Gephebase compile only studies where a given genotype&#x02013;phenotype association is well supported or understood. Association Mapping studies are included only if there is additional experimental support for the given gene. Candidate Gene studies require conclusive functional assays for inclusion in Gephebase. Overall, gene-to-phenotype links identified by Linkage Mapping with resolutions &#x0003c;500&#x000a0;kb have priority in the dataset. There are multiple types of experimental evidence that led to the discovery of a relationship between a genetic mutation and a phenotypic change. For sake of simplicity and efficiency, each gene-phenotype association is attributed only one type of Experimental Evidence among three possibilities: &#x02018;Association Mapping&#x02019;, &#x02018;Linkage Mapping&#x02019;, or &#x02018;Candidate Gene&#x02019; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). When several methods were used, the least biased one is chosen by the curator (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). And when new evidences emerge, they are added to the entry.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Three kinds of experimental strategies for identifying gene-to-phenotype variations. Gephebase focuses on genes that have been mapped using a forward genetics approach, and supported as the causal agents by sufficient evidence. Candidate gene approaches are also included and cover broader phylogenetic distances (e.g. human/chimp), but tend to be biased towards the identification of coding changes for relatively simple traits. The search for the genes and mutations that drive phenotypic variation is somewhat analogous to searching gold: from left to right, targeted candidate gene approaches can identify variants of large effects at loci previously identified in other organisms; in a linkage mapping approach, the experimenter walks on chromosomes to narrow down the causal genetic interval, and can increase resolution and sensitivity with the analysis of more recombinants; association mapping (e.g. GWAS) takes advantage of statistical power across large datasets to extract genetic variants in linkage disequilibrium with the causal mutations.

MariaDB (v10) is used to store data. The database consists of 33 tables including users management and logs. The main table links genotypic change, phenotypic change, references and validation information. Most fields of other tables are automatically retrieved from NCBI databases. The import procedure uses the NCBI E-utility interface with XML to fill the corresponding tables. Gephebase entries of the main table can be imported and exported through a csv file. For convenience, fields retrieved automatically can be present in the csv file even though they are fetched and stored in other tables.</p><p>The project code was put under version control (git) from its inception. The code is available in the GitHub repository <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Biol4Ever/Gephebase-database">https://github.com/Biol4Ever/Gephebase-database</ext-link> under GPL (GNU General Public License) version 3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="SEC4"><title>DATABASE CONTENT AND WEB INTERFACE</title><sec id="SEC4-1"><title>Organization of the data into entries</title><p>This database currently comprises &#x0003e;1900 entries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). One entry corresponds to a single mutation, or a group of linked mutations within a single gene, either between two closely related species or between two individuals of the same species, and its associated phenotypic change (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). For cases of repeated evolution (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), we use the following conventions. When several mutations are found within the same gene in a given individual, with each mutation affecting the trait of interest&#x02014;i.e. several causative mutations within a haplotype, intralineage hotspot (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)&#x02014;all are grouped into a single entry. In contrast, when independent mutations occur in the same gene in distinct individuals of the same species, leading to similar phenotypic changes (intraspecific parallel evolution, convergent evolution), we chose to create different entries for each lineage-specific haplotype. In cases where a genetic variant was invented once, and then spread into multiple branches of the gene pool, via Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS), secondary hybridization (introgression among organisms that are not completely reproductively isolated) or horizontal transfer, a single entry is created and multiple taxa with the derived trait are reported in the entry.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Example of a Gephebase entry.

In addition, for each entry, 20 fields are automatically fetched based on manually curated data, from NCBI Taxonomy using the Taxon ID (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), from UniProtKB using the UniProtKB ID (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and from NCBI PubMed using the PubMed ID (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Two fields are also automatically computed within Gephebase: &#x02018;Related Genes&#x02019;, which corresponds to the other genes in Gephebase associated with the same phenotypic trait in the same group of species, and &#x02018;Related Haplotypes&#x02019;, which displays the other mutations in Gephebase that are found in the same gene and that occurred in other lineage branches in the same group of species.</p><p>A single entry can include several traits if a mutation is pleiotropic. Taxon A represents the taxon(s) inferred to bear the ancestral phenotypic state and Taxon B the derived state. If the direction of change cannot be inferred, the field &#x02018;Ancestral State&#x02019; is &#x02018;Unknown&#x02019; and the two compared taxa are assigned arbitrarily to Taxon A and Taxon B.

We consider our dataset to be highly complementary to other available databases, which are more species-specific and which usually include more detailed information about genotype&#x02013;phenotype relationships. Gephebase can be used in various ways: as a powerful bibliographic tool, as a place to formulate hypotheses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), as a list of potential targets for breeders interested in transferring traits of interest to new species, as an extensive compilation for broad meta-analyses on the genetic loci of evolution, and also as a resource for epistemologists interested in biases and sociological aspects in the field of genetic evolution. Moving forward, we invite the community of scientists interested in comparative genetics and genotype&#x02013;phenotype associations to join us in our efforts to curate and synthesize accumulating data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="SEC6"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>Gephebase is freely available at gephebase.org.
