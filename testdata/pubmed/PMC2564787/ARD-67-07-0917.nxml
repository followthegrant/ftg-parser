Serum levels of IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF) decreased significantly at 24 weeks and anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) levels at 36 weeks. Peripheral blood B cells were depleted at 4 weeks and started to return at 24 weeks. Synovial B cells were significantly decreased at 4 weeks, but were not completely depleted in all patients; there was a further reduction at 16 weeks in some patients.

The kinetics of the serological as well as the tissue response in clinical responders are consistent with the notion that rituximab exerts its effects in part by an indirect effect on plasma cells associated with autoantibody production, which could help explain the delayed response after rituximab treatment.</p><p><bold>Trial registration number:</bold> ISRCTN05568900.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting synovial tissue in multiple joints. Early treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has become the cornerstone of therapy. Recently, new biological therapies, including rituximab, have become available. Rituximab is a chimaeric monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen expressed by B cells, which significantly improves disease symptoms in patients with high levels of disease activity despite treatment with methotrexate (MTX) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> This clinical effect strongly supports the notion that B cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of RA, although the exact mechanism of rituximab treatment in RA remains to be elucidated.</p><p>We have previously shown that rituximab treatment causes a rapid and specific decrease in numbers of B cells at the primary site of inflammation, the rheumatoid synovium,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> which was recently confirmed in another study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> The early synovial tissue response varies between patients, which is in contrast with the marked B cell depletion observed in the peripheral blood of nearly all patients with RA. Interestingly, in the earlier, smaller studies there was no significant decrease in numbers of inflammatory cells other than synovial B cells 4&#x02013;8 weeks after initiation of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref></p><p>Currently, no data are available on the synovial tissue response to rituximab treatment after more prolonged follow-up and its predictive value related to clinical improvement. The current study was performed to investigate the kinetics of this response in detail and to identify possible predictors of clinical response in patients with RA.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and treatment protocol</title><p>A total of 24 patients were included in this study analysing synovial biopsies at three timepoints: before treatment, at 4 weeks and 16 weeks after initiation of rituximab treatment; 17 of these patients participated in a previously reported study on the synovial tissue response to rituximab at 4 weeks only.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> The patients had active RA;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> active disease was defined as having &#x02a7e;4 tender joints and &#x02a7e;4 swollen joints of 28 joints assessed, and at least one of the following: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &#x02a7e;28 mm/h, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels &#x02a7e;15 mg/litre, or morning stiffness &#x02a7e;45 min. In addition, patients needed to be positive for IgM-RF and/or anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and have active arthritis (defined by the presence of pain and swelling) of a wrist, knee or ankle joint, amenable for arthroscopy.</p><p>All study patients were on stable doses of MTX (5&#x02013;30 mg/week) for at least 28 days prior to enrolment. Stable prednisone therapy (&#x02a7d;10 mg/day) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatments were allowed. All other DMARDs and biological agents were withdrawn at least 4 weeks prior to study inclusion, with a washout period for leflunomide, infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept of &#x0003e;8 weeks prior to randomisation. The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Center/University of Amsterdam, and all patients gave written informed consent before participation in the study.</p><p>Treatment consisted of two infusions of 1000 mg of rituximab (Roche, Woerden, The Netherlands) on days 1 and 15 after premedication with 2 mg clemastine fumarate intravenously and 1000 mg acetaminophen orally. Peri-infusional treatment with corticosteroids was not allowed, as this could have influenced the features of synovial inflammation.</p><p>The 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> was measured every month after treatment. Serum levels of IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF) and ACPA (anti-CCP2 ELISA, Immunoscan RA, Mark 2, Euro Diagnostica, Arnhem, the Netherlands) were determined at baseline and weeks 4, 16, 24 and 36 after treatment. Synovial biopsies were obtained from the same clinically involved joint at three timepoints: before as well as 4 and 16 weeks after the first infusion of rituximab.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Blood lymphocyte populations</title><p>Flow cytometry on fresh peripheral blood samples was performed at baseline and at 4, 16 and 24 weeks after the first rituximab infusion. B cells and T cell subsets were detected by real-time fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, California, USA) with antibodies against CD19, CD3, CD4 and CD8 (all from Becton Dickinson). CD19 was chosen because of its similar expression to CD20 on B cell subsets, without interference with the circulating rituximab antibody. The lower limit of detection of CD19+ B cells was set at 0.01&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> cells/litre.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Synovial biopsy</title><p>Serial synovial biopsies were collected by needle arthroscopy from the same actively inflamed joint under local anaesthesia as previously described,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> before as well as 4 and 16 weeks after the first infusion of rituximab.

CD22 rather than CD19 was used to detect B cells in tissue, as it results in more reliable staining on the tissue level. The presence of FDCs was assessed by CD23 staining and subsequently confirmed by CD21L staining.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Digital image analysis</title><p>All sections were coded and randomly analysed by computer-assisted image analysis using a Leica DM-RXA light microscope and a program written in the programming language QUIPS with specialised Qwin software (both from Leica, Cambridge, UK).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> An independent observer (Marjolein Vinkenoog, Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology of the Academic Medical Centre/University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands) who was unaware of the clinical data performed the acquisition and image analysis.

For dichotomous analysis response was determined as a decrease in DAS28 of &#x02a7e;1.2 at 24 weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and also as according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref></p><p>The Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test for unpaired data was used to compare the clinical response in patients with FDCs or lymphocyte aggregates at baseline compare to those without.

Finally, these parameters were analysed together with multiple linear regression analysis in a backward model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Clinical and demographic features</title><p>Clinical and demographic details are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ard-67-07-0917-t01">table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="ard-67-07-0917-t01" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics of the study patients</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demographic</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Median age, years (range)</td><td align="char" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55 (22&#x02013;75)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female, no.

The reduction of macrophages also showed a trend for predicting clinical improvement at week 24 in the univariate analysis (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.051), but when analysed together with the decrease in plasma cells in a multiple linear regression model, it was not an independent predictor of the decrease in DAS28 (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.216, partial correlation 0.399).</p><p>When linear regression analysis was performed on the combination of changes in plasma cells between 4 and 16 weeks and the baseline DAS28 using multiple linear regression analysis, the decrease in plasma cells continued to predict the decease in DAS28 at week 24 (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.034), whereas the baseline DAS28 alone could not predict the clinical response (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.623).

This change is also correlated to the reduction in serum ACPA levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results presented here confirm the previously reported variable tissue response of B cells after rituximab treatment, in contrast to the nearly complete depletion of B cells in the peripheral blood. Moreover, this study shows for the first time the secondary effects on cell populations other than synovial B cells, supporting the concept that B cells orchestrate synovial inflammation. In particular the change in short-lived synovial plasma cells (derived from B cells) between 4 and 16 weeks after initiation of treatment is related to the clinical response over time. These findings are consistent with the kinetics of the gradual clinical response and the slow but sure decrease in levels of circulating antibodies observed after rituximab treatment.</p><p>B cells may drive the inflammatory processes involved in RA by different mechanisms. First, B cells may drive synovial inflammation by production of autoantibodies;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> they are the precursors of short-lived plasma cells associated with production of autoantibodies, such as IgM-RF and ACPA. Second, B cells are effective antigen-presenting cells and activators of T cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> Third, B cells may promote synovial inflammation by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> Thus, depletion of B cells could interfere with different mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis.</p><p>The results from the present study show that rituximab treatment may indeed deplete B cells at the primary site of inflammation, the synovium, although there is persistence of synovial B cells in a subset of patients. The discrepancy with the complete B cell depletion observed in peripheral blood in nearly all patients might be explained by the expression of protective factors in the tissue, such as BLyS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and CD55 (decay-accelerating factor (DAF)),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> as well as the requirement for B cells to access the circulation for efficient depletion. This difference underscores the importance of analysis of different compartments to understand the effects of treatment, as has also been shown after, for example, Campath-1H treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> The variable response in the synovial tissue with regard to B cell depletion suggests that the standard therapeutic regimen is perhaps not optimal in all patients. Of note, persistence of synovial B cells was related to persistence of plasma cells. Future studies need to address the question whether it is possible to induce clinical improvement in non-responders with persistent B cells and plasma cells in the synovium. Conceivably, a subset of patients would benefit from a more intense dosing schedule. It is also possible that persistence of plasma cells in non-responders is related to the presence of long-lived plasma cells in the synovium of a subset of patients. Plasma cells with different longevity could be induced by mechanisms such as epitope spreading. For these patients alternative approaches may be considered, interfering with, for example, APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) and B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS). The present study strengthens the rationale for evaluating changes in biomarkers after targeted therapies interfering with B cells and plasma cells to further optimise the clinical response in the context of personalised medicine.</p><p>The relationship between the change in plasma cells and clinical improvement suggests that rituximab exerts its effects at least in part by an indirect effect on short-lived autoreactive plasma cells that are associated with the production of autoantibodies. Consistent with these results, there was a reduction in RF and ACPA levels after treatment; the reduction in plasma cells was directly related to the decrease in ACPA levels at week 16. These data are also in agreement with a previous study showing a trend towards lower synovial immunoglobulin synthesis 2 months after rituximab treatment, although that study was not powered to detect statistically significant changes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> A role for autoantibodies in RA has been suggested since the discovery of RF in RA and regained interest in the late nineties.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> The previously reported decrease in RF and ACPA levels after rituximab treatment relative to minor changes in total immunoglobulins suggests a role for short-lived plasma cells in their production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> This notion is supported by observations in a mouse model; rheumatoid factor transgenic mice were crossed with mice of the autoimmune-prone MRL/lpr strain, after which a spontaneous rheumatoid factor response developed. This response was mediated by continuous generation of short-lived plasmablasts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> In addition, it has been suggested that small immune complexes containing autoantibodies may drive synovial inflammation by triggering Fc&#x003b3; receptor IIIA, which is expressed by intimal macrophages.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> The results presented here would support the concept that autoantibody production by B cells and plasma cells is critically involved in promoting synovial inflammation.</p><p>Depletion of B cells did not only indirectly result in a decrease in synovial plasma cells, but there was also an effect on other major cell populations, such as T cells and macrophages. This indicates that B cells have an important role in sustaining the inflammatory cell infiltrate in the rheumatoid synovium. The decrease in synovial T cells and the disruption of lymphocyte aggregates and germinal centres, as shown by the disappearance of FDCs, supports the hypothesis that B cells influence T cell activity and organisation in the synovial tissue. Lymphocyte aggregates could be disrupted by the absence of B cell derived factors such as lymphotoxin beta.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> However, it is quite likely that the explanation is more complex, since previous work has shown that, in contrast to large follicles, relatively small lymphocyte aggregates usually contain very few B cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> Interestingly, B cell depletion also diminished macrophage infiltration, which is in agreement with the concept that there is a consistent relationship between clinical improvement and changes in synovial macrophages, independent of the primary mechanism of action of the treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> Together, the change in T cells and macrophages could be explained by an indirect effect of B cell depletion on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines involved in cell migration and retention, although this remains to be shown.</p><p>In conclusion, rituximab treatment results in a variable response on synovial B cells with secondary changes in numbers of other inflammatory cells, leading to diminished synovial inflammation. There is a direct relationship between the decrease in synovial plasma cells and clinical improvement over time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr Tom J M Smeets, Desiree Pots and Marjolein Vinkenoog for expert technical support, as well as the research nurses Margot Colombijn and Angelina Roelse.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> PPT has served as a consultant to Roche.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> DMG was supported by the Dutch Arthritis Association (Reumafonds).
