The Hh signaling pathway has been one of the most intensely investigated targets for cancer therapy, and a number of compounds inhibiting Hh signaling are being tested clinically for treating many cancers. Lung cancer causes more deaths than the next three most common cancers (colon, breast, and prostate) combined. Cyclopamine was the first compound found to inhibit Hh signaling and has been invaluable for understanding the function of Hh signaling in development and cancer. To find novel strategies for combating lung cancer, we decided to characterize the effect of cyclopamine tartrate (CycT), an improved analogue of cyclopamine, on lung cancer cells and its mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The effect of CycT on oxygen consumption and proliferation of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines was quantified by using an Oxygraph system and live cell counting, respectively. Apoptosis was detected by using Annexin V and Propidium Iodide staining. CycT&#x02019;s impact on ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial morphology in NSCLC cells was monitored by using fluorometry and fluorescent microscopy. Western blotting and fluorescent microscopy were used to detect the levels and localization of Hh signaling targets, mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, and heme-related proteins in various NSCLC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our findings identified a novel function of CycT, as well as another Hh inhibitor SANT1, to disrupt mitochondrial function and aerobic respiration. Our results showed that CycT, like glutamine depletion, caused a substantial decrease in oxygen consumption in a number of NSCLC cell lines, suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis. Further, we found that CycT increased ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby disrupting mitochondrial function in NSCLC cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Together, our work demonstrates that CycT, and likely other Hh signaling inhibitors, can interrupt NSCLC cell function by promoting mitochondrial fission and fragmentation, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and ROS generation, thereby diminishing mitochondrial respiration, suppressing cell proliferation, and causing apoptosis.

Dysregulation of the Hh pathway is responsible for various developmental malformations, such as holoprosencephaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Aberrant activation of the Hh signaling is implicated in a variety of cancers, such as prostate cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and basal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, Hh signaling pathway has become a therapeutic target for treating many types of cancers. Particularly, a great deal of efforts have been focused on targeting smoothened (SMO), a G protein-coupled receptor mediating Hedgehog (Hh) signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Many SMO inhibitors have been generated and tested, and all have shown efficacy as anti-tumor agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For example, vismodegib is the first FDA-approved SMO inhibitor for the treatment of advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma. Currently, vismodegib and many other SMO inhibitors are being investigated in clinical trials in a range of advanced cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Consequently, understanding the molecular actions of such inhibitors can be of great value to the improvement of therapeutic strategies for many types of cancers.</p><p>The first identified inhibitor of Hh signaling was cyclopamine, a molecule isolated from corn lilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Cyclopamine binds to and inhibits SMO. Cyclopamine has been very valuable for understanding the function of Hh signaling and has been widely used as an Hh inhibitor in cell and murine models of various tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the usefulness of cyclopamine (Cyc) as a therapeutic drug is hindered by its poor aqueous solubility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To improve the solubility and efficacy of Cyc, Dr. Garrossian, a contributor of this manuscript, generated cyclopamine tartrate (CycT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Indeed, CycT is water soluble, and its activity in inhibiting Hh signaling is higher than Cyc. Furthermore, CycT is effective in causing tumor shrinkage in two mouse models of basal cell carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, we decided to examine the efficacy of CycT in inhibiting the proliferation and function of an array of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines.</p><p>Previously, using a matched pair of cell lines representing normal nonmalignant and NSCLC cells developed from the same patient, we found that oxygen consumption is intensified in NSCLC cells and tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Specifically, the rates of both glucose and oxygen consumption in NSCLC HCC4017 cells are elevated, with the elevation of oxygen consumption greater than that of glucose consumption. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration interferes strongly with NSCLC cell function, proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this paper, we sought ways to suppress aerobic respiration, which may lead to novel therapeutic strategies to treat lung cancer and other cancers as well. Firstly, we found that oxygen consumption is intensified in an array of NSCLC cell lines. Secondly, we demonstrated that CycT and another SMO inhibitor SANT1, like glutamine depletion, suppress the rates of oxygen consumption and the rates of cancer cell proliferation. Further analyses of various cellular functions showed that CycT, as well as SANT1, increases ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential in NSCLC cells. Ultimately, these SMO inhibitors cause mitochondrial fragmentation, leading to apoptosis. Our studies uncovered a novel mode of anticancer action of an Hh inhibitor, which may have broad implications in the development and application of many Hh inhibitors currently being tested.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cyclopamine tartrate (CycT), like glutamine depletion, strongly suppresses oxygen consumption in NSCLC cells</title><p>Previously, we showed that the rate of oxygen consumption in NSCLC HCC4017 cells is intensified compared to the nonmalignant HBEC cells representing normal lung epithelial cells from the same patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. Additionally, we measured oxygen consumption rates in five other NSCLC cell lines and found that they were substantially increased in all NSCLC cell lines (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the effect of glucose depletion, glutamine depletion, and CycT on the rates of oxygen consumption in these NSCLC cell lines. We found that glucose depletion generally enhances oxygen consumption rates, while glutamine depletion diminishes the rates (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b-g</xref>). Glucose and glutamine are two critical fuels for cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. When glucose is limiting, the cells use glutamine, and vice versa. Thus, these results showed that in the absence of glucose, glutamine supports intensified oxygen consumption in cancer cells. In the absence of glutamine, even in the presence of glucose, oxygen consumption was substantially reduced (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b-g</xref>). Notably, CycT diminished the rates of oxygen consumption in cancer cells largely to the same extent as glutamine depletion. Likewise, another SMO inhibitor SANT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] diminished oxygen consumption in NSCLC cells, as expected. These results indicate that CycT can cause the same effect as glutamine depletion on cancer cell metabolism and aerobic respiration.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

Thus, we further examined the effect of CycT on NSCLC cell proliferation. We found that CycT diminishes the proliferation and survival of NSCLC cells, although the sensitivity of different cell lines to CycT varies (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1). We also tested whether CycT causes apoptosis in NSCLC cells by using Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining. We found that CycT indeed causes apoptosis in NSCLC cells, albeit with varying efficacy in different NSCLC cell lines. For example, after 24&#x000a0;h of treatment with CycT, H1299 cells were mostly apoptotic, as detected by Annexin V staining (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). PI staining further showed that a fraction of these apoptotic H1299 cells were in the late apoptotic stage. A549 cells, as shown by the proliferation rates in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1, were more resistant to CycT (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). After 24&#x000a0;h of treatment, only a fraction of the cells showed signs of apoptosis, as detected by Annexin V staining. No A549 cells were in late apoptotic stage (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Nonetheless, our results showed that CycT can cause apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Notably, another SMO inhibitor SANT1, like CycT, also exerted similar effects on NSCLC cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a and b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>CycT and SANT1 induce apoptosis in H1299 (<bold>a</bold>) and A549 (<bold>b</bold>) NSCLC cell lines.

Previously, we have shown that limiting intracellular heme levels strongly diminishes mitochondrial respiration and NSCLC cell proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we examined whether CycT impacts heme synthesis and metabolism. We found that CycT does not significantly affect the rate of heme synthesis in NSCLC cells (data not shown). Likewise, we found that CycT does not significantly affect the protein levels of the rate-limiting heme synthetic enzyme ALAS1 and the degradation enzyme HO1 (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a and b</xref>). For a control, we showed that CycT reduces the level of the Hh signaling target Gli1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), as expected. Furthermore, we found that CycT treatment reduced the levels of phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK. The activation of p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway has been shown to be critical for Hh signaling previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

In addition, we found that another SMO inhibitor SANT1 increased ROS generation in NSCLC cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Because of the dominant role of mitochondria in oxygen metabolism, mitochondria are mainly responsible for the generation of cellular ROS. Therefore, we also examined the effect of CycT on mitochondrial function. First, we measured and compared mitochondrial membrane potential in CycT-treated and CycT-untreated cells. We found that CycT increases mitochondrial membrane potential substantially in NSCLC cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b and c</xref>).

Vismodegib, a SMO antagonist, was the first Hh inhibitor to receive approval from the USA FDA in January 2012 for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Currently, NIH lists 91 ongoing or completed clinical trials testing Hh inhibitors against a variety of cancers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=HEDGEHOG">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=HEDGEHOG</ext-link>). Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the modes of Hh inhibitor action can benefit the treatment of a wide range of cancers. Here, by using the well-studied Hh inhibitor cyclopamine tartrate, we identified a new activity of this drug against aerobic respiration and mitochondrial function in NSCLC cancer cells.</p><p>First, we found that oxygen consumption is intensified in an array of NSCLC cell lines and that glutamine has a prominent role in promoting oxygen consumption, because glucose depletion in the presence of glutamine enhanced oxygen consumption while glutamine depletion in the presence of glucose diminished oxygen consumption substantially (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This is entirely consistent with previous studies showing glutamine as the dominant respiratory substrate in tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Remarkably, we found that CycT exerted largely the same effect on oxygen consumption as glutamine depletion (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b-g</xref>). Glutamine provides a crucial source of cellular energy and building blocks for cancer cells, and targeting glutamine uptake and metabolism has become an important approach in treating drug-resistant cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our finding linking both CycT treatment and glutamine depletion with diminished aerobic respiration provides a new way to control cancer cell bioenergetics. Although different NSCLC cell lines exhibited varying rates of oxygen consumption (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b-g</xref>), CycT, like glutamine depletion, strongly diminished oxygen consumption in all cell lines, suggesting that CycT can be an effective inhibitor of cellular energy production in all these lines. The same effect of glutamine depletion and CycT treatment suggests that Hh inhibitors may be used in substitution of drugs targeting glutamine metabolism in cancer therapy.</p><p>Second, we showed that CycT strongly suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1) and induced apoptosis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a and b</xref>). Notably, apoptosis of NSCLC cells was preceded by increased ROS generation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">b</xref>) and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). At first sight, increased mitochondrial membrane potential accompanying apoptosis may seem paradoxical. However, hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential induced by various stress factors have been observed in a wide array of cells ranging from neuronal to blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. For example, both glucose and oxygen deprivation induces mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential will lead to excessive ROS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The connection between the &#x00394;&#x003a8;m and ROS is exponential when &#x00394;&#x003a8;m exceeds 140&#x000a0;mV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Ultimately, increased ROS generation will lead to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], as indicated in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.</p><p>Third, we found that CycT strongly induced mitochondrial fission and fragmentation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). As expected, CycT-induced mitochondrial fragmentation accompanied the recruitment of Drp1 to the mitochondrial outer membrane and fission sites (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Fig. S2), consistent with previous models of mitochondrial fission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Mitochondrial fragmentation is often associated with apoptosis, although it can occur in a variety of conditions independently of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Here our results suggest that CycT-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells is associated with mitochondrial fragmentation. Interestingly, while CycT caused strong mitochondrial fragmentation in both A549 and H1299 cells, apoptosis was much less prominent in A549 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting differential sensitivity of NSCLC cells to mitochondrial fragmentation and CycT.</p><p>In sum, our results provide novel insights into the potential mechanisms of action of Hh signaling pathway inhibitors. Previous studies have shown that Gli transcriptional factors are the key mediators of Hh signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, genome-wide analyses using gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation have identified many Gli target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A careful examination of these target genes showed that there are 30 genes encoding for mitochondrial functions, such as MRPL23, GLUL, SLC25A13, PRDX6, and ATP6V1E1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These targets also include NDUFS8, a subunit of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, or Complex I; Cyb5b, a cytochrome b5 outer mitochondrial membrane isoform; 1810063B05Rik, cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 6; and catalase. Although the identification of such a relatively small number of mitochondrial targets does not allow the inference of a global effect of Hh signaling or Hh inhibitors on mitochondria, it does lend support to our new finding that the Hh inhibitor CycT impacts mitochondrial morphology and function, thereby modulating mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis. Further studies comparing SMO inhibitors, such as CycT, and Gli inhibitors may provide additional insights into which proteins in the Hh signaling pathway play a dominant role in mitochondrial morphology and function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The major findings of our study are: a) CycT, like glutamine depletion, causes a substantial decrease in oxygen consumption in a number of NSCLC cell lines; b) CycT suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in NSCLC cells; c) CycT and evidently other Hh inhibitors promote mitochondrial fission and fragmentation, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, and ROS generation; and d) Hh signaling inhibitors can act on mitochondria and cause broad and dramatic changes in mitochondrial morphology, respiration and function. These new findings can shed light on the mechanisms underlying various cancers associated with aberrant Hh signaling and can provide novel insights into how to optimize anti-Hh signaling strategy for treating cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Lung cell lines, antibodies and reagents</title><p>HBEC30KT and HCC4017 cell lines representing normal and NSCLC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] were provided by Dr. John Minna&#x02019;s lab (UTSW) as a gift.
