A lack of response to chemotherapeutic treatments shows the importance of exploring new therapeutic methods. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharma), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was originally developed for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Several studies revealed that imatinib mesylate inhibits osteoclast differentiation through the M-CSFR pathway and activates osteoblast differentiation through PDGFR pathway, two key cells involved in the vicious cycle controlling the tumour development. The present study investigated the <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of imatinib mesylate on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and migration ability of five osteosarcoma cell lines (human: MG-63, HOS; rat: OSRGA; mice: MOS-J, POS-1). Imatinib mesylate was also assessed as a curative and preventive treatment in two syngenic osteosarcoma models: MOS-J (mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic osteosarcoma) and POS-1 (undifferentiated osteosarcoma). Imatinib mesylate exhibited a dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect in all cell lines studied. The drug induced a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in most cell lines, except for POS-1 and HOS cells that were blocked in the S phase. In addition, imatinib mesylate induced cell death and strongly inhibited osteosarcoma cell migration. In the MOS-J osteosarcoma model, oral administration of imatinib mesylate significantly inhibited the tumour development in both preventive and curative approaches. A phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array kit revealed that PDGFR&#x003b1;, among 7 other receptors (PDFGFR&#x003b2;, Axl, RYK, EGFR, EphA2 and 10, IGF1R), appears as one of the main molecular targets for imatinib mesylate. In the light of the present study and the literature, it would be particularly interesting to revisit therapeutic evaluation of imatinib mesylate in osteosarcoma according to the tyrosine-kinase receptor status of patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from Pharma Novartis (Rueil-Malmaison, France) and B&#x000e9;reng&#x000e8;re Gobin received a PhD fellowship from the Region des Pays de la Loire and INSERM.

The current therapeutic sequence for high-grade osteosarcoma was proposed by Rosen et al in the 1970s and is now internationally accepted <xref rid="pone.0090795-Rosen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This treatment is based on neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, delayed en-bloc wide resection, and adjuvant chemotherapy adapted to the histologic profile assessed on tumour tissue removed during surgery. In spite of the fact that the development of polychemotherapy has clearly improved the survival and the quality of life of patients, the 5-year event-free survival has remained at a plateau of 60&#x02013;70% of patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma for over the last 40 years <xref rid="pone.0090795-Allison1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Nevertheless, in the last 10 years, better knowledge of oncogenic processes in osteosarcoma has led to the development of new therapeutic approaches based on single new drugs or administered in combination with conventional chemotherapy <xref rid="pone.0090795-Ando1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Targeting intra-cellular signaling or metabolic pathways appear as promising therapeutic approaches. For instance, mevalonate pathway may be an interesting target in osteosarcoma. Thus, the combination of apomine and lovastatine which targets the mevalonate pathways significantly reduced tumour progression in osteosarcoma-bearing mice compared to single treatment which had no effect at the doses used <xref rid="pone.0090795-Moriceau1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The mTOR inhibitor ridaforolimus has been studied in a phase II trial of patients with advanced bone sarcomas and this study revealed improved progression-free survival in advanced sarcomas including osteosarcoma <xref rid="pone.0090795-Chawla1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Moriceau <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated recently that RAD001 (everolimus) a new oral mTOR inhibitor, inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation and its combination with zoledronic acid reduced tumour development in murine models of mixed osteoblastic/osteolytic or undifferentiated osteosarcoma <xref rid="pone.0090795-Moriceau2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Similarly, NVP-BEZ235, a dual pan-PI3K-mTOR inhibitor, exhibits anti-proliferative effects in a panel of osteosarcomas and showed synergistic activity with chemotherapeutic agents and with other small signaling inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0090795-Manara1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In contrast, targeting Src, a tyrosine kinase which activates tumour cell-motility and invasion showed interesting anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity in osteosarcoma cell lines but did not exert any activity <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0090795-Hingorani1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is an orally active tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against a large panel of tyrosine kinase protein including bcr/abl, c-kit, MCSF receptor (cFMS) and the PDFG receptor among others <xref rid="pone.0090795-Savage1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Its clinical success is demonstrated by its current use as a first-line therapy for patients with bcr-abl-positive chronic myeloid leukemia <xref rid="pone.0090795-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and in gastrointestinal stromal cell tumours characterized by activating mutations of c-kit <xref rid="pone.0090795-Verweij1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In addition, imatinib mesylate exerts direct effects on bone cells. It inhibits osteoclast-resorbing activity by increasing mature osteoclast apoptosis and targeting the MCF receptor <xref rid="pone.0090795-ElHajjDib1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Moreover, imatinib mesylate also alters osteoblast differentiation with promoting <xref rid="pone.0090795-OSullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> or deleterious activities <xref rid="pone.0090795-Fierro1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It seems that the drug decreases osteoblast proliferation while stimulating their activity. All published data suggest that imatinib mesylate may transiently increase osteoblast activity and subsequently induce an opposite effect <xref rid="pone.0090795-Vandyke1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Based on these observations, imatinib mesylate may be an interesting drug for bone sarcoma and especially for osteosarcoma.</p><p>The present work aimed to analyze the biological activities of imatinib mesylate in various human, mouse and rat osteosarcoma cell lines and on primary tumour growth (at the bone site) using two different syngenic models of murine osteosarcoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethic Statement</title><p>Mice (Elevages Janvier, France) were housed under pathogen-free conditions at the Experimental Therapy Unit (Faculty of Medicine, Nantes) in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the ethical committee and under the supervision of authorized investigators.

Indeed, the current strategy for treatment of high-grade osteosarcoma is based on neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, delayed en-bloc wide resection, and adjuvant chemotherapy adapted to the histologic profile assessed on tumour tissue removed during surgery. The initial therapeutic response to the first line of chemotherapy will then condition the following therapeutic lines. Imatinib mesylate is a promising therapeutic drug targeting a large panel of tyrosine kinase proteins but also having an effect upon on tyrosine kinase targets such as quinine oxidoreductase and members of carbonic anhydrase family of metalloenzymes <xref rid="pone.0090795-Rix1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090795-Parkkila1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In this context, we investigated its effect on osteosarcoma cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> and on tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Imatinib mesylate exerts anti-proliferative activities in human, mouse and rat osteosarcoma cell lines by affecting cell cycle and inducing caspase-dependent cell death and cell migration. Murine syngenic models of osteosarcoma have been used to study the efficacy of this therapeutic agent on the primary tumour growth at the bone site. The data revealed the inhibitory activity of imatinib mesylate in undifferentiated- and mixed osteoblastic&#x02212;/osteolytic forms of osteosarcoma, in &#x0201c;preventive&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;curative&#x0201d; approaches. Finally, PDGFR&#x003b1;, Axl, PDGFR&#x003b2;, RYK, EGFR, EphA2, EphA10 and IGF1-R are key targets of imatinib mesylate in osteosarcoma.</p><p>Osteosarcomas originate from connective tissues and thus derive from mesoderm. It has been suggested that osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma and Ewing&#x02019;s sarcoma originate from multipotent cells called mesenchymal stem cells able to differentiate into fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes etc <xref rid="pone.0090795-Heymann1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090795-Deschaseaux1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090795-Tirode1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Osteoblasts and their precursors are cellular targets of imatininb mesylate. Indeed, Indeed, imatinib mesylate inhibits osteoblast proliferation and activity in particular through its inhibitory activity on PDGFR&#x003b2; <xref rid="pone.0090795-OSullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090795-Vandyke1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We obtained similar findings with stimulation of calcified matrix deposition by osteoblasts correlating with modulation of differentiation markers (cbfa1, osteocalcine, bone sialoprotein) in the presence of low doses of imatinib mesylate (until 5 &#x000b5;M) while higher doses exert opposite effect with a strong inhibition of mineral deposit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090795.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Such marked effects of imatinib mesylate on osteoblastic lineage strengthen the therapeutic interest of imatinib mesylate for osteosarcoma. Ten years ago, McGary et al demonstrated that imatinib mesylate inhibits PDGF-mediated growth and leads to osteosarcoma cell apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> by selective inhibition of the PDGFR <xref rid="pone.0090795-McGary1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The effectiveness of the drug was confirmed in murine immunodeficient model of osteosarcoma as revealed by the follow-up of tumour-associated osteolysis by radiography <xref rid="pone.0090795-Kubo1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Interestingly, expression of PDGF receptors and their ligands has been investigated in tissue micro arrays prepared from 54 osteosarcoma patients. Immunohistochemical analyses showed frequent expression of PDGFR&#x003b1; and PDGFR&#x003b2; (around 80%) and their ligands with a correlation with lower event-free survival for PDGFR&#x003b1; that was not observed for PDGFR&#x003b2; (28). In this context, the patient PDGFR status may be used as a prognostic marker in osteosarcoma and may serve to define imatinib mesylate therapy. Unfortunately, a phase II study of imatinib mesylate in children with solid tumours demonstrated little of no activity as a single agent in children with refractory osteosarcoma (10 cases evaluated) <xref rid="pone.0090795-Bond1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, there was no information on the tyrosine kinase status of patients initially enrolled. Our data revealed that among the decreased phosphorylated receptors, PDGFR&#x003b1; appears as the most sensitive target of imatinib mesylate in osteosarcoma. In addition, while all cell lines were sensitive to this drug, PDGFR&#x003b1; was expressed by all cell lines in contrast to PDGFR&#x003b2;. Our data are in agreement with the data obtained recently by Kitagawa et al <xref rid="pone.0090795-Kitagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. These authors studied the specificities of various approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors including imatinib mesylate, by activity-based kinase profiling using a panel of 310 human recombinant active kinases. They revealed that imatinib mesylate targets were in rank order of IC50 values: PDFR&#x003b1;, PDFR&#x003b2;, Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 (DDR2), DDR1, KIT, lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), yes-related novel PTK B (LYN B), LYN A and ABL <xref rid="pone.0090795-Kitagawa1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Our study demonstrated the inhibition of a set of tyrosine kinase receptors induced by imatinib mesylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090795-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Ten years ago, from 600 cDNA microarray experiments of human osteosarcoma cell lines, five genes (Axl, TGFA, COLL7A1, WNT5A, and MKK6) have been identified and were associated with adherence, motility, and/or invasiveness of cancer cells <xref rid="pone.0090795-Nakano1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. More recently, using phosphoproteomic screening, Rettew et al identified twelve receptor tyrosine kinases that were phosphorylated in two metastatic human osteosarcoma cells (143B, LM7) <xref rid="pone.0090795-Rettew1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In this extensive screening, these authors identified Axl, EphB2, FGFR2, IGF-1R and Ret as specific activated receptor tyrosine kinases and they demonstrated using functional inhibition approaches (neutralizing antibodies, antisense-mediated knockdown or small molecule inhibitors) that those specific receptors promote the in vitro behavior of metastatic osteosarcoma cell lines <xref rid="pone.0090795-Rettew1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

Among them, cKit is one of the candidates <xref rid="pone.0090795-Miiji1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. No correlation was found between c-kit expression and overall or disease-free survival however c-kit-positive tumours exhibited lower necrosis post-chemotherapy <xref rid="pone.0090795-FritscheGuenther1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Similarly the expression of EphA2 receptors is increased in osteosarcoma and modulates activation of the mitogenic signalling pathway and consequently may be involved in the oncogenic process <xref rid="pone.0090795-FritscheGuenther1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In contrast to ephrinB ligands and EphB receptors which regulate the migration, attachment and spreading of mesenchymal stem cells, and constitute a bidirectional signaling between osteoclasts and osteoblasts activating osteoclasts, EphA2 and its ligands act as a &#x0201c;coupling inhibitor&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0090795-Mstuo1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Indeed, EphA2 reverse signaling into osteoclasts enhances osteoclastogenesis and suppresses osteoblastic bone formation. Consequently, EphA2 system may contribute to the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma by modulating the communications between tumour cells and their microenvironment <xref rid="pone.0090795-Mstuo1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Mass spectrometry experiments comparing human osteosarcoma cell lines and human primary osteoblasts identified 156 surface proteins significantly upregulated on osteosarcoma cells <xref rid="pone.0090795-Posthumadeboer1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Among these proteins, EphA2 receptor 2 was the most abundant surface protein on cancer cells and was expressed in a majority of human osteosarcoma samples <xref rid="pone.0090795-Posthumadeboer1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. EphA10 may contribute to the oncologic process but its role remains under investigation <xref rid="pone.0090795-Truitt1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.
