The epidermis, consisting of keratinocytes with variable degrees of differentiation, is constantly maintained by self-renewing epidermal stem cells (ESCs) [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], skin-specific adult stem cells with a strong proliferative capacity. Following induction, ESCs differentiate into a variety of epidermal lineages to promote self-renewal and regeneration of the epidermis as well as wound healing [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Wound healing is a complex process mediated by various factors responsible for the regeneration and reorganization of damaged tissue into its normal architecture, and ESC differentiation, migration and proliferation are the basis of this process. We previously conducted work on ESC differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and migration [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; however, little is known regarding ESC proliferation.</p><p>The small GTPase RhoA, a member of the Rho GTPase family (RhoA, CDC42 and Rac), is activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Numerous biochemical, cell biological and physiological studies have demonstrated that RhoA tightly regulates actin-based structure formation [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and cell migration [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PKN (protein kinase N; also referred to as PRK, protein kinase C-related kinase) plays an important role in diverse functions, including regulation of the cell cycle [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], migration [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. PKNs can be activated by binding to Rho and certain unsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, PKN is involved in transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced expression of smooth muscle marker genes after RhoA activation [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. PKNs have been implicated in signal transduction as effectors of Rho, Rac and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>At least three isoforms of PKN are present in mammals, termed PKN1, PKN2 and PKN3 [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Notably, PKN1 regulates endometrial cancer cell proliferation by modulating TGF&#x003b2; and epidermal growth factor (EGF) dependence, promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation through WDR5 (WD repeat-containing protein 5) [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In particular, PKN1 plays a critical role in vascular wall remodeling and accelerates smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation linked to cyclin D1 [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Cyclin D1 plays a central role in regulating proliferation by linking the extracellular signaling environment to cell cycle progression [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Cyclin D1 expression is highly responsive to proliferative signals, including growth factor receptors, Ras, and their downstream effectors. However, the critical cyclin D1-mediated proliferation of ESCs has not been fully elucidated.</p><p>Our previous study suggested that RhoA was linked to ESC migration mediated by nitric oxide [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, in the present study, we employed cultured ESCs prepared from human foreskin and primarily focused on the effect of RhoA on ESC proliferation. The present study demonstrated that RhoA promotes ESC proliferation through PKN1-cyclin D1 signaling, suggesting that RhoA may be involving in wound healing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Isolation, culture and identification of primary human ESCs</title><p>Primary human ESCs (huESCs) were isolated from human neonatal foreskins using a modified method of rapid adhesion to collagen IV as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Human skin samples used for cell cultures were obtained from neonatal foreskins; the samples were de-identified and were to be discarded, which exempts the use of this tissue from requirements for informed consent according to 45CFR46. This exempt status for collection of discard skin without informed consent was confirmed by the Ethics Committee of Southwest Hospital, Chongqing, China. Briefly, foreskin was incubated overnight in 0.25% Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) at 4&#x000b0;C. Then, separated epidermis was dissociated into single cells with 0.25% trypsin for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C. The isolated cells were suspended in keratinocyte serum-free medium (K-SFM, Invitrogen, CA, USA) supplemented with 0.2 ng/ml EGF, 20 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.05 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 100 IU/ml streptomycin/penicillin.

The non-adherent cells were then immediately rinsed off. The adherent cells were further cultured with fresh K-SFM in cell culture incubators at 37&#x000b0;C with 100% humidity and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air. The medium was changed every other day. When the cells reached 60&#x02013;70% confluence, those at passages 1 (P1) and P2 were digested with TrypLE Select (Invitrogen, CA, USA) for 10 min.

Furthermore, Rho GTPases have been reported to regulate proliferation and the cell cycle in cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and nerve cells [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Recently, the Rho GTPase Rac1 was reported to regulate ESC proliferation and to determine ESC fate by controlling their exit from the stem cell compartment [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, Rho GTPase was reported to be involved in nitric oxide-induced ESC migration. We found that in contrast to a dominant-negative RhoA mutant (T19N), an active RhoA mutant (G14V) promotes ESC proliferation and cell DNA synthesis in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172613.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Additionally, in contrast to the RhoA antagonist C3 transferase, the RhoA agonist U-46619 promotes ESC proliferation during wound healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172613.g006">Fig 6</xref>), suggesting that RhoA plays an important role in ESC proliferation. ESC biological activities, such as proliferation and migration, have functions in wound healing. For example, Horii et al. [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported a link between RhoA and intestinal epithelium wound healing. In vivo, ESCs participate in wound healing via a continuous process of de-adhesion, migration, differentiation and proliferation. In this study, we attempted to detect ESC proliferation in vivo by designing a model based on the BrdU pulse-chase method reported by Taylor et al. [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] combined with IdU incorporation and their observation that double BrdU and IdU-positive cells must undergo proliferation in the re-epithelialization area. Moreover, as we previously reported, RhoA is involved in ESC migration under nitric oxide treatment [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Rho GTPases play important roles in cell migration and spreading, whereby the effect of RhoA in the wound healing process involves the promotion of ESC proliferation and migration.</p><p>There is no question based on the literature that cyclin D1 is a critical modulator of the G1/S cell cycle transition [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Cyclin D1 is a key regulator of cell proliferation, and its expression is subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Cyclin D1 protein and mRNA expression levels were up-regulated by an active RhoA mutant (G14V), and these effects were inhibited by siRNA-mediated knock-down of PKN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172613.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Moreover, the ability of RhoA to promote ESC proliferation and DNA synthesis was interrupted by PKN1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172613.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>), and the PKN inhibitor K-252a abolished the effect of U-46619 on BrdU-positive cells in the regenerated epidermis during wound healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172613.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Simultaneously, PKN1 was activated by RhoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172613.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). All these findings indicate that RhoA up-regulated cyclin D1 through PKN1 to promote cell proliferation and suggest a new mechanism by which RhoA regulates cell proliferation. It has been reported that PKN1, as the downstream effector of RhoA, regulates cytoskeleton organization [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, PKN1 can utilize coiled-coil motifs to interact with a few residues within the RhoA switch regions [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The relationship between PKN1 and cyclin D1 is nebulous and rarely reported. Singh et al. [<xref rid="pone.0172613.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that the depletion of cyclin D1 levels abolished monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)-induced PKN1 phosphorylation in smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. Our study found that cyclin D1 is a downstream regulator of PKN1, which can regulate the transcription of cyclin D1.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that RhoA plays an important role in ESC proliferation in vitro and in vivo and is likely involved in wound healing. Moreover, we found a new mechanism by which RhoA regulates ESC proliferation via activation of the PKN1-cyclin D1 signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that RhoA may serve as a new therapeutic target for wound healing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81272121).
