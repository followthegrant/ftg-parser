Past medical history was otherwise significant for severe lumbar levoscoliosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG1">1</xref>) and hepatitis C virus-related liver cirrhosis.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="FIG1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Contrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan.

EUS was requested to provide histopathological diagnosis. Upper endoscopy outlined the anatomy showing a large hiatal hernia with an intrathoracic stomach. A guidewire had to be inserted to facilitate the passage of the EUS scope into the duodenum. The linear echoendoscope was advanced down to the duodenal bulb. A 3.0 &#x000d7; 3.0 cm pancreatic tail mass was identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG3">3</xref>) with the&#x000a0;invasion of the splenic vasculature and notable malignant appearing lymph nodes.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="FIG3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Endoscopic ultrasound image showing a 3.0 x 3.0 cm hypoechoic mass lesion in the pancreatic tail (arrow).

Pancreatic masses could only be accessed through conventional techniques in the past, namely percutaneous and CT-guided biopsies in addition to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with brush cytology [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, EUS has recently overcome the other traditional modalities in assessing pancreatic lesions in view of its higher diagnostic yield, lower cost, technical ease, and improved safety profile [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a recent meta-analysis, EUS-fine needle aspiration (FNA) was found to have a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 98% in diagnosing pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].&#x000a0;If the initial procedure is nondiagnostic, it is recommended to repeat EUS-FNA given the improved diagnostic yield with repeated interventions [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several factors can affect the accuracy of EUS-FNA including adequacy of tissue sample, location of the mass, endoscopist&#x02019;s expertise, in addition to on-site cytopathology availability&#x000a0;and presence of chronic pancreatitis [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Limitations of EUS-FNA include the&#x000a0;inability to obtain a histologic architecture of the acquired tissue and an&#x000a0;indeterminate number of passes needed to attain an adequate sample in the absence of an on-site cytopathologist [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recent trials have suggested that EUS-guided fine needle biopsy (FNB) might be able to overcome these limitations [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. EUS-FNA has a complication rate of one to two percent [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Complications occur more often with pancreatic cystic rather than solid lesions and mainly include pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, infection, and tumor seeding [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Traditionally pancreatic tail lesions are best accessed through the gastric fundus as this avoids scope angulation allowing an easy passage of the needle through the biopsy channel [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, in view of our patient&#x02019;s altered anatomy and intrathoracic location of the stomach, EUS-FNA had to be performed through the duodenum [<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We present a case where EUS was the only modality capable of providing a pancreatic mass tissue sample in a patient with a challenging thoracoabdominal anatomy.
