Indians are known to be prone to diabetes at lower body mass index (BMI) and also at much earlier age as compared to Caucasians.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] India is, unfortunately, about to become diabetes capital of the world while it still has very low rates of obesity among the general population as compared to Europe and North America.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is a common perception that people with diabetes in India are generally lean. There are numerous population-based studies documenting the occurrence of diabetes at much lower BMI in Indians.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, studies documenting the actual prevalence of overweight/obesity among people with diabetes in India are scant or nonexistent.

Most of the patients coming to clinic belong to upper middle socioeconomic strata and are highly educated. At the clinic, all patients are being given prescription using electronic medical software &#x0201c;Healthvriksh EMR, version 1 (Kalpavriksh Healthcare, Delhi, India)&#x0201d; since May 2015. This allows us to capture all clinical data longitudinally for all patients. Vital signs of all patients, including height and weight, are recorded at each clinic visit by our trained staff and entry is done in the electronic medical record (EMR) by the same person immediately. This minimizes the possibility of clerical errors in data. Height is measured using standard wall-mounted stadiometer. Weight is measured using an electronic weighing scale that is calibrated yearly by the competent external agency. Retrospective data of all patients with diabetes were captured from clinic EMR from May 2015 to March 2017 period and were analyzed. Data were analyzed descriptively to assess the prevalence of obesity and overweight among people presenting with diabetes at our center. BMI cutoff for overweight was kept at 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and BMI &#x02265;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was classified as generalized obesity as per the accepted norms for the Indian population.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Further, subset analysis of people with new-onset diabetes was done. For statistical analysis, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Data of total 1473 patients were retrieved.

The situation is perceived to be changing, especially in urban areas, with rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In fact, there is a paucity of data documenting the actual prevalence of different weight categories in people with diabetes. In population, as a whole, the prevalence of obesity in general is still low as compared to western countries, though it is increasing at rapid pace.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In a study by Ramachandran <italic>et al</italic>., 46.8% of people with diabetes had BMI more than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in 2001 from an urban population.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In ICMR-INDIAB 3 study, a survey done from 2008 to 2010 among mixed (rural as well as urban) population, 48.5% people with diabetes had BMI &#x0003e;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> as compared to 16.9% in people with normal glucose tolerance.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In contrast, the current study shows that 71.5% people with diabetes have same amount adiposity. Among Indians, predisposition at lower BMI and increasing adiposity may prove to be a double whammy for the prevalence of diabetes in the foreseeable future. This trend has been very well delineated in CAARS cohort, showing 25.2% prevalence of diabetes and 47.6% of prediabetes.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Over the years, there are studies showing a gradual increase in the mean BMI of people suffering from diabetes [<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>]. However, no study has tried to find the actual prevalence of overweight/obesity in people suffering from diabetes. Out dataset fills this lacuna in literature. However, these data are from the highly urbanized area of NCT of Delhi and may not represent Indian population in general. However, the strength of the study lies in fact that data have been recorded at the clinic by trained staff using calibrated instruments.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Indian studies documenting BMI in people with diabetes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJEM-22-429-g004"/></table-wrap><p>Subset analysis of people with recent onset diabetes further strengthens the BMI data and confirms our worse fears.</p><p>Another frightening aspect brought to the notice is the highest incidence happening in 30&#x02013;35 years age group followed by in 35&#x02013;40 years [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Now, as much as 47.2% cases are reported at &#x0003c;40 years of age which is again way more than reported previously.
