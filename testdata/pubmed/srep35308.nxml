In this study, we demonstrated the oncogenic role of PTP1B in promoting colon carcinogenesis and predicting worse clinical outcomes in CRC patients. By co-immunoprecipitation, we showed that PITX1 was a novel substrate of PTP1B. Through direct dephosphorylation at Y160, Y175 and Y179, PTP1B destabilized PITX1, which resulted in downregulation of the PITX1/p120RasGAP axis. Interestingly, we found that regorafenib, the approved target agent for advanced CRC patients, exerted a novel property against PTP1B. By inhibiting PTP1B activity, regorafenib treatment augmented the stability of PITX1 protein and upregulated the expression of p120RasGAP in CRC. Importantly, we found that this PTP1B-dependant PITX1/p120RasGAP axis determines the <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-CRC effects of regorafenib. The above-mentioned effects of regorafenib were confirmed by the HT-29 xenograft tumor model. In conclusion, we demonstrated a novel oncogenic mechanism of PTP1B on affecting PITX1/p120RasGAP in CRC. Regorafenib inhibited CRC survival through reserving PTP1B-dependant PITX1/p120RasGAP downregulation. PTP1B may be a potential biomarker predicting regorafenib effectiveness, and a potential solution for CRC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world, with more than 1.3 million new cases diagnosed annually<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Interestingly, there is a large geographic difference in the worldwide distribution of CRC; the difference of incidence between countries with the highest and the lowest rates varying up to 10-fold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. A canonical multistep process involving sequential genetic mutations in APC, K-ras and p53 has been established to explain colon carcinogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>; however, the global heterogeneity in CRC incidence indicates that such a model is not fit to explain all CRC patients. Thus, it is important to investigate potential oncogenic factors associated with the development of CRC, especially those that may link tumor biology to known environmental and lifestyle risk factors, such as obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and insulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> resistance of CRC.</p><p>Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B, <italic>PTPN1</italic>), the prototypic member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase superfamily, has been implicated in multiple signaling pathways associated with cell growth and metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. PTP1B is known to attenuate signaling from insulin and leptin receptors, and, thus, play a major role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Distinct from the clear functions characterized in metabolic regulation, the effects of PTP1B on carcinogenesis are far more complex. PTP1B was originally considered to play a tumor suppressor role counteracting activated tyrosine kinases, such as Bcr-Abl, &#x003b2;-catenin, and epithelial growth factor receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>; however, a growing body of evidence also supports the notion that PTP1B is actively involved in promoting carcinogenesis by interacting with several oncogenic substrates, including HER2/<italic>Neu</italic>, ERK1/2, p62Dok and Src<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The seemingly contradictory effects of PTP1B on oncogenesis reflect the complex interplay of PTP1B-regulated signaling and the diverged oncogenic addiction on metabolism and growth signaling in each cancer type. For CRC, Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. described a positive role for PTP1B in the promotion of colon carcinogenesis through Src Activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and overexpression of PTP1B was found to be an important prognostic factor in CRC patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Intriguingly, Tremblay and colleagues suggested that PTP1B has a positive regulatory role in Ras activity by finding that upregulation of p120 Ras GTPase-activating protein (p120RasGAP, RASA1) and p62Dok phosphorylation were presented in PTP1B-deficient fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Given the crucial role of Ras signaling in insulin receptor signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and colon carcinogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, it is of great interest to explore the cross talk between PTP1B and Ras signaling in CRC.</p><p>In the current work, we describe a novel oncogenic mechanism of PTP1B in CRC through affecting the PITX-1/p120RasGAP axis. By dephosphorylating PITX-1, the transcription factor of p120RasGAP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, PTP1B destabilizes PITX-1 protein and downregulates p120RasGAP to promote proliferation of CRC cells. Furthermore, we show that the expression of PTP1B in clinical CRC tumors is negatively correlated with p120RasGAP, but positive correlated with p-Erk expression, one indicator for activation of Ras signaling. Overexpression of PTP1B predicts early development of metastasis and shorter overall survival in CRC patients. Moreover, we further identified that regorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that has been approved for chemo-refractory metastatic CRC patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, modulates PTP1B/PITX-1/p120RasGAP signaling in CRC.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>PTP1B is a novel oncoprotein in colorectal carcinoma</title><p>To understand the role of PTP1B in CRC, we first examined the expression of PTP1B in a panel of cell lines containing CRC and normal colon cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>, PTP1B was highly expressed in all CRC cell lines, but not in the CCD-18Co cells (normal fibroblasts from the colon). Interestingly, we found very similar results when analyzing clinical samples obtained from 242 CRC patients, whose basic characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplement Table 1</xref>. The expression of PTP1B was higher in the tumor tissue compared to the adjacent normal part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, patients with overexpression of PTP1B had more aggressive clinical presentation. Within a median 46 months follow-up period, 43.3% patients with high PTP1B expression had newly-identified metastatic disease, while it was 16.4% in patients with low PTP1B expression. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we found that overexpression of PTP1B significantly defined a subgroup of patients with worse overall survival (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>) and metastatic&#x02013;free survival (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we sought to understand the impact of PTP1B on promotion of carcinogenesis in CRC using three different assays. First, by MTT, we found that overexpression of PTP1B significantly increased the proliferation rates of all CRC cells, while PTP1B silencing resulted in reduced proliferation of HCT-29 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). Correspondingly, the number of colonies formed by DLD1 cells with ectopic expression of PTP1B was nearly two times more than that of mock-treated cells, while PTP1B-knockdown Hct116 and Hct29 cells generated fewer colonies than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Last, we performed sphere formation assay and found that overexpression of PTP1B significantly potentiated the sphere forming ability of DLD1 cells, while knockdown of PTP1b reduced the number and size of CRC spheres formed by DLD1 and Hct29 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplement Figure 1</xref>). Together these results show that overexpression of PTP1B is a recurrent event in CRC patients and was associated with worse clinical outcome. Moreover, PTP1B expression was critically associated with the carcinogenic properties of CRC cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PTP1B affects the PITX1/RasGAP axis in CRC cells</title><p>To explore the mechanism by which PTP1B promotes carcinogenesis, we examined the biological impact of PTP1B-overexpression in CRC cells. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of PTP1B in DLD1 and Hct-116 cells significantly downregulated the expression of p120RasGAP and Pitx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). To confirm this finding, we knocked down PTP1B in CRC cells, and, indeed, the expression of p120RasGAP and PITX-1 was upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). According to the literature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, PITX-1 is involved in regulating the transcriptional activity of RasGAP. Thus, we sought to validate this relationship by examining the endogenous expression of PITX-1 and p120RasGAP in CRC cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>, the endogenous expression of these two proteins were highly correlated. Therefore, we postulated that PTP1B induced downregulation of p120RasGAP via affecting PITX1 and inhibition of the PITX-1/RasGAP axis mediates the oncogenic effects of PTP1B in CRC.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PTP1B downregulates the expression of PITX1 through affecting phospho(Y)-PITX1</title><p>Next, we examined whether and how PTP1B affects the expression of PITX1/p120RasGAP through PITX1. Using endogenous and overexpression co-immunoprecipitation assay, a direct association between PITX-1 and PTP1B was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplement Figure 2A</xref>). Since PTP1B is known to be a tyrosine phosphatase, we postulated that PTP1B affects the expression of PITX-1 by dephosphorylation. To prove our hypothesis, we manipulated the expression level of PTP1B and examined the phospho(Y)-status of PITX1. In DLD1 cell with ectopic expression of PTP1B, we found that the phospho(Y)-PTIX1 was downregulated; and conversely, silencing of PTP1B resulted in upreguation of phospho(Y)-PITX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplement Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, we observed a dose-dependent increase in the expression of the phospho(Y)-PITX1 after PTP1B inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>, left panel). Moreover, in line with the change in phospho(Y)-PITX1, the expression of p120RasGAP and PITX1 was also upreguated by PTP1B inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplement Figure 3A,B</xref>). Collectively, the above data indicated that PTP1B dephosphorylates PITX1 at certain tyrosine residue(s) that results in destabilization of PITX1 and downregulation of p120RasGAP.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>PTP1B dephosphorylates PITX-1 at Y160, 175 and Y179</title><p>To clarify which tyrosine residue(s) are involved in PTP1B-mediated PITX1 dephosphorylation, we applied NetPhos 2.0 Server<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, and three potential tyrosine residues, Y160, Y175 and Y179, were identified. We generated three site-specific mutations of PITX1, namely Y160F, Y175F and Y179F, and examined the effects of PIP1B on DLD1 cells with transient expression of these mutation constructs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>, distinct from that observed in cells expressing wild-type PITX1, the phospho(Y)-status of all three mutations were not affected by PTP1B overexpression, indicating that PTP1B potentially dephosphorylates PITX-1 at these three tyrosine residues. Furthermore, we exposed DLD1 cells expressing the wild-type and the three mutant forms of PITX-1 to cycloheximide (CHX) treatment, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Interestingly, we found that degradation of PITX-1 protein was significantly enhanced in the above-mentioned mutations in comparison with the wild-type PITX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplement Figure 3C</xref>), implying that these three tyrosine sites are critical in determining the stability of PITX-1 protein. Moreover, Lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor, induced potent augmentation of PITX-1 expression in cells expressing wild-type PITX1; but such effects were lost in cells expressing mutant PITX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that PTP1B has a critical role in promoting the proteasomal degradation of PITX1 through dephosphorylating PITX-1 at Y160, Y175 and Y179.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Regorafenib inhibits the phosphatase activity of PTP1B and upregulates the expression of PITX-1/p120RasGAP</title><p>Given the known crucial role of RAS signaling in CRC and the novel mechanism of PTP1B in regulating p120RasGAP that we have characterized in the current project, we were interested to know whether targeting PTP1B exerts therapeutic potential against CRC. Thus, we explored the role of PTP1B/PITX1/p120RasGAP signaling as associated with the effects of regorafenib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>), an approved oral target agent for the treatment of CRC. Interestingly, we found that regorafenib inhibited the phosphatase activity of PTP1B. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>, regorafenib dose-dependently decreased the PTP1B phosphatase activity in DLD1 cell lysate (left panel) and recombinant PTP1B protein (right panel). Furthermore, we found that the expressions of PITX1 and p120RasGAP, which are associated with activation of apoptotic signals, were correspondingly upregulated by regorafenib treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplement Figure 4A,B</xref>). Previously, we showed that PTP1B affects the expression of PITX-1/RasGAP by promoting proteasomal degradation of PITX-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E,F</xref>). Thus, we checked whether the effects of regorafenib on PITX1 expression did act on preventing its degradation. We examined the half-life of PITX1 by exposing DLD1 cells to CHX and/or regorafenib. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplement Figure 4C</xref>, regorafenib indeed delayed the protein turnover of PITX1. Moreover, we used MG-132, a specific proteasome inhibitor, to validate the role of proteasome degradation in mediating the effects of regorafenib. In line with our hypothesis, we showed that regorafenib-induced PITX1 augmentation was blocked by MG-132 in DLD1 and Hct-15 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplement Figure 4D</xref>). Collectively, our data suggested that regorafenib potentially affects Ras activity by inhibiting PTP1B-dependent PITX1-p120RasGAP downregulation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Direct interaction with the PTP1B/PITX1/p120RasGAP axis determines the anti-CRC effects of regorafenib</title><p>To validate our findings on the novel mechanism of regorafenib, we further manipulated the level of PTP1B, PITX1 and p120RasGAP and examined their impacts on affecting the effectiveness of regorafenib. First, we overexpressed PTP1B in DLD1 cells and examined the effects of regorafenib. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>, regorafenib treatment led to significant upregulation of RasGAP and apoptosis of DLD1 cells, and these effects were diminished by overexpression of PTP1B. On the other hand, DLD1 cells with silencing of p120RasGAP (<italic>RASAL1,</italic>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>) and PITX1 (<italic>PITX1,</italic>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>) reversed the effects of regorafenib on promoting apoptosis. Furthermore, we performed molecular docking to dissect the potential docking sites of regorafenib in PTP1B. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>, regorafenib was docked into a groove between helices &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;6 in the catalytic domain of PTP1B, and interacted with the WPD loop via electrostatic and von der Waals force. Collectively, our data illustrates a new mechanism of action of regorafenib in CRC, i.e. direct targeting the novel oncoprotein, PTP1B, and subsequent upreguation of the expression of PITX-1/RasGAP.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Inhibition of PTP1B mediates the <italic>in-vivo</italic> anti-tumor effects of regorafenib</title><p>To validate the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of regorafenib on the PTP1B-PITX-1-RasGAP axis, we tested the effects of regorafenib in a clinically relevant CRC animal model. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>, regorafenib treatment significantly inhibited the growth rate of HT29 subcutaneous xenograft tumor. Average tumor weight was also reduced in the regorafenib arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Importantly, the PTP1B activity was significantly inhibited in the tumor lysate obtained from regorafenib-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7C</xref>). In agreement, the expression of PITX-1 and RasGAP in mice treated with regorafenib was higher than mock-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7D</xref>). Furthermore, we validated the clinical relevance our finding by examining the clinical tumor samples from the cohort we characterized above. First, we found a negative association between PTP1B and p120RasGAP expression (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7E</xref>). More interestingly, we showed that the expression level of PTP1B was significantly correlated with p-ERK, one important downstream factor of Ras signaling (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplement Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, CRC patient with low- or non-expression of PTP1B and p-ERK had superior overall survival than the others (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05). Concluded from the findings in CRC animal model and the clinical tumors consolidate the role of PTP1B in regulating Ras signaling and mediating the therapeutic effects of regorafenib. Further study to investigate the potential of targeting PTP1B for the treatment of CRC is warranted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the complex network of signaling that PTP1B involved, the &#x0201c;net effect&#x0201d; of PTP1B plays in individual cancer may be different and should be discussed separately. In the current work, we showed that PTP1B is sufficient and necessary for the maintenance of CRC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplement Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, we, for the first time, described how this novel oncoprotein interacts with the Ras signaling in CRC. Ras signaling has long been known as one of the fundamental mechanisms that drives colon carcinogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Occurrence of the activating mutations of Ras gene in codon 12, 13 and 61 is regarded as the most common cause explaining aberrant activation of Ras signaling in cancer. However, only half of CRC patients presented with detectable genetic mutation of the <italic>Ras</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Thus, it is of great interest to explore other regulatory mechanisms of Ras signaling associated with the development of CRC. Here, we showed that PTP1B downregulated the expression of p120RasGAP via destabilizing PITX-1, the transcription factor of p120RasGAP in CRC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). Through directly dephosphorylating PITX-1 at Y160, Y175 and Y179, PTP1B promoted proteasomal degradation of PITX-1, thus leaded in downregulating p120RasGAP and CRC cell survival. Above findings were not only validated vigorously be a serial knockdown and overexpression experiments, but also echoed the findings we observed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Given the distinct biological backgrounds, especially regarding RAS mutation status, the commonality of PTP1B we found in CRC and HCC is interesting, and further studies is warranted.</p><p>The activity of Ras protein is controlled by the ratio of bound GTP to GDP, and alternation between the active Ras-GTP and inactive Ras-GDP is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP, and GAPs, which terminate the active state by stimulating GTP hydrolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that deregulation of GAPs has a critical role in promoting carcinogenesis. For example, germline mutational loss of neurofibromin (NF1), a member of the Ras GAP family, resulted in the autosomal dominantly inherited disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is known to increase risk of developing neuroblastoma or other tumors of the peripheral and central nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. p120RasGAP is a member of the Ras GAPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, and its roles in colon cancer has been discussed in the work presented by Ohta <italic>et al</italic>., which showed that decreased expression of p120RasGAP by epigenetic silencing was associated with colorectal tumor progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Ectopic overexpression of p120RasGAP defected the growth rate of CRC cells, while knockdown of p120RasGAP significantly potentiated the growth rate of PMFko14 xenograft tumor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. For other cancer types, somatic inactivation of p120RasGAP was reported in thyroid, nasopharyngeal, esophageal and gastric cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, and a potential tumor suppressor role of p120RasGAP in basal cell carcinoma, and triple negative and HER2 positive subtypes of breast cancer was also suggested by genetic studies and integrative bioinformatics analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Notably, Ingrid <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated the effects of PITX1 on transcriptionally upregulating the expression of <italic>RASAL</italic>1 that resulted in suppression of Ras activity and tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Furthermore, low levels of expression of PITX1 were found to be predict worse survival of CRC patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Together with our data, dysregulation of PITX-1/p120RasGAP axis may be an important mechanism, in addition to mutation of Ras gene, explaining deregulated Ras signaling in cancer cells.</p><p>In the present study, we reported for the first time that regorafenib inhibits PTP1B activity in CRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7</xref>). Treatment with regorafenib significantly delayed the turnover of PITX-1 protein and upregulated the expression of PITX-1 and p120RasGAP in a dose- and time-dependent manner through inactivating PTP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Importantly, the effects of regorafenib on the PITX-1/RasGap axis and induction of cell apoptosis were significantly diminished in cells with overexpression of PTP1B and knockdown of PITX1 or p120RasGAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Importantly, our results suggest that regorafenib inhibited the activity of PTP1B by direct interaction with its catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>, right panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>). The idea of using PTP1B inhibitor as an anti-cancer treatment was first suggested by observing that a specific PTP1B inhibitor significantly delayed the development of breast tumor in NDL2 transgenic mice via attenuating the MAPK and Akt pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Recently, Krishnan <italic>et al</italic>. also showed the efficacy of MSI-1436, a novel allosteric inhibitor of PTP1B, against HER2-driven breast tumor and abrogated the development of pulmonary metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Our data suggest the exciting possibility of applying PTP1B inhibitor against CRC. Given the well-known roles of PTP1B in regulating insulin and leptin signaling, the development of a PTP1B inhibitor for the treatment of diabetes and obesity is already in progress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Therefore, it is worth further exploring the effectiveness of these potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors for the treatment of cancer, especially the cancer types like CRC and breast cancer that are associated with metabolism. In addition, our data indicated that PTP1B expression may be a novel biomarker to predict effectiveness of regorafenib treatment in CRC patients. Further studies are required to explore this issue.</p><p>As described before, PTP1B is an important regulator of cell metabolism and has a strong link with the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. In this project, in addition to dissect the association of PTP1B and the clinical aggressiveness of CRC patients, we also tried to known whether PTP1B may link metabolic disorder to colon carcinogenesis. By analyzing clinical tumor samples with immunohistochemical stain, we showed that overexpression of PTP1B is a recurrent event in CRC patients and associated with a shorter metastatic-free survival and overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Our results echoed the findings of the other two groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Furthermore, we showed a significant positive correlation between PTP1B and p-Erk, one important indicator for activation of Ras signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplement Figure 5</xref>), supporting the importance of PTP1B in regulating Ras signaling. Interestingly, we also found a trend of increasing risk in CRC patients with PTP1B overexpression to be co-morbid with type 2 diabetes mellitus (data not shown). Above findings not only add knowledge to the oncogenic properties of PTP1B in CRC, but also offer new clues to link insulin resistance with colon carcinogenesis.</p><p>In this study, we reported a novel oncogenic property of PTP1B in CRC. By direct dephosphorylation of PITX1 at three potential tyrosine residues, PTP1B promotes proteasome degradation of PITX1 and downregulation of p120RasGAP. By directly inhibiting the phosphatase function of PTP1B, regorafenib restored the expression of PITX1/p120RasGAP and promoted apoptosis of CRC cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture, reagents and antibodies</title><p>The colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines Hct-15, Hct-116, SW-480, DLD1 and HT-29 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); and CCD-18Co, the normal colon fibroblast cell line, was maintained in Eagle&#x02019;s Minimum Essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS.

(<bold>C</bold>) Specific PTP1B inhibitor treatment increased the phospho-tyrosine status of PITX1 and augmented PITX1/p120RasGAP expression in CRC cells. The phospho-tyrosine status of PITX1 in PITX1-overexpressed DLD1 cells were determined by immunoprecipitation assay after exposing to PTP1B inhibitor treatment at the indicated doses for 4 hours (left panel). The expression of PITX1/p120RasGAP after PTP1B treatment described above were also examined by western blot (right panel). Representative images of triplicated experiments were shown here. (<bold>D</bold>) PTP1B interacted with PITX-1 at three tyrosine residues, namely Y160, Y175 and Y179. PTP1B could only induced PITX-1 phosphorylation change in wild-type PITX-1-expressing cells. Phospho-(T)-PITX1 in DLD1 expressing wild-type, Y160F-, Y175F-, and Y79F-mutant PITX1 were determined by immuneprecipitation and immunebloting. Representative images of triplicated experiments were shown here. (<bold>E</bold>) PTP1B-dependent dephosphorylation reduced the stability of PITX-1. DLD1 cells with different PITX-1-phospho-mutants were treated with 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated times and analyzed by western blot. Representative images of triplicated experiments were shown over the left panel. The quantified results of PITX1 expression in each experiment were shown over the right panel (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3). (<bold>F</bold>) Degradation of wild-type and mutant PITX-1 protein were affected by lactacystin treatment. Effects of proteasome inhibitor, Lacacystin, on wild-type or the three mutants PITX-1 were examined by western blot (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;3).</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep35308-f4"/></fig><fig id="f5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Regorafenib upregulates PITX1/p120RasGAP axis through inactivation of PTP1B.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structure of regorafenib.
