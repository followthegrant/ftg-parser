To analyze CD4 T cell reactions against IgG in various physical states, we developed an adoptive transfer model using CD4+ T cells specific for a V&#x003ba; region-derived peptide in the hapten-specific IgG mAb 36&#x02013;71. We found that heat-aggregated or immune complexes (IC) of mAb 36&#x02013;71 elicited anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, while the deaggregated form was tolerogenic. All 3 forms of mAb 36&#x02013;71 induced proliferation of cognate CD4+ T cells, but the aggregated and immune complex forms drove more division cycles and induced T follicular helper cells (T<sub>FH</sub>) development more effectively than did the deaggregated form. These responses occurred despite no adjuvant and no or only trace levels of endotoxin in the preparations. Physical analyses revealed large differences in micron- and nanometer-sized particles between the aggregated and IC forms. These differences may be functionally relevant, as CD4+ T cell proliferation to aggregated, but not IC mAb 36&#x02013;71, was nearly ablated upon peritoneal injection of B cell-depleting antibody. Our results imply that, in addition to denatured aggregates, immune complexes formed <italic>in vivo</italic> between therapeutic mAb and their intended targets can be immunogenic.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30DK091102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>St. Clair</surname><given-names>J.

While the historical literature would suggest that soluble, bivalent IgG is profoundly tolerogenic and suppresses Ig-specific humoral responses, therapeutic mAbs can be immunogenic and commonly elicit anti-Id responses in some percentage of recipients, particularly in populations treated for autoimmune diseases. The clinical ramifications of anti-mAb have varied in individual clinical trials, but meta-analyses have confirmed decreased therapeutic efficacy and increased adverse events such as hypersensitivity reactions [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To prevent the development of high affinity antibodies directed against therapeutic mAb, researchers and physicians have adopted a number of strategies, with varying practical and theoretical costs and benefits, many of which target CD4+ T cell responses to Ig-derived peptides [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>This focus on the immunogenicity, or tolerogenicity, of Ig for CD4+ T cells is based upon a historical dichotomy in the literature. Dresser first revealed the tolerogenicity of deaggregated, heterologous gamma globulin in 1961 [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Chiller, Habicht, and Weigle demonstrated that both mouse T helper cells and B cells could be tolerized by polyclonal, deaggregated human gamma globulin, and that T cell tolerance was both long lived and dominant when thymocytes were adoptively transferred into irradiated animals along with normal bone marrow [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, Janeway and Paul reported the augmentation of anti-idiotypic antibody production to a hapten-conjugated antibody if mice received a hapten-targeted antisera [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This suggested a potential adjuvant role for immune complexes, however the experiment was complicated by the hapten-conjugation to the targeted antibody which led to low anti-idiotypic production without antisera, a potential consequence of novel T-epitopes, aggregation, or endotoxin [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In a more recent study, Reitan and Hannestad found that a pentameric IgM form of a monoclonal Ig without adjuvant or endotoxin was immunogenic, while the IgG form was not, even after multiple injections [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Finally, inclusion of certain peptides into the structure of IgG renders them tolerogenic for CD4+ T cells and mitigates pathology in a mouse model of autoimmune disease [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Despite evidence for the tolerogenic properties of IgG, therapeutic IgG mAbs often elicit IgG antibody directed against the infused mAb [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This occurs even when the therapeutic mAb are encoded by entirely human Ig genes. While the CD4+ T cell repertoire attains self-tolerance to germline Ig V region sequences, somatically generated diversity arising at boundaries of V region genes during B cell development or throughout the entire V region via somatic hypermutation is potentially antigenic [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170556.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In cases where it is antigenic, this somatic diversity may provide an avenue of T cell help to any B cell specific for the idiotype of a therapeutic mAb. However, antigenic peptide sequences in Ig alone may be insufficient to elicit a productive anti-Id response, which has led researchers to hypothesize that mAbs are more likely to be immunogenic if they are aggregated during handling, targeted to a cell surface antigen, or engaged in immune complexes [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Prior studies in experimental models generally assessed CD4+ T cell reactions to IgG under circumstances in which the IgG could not form immune complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>, either because the IgG was polyclonal and nonspecific or because the cognate antigen for a monoclonal IgG was not present [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170556.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170556.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. And in most of these studies, analyses were limited because they involved wildtype i.e. nontransgenic T cells.</p><p>To resolve this divide between immunogenicity and tolerogenicity of IgG, we have sought to investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> response of a single CD4+ T cell clone to an antigenic IgG mAb in various physical states. Using an adoptive transfer model, we demonstrate that aggregated and complexed Ig without adjuvant are immunogenic and elicit IgG anti-Id antibodies, while monomeric Ig induces a profound state of self-tolerance that subverts an anti-idiotypic response.</p><p>This dichotomy between immunogenicity and tolerance is mirrored by differences in the early proliferation of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells and development of T<sub>FH</sub>. Finally, we show that heat-aggregated and complexed Ig, while both immunogenic, have notably different structural profiles and distinct requirements for CD4 T cell activation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken as a whole, our data suggest that immune complexes may be a common catalyst for productive activation of CD4+ T cells that drive anti-Id responses against therapeutic IgG targeting soluble antigen, in stark contrast to the tolerogenicity of these mAb in an uncomplexed deaggregated form.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Mice</title><p>Three background strains, A/J, C;129S4-Rag2<sup>tm1.1Flv</sup> Il2rg<sup>tm1.1Flv</sup>/J (Rag2-/-c&#x003b3;-/-) and (B6 x A/J)F1 (B6AF1) mice were bred in house.

Therefore, we evaluated the physical states of the various preparations, using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), particle-tracking analysis (PTA), and microflow imaging (MFI).

The aggregated preparation, on the other hand, contained only a minute amount of monomeric IgG. In fact, very little protein entered the SEC column once large insoluble particles were removed by a low speed centrifugation step (note the change in scale of the Y-axis). In contrast, a large amount of IgG entered the column from the IC preparation. This included some monomeric IgG, as well as complexed IgG, which was evident as a peak at 6.25 minutes. These size-exclusion data were consistent with PTA data, which revealed relatively few particles with radii in the 1 to 200 nm range (&#x0003c;10<sup>6</sup> particles/ml/size bin) for the deaggregated and heat-aggregated preparations, each of which were within the range observed for the PBS/histidine-trehalose buffer controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170556.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).

To test this, we injected 500 &#x003bc;g of anti-CD20 (5D2, IgG2a/&#x003ba;) or a control IgG2a/&#x003ba; (anti-ragweed) i.p. into mice one day prior to initiating our standard adoptive transfer with CA30 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170556.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Splenocytes were analyzed for B cell depletion and proliferation of the CA30 T cells 5 days after injection of deaggregated, heat-aggregated or IC mAb 36&#x02013;71. The anti-CD20 treatment achieved a 78% reduction in B cells at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170556.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). When CA30 T cells were enumerated, there was a trend towards reduced numbers in all groups that were pretreated with the anti-CD20 mAb relative to those that received the control anti-ragweed mAb. However, this was most extreme in the mice that were immunized with heat-aggregated IgG, the only group in which the difference reached statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170556.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Although it was not the intention of this experiment, the results also revealed that the control Ab resulted in diminished yields of CA30 T cells in the aggregate-immunized group. We can infer this because in all prior d5 proliferation experiments, the aggregate- and IC- immunized groups consistently yielded similar numbers of CA30 T cells and more so than the group immunized with deaggregated IgG (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170556.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). In agreement with these results, CFSE profiles of CA30 cells in anti-CD20 and isotype control treatment groups were similar for mice immunized with either deaggregated IgG or IC and also similar to CFSE profiles in earlier experiments not involving anti-CD20. In contrast, CA30 T cells in mice immunized with heat aggregates had altered CFSE profiles relative to those of earlier experiments when treated with either anti-CD20 or isotype control IgG.</p><fig id="pone.0170556.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0170556.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Aggregated mAb 36&#x02013;71 requires B cells to induce early proliferation of CA30 T cells.</title><p>(A) Adoptive transfer scheme designed to test early CA30 T cell proliferation after B cell depletion.

Our experiments demonstrated the immunogenicity of both aggregated and IC IgG under conditions in which no adjuvant was used and endotoxin contamination was nil. In stark contrast, we found that deaggregated IgG was highly tolerogenic, even when mice were challenged with immunogenic forms of IgG in a strong adjuvant and in the presence of excess T cell help. This contrast between immunogenicity and tolerogenicity was manifested by differences in CD4 T cell proliferation, differentiation into T<sub>FH</sub> and production of a humoral IgG anti-Id response against the injected IgG.</p><p>Tolerogenicity of the deaggregated IgG was associated with efficient but attenuated proliferation of CD4+ CA30 T cells that was dependent upon the Fc region of the IgG. In contrast, induction of a humoral IgG anti-Id response by aggregated and IC IgG was associated with CD4+ T cell proliferation through a greater number of division cycles and T<sub>FH</sub> development. Unexpectedly, CD4 T cell proliferation in response to the aggregated IgG was heavily dependent upon B cells but less so in response to IC IgG. These functional differences among the various forms of IgG were associated with differences in particulate matter composition. While the requirement of an Fc for effective T cell proliferation and tolerance could have several explanations, we think it is most likely due to the rapid clearance of Fab fragments <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the established role of the Fc in preserving serum Ab lifespan [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Consistent with this interpretation, we were unable to detect Fab in sera of mice injected only 24 h before (data not shown).</p><p>To our knowledge, these studies are the first to directly analyze how the physical state of IgG affects the activation of mAb-specific CD4+ T cells in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of immune responses to mAb therapy. The observed immunogenicity of aggregated IgG concurs with both historical immunological and modern pharmaceutical science and justifies considerable efforts to eliminate these aggregates during production and handling. However, our results also indicate that removing denatured aggregates alone may not be sufficient to preclude immunogenicity because we found that IC were immunogenic. Thus, our data provide strong support for prior conjecture that complexes between therapeutic mAb and targeted antigen <italic>in vivo</italic> can be immunogenic and elicit IgG antibodies against the mAb [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This interpretation is consistent with our unexpected finding that B cell depletion strongly impedes a CD4 response against IgG aggregates but less so against IC because it suggests that anti-mAb responses by patients receiving B cell-depleting mAb, such as rituximab, may be due to complexes formed between the therapeutic mAb and its intended target.</p><p>Results of our B cell depletion experiments suggest that B cells in the peritoneum may be playing different roles in transport or presentation of aggregated IgG versus IC IgG. It has been reported that B cells are important for shuttling large antigens (dynamic radius &#x0003e;5.5 nm or ~70 kDa) into lymph node germinal centers, and more recent literature has substantiated this view by revealing their role in shuttling immune complexes [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. However, in our model, CA30 T cell proliferation induced by IC was not as severely affected by B cell depletion as was proliferation induced by aggregated IgG. Perhaps this discrepancy is due to the small sizes of our IC compared to the aggregated mAb 36&#x02013;71. Subvisible particle analyses revealed major differences between the heat-aggregated mAb 36&#x02013;71 preparation, which had high concentrations of micron-sized particles, and IC mAb 36&#x02013;71, which had high concentrations of nanometer-sized particles. We deliberately generated IC in antigen excess to favor smaller complexes based upon literature suggesting that smaller immune complexes are more inflammatory [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170556.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Intriguingly, proliferation of CA30 T cells in the group immunized with heat-aggregated mAb 36&#x02013;71 was somewhat diminished by pretreatment with the isotype control IgG. Although, IgG has been reported to impede other types of immune reactions, the mechanism by which it impedes T cell proliferative responses is unknown to us and would likely require extensive further investigation to uncover [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170556.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170556.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].</p><p>By necessity, a mAb must engage its target antigen for therapeutic effect, meaning that for many therapeutic mAb, immune complexes will be generated <italic>in vivo</italic> even if they were completely deaggregated during infusion. However, the efficacy of mAbs in the clinic depends upon their high affinity for antigen, which in turn is heavily dependent upon somatic diversity generated at V gene segment boundaries by terminal transferase and throughout the V region by somatic hypermutation. And this somatic diversity is a source of potential immunogenicity, even in fully human mAb. In our model for example, mAb 36&#x02013;71 was originally derived from a strain A/J mouse. Yet somatic mutations rendered it antigenic with respect to the immune system of (B6 x A/J) F1 mice, and aggregation further rendered it immunogenic. Unfortunately, it is not a simple matter to selectively revert mutations that impart immunogenicity with respect to CD4 T cells because some mutations may both improve affinity and impart immunogenicity and because specific mutations that impart immunogenicity will likely vary with the MHC of the patient. These considerations lead us to conclude that in order to avert immune responses against therapeutic mAb it will often be necessary to induce a state of tolerance to the mAb in the CD4 T cell repertoire. In this vein, several groups have sought to suppress anti-mAb responses by injecting IgG with variable regions that were altered to prevent antigen engagement in vivo. [<xref rid="pone.0170556.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170556.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170556.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170556.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, this strategy risks introducing an autoreactive specificity or eliminating an important T cell determinant to which tolerance is desired. So it is likely that novel tolerance strategies will have to be devised.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170556.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Deaggregated mAb 36&#x02013;71 suppresses a humoral anti-Id response against mAb 36&#x02013;71 in a mouse with a smaller CA30 T cell transfer.</title><p>Mice 6&#x02013;8 weeks of age received adoptive transfer of 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> CA30 T cells on day -1 and 100 &#x003bc;g of deaggregated mAb 36&#x02013;71 (experimental) or mAb 36&#x02013;65 (control).
