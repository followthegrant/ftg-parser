Regular practice of physical activity may contribute to the prevention of the main chronic degenerative diseases (diabetes, overweight, obesity, hypertension, osteoporosis) as well as favour psychological balance, development and the improvement of social skills among children and adolescents (Hardman and Stensel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2003</xref>; Warburton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>; Washington et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2001</xref>). Although the positive effects on health of physical activity have largely been demonstrated, the regular practice of physical activity is less and less frequent in developed countries. Indeed, inactivity is one of the main causes of the current epidemics of childhood obesity (World Health Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>). In children and adolescents, participation in physical activity and sports is particularly important because it is associated with lower levels of antisocial behaviour (Harrison and Narayan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>), higher levels of positive emotional well-being (Steptoe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1997</xref>) and greater participation in sports in adulthood (Tammelin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>).</p><p>Levels of physical activity among children and adolescents are highly variable, and few consistent correlates have been identified (Lindquist et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1999</xref>). These include individual, parental and environmental influences. Boys are generally more active than girls, and children are more active than adolescents (Kohl and Hobbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>; Seabra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>), although the latter finding was not confirmed in another study (Brodersen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>). Economic resources and familial set-up exert decisive influences on children&#x02019;s and adolescents&#x02019; physical activity practice, with those from more advantaged familial background often having higher levels of physical activity than those in poorer families (Gordon-Larsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2000</xref>; Van der Horst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2007</xref>). Both cultural and material familial resources are important predictors of physical activity: when parents provide support, their offspring are more likely to engage in physical activity (Sallis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2000</xref>; Hoefer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2001</xref>). However, some authors reported that once parental attitudes are taken into account, familial resources do not influence children&#x02019;s physical activity any longer (Kirk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1997</xref>). It is therefore unclear whether the association of socio-economic status (SES) with children&#x02019;s and adolescents practice of physical activity persists, when other factors, including parents&#x02019; physical activity practice, are taken into account. In addition, previous studies took into account only few dimensions of SES, mainly focusing on either parental occupation or parental educational level. We therefore aimed to evaluate whether socio-economic inequalities in the practice of physical activity existed among children and adolescents, using different indicators of SES (parental education and occupation level, and family&#x02019;s available material resources).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used data collected in the most recent Italian Health Interview Survey, which was performed by the Italian National Statistical Institute (Istat) in 2004&#x02013;2005. This survey examined a random sample, representative of the Italian resident population, of 128,040 non-institutionalized individuals within strata of geographical area, municipality and household size (Istat-Istituto Nazionale di Statistica <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>). The non-response rate of the survey was 14.3%. Our study included all subjects aged 6&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15,216) examined in the survey. From the interviewer-administered and the self-compiled questionnaire, we abstracted data on gender, age, geographical area, physical activity practice, parents&#x02019; educational and occupational level, availability of material resources, perceived health status and parents&#x02019; physical activity practice.</p><p>We used three different indicators of SES: parental educational level, parental occupational level and family&#x02019;s availability of material resources. Parental educational level was grouped into three categories according to the highest level successfully completed by one of the parents: low (primary school), middle (secondary school) and high education (university degree). Parental occupational level was grouped into five categories: administrative/professionals, self-employed, manual workers, unemployed and housewives, and those who had retired from work. Familial material resources were categorized into three classes on the basis of information about house type (country house/cottage, apartment, council house) and the availability of the following two utilities: heating and drinkable water. Material resources were classified as less than good if at least one utility was not available or the house was poorly maintained. They were classified as good if both utilities were present and the subject lived in a properly maintained apartment, and as very good if both utilities were present and subjects lived in a properly maintained country house/cottage.</p><p>The practice of physical activity was measured on the basis of questions regarding frequency and intensity of activity during leisure time over the past 12&#x000a0;months. Each subject was asked whether he/she was engaged in moderate or vigorous physical activity at least once a week. The practice of moderate physical activity was defined as the practice at least once a week of activities such as walking, doing gymnastics or cycling at moderate speed. The practice of vigorous physical activity was defined as the practice at least once a week of intense physical activity such as running, cycling or other sweat-producing activities.</p><p>Bivariate analyses were carried out using the chi-square test. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the contribution of the three socio-economic indicators to children&#x02019;s and adolescents&#x02019; participation in physical activity adjusting for potential confounding factors. Two separate logistic regression models were performed using as outcome variables the practice of moderate/vigorous activity and that of vigorous activity only. In order to increase the power of the analyses, the upper two categories of educational level (middle and high education) were collapsed into one. A further grouping was performed for geographical area (northern/central regions vs southern/insular regions). The results of the regression models are expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The overall likelihood ratio test was used to evaluate the significance of the model, while the partial likelihood ratio test was used to determine whether adding a covariate significantly improved the model. Interaction terms were added to the model and retained if the corresponding <italic>p</italic> value was lower than 0.05. All statistical analyses were carried out using the software package Stata 10.1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the characteristics of the study sample, which included 15,216 subjects aged 6&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years, as well as their parents&#x02019; characteristics.

</p><p>Adjusting for all of the variables reported in the table, children and adolescents with unemployed parents had an odds of practicing moderate or vigorous physical activity 0.43 times that of those children whose parents belonged to the top job occupation category (administrative/professionals). On the other hand, subjects whose parents held a middle or high educational title were 80% more likely to practice moderate or vigorous physical activity than subjects whose parents had a lower level of education, with adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.80 (95% CI: 1.40&#x02013;2.33). The adjusted OR of practising moderate or vigorous physical activity was 1.47 (95% CI: 1.33&#x02013;1.62) for children and adolescents with &#x0201c;good or very good&#x0201d; material resources compared to those with &#x0201c;less than good&#x0201d; ones. When parents practiced physical activity, their offspring were more likely to participate in moderate or vigorous physical activity. Living in southern Italy or in insular regions was associated with a lower participation compared to other regions, with adjusted OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48 (95% CI: 0.45&#x02013;0.52).</p><p>When the practice of vigorous physical activity was considered instead of that of moderate or vigorous physical activity, results of the logistic regression analysis were largely overlapping. All three socio-economic indicators considered were significantly associated with the practice of vigorous physical activity: the higher the status, the more frequent the practice of vigorous physical activity, although inequalities were generally smaller compared to the model with moderate or vigorous physical activity as the outcome variable.</p><p>Since we hypothesized that parental characteristics could have a different effect depending on their offspring age and gender, we tested for interaction between parent&#x02019;s education and occupation and their offspring demographics. In the multivariable model with moderate or vigorous physical activity as the outcome variable, the only significant interaction was found between parental education and gender, showing the different influence parent&#x02019;s educational level has on their daughters and sons. No significant interaction was found for the model with vigorous physical activity as the outcome variable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Summary of the main findings</title><p>In our study, adjusting for individual and area-level variables, all three indicators of SES (parental education and occupational level, and availability of material resources) were significantly associated with children&#x02019;s and adolescents&#x02019; physical activity practice. The practice of physical activity increased with higher parental educational and occupational level and greater availability of material resources.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Firstly, physical activity measurement relied on self-reported data. Physical activity has traditionally been measured with surveys and recall instruments, which are often preferred to objectively measured physical activity because of greater convenience (Heitzler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>; Scully et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>). A widely used tool is the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, which is usually applied for monitoring population levels of physical activity among adults (Craig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2003</xref>). Among children, the validity of similar questionnaires is limited (Lachat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>). Some studies reported a moderate to good agreement between self-reported and objectively measured physical activity (Epstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1996</xref>; Sallis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1996</xref>). Our measurement of physical activity may have suffered from some misclassification. However, if the misclassification was not differential, that is, the misclassification did not significantly vary by socio-economic indicator, the result would be a dilution of the effect. In other words, the socio-economic differences in physical activity practice found in this study are probably smaller than they actually are.</p><p>A second limitation of the study is the cross-sectional design, which is of limited value in the search for causal explanation because exposure and outcome are measured at the same time. However, it is likely that all three socio-economic determinants under investigation preceded in time, and were not followed by, children&#x02019;s and adolescents&#x02019; practice of physical activity. A third limitation is the lack of information in the available data set on those psychological factors which may influence the participation in physical activity, such as anxiety and self-esteem. Accounting for these factors would probably have attenuated the effect of parental socio-economic characteristics and attitudes towards physical activity, but it is unlikely that the effect of all three measures of SES would have been cancelled out.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>Several studies found a positive association between SES and children and adolescents&#x02019; physical activity practice. According to a recent review, mother&#x02019;s educational level and family income were consistently associated with physical activity practice among adolescents (Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>). In Finland, parental income and education were directly related to adolescents&#x02019; physical activity or engagement in sport activities (Kantomaa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>). Among adolescents of central and southern Italy, a positive association between extracurricular physical activity and parental SES was found (La Torre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>). Contrary to the finding of Wagner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>), our results indicate an effect of familial available material resources on offspring physical activity also after controlling for parental sport habits. Our finding that available material resources limit the possibility to practice physical activity is justified, among others, by the study performed by Kirk et al. on 220 families in the Queensland and Victoria areas in Australia (Kirk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1997</xref>). In this study, parents made a substantial contribution in terms of financial support to their children&#x02019;s participation in junior sport activities, given the yearly cycle of training and competition, distance from facilities and coaching, and costs associated with coaching, equipment and uniforms.</p><p>A more difficult access to sport facilities may probably explain the large heterogeneity in physical activity practice we found within the same country, namely the existence of a north-south gradient in physical activity practice. A study conducted by the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) found a huge gradient in the number of infrastructures within Italy, with more structures being present in northern regions (CONI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>). Focus group discussions revealed that safe, convenient, inexpensive facilities were considered essential for participation in physical activity especially by adolescents of lower SES, while different factors, such as fun, perceived competence and friends&#x02019; support, were more relevant among youth of higher SES (Humbert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>). Other possible explanations of the north-south gradient are the higher level of social deprivation in southern regions and cultural factors that value physical activity differently.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Implications for policy</title><p>Since children and adolescents spend a large part of their time at school, school environment may strongly influence their engagement in physical activity. The implementation of school policies related to physical activity, like physical education classes, leisure time free use of playing fields, size and state of conservation of school facilities, and existence of parental supervision or organized activities, was associated with higher levels of children&#x02019;s and adolescents&#x02019; physical activity (Ferreira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>), although there is considerable debate on the effect of compulsory school physical activity (Seabra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>; Cleland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>). A recent study from the Netherlands emphasizes the contribution of physical environment features, such as housing type, green spaces and traffic levels (de Vries et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>). Since it is increasingly recognized that the wider physical and social environment is an important determinant of health and health behaviour, the availability of material infrastructure, such as children&#x02019;s playgrounds and sport facilities that are easily accessible as well as the social context of the community in which children and adolescents live, may increase their participation in physical activity (McKay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Socio-economic differences in the practice of physical activity are present during childhood and adolescence and are of considerable extent. Interventions that promote the practice of physical activity, and especially those aimed at creating supportive neighborhood environments in more disadvantaged areas as well as at increasing accessibility to playgrounds and sport facilities, are strongly needed in order to contrast socio-economic differences in physical activity among children and adolescents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank Dr. Saverio Tomaiuolo, Lecturer in English Literature, Language and Translation, Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Cassino, for his revision of the manuscript.</p><sec id="d32e2026"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors confirm that there are no relevant associations that might pose a conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="d32e2031"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was partially funded by the Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Cassino.</p></sec><sec id="d32e2036"><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brodersen</surname><given-names>NH</given-names></name><name><surname>Steptoe</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Boniface</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name><name><surname>Wardle</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Trends in physical activity and sedentary behaviour in adolescence: ethnic and socioeconomic differences</article-title><source>Br J Sports Med</source><year>2007</year><volume>41</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>140</fpage><lpage>144</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bjsm.2006.031138</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17178773</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cleland</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Dwyer</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Blizzard</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Venn</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The provision of compulsory school physical activity: associations with physical activity, fitness and overweight in childhood and twenty years later</article-title><source>Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act</source><year>2008</year><volume>5</volume><fpage>14</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1186/1479-5868-5-14</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18312621</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">CONI (2004) La situazione degli impianti sportivi in Italia al 2003.
