The aim of the present Swedish study, which was performed in a country that has universal health care, was to investigate if there is an association between socioeconomic factors and bariatric surgery by taking body mass index (BMI) into account.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this prospective cohort study, BMI data were collected for the period 1985&#x02013;2010 from the Military Service Conscription Register (for men) and from the Medical Birth Register in the first trimester (for women). The follow-up period started in 2005 and continued until 2012. Age-standardized cumulative incidence rates (CR) of bariatric surgery were compared between different BMI groups by considering individual variables. We analyzed the association between the individual variables and bariatric surgery using Cox proportional hazard models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In the study population of 814,703 women and 787,027 men, a total of 7433 women and 1961 men underwent bariatric surgery. In women, the hazard ratios (HRs) for bariatric surgery were higher for low and middle income and educational levels, compared to high income and educational levels. In men, the highest HR for bariatric surgery was found among those with a high income. The HRs when comparing the different socioeconomic groups in those with BMI&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> showed no significant results, except for middle education in women.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Differences in bariatric surgery between socioeconomic groups were found, favoring those with a low socioeconomic status. However, very few socioeconomic differences were found amongst those who had a BMI&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. This indicates that the Swedish healthcare system seems to have achieved equal access to health care for bariatric surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12889-019-6585-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>BMI</kwd><kwd>Bariatric surgery</kwd><kwd>Socioeconomic status</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003173</institution-id><institution>Crafoordska Stiftelsen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20171054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xinjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003793</institution-id><institution>Hj&#x000e4;rt-Lungfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL116381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundquist</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">Obesity, defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and over, is one of the major modifiable causes of preventable death in the developed world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Conventional interventions for weight loss, such as lifestyle modifications (healthy diet and exercise), have often been ineffective in maintaining a sustained weight loss, particularly in individuals with severe obesity (BMI&#x000a0;<underline>&#x0003e;</underline>&#x000a0;40&#x02009;kg /m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Due to the enormous clinical burden and ineffectiveness of conventional interventions against obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], it has been highly needed to develop innovative and cost-effective strategies for the treatment of obesity. Today, bariatric surgery is considered to be the most effective strategy to achieve both sustained weight loss and significant improvements in obesity-related comorbidities and quality of life as well as a reduction in mortality in individuals with obesity. Bariatric surgery has also been proven to be cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The utilization of bariatric surgery has increased worldwide due to both an increasing incidence of sever obesity and the expanding evidence of the beneficial effects of surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In Sweden, there has been a large increase in bariatric surgery after 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], presumably in response to a report from the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the Swedish Obese Subjects study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Sweden has a universal healthcare insurance system, which means that financial resources should not be a barrier for obesity surgery. According to Swedish law, the tax-financed health care service should be provided on equal terms for the entire population and those who are in the greatest need of health care should be prioritized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a previous study of ours, however, we found that individuals with a low socioeconomic status underwent bariatric surgery to a lower extent than those with a higher socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This is despite the higher rates of obesity being among individuals with a low socioeconomic status. However, we did not have access to BMI data in our previous study. In the present study, we have access to individual BMI data from two different nationwide registers for men and women. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether differences in the access to bariatric surgery exist for different socioeconomic groups after accounting for BMI. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this is the first nationwide study examining potential socioeconomic differences in the access to bariatric surgery after having taken BMI into account.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Data sources</title><p id="Par15">Data used in this study were obtained from nationwide registers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The Swedish Medical Birth Register, which is a register of all pregnancies, prenatal care and birth records for all mothers and children in Sweden since 1973, was used to obtain information about women&#x02019;s weight, height and BMI. A pregnant woman&#x02019;s first contact with the health care service is during the first trimester.</p><p id="Par16">The Military Conscription Register, which includes a structured and standardized medical assessment of all Swedish men since 1969, was used to obtain information about men&#x02019;s weight, height and BMI. Men of foreign citizenship and those with a severe disability were excluded from military service. The Total Population Register, maintained by Statistics Sweden, the Swedish government-owned census bureau, was used to obtain the demographic and socioeconomic variables. Additional linkages in the database included data from the National Cause of Death Register and the Immigration Register (to identify dates of immigration and/or emigration). Information about surgical procedures were obtained from the Swedish Inpatient Register maintained by the National Board of Health and Welfare. Data linkages were performed on the basis of a personal identification number that is assigned to each permanent resident in Sweden for their lifetime. This number was replaced by a serial number for each person to provide anonymity.

The interactions that were statistically significant are presented in the Additional files <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1 and Additional files <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S2. Except for marital status in men, we did not find a clear pattern in the potentially differential effects of SES on bariatric surgery. Thus, the clinical significance of these interactions is unclear. The effect of BMI on surgery for men was modified by marital status, i.e. those who were married had a higher rate of surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par55">The main findings of the present study are that socioeconomic differences exist between individuals who receive bariatric surgery in Sweden and those who do not. However, in severely obese individuals (BMI &#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), these differences disappeared with the exception of women with middle educational level who had higher rates of surgery. Sweden has universal health care, which enable individuals with BMI&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> to receive publicly funded bariatric surgery. This might be the explanation to diminishing socioeconomic differences between individuals with BMI &#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. A study by Krajewski et al. showed that access to emergency operative care was related to SES in the United States where most individuals have private health insurance, whereas in Canada, with universal health insurance, no such relationship was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">In 2006, almost 1500 individuals underwent bariatric surgery in Sweden. According to previous estimations, there were 10,000&#x02013;15,000 individuals who could be eligible for surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This indicates that bariatric surgery access may not meet the demand due to factors beyond SES, such as prioritization in healthcare utilization.</p><p id="Par57">We hypothesized that the potential effect of socioeconomic factors was higher for individuals with BMI &#x0003c;&#x02009;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, who are not eligible for publicly funded bariatric surgery unless BMI is &#x02265;35&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> in addition to the presence of an obesity-related comorbidity. These individuals might receive bariatric surgery in case they are able to finance the surgery with their own financial resources. Nevertheless, the results of this study show that women with low and middle family income and education and men with low and middle education had higher HRs for bariatric surgery. This might be explained by the fact that we did not have access to all data concerning privately paid bariatric surgeries. It is possible that some inequality in SES exists for those with BMI&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="Par58">In the present study, the HRs for bariatric surgery were higher for low and middle income and educational levels for women even when adjusted for BMI and the other variables. Similarly, the HRs for men were higher for low and middle educational groups even when adjusted for all other variables. These results complement findings from our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] where the HRs were higher for those with low and middle income and educational level. One limitation of our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] was that we did not have access to BMI data, which was overcome in the current study. According to another Swedish study, the increase in obesity between 2000 and 2012 was steepest among those with a middle educational level and, in 2012, the prevalence of obesity was almost twice as high among those with a low or middle educational level compared with those with a high educational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">An Australian study showed that bariatric surgery rates were higher among those with higher SES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In contrast, our earlier study indicated that individuals with high income and education underwent bariatric surgery to a lower extent, which we interpreted was due to the lower prevalence of obesity in this group. According to the current study, however, the HRs were also lower among those with a high income and educational level (for women) and those with a high educational level (for men), whereas the HR in men was lowest among those with a low income. This socioeconomic difference disappeared, however, when we examined those with a BMI &#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The reasons behind our results are not possible to disentangle in the present study but some explanations behind the lower HRs for bariatric surgery among individuals with high SES are plausible. The first explanation is that those with high income may be able to pay for their surgery with private resources even if they are not eligible for publicly funded surgery according to national guidelines. Not all individuals that pay for the surgery with private resources might be included in our data. Another explanation is that those with a high income and/or education may have fewer comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], use alternative methods for weight reduction and/or are more aware of complications of surgery for why they opt out this alternative. Another explanation might be the time lag between the BMI measurement and the surgery, which could mean that those with a high education and/or income succeeded to lose weight and were therefore not eligible or in need of surgery. However, a Swedish longitudinal study showed that BMI increased in all age groups in Sweden between 1980 and 2005, even after controlling for education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. That study also showed that the largest increase in BMI was in young and middle-aged individuals, which are the individuals included in the present study.</p><p id="Par60">It seems that the patterns of socioeconomic characteristics differ between men and women except for education, which shows a higher HR for surgery in the middle educational group for both men and women; this confirms the results of our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Differences in socioeconomic characteristics between men and women might be explained by several factors. Women usually get operated on at an earlier age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and might have other reasons for accepting/demanding the surgery such as cosmetic and fertility reasons whereas men usually undergo the operation later in life and perhaps mostly due to comorbidities. Both married/cohabiting men and women had a slightly higher HR for surgery. This may be due to the encouraging role of their spouses to get treatment for obesity. Several studies have shown a positive effect of marriage/cohabiting on health and longevity and these benefits of marriage may sometimes be higher for men than for women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par61">Previous studies have shown significant disparities in socioeconomic characteristics between the severely obese population and the subgroup that actually receive bariatric surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In countries with a private healthcare system, some of these variations might be explained by financial inequalities. However, in countries with a publicly funded system, no obvious reason for these disparities are apparent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Few studies have systematically analyzed the factors that cause the variation in receiving bariatric surgery. It is generally assumed that much of the variation is explained by socioeconomic barriers. An American study did not support this assumption; it instead emphasized the patients&#x02019; perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In that study, men were less likely than women and African Americans were less likely than Caucasians to have seriously considered bariatric surgery after accounting for sociodemographic factors. Having a lower ideal weight was also associated with having considered bariatric surgery, which partly explains the gender differences. Men may be less likely than women to consider bariatric surgery, which may be due to them being less concerned about the negative impact of extreme obesity on health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A Chinese study showed that gluttonous behaviors were positively correlated with the acceptance level of bariatric surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Physicians&#x02019; recommendations were also a strong independent factor for patients considering bariatric surgery according to an American study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This study also found that men and African Americans were less likely to be recommended bariatric surgery by their doctors. The results of the present study indicate that the Swedish healthcare system has achieved its goal of equal health care for the entire population regarding bariatric surgery, since those with BMI &#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were not affected by socioeconomic factors in their likelihood to receive surgery, and there was no strong association between socioeconomic characteristics and the rate of bariatric surgery. In addition, the socioeconomic differences favored those with a low and middle socioeconomic status rather than those with a high socioeconomic status.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p id="Par62">This study has some limitations. The most important limitation is the time lag between the BMI measurement and the obesity surgery, which means that we had no access to the BMI data at surgery (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Information about SES was collected after 2005 and close in time to the bariatric surgery. However, SES could change over time and the impact of potential changes in SES on BMI during these years is therefore unclear. However, as mentioned above, previous research has found that BMI increased in all age groups in Sweden during the study period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and BMI early in adulthood is a good predictor of BMI later in life. It is also unclear how many in the BMI group 1&#x02013;3 that actually became severely obese during the study period and thus eligible for surgery. For women, we only included the population that had a pregnancy, thus not including those who did not become pregnant. An additional limitation is that the women and men were not directly comparable as most men completed their military service between the ages of 18&#x02013;20&#x02009;years (96.5%) whereas the women&#x02019;s childbearing age was mainly between 18 and 39&#x02009;years. Furthermore, pregnant women will likely have a higher BMI. Finally, socioeconomic variables cannot fully measure socioeconomic status.</p><p id="Par63">However, the limitations of this study are balanced by its strengths. To our knowledge, the current study is the first nationwide study that considers socioeconomic characteristics in relation to rates of obesity surgery, including levels of BMI. An additional strength is that we had access to a large database, which included all publicly funded surgeries, and the main purpose was to examine whether the publicly funded surgery is equally distributed, irrespective of socioeconomic status. Finally, both men and women were included in the study and analyzed separately. According to the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, only a small percentage of records (0.5&#x02013;3.0%) of all infants are missing from the Swedish Medical Birth Register [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par64">The present nationwide study shows differences between socioeconomic groups and rates of bariatric surgery, favoring those with a low socioeconomic status. However, socioeconomic differences disappeared in those individuals with a BMI&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which indicates that severe obesity rules out socioeconomic differences in bariatric surgery rates. The Swedish healthcare system seems to have achieved its goal of equal health care for the entire population regarding bariatric surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
