In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNA, this sequence element has a potential to form either a stem-loop or a pseudoknot structure. Based on many mutational studies, the stem-loop structure has been proposed for the downstream enhancer region of the HIV-1 mRNA. This stimulatory stem-loop structure is separated from the shift site by a spacer of seven nucleotides. In contrast, a recent report has proposed an alternative model in which the bases in the spacer sequence form a pseudoknot structure as the downstream enhancer sequence [Du et al., Biochemistry 35 (1996) 4187&#x02013;4198.]. Using UV melting and enzymatic mapping analyses, we have investigated the conformation of the sequence region involved in ribosomal frameshifting in HIV-1. Our S<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>1</sub>, and T<sub>1</sub> endonuclease mappings, together with UV melting analysis, clearly indicate that this sequence element of the HIV-1 mRNA frameshift site forms a stem-loop structure, not a pseudoknot structure. This finding further supports the stem-loop structure proposed by many mutational studies for the downstream enhancer sequence of the HIV-1 mRNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Frameshifting</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Hairpin</kwd><kwd>Pseudoknot</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that employs &#x02212;1 ribosomal frameshifting to synthesize essential viral enzymes, including reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease, as fusion proteins with gag proteins <xref rid="BIB1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="BIB2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="BIB3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The signals for this frameshifting process consist of a heptanucleotide shift site and a downstream enhancer sequence in the viral RNA. These two important signals are separated by a spacer with a nearly constant number of nucleotides.</p><p>The mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting is not well understood, although the simultaneous slippage model is the most plausible. The pre-translocation slippage model proposes that when the ribosome enters the frameshift region, the peptidyl (P) and aminoacyl (A) sites of the ribosome slip backward simultaneously into the &#x02212;1 frame at the shift site, and that translation continues in the new reading frame <xref rid="BIB4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="BIB5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. In addition to this pre-translocation slippage model, a report by Horsfield et al. <xref rid="BIB6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>proposes an E/P site post-translocation slippage model in <italic>E. coli</italic> containing HIV-1 <italic>gag-pol</italic> frameshift sequence. The enhancer secondary RNA structure, either a stem-loop or a pseudoknot, downstream of the shift site induces pausing of the ribosome and stimulates slippage at the shift sequence <xref rid="BIB4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="BIB5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="BIB6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="BIB7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>Enhancement of ribosomal frameshifting by RNA secondary structures has been studied by many mutational analyses. An RNA pseudoknot is a common enhancer for highly efficient frameshifting (<xref rid="BIB8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>and references therein). However, in HIV-1 and human T-cell leukaemia virus type II (HTLV-II), frameshifting occurs at a frequency of 1&#x02013;5% both in vivo and in vitro, and a simple stem-loop structure has been implicated for the enhancer region <xref rid="BIB9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="BIB10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. This downstream enhancer structure is separated from the shift site by a spacer sequence of typical length. The importance of the proper distance between this two signals was evidenced by a mutational study <xref rid="BIB11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, recently Du et al. <xref rid="BIB12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>proposed an alternative model involving a pseudoknot for the frameshifting region of the HIV-1 mRNA. In this pseudoknot model, the bases in the spacer region are part of stem 1 of the pseudoknot, thus leaving no nucleotides between the shift site and the downstream enhancer structure. Direct probing of the RNA secondary structure by single-strand and double-strand specific enzymes can distinguish between these two models.</p><p>Here, we determine the secondary structure of the HIV-1 mRNA frameshifting sequence elements including the shift site, the spacer, and the downstream enhancer sequence by using ultraviolet melting and enzymatic mapping analysis. The RNA sequence element has a potential to form either a stem-loop or a pseudoknot structure, as illustrated in <xref rid="FIG1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
. We show that the downstream enhancer sequence adopts a simple stem-loop structure. The spacer region is not involved in the formation of the stem of a pseudoknot as predicted by Du et al. <xref rid="BIB12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, but is in a single-stranded conformation. Our results agree well with the mutational studies showing a simple stem-loop structure for the downstream enhancer sequence of the frameshifting region of the HIV-1 mRNA.<fig id="FIG1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>(a) The sequence of the frameshifting signals in HIV-1 RNA consists of a shift site (boxed), a spacer (bold), and an enhancer.

Nucleotides from G1 to G5 were strongly cleaved by single-strand specific nuclease S<sub>1</sub>, but were protected from cleavage by double-strand specific RNase V<sub>1</sub>. However, at a high enzyme concentration, some of the nucleotides in the region of G1 to G10 was cleaved by RNase V<sub>1</sub>, suggesting that residues 1 to 10 are partially stacked.

By expressing the HIV-1 <italic>gag-pol</italic> domain in cultured vertebrate cells, Parkin et al. <xref rid="BIB9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>showed that a stem-loop structure downstream of the HIV-1 shift site is important for wild-type levels of frameshifting. In a cell culture analysis for the sequences and distance between two <italic>cis</italic>-acting signals in HIV-1 and HTLV-2, Kollmus et al. <xref rid="BIB11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>observed that the slippery sequence alone is sufficient for basal level of frameshifting, but that the frameshifting efficiency is enhanced by a downstream stem-loop structure. A similar stimulating role of the stem-loop sequence in HIV-1 mRNA to enhance frameshifting was also observed in mammalian cell culture <xref rid="BIB16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Honda et al. <xref rid="BIB17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>used an in vitro luciferase assay system for HIV-1 translation frameshifting and noted that the stem-loop is not essential for basal-level frameshifting, but it does influence the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting.</p><p>The simultaneous slippage model of ribosomal frameshifting proposes that an RNA secondary structure downstream of the shift site may slow or stall ribosomes during translation, thus increase the probability of the ribosome to slip backward into the &#x02212;1 frame at the slippery site. Such a model predicts that the correct spacing must be maintained between the shift site and the downstream RNA structure. In analysis of the RNA sequences responsible for frameshifting in the avian corona&#x000a0;virus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Brierley et al. <xref rid="BIB18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>observed that alteration of the relative position of the shift sequence by as little as three nucleotides with the respect to the downstream pseudoknot causes a dramatic reduction in frameshifting efficiency. Morikawa and Bishop <xref rid="BIB19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>also demonstrated for the <italic>gag-pol</italic> ribosomal frameshift site of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) that mutations which alter the distance between the frameshift signal and the downstream pseudoknot structure reduces frameshifting efficiency. In a systematic analysis of the effect of the sequence and the distance between two signals on frameshifting efficiency in HTLV-II, Kollmus et al. <xref rid="BIB11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>demonstrated that the base composition 3&#x02032; to the slippery sequence does not have a significant influence on frameshifting, but that the spacing between the slippery sequence and the 5&#x02032; end of the stem-loop is stringently restricted to an optimal distance of seven nucleotides.</p><p>All of these mutational results imply that the downstream RNA structure should be located at a precise position relative to the shift site to enhance frameshifting. In the viruses reported so far, the relative spacing distance between the stimulator and the slippery sequence varies between five and eight nucleotides <xref rid="BIB8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Of course it is possible that the distance from the more efficient slippery sequence to the downstream RNA structure needs not be so tightly constrained. Since HIV-1 contains the highly slippery sequence UUUUUUA, the distance between two signals needs not be so stringently maintained, and the spacing may vary from three to nine nucleotides to promote different level of frameshifting; the maximum frameshifting efficiency is observed in the context of relative spacing between two signals separated by seven nucleotides <xref rid="BIB11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Although a pseudoknot is the usual enhancer structure in retroviral frameshifting, there is no support for the proposed pseudoknot structure for HIV-1 by Du et al. <xref rid="BIB12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In a recent paper, Du and Hoffman <xref rid="BIB20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>mentioned that the possible pseudoknot structure for HIV-1 is speculative, since it lacks a spacing sequence between the frameshift site and the pseudoknot. The mutation data and our direct structural studies all agree that a stem-loop structure separated from the slippery sequence by about seven nucleotides is necessary for efficient ribosomal frameshifting in HIV-1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="BIB1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jacks</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Power</surname><given-names>M.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Masiarz</surname><given-names>F.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Luciw</surname><given-names>P.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Barr</surname><given-names>P.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Varmus</surname><given-names>H.E.</given-names></name></person-group><source>Nature</source><volume>331</volume><year>1988</year><fpage>280</fpage><lpage>283</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2447506</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="BIB2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Atkins</surname><given-names>J.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>R.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gesteland</surname><given-names>R.F.</given-names></name></person-group><source>Cell</source><volume>62</volume><year>1990</year><fpage>413</fpage><lpage>423</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2199062</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="BIB3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jacks</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></person-group><source>Curr.
