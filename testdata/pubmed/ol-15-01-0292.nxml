The present study aimed to evaluate the anticancer activity of a natural alkaloid, mecambridine, against human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). An MTT assay was used to evaluate cytotoxic effects of mecambridine on HSC-3 oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Effects of mecambridine on autophagy-associated proteins were analyzed by western blotting. Effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed by flow cytometry. Results indicated that mecambridine exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 50 &#x000b5;M and exerted its cytotoxic effects in a dose dependent manner on OSCC HSC-3 cells. Furthermore, it was observed that mecambridine decreases cell viability and induces autophagy in a dose-dependent manner. The underlying mechanism for the induction of autophagy was demonstrated to be associated with ROS-mediated alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential and modulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (m-TOR/PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway in HSC-3 at the IC<sub>50</sub>. In conclusion, the present study suggests that mecambridine exhibits substantial anticancer activity against OSCC HSC-3 cells by induction of autophagy and modulates the expression of the mTOR/PI3K/Akt signaling cascade which is considered a potential target pathway for anti-cancer agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mecambridine</kwd><kwd>oral squamous cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants synthesize a wide array of compounds with structurally complex molecular scaffolds. Several of these compounds and their derivatives such as alkaloids and flavonoids exhibit a diversity of medicinal properties (<xref rid="b1-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Among plant derived secondery metabolites alkaloids are biologically active found across plant kingdom. They have been found to exhibit several pharmacological properties such as anticancer and antimicrobial. Cancer is considered one of the most lethal diseases and due to the dearth of operative drugs, lavish cost of chemotherapeutic agents and the side effects, there is tremendous need for exploration of novel molecules for their anticancer activities (<xref rid="b2-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Among all cancers, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for more 2.5 lakh new cases and about 1.3 lakh deaths each year around the globe (<xref rid="b3-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). If OSCC is detected at an early stage, treatment with surgery or radiotherapy or the combination of both and has a five-year survival rates varying between 70 to 90% (<xref rid="b3-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). However, 2/3 of OSCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the diseases (<xref rid="b6-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In the present study we evaluated the anticancer activity of a plant derived natural alkaloid mecambridine against squamous cell carcinoma HSC-3 oral cell line. Results indicated that mecambridine exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 50 &#x000b5;M and exerted its cytotoxic effects in a dose dependent manner on OSCC HSC-3 cell line. Moreover, it was observed that the mecambridine lessens cell viability and induces autophagy dose dependently. The underlying mechanism for the induction of autophagy was found to be ROS mediated in mitochondrial membrane potential and changes in the expression mTOR/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway proteins in HSC-3 at the IC<sub>50</sub> concentration of mecambridine. These results strongly stress that mecambridine may prove to be an anticancer lead molecule for the treatment and of OSCC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Chemicals and regents and cell culture conditions</title><p>The chemicals used in this study include; triton X-100, dimethyl and sulfoxide (DMSO), RNase A purchased from from Sigma-Aldrich Co., (St. Louis, MO, USA), primary and secondary antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and fetal bovine serum (FBS), RPMI-1640 medium, L-glutamine, antibiotics procured from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

The anti-proliferative activity of the mecambridine was found be concentration-dependent.</p></sec><sec><title>Mecambridine induces autophagy in HSC-3 cells</title><p>In order to confirm that mecambridine induces autophagy in HSC-3 cells, mecambridine treated cells were stained with MDC. Vital staining of mecambridine-treated HSC-3 cells with MDC (monodansylcadaverine, an autophagolysosome marker) and AO (acridine orange), indicated an increased buildup of the dye as compared to the control cells. In control the dye is scattered and comparatively fainter than treatment (<xref rid="f2-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). These observations provided strong clue that mecambridine induces autophagy in HSC-3 cells. To quantify the increase of the acidic vesicular organelles, mecambridine-treated cells were treated with acridine orange dye and it was revealed that there was accumulation of acridine orange in the mecambridine-treated cells.</p><p>To confirm autophagy, we evaluated the expression of several autophagy associated proteins. The results indicated that the treatment with the extract induced the expression of several autophagy associated proteins (<xref rid="f3-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). It was observed there was no change in the expression of several proteins which include Vps34, Beclin-1, and LC3-I. However expression of LC3-II was significantly increased in a concentration dependent manner while as slight reduction in the expression of together with a slight reduction in the levels of p62 was also observed. The capacity of the mecambridine to induce autophagy was further confirmed by the use of autophagy inhibitor, pepstatin. The results indicated that mecambridine abridged the effect of the inhibitors (<xref rid="f4-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mecambridine induces the ROS accretions and MMP reduction in HSC-3 cells</title><p>The autophagic potential of mecambridine indicated that it might induce generation of intracellular ROS. Therefore, we calculated the ROS level at varied concentrations of mecambridine for 24 h. The results showed that the intracellular ROS levels of treated cells increased to 194% at 100 &#x000b5;M as compared to untreated cells (<xref rid="f5-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Our result suggested that mecambridine a potent molecule for activating ROS in squamous oral carcinoma HSC-3 cells to trigger the autophagy. ROS generation causes mitochondrial dysfunction. It disrupts the outer mitochondrial potential to release the death-promoting proteins (<xref rid="b9-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether mecambridine reduces the MMP in squamous oral carcinoma HSC-3 cells in a concentration dependent manner. Treated squamous oral carcinoma HSC-3 cells showed a significant reduction in MMP in a dose-dependent manner. The MMP reduced by 68% at 100 &#x000b5;M of mecambridine as compared to untreated control (<xref rid="f6-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mecambridine targets m-TOR/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway</title><p>The fact that mecambridine could modulate the protein expressions of m-TOR/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway was evaluated by using western blot analysis (<xref rid="f7-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Compared to the untreated control cells, mecambridine treated HSC-3 cells showed a concentration-dependent downregulation of m-TOR and pm-TOR proteins. It also caused downregulation of PI3K/Akt protein expressions. Thus it may be concluded that mecambridine induced anticancer and autophagy inducing effects via m-TOR/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Oral squamous cell carcinoma is of the leading causes of cancer related mortality and about 1.3 lakh new patients are diagnosed for OSCC every year across the world. Additionally, treatment options for this type of cancer are limited and currently available treatments have severe side effects and badly affects the quality line of the patients (<xref rid="b4-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, the present study aimed at determining the anticancer activity of the mecambridine (a natural alkaloid) against OSCC HSC-3 cells. The results indicated that the test molecule mecambridine exerted significant anticancer activity against OSCC HSC-3 cells in a dose dependent manner with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 50 &#x000b5;M. These results suggest that the mecambridine is a potential source of cytotoxic agents. The cytotoxic effect of mecambridine was later on reported to be due to the induction of autophagy, as evident from the accumulation of MDC and acridine orange dyes in mecambridine treated OSCC HSC-3 cells. Expression of several of the autophagy associated proteins was evaluated and it was found that the expression of only LC3-II was highly induced by the mecambridine in OSCC HSC-3 cells. Furthermore mecambridine exhibited a strong potential to abridge the expression of autophagy inhibitors, providing a strong clue towards the role of this molecule in the execution of autophagy.</p><p>Moreover, results indicated that mecambridine treated cells displayed ROS mediated MMP reduction. Therefore, the results suggest that the mecambridine may induce autophagy through increasing intracellular ROS and reduction in MMP. Our results are in agreement with studies wherein several anti-tumor agents have been reported to target cancer cells partly by accretion of high levels of ROS (<xref rid="b10-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-ol-0-0-7321" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Finally, effects of mecambridine on the expression levels of various proteins including m-TOR, pm-TOR, PI3K, p-PI3K and Akt were studied using western blot assay. Results showed mecambridine-treated OSCC HSC-3 cells showed a concentration-dependent downregulation of m-TOR and pm-TOR proteins. It also caused downregulation of PI3K/Akt protein expressions. Therefore, inhibitory effect of mecambridineon OSCC HSC-3 cells may prove crucial in the treatment and management of OSCC.</p><p>In conclusion, the present results suggest that mecambridine induces anticancer and autophagy effects via the m-TOR/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. The mechanism involved will be further studies in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was supported by Science and Technology Plan Project of Mudanjiang (grant no.
