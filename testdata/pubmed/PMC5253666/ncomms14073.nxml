Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway leads to aberrant activation of the transcription co-activator YAP (Yes-associated protein) that contributes to tumorigenesis in several tissues. Here we identify glucocorticoids (GCs) as hormonal activators of YAP. Stimulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) leads to increase of YAP protein levels, nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mechanistically, we find that GCs increase expression and deposition of fibronectin leading to the focal adhesion-Src pathway stimulation, cytoskeleton-dependent YAP activation and expansion of chemoresistant cancer stem cells. GR activation correlates with YAP activity in human breast cancer and predicts bad prognosis in the basal-like subtype. Our results unveil a novel mechanism of YAP activation in cancer and open the possibility to target GR to prevent cancer stem cells self-renewal and chemoresistance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>Activation of YAP contributes to tumorigenesis in several tissues.

The core of the mammalian Hippo pathway is a serine/threonine kinase cassette represented by the Ste20-like MST1/2 (Hippo in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) kinases and the large tumour suppressor LATS1/2. Activated MST1/2 in association with the adaptor protein Salvador (Sav1) phosphorylate and activate the downstream kinases LATS1/2, which in turn phosphorylate and inhibit the Hippo pathway nuclear effectors YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif). While phosphorylated YAP/TAZ are retained in the cytoplasm and directed toward proteasome-dependent degradation, dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ localize in the nucleus and function as transcription co-activators for the TEAD family of transcription factors to induce gene expression thereby promoting the cell growth, proliferation and survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>Disruption of Hippo signalling in mouse models promotes tumour formation, while transgenic YAP overexpression in mice results in hyperplasia and eventual tumour development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Aberrant activation of YAP and TAZ has been observed in many human cancers, including high-grade and metastatic breast cancer, and it is associated with tumour initiation, progression and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The YAP/TAZ-induced transcriptional program leads to an increase in cell proliferation, migration, self-renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs), epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and drug resistance, making these transcription co-activators attractive targets for cancer therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>While the core components of the Hippo pathway are well established, a number of additional upstream regulators are emerging. YAP/TAZ, in fact, have turned out to be primary sensors of a variety of signals generated on cell&#x02013;cell contacts, by adhesion and apical&#x02013;basal polarity proteins, by the mechanical cues of the neighbouring cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), as well as in relation to the metabolic state of the cell<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Moreover, a number of diffusible extracellular ligands have been recently entered into the list of YAP/TAZ regulators. In this context, it has been demonstrated that some signalling molecules, among which lysophosphatidic acid and epinephrine, control YAP/TAZ via G-protein-coupled receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Also oestrogens have been shown to strongly impact on YAP/TAZ regulation, but only through the membrane-associated G-protein-coupled oestrogen receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However open questions remain on whether YAP/TAZ are controlled by hormones acting through nuclear receptors.</p><p>Here, we identify glucocorticoids (GCs) as hormonal activators of YAP in breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that GCs treatment promotes fibronectin deposition, focal adhesion-dependent activation of Src and the remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton, which ultimately results in sustained YAP activity. Moreover, we find that in breast cancer cells the activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is fundamental for CSCs self-renewal and chemoresistance and that this effect is the consequence of the transcriptional activity of activated YAP. Our results unveil an unpredicted layer of YAP regulation and put the GR&#x02013;YAP axis at the cornerstone of a potential new therapeutic strategy to specifically target CSCs in breast cancer.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>GCs induce activation of the Hippo transducer YAP</title><p>To identify novel signalling pathways able to control YAP activation in breast cancer we performed a high-content, fluorescence microscopy-based, high-throughput screening using a library of FDA: Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs composed of a collection of 640 clinically used compounds with known and well-characterized bioactivity, safety and bioavailability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The activation of YAP observed in human cancers is linked to increased levels of YAP protein that accumulate in the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Therefore, we monitored the effect of each compound of the library on YAP protein levels in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Drugs were added to the culture medium for 24&#x02009;h and total YAP protein amount was detected by immunofluorescence followed by automated quantification of the YAP-relative signal at single-cell level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). With this analysis, we identified drugs that either reduced or increased YAP protein amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Interestingly, the compounds with the strongest effect in increasing YAP protein levels belong to the class of synthetic GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Betamethasone (BM) was among the strongest hits and, together with hydrocortisone (HC) and dexamethasone (DM), was selected for further analysis.</p><p>Natural GCs, such as cortisol, are a class of steroid hormones acting through specific nuclear receptors and playing important roles in various physiological processes, such as metabolism, immune response and development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Owing to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions, synthetic GCs have been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p><p>To evaluate the response of MDA-MB-231 cells on GCs stimulation, we used the GCs-responsive reporter MMTV-luc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Treatment with BM for 24&#x02009;h led to strong increase of luciferase signal, which was completely prevented by concomitant administration of the GC and progesterone receptors inhibitor RU486 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). To validate the results of the screening we monitored YAP protein levels by western blot (WB) in MDA-MB-231 cells, in Ras-transformed MCF10A-T1k (hereafter MII) cells and in immortalized normal mammary MCF10A cells on treatment with GCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. BM led to a GR-dependent increase of YAP protein levels in all the investigated cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), an effect not observed for the YAP paralog TAZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p>In cells, YAP acts mainly as TEADs transcription co-factor inducing the expression of several genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. To determine whether the GCs-induced increase of YAP levels was associated with its functional activation, we monitored the expression of YAP target genes (<italic>Ankrd1, Cyr61</italic> and <italic>Ctgf)</italic> in MDA-MB-231 cells, on administration of GCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Interestingly, along with increased expression of GILZ, a well known GC-responsive gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, BM treatment increased the expression of YAP target genes and this effect was prevented by RU486 co-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Moreover, short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of YAP, but not of TAZ, prevented the induction of YAP targets, while having no effects on GILZ expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d,e</xref>). To investigate whether GCs could regulate YAP transcriptional activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, we systemically injected DM in C57Bl/6 mice and after 16&#x02009;h we measured YAP transcriptional activity in the mammary tissue. We used the expression levels of YAP target genes C<italic>cnd1</italic> and <italic>Ctgf</italic> as reporters of YAP activity, as they have been previously used with success to monitor YAP activation <italic>in vivo</italic> and have been reported to be expressed in breast tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>; GILZ was used as a control for GR activation. Interestingly, BM treatment led to significant increase in <italic>Ccnd1</italic> and <italic>Ctgf</italic> expression in the mammary tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Taken together, these results support the notion that GCs activate YAP in mammary epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GR controls YAP in breast cancer cells</title><p>Natural GCs are cholesterol-derived hormones released in the serum. Their synthesis and relapse are under circadian and stress-associated regulation exerted by the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Both natural and synthetic GCs mediate their effects on target cells by binding to GR and inducing its translocation into the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor that positively or negatively regulates the expression of GC-responsive genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Several soluble serum factors, such as G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, cytokines and growth factors, have been shown to control YAP activity in cancer cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>; thus, we hypothesized that, acting through GR, GCs may represent a novel class of serum regulators of YAP. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed the ability of serum GCs to activate endogenous GR in breast cancer cells. As expected, in serum-starved MDA-MB-231 cells GR localized mainly in the cytoplasm in an inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). On addition of 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (FBS) to cells for 24&#x02009;h a clear nuclear localization of GR was observed in almost 50&#x00025; of the cells while, after BM treatment, all the cells (100&#x00025;) scored positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>). To assess whether serum GCs control YAP activation in breast cancer cells, we knocked down GR by siRNA transfection in MDA-MB-231, BT-549 and MII cells grown in 10&#x00025; FBS. Interestingly, GR silencing led to a strong reduction of the protein levels of YAP, but not of TAZ, and this effect was due to increased the protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1g,h</xref>). Moreover, GR silencing reduced YAP transcriptional activation, as assayed by monitoring the reporter activity of a YAP-responsive 8XGTII-luc construct and the expression levels of YAP target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Altogether these results demonstrate that GR regulates YAP protein levels and transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GCs induce YAP nuclear localization</title><p>The analysis of YAP subcellular localization showed that all the GCs of the drug collection used for the screening increased the percentage of cells displaying nuclear-localized YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Moreover, validation experiments confirmed that BM induces YAP nuclear localization in serum-starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. As YAP activity is tightly controlled through its phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, we next monitored the levels of YAP phosphorylation on Ser-127, a post-translational modification associated to YAP cytoplasmic retention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Interestingly, on BM treatment, MDA-MB-231 and MII cells displayed a strong decrease of YAP phosphorylation on Ser-127 along with increased YAP protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In line with this, BM treatment rescued YAP nuclear localization in cells grown at high confluence, a condition known to inhibit YAP nuclear localization in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p>The LATS1/2 kinases are key components of the Hippo pathway and are known to phosphorylate YAP on several residues, including Ser-127. Thus, we sought to determine whether LATS1/2 were involved in the regulation of YAP localization by GCs. Of note, while RU486 treatment induced YAP cytoplasmic localization in BM-treated cells, LATS1/2 knockdown completely prevented this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). To confirm the role of LATS1/2 in BM-induced YAP nuclear localization, we transiently transfected MDA-MB-231 cells with a construct expressing a mutant form of YAP (YAP-5SA) able to escape LATS1/2-mediated phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. YAP-5SA was almost completely insensitive to RU486 treatment in BM-treated cells, thus suggesting that GCs regulate YAP subcellular localization in a LATS1/2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Consistently, in parallel with a decrease in YAP phosphorylation, BM caused a reduction of the phosphorylated and active form of LATS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>), confirming that GCs inhibit the Hippo pathway activation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GR activates YAP by inducing FN1</title><p>To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying YAP activation in response to GR stimulation, we monitored the time course of GR and YAP activation after BM treatment using GILZ (target of GR) and Ankrd1 (target of YAP) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels as read outs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, GR nuclear translocation significantly anticipated YAP nuclear accumulation. Moreover, analysis of GILZ and Ankrd1 mRNA levels showed that GR and YAP are not concurrently activated by BM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These results, together with the evidence that YAP mRNA levels are not significantly affected by GCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>), suggest that YAP is not a direct target of GR and are consistent with a scenario, in which YAP is activated as an indirect consequence of the GR transcriptional activity. To identify GR target genes involved in the GC-dependent activation of YAP, we examined the genes induced in MDA-MB-231 cells on DM treatment as annotated in published data set<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and we found an enrichment in genes involved in cellular adhesion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 1, 4 and 5</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. We focused our attention on fibronectin 1 (FN1), a glycoprotein that is essential for establishing cell adhesion to ECM and spreading (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Recently, cell adhesion to fibronectin has been found to regulate Hippo signalling and YAP activation through mechanical stimulation of cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. We also analysed the GR chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-Seq data set of Dex-stimulated A549 cells derived from the ENCODE project and we identified and validated a stringent ChIP-Seq peak in the FN1 promoter, supporting that FN1 is a direct target of GR that could activate YAP by reinforcing cell adhesion to ECM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we monitored FN1 mRNA levels in MDA-MB-231 cells after BM treatment. Of note, BM induced a strong increase of FN1 mRNA and protein levels, as well as its extracellular deposition, in a GR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d&#x02013;f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d,e</xref>). In line with increased fibronectin expression, microscopy analysis confirmed that cells receiving BM underwent marked morphological changes with a clear increase in cell size and spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). These results strongly suggest that GR-induced FN1 expression and deposition might alter the ECM composition in the local microenvironment with a consequent impact on cell adhesion which, in turn, could lead to the YAP activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with BM in combination with a synthetic peptide (the Arg -Gly -Asp (RGD) containing peptide) that competing with ECM proteins' binding to integrin&#x02014;impedes the adhesion of cells to ECM. Of note, RGD co-treatment prevented YAP dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation and Ankrd1 upregulation induced by BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h&#x02013;j</xref>). In line with this evidence, FN1 and integrin &#x003b1;V siRNA transfection prevented the YAP activation downstream of GR stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3f,g</xref>), demonstrating that FN1 acts as an effector of GR signalling to stimulate YAP function.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>GCs activate YAP via actin cytoskeleton remodelling</title><p>Increased matrix stiffness is a feature of several solid tumours, and the integrated cooperation of mechanical and diffusible signals is required to maintain this physical property within the tumour mass<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. YAP has been described as a sensor and transducer of mechanical stimuli. Indeed, in cells grown on high-rigidity substrate under high mechanical tensions generated by actin stress fibres YAP localizes in the nucleus and activates its transcriptional program<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In this context, tension imposed by integrin-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin leads to FAK/Src-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangement, cell spreading and LATS1/2-dependent YAP nuclear localization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Moreover, actin cytoskeleton and Src functions are required for the YAP activation by stiff matrices<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Thus, it is conceivable that GC-induced YAP activation could be triggered by the increased deposition of fibronectin, which in turn stimulates the intracellular integrin&#x02013;FAK&#x02013;Src signalling. To test this hypothesis, we analysed these cascade of events by staining focal adhesions, by vinculin immunofluorescence in BM-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, along with the induction of YAP nuclear localization, BM treatment elicited a marked increase of the number of focal adhesions, which was completely prevented by the GR inhibitor RU486 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Consistently, BM-induced Src activation, as demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of Src (on Y-416) and of FAK (on Y-925, a Src-specific phosphorylation site; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). To prove the involvement of the focal adhesions and of Src pathway activation in YAP nuclear localization downstream of GR, we pharmacologically inhibited Src activation in BM-treated cells. Strikingly, the nuclear translocation and activation of YAP induced by BM was completely prevented by the two Src inhibitors dasatinib and saracatinib, in a LATS1/2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c&#x02013;f</xref>). Similarly, treatment with a FAK inhibitor (PF573228) or growing cells in suspension prevented YAP activation on GC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c&#x02013;e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>).

In line with this, Slug knockdown efficiently inhibited the positive effects of BM on mammosphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>), suggesting that downstream of YAP, Slug acts as an effector of the GC signalling to establish CSCs traits.</p><p>Next, we wanted to test whether GR affects the ability of tumour progenitor cells to seed tumours <italic>in vivo</italic> by serial dilution transplantation experiment of MDA-MB-231-shCTL and MDA-MB-231-shGR cells in mice.

However, although this evidence has been well documented, the mechanisms underlying the GR-associated chemoresistance in breast cancer are largely unknown. In addition to self-renewal, resistance to standard chemotherapy (for example, taxanes treatment) is another well-established feature of CSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. On the basis of our results, we hypothesized that the GC-induced chemoresistance could be mediated by YAP that acts downstream of GR to fuel the expansion of drug-resistant CSCs. To test this hypothesis, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with paclitaxel (PX) for 48&#x02009;h and assessed cell death by monitoring the cleavage of PARP-85, a marker of apoptosis. As expected, PX elicited apoptosis while co-treatment with BM efficiently prevented cell death in a GR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6g</xref>). To demonstrate the involvement of YAP in BM-induced cell survival we knocked down YAP in PX-treated MDA-MB-231 cells and found that YAP silencing rescued drug-induced cell death in BM-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). This evidence prompted us to investigate the consequences of the GR&#x02013;YAP axis abrogation on CSCs expansion during drug treatment. To this aim, we elicited mammosphere formation from MII and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with PX. As expected, PX promoted a slight increase of mammosphere formation efficiency due to the selective expansion of chemotherapy-resistant CSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). However, the pharmacological inhibition of the GR pathway by RU486 co-treatment completely blunted this effect, suggesting that GR is responsible for the expansion of CSCs during PX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Moreover, YAP-5SA overexpression completely rescued CSC expansion in the presence of PX and RU486, thus confirming the role of YAP as an effector of the GR in inducing CSC self-renewal and chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,e</xref>). In line with these results, we stratified patients based on the activation level of GR and we found that high activity of GR was associated with shorter overall survival in basal-like breast tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we demonstrate that YAP is a sensor of GR signalling in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, we found that GR signalling affects the mechanical properties of the tumour microenvironment, ultimately promoting YAP nuclear accumulation and activation. On hormonal stimulation, GR induces expression and extracellular deposition of fibronectin, leading to increased number of focal adhesions and cell spreading. These events, in turn, activate Src and induce actin cytoskeleton rearrangements that promote YAP activation. The GC&#x02013;GR&#x02013;YAP axis is required for and/or enhances self-renewal of breast CSCs and YAP is responsible for the GC-induced resistance to chemotherapy drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>).</p><p>Alterations of the mechanical properties of the ECM, that is, stiffness and elasticity, can be induced by cancer cells themselves or by stromal cells and represent mechanical inputs that profoundly affect crucial biological aspects of tumour development, such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Breast tumours are typically stiffer than the normal tissue and this feature is commonly used as a diagnostic tool to screen patients for early lesions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. The mechanisms underlying how cells sense or alter the mechanical properties of the microenvironment in response to certain stimuli remain largely unknown, particularly in the context of epithelial cells. In this regard, our results establish a direct relationship between the endocrine system and the mechanical features of the ECM, opening a scenario in which aberrant endocrine activation of GR has a relevant impact on tumour microenvironment and, as a consequence, on cancer aggressiveness.</p><p>Cells can sense mechanical signals from ECM through various physical contacts, among which integrin-based cell&#x02013;matrix focal adhesions. Our data indicate that GR stimulation activates YAP through a hormonal and cell-autonomous manner and involves intracellular signalling pathways triggered by the cell&#x02013;ECM interplay. On sensing forces, cells react by increasing tension within the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. This mainly occurs through the activation of two families of proteins: the Src kinases and the RhoGTPases. Signalling pathways activated by these enzymes have been found to mediate the effects of ECM rigidity on YAP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Although RhoA activation on GC treatment has been previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, in this study the main route through which GR signalling acts to activate YAP relies on integrin/Src activation and F-actin polymerization. As the signalling pathways activated by Src kinases and RhoGTPases are connected by extensive crosstalk, further investigations are needed to clarify the exact role of RhoGTPases in this context.</p><p>Interestingly, recent work reported that, through YAP/TAZ activation, ECM stiffness profoundly affects the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to therapeutics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. In the clinic, GCs are frequently prescribed to cancer patients to alleviate the acute toxicity of chemotherapy and to protect healthy tissue (for example, bone marrow) against its long-term effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. However, mounting clinical evidence has suggested that GR activation may induce therapy resistance and is associated with bad prognosis in solid tumours (for example,, basal-like breast cancer and prostate cancer)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Data presented in this work not only fuel the concern raised over the use of GCs as supportive co-medication in anti-cancer treatments, but also provide novel mechanistic explanations of how GCs lead to chemoresistance and tumour relapse by promoting the unscheduled expansion of CSCs, a sub-population of cancer cells that is intrinsically resistant to therapy and highly metastatic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>.</p><p>In our experimental set-up, GCs activate YAP at doses that are comparable to GCs plasma concentrations detected in cancer patients receiving these hormones as palliative therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>.

The influence of acute and chronic stress factors on the development and progression of cancer has been a longstanding hypothesis since ancient times. Epidemiological and clinical studies over the past 30 years have provided evidence for a link between dysregulation of neuroendocrine hormones, in particular catecholamines and cortisol, and cancer progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. The unpredicted role of GCs on YAP activation unveiled by this work suggests that a direct link between stress hormones and oncogenes does exist and that, in some cases, oncogenes may be activated in an endocrine manner.</p><p>In spite of their pro-oncogenic role in some solid cancers, GCs have well-documented pro-apoptotic activity in cells from haematological tumours and are considered as a first line of defence in the treatment of different leukaemias<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>.

This evidence and our results may suggest other possible connections between GCs and YAP via different mechanisms.</p><p>In light of our findings, in fact, it is conceivable that YAP activity could be involved in diverse GC-induced biological responses, in both physiological and pathological conditions. The metabolic syndrome (MetS), for example, might provide another relevant pathological context where this relation is worthy to be investigated.

Mounting clinical data and animal genetic studies have strongly associated aberrant GC signalling with diverse features of MetS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>.</p><p>From a different point of view, the identification of GCs as Hippo pathway regulators opens the doors to the exploration of the potential role both of GCs in organ size control during development and of YAP as part of the cellular physiological response to GCs released under stress or circadian rhythm. The functional role of the endocrine system in YAP activation thus provides a novel conceptual framework to better understand YAP/Hippo pathway functions and regulatory mechanisms under a number of different signals and conditions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reagents and plasmids</title><p>The library of FDA-approved drugs (Screen-Well FDA-Approved Drug Library, 640 chemical compounds dissolved at 10&#x02009;mM in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO)) was obtained from Enzo Life Sciences (Enzo Life Sciences Inc.,Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA).</p><p>The following compounds were purchased from Sigma Aldrich: HC (H0888), verteporfin (SML0534), PX (T7191), RU486 (Mifepristone; M8046), BM (B7005), PF573228 (PZ0117).

(<bold>d</bold>) Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis representing the probability of disease-specific survival in basal breast cancer from the metadata set stratified according to high or low GR signature score (left panel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>; right panel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). The log-rank test <italic>P</italic> value reflects the significance of the association between high levels of the GR signature score and shorter survival in GR signature high as compared with GR signature low patients (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). (<bold>e</bold>) Proposed working model. &#x0002a;<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, &#x0002a;&#x0002a;<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01; two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test is used throughout.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ncomms14073-f7"/></fig></floats-group></article>
