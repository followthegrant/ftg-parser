Here, we found that many SEZ isolates bind to a monoclonal antibody that recognizes poly-<italic>N-</italic>acetylglucosamine (PNAG), a polymer that is found as a surface capsule-like structure on diverse microbes. A fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) screen, coupled with whole-genome sequencing, was used to search for genes for PNAG biosynthesis. Surprisingly, mutations in a gene encoding an M-like protein, <italic>szM</italic>, and the adjacent transcription factor, designated <italic>sezV</italic>, rendered strains PNAG negative. SezV was required for <italic>szM</italic> expression and transcriptome analysis showed that SezV has a small regulon. SEZ strains with inactivating mutations in either <italic>sezV</italic> or <italic>szM</italic> were highly attenuated in a mouse model of infection. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that linked <italic>sezV</italic> and <italic>szM</italic> homologues are present in all SEZ, <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. equi</named-content> subspecies <italic>equi</italic> (SEE), and M18 group A streptococcal (GAS) genomes in the database, but not in other streptococci. The antibody to PNAG bound to a wide range of SEZ, SEE, and M18 GAS strains. Immunochemical studies suggest that the SzM protein may be decorated with a PNAG-like oligosaccharide although an intact oligosaccharide substituent could not be isolated. Collectively, our findings suggest that the <italic>szM</italic> and <italic>sezV</italic> loci define a subtype of virulent streptococci and that an antibody to PNAG may have therapeutic applications in animal and human diseases caused by streptococci bearing SzM-like proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>M protein</kwd><kwd><italic>Streptococcus equi</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Streptococcus zooepidemicus</italic></kwd><kwd>whole-genome sequencing</kwd><kwd>group A streptococcus</kwd><kwd>streptococcal pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>virulence regulation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Young Backbone Teachers Study Abroad Program of China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201706855039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFD0500203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Hongjie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>HHS | NIH | National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI-043247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waldor</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>HHS | NIH | National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D'Gama</surname><given-names>Jonathan D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waldor</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSF)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31772746</award-id><award-id>31302093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/501100012246</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><count count="10" count-type="supplementary-material"/><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="76"/><page-count count="19"/><word-count count="13951"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>September/October 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus equi</named-content> subspecies <italic>zooepidemicus</italic> (SEZ) is a Lancefield group C streptococcus (GCS) that is a constituent of the normal upper respiratory tract flora of domesticated animals, such as horses (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). SEZ is also an opportunistic pathogen, and infections in a wide range of animals, including pigs, cows, dogs, and horses, have been reported (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Epizootic outbreaks in livestock (e.g., swine in China) can be widespread and severe, resulting in significant economic loss (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Infection of horses with another <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. equi</named-content> biovar, <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. equi</named-content> subspecies <italic>equi</italic> (SEE), causes the severe, contagious respiratory infection known as strangles (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). SEZ infection of humans, who typically acquire the pathogen through contact with infected animals or contaminated milk or cheese, typically causes meningitis and can be fatal (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Several virulence factors and protective antigens have been identified in SEZ/SEE, including two M-like proteins, referred to as SzM/SeM and SzP/SzPSe (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>The M/M-like protein family is a class of surface-associated streptococcal proteins that includes M protein, a classical virulence factor of group A streptococcus (GAS; <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pyogenes</named-content>) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Proteins in the group are anchored to the cell wall, share several features (including a primarily alpha-helical/coiled-coil structure, a polar cytoplasmic C-terminal tail, and an extracellular distal N terminus), and function in modulating the host immune response to the pathogen. The diverse immunomodulatory functions of M/M-like proteins include but are not limited to fibrinogen binding, inhibition of complement activation, antiphagocytic activity, and binding to Fc portions of immunoglobulins (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). M/M-like proteins are typically key streptococcal virulence factors that can be targets of protective antibody responses (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The flexible set of criteria for M/M-like protein classification has led to ambiguity in the field since various types of M-like proteins have different designations, functions, and sequences (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>The SzM M-like protein in SEZ has been shown to bind fibrinogen, activate plasminogen, inhibit phagocytosis, and serve as a protective antigen for vaccination (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, the contribution of SzM to SEZ virulence <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been determined. SzP, a second SEZ M-like protein, has been shown to contribute to SEZ virulence in an animal model (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). An SzM ortholog in SEE, SeM (also called FgBP [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]), has also been shown to be an important virulence factor when evaluated in mice (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Dale et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) noted that certain strains of GAS, particularly of the M18 type, encode a SzM ortholog, called Spa (streptococcal protective antigen), which is linked to virulence (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In the M18 strain studied, a Spa deletion mutant was more attenuated in mice than a mutant with the canonical M18 protein deleted and Spa was a protective antigen as well (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Although homologs of SzM have been found in several SEZ, SEE, and GAS strains, the distribution and extent of conservation of SzM homologs in strains of these species and in other streptococcal species is unknown. Furthermore, factors governing the expression of SzM or its homologs have not been described. In contrast, the regulation of M protein and two classes of M-like proteins (M-related protein [Mrp] and M-like protein [Enn]) in GAS by the central virulence regulator, Mga (multiple gene activator), is well described (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>In addition to M/M-like proteins, capsular polysaccharides and other surface polysaccharides are also important streptococcal virulence factors and protective antigens (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). For example, the GAS carbohydrate is critical for GAS virulence (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Poly-<italic>N-</italic>acetyl-<sc>d-</sc>glucosamine (PNAG) is a surface polysaccharide found on numerous Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and fungi (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) that can serve as a virulence factor and a protective antigen (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Surface PNAG has been identified in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pneumoniae</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pyogenes</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. dysgalactiae</named-content> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), but the loci encoding PNAG biosynthesis have not been described in streptococci. Also, the chemical bases of the association of PNAG with the microbial surface have not been elucidated, and it is unknown whether PNAG is physically linked to the cell membrane or cell wall.</p><p>Here, we found that SEZ is bound by a monoclonal antibody to PNAG and performed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based transposon-insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) screen to identify genes required for surface production of PNAG by SEZ. Unexpectedly, the screen identified SzM and a conserved adjacent locus (termed here SezV for SEZ virulence) that promotes <italic>szM</italic> expression. An anti-PNAG monoclonal antibody was found to directly interact with SzM, suggesting that this M-like protein may be decorated with a PNAG-like glycan. SEZ mutants lacking either <italic>sezV</italic> or <italic>szM</italic> were highly attenuated in a mouse model of infection. Comparative genomics revealed that <italic>szM</italic>, <italic>seM</italic>, and/or <italic>spa</italic> (here referred to as <italic>szM</italic>/<italic>seM</italic>/<italic>spa</italic>) are linked to <italic>sezV</italic> in all SEZ and SEE strains in the database, as well as in all M18 GAS, but not in other streptococci. Thus, our findings suggest that SezV-related regulators and the linked SzM family of M-like proteins define a new subset of virulent streptococci.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Tn-seq screen for loci required for surface PNAG expression.</title><p>We observed that a porcine SEZ isolate (ATCC 35246) (referred to as SEZ) was bound by a human anti-PNAG monoclonal antibody (MAb F598) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>), and we set out to identify loci that contribute to PNAG synthesis in SEZ. First, we developed a flow cytometry-based system for high-throughput analysis of the PNAG phenotype of single bacteria, using fluorescently conjugated F598 (AF488-F598). There was a considerable range of fluorescence intensities among a population of AF598 bound stationary-phase cells, but this range had minimal overlap with that of cells bound by an AF488-labeled isotype control antibody (F429) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>). Notably, although F429 was raised against an unrelated carbohydrate, it was engineered to include IgG1 heavy- and light-chain constant region amino acid sequences identical to those of F598 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy using these two labeled antibodies confirmed that F598, but not F429, bound to SEZ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1A</xref>), consistent with the idea that SEZ expresses surface PNAG.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Tn-seq and WGS screens for identification of loci required for surface PNAG expression in SEZ.

Using the recently developed pMar4s mariner-based transposon delivery vector (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), a library containing transposons in &#x0003e;50% of potential insertion sites was created (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">B</xref> in the supplemental material). A FACS-based screen of the Tn library with several rounds of selection for bacteria with low fluorescent intensity after staining with AF598 was carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">C</xref>). We performed the screen with outgrowth in either liquid (screen A) or solid (screen B) media; more modest gating thresholds were applied in the latter, with the aim of identifying genes with weaker phenotypes.

From the resistance profiles of the 100 colonies, the transposition and integration frequency can be estimated. As indicated, colonies with the desired resistances were picked from a second THY + Spc + Km plate grown at 28&#x000b0;C and frozen stocks were made from these colonies. The transposon library was generating by thawing a frozen stock and spreading it over several large square THY + Km plates that were subsequently grown at 37&#x000b0;C, yielding &#x0223c;5.4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> colonies.

Several strains were sequenced, including a few Tn mutants and the RS00930 gene deletion strain that lacked F598 binding. Comparative analyses of these genome sequences revealed that 4 out of 5 F598 negative strains contained one of three distinct mutations in a single gene, RS09465 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/WP_038674722.1" assigning-authority="ncbi:protein">WP_038674722.1</ext-link>, old locus tag SeseC_02416), which we have termed <italic>sezV</italic> (for SEZ virulence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">F</xref>). The amino acid sequence of SezV is predicted to contain two domains, an N-terminal sensor kinase-like domain and an AraC helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain, suggesting that the protein is a transcriptional regulator.

The purified protein was bound by F598, as well as by anti-SeM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis of the peptides produced by trypsin digestion of the protein immunoprecipitated with the anti-SeM antisera confirmed that it was SzM; peptides were detected that span the majority of the predicted processed form of the protein (i.e., lacking the signal sequence and extreme C terminus, which is presumably cleaved as a result of sortase-mediated attachment of SzM to the cell wall) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3D</xref>). Together, these observations establish that the MAb F598 to PNAG binds to SzM. F598 also bound to a single band recognized by anti-SeM in lysates of SEE strain CDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4C</xref>), suggesting that a PNAG-like molecule may decorate SzM homologs in other species.</p><p>To further investigate the chemical bases of the epitopes of SzM and SeM bound by F598, lysates of SEZ and SEE were treated with sodium periodate. This reagent opens the rings between vicinal hydroxyl groups generating aldehydes and is known to disrupt the structure of PNAG such that it is no longer recognized by F598 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4C</xref>). Periodate-treated bacterial lysates of SEZ and SEE were no longer bound by F598 but retained anti-SeM binding; however, the molecular weights of the proteins recognized by the anti SeM antisera shifted to slower-migrating forms, suggesting that the periodate treatment may have led to the formation of higher-order oligomers of SzM and SeM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4C</xref>). These lysates were also treated with dispersin B, an enzyme that specifically cleaves the &#x003b2;-1,6 linkage between glucosamines in PNAG (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). After prolonged treatment with this enzyme, there was a marked reduction in F598 binding with only a minor reduction in binding of the anti-SeM antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4D</xref>). Protease treatment ablated reactivity with both F598 and anti-SeM sera but had minimal effect on purified PNAG polysaccharide. Together, these immunochemical experiments on carbohydrate- and protein-specific degradative enzymes&#x02019; effects on binding of F598 suggest that SzM and SeM are modified by a carbohydrate with a chemical composition similar to PNAG. Importantly however, we did not detect either O- or N-linked glycans in mass spectrometry analyses of purified SzM protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3E</xref>).

SzM/SeM/Spa (also called FgBP) is representative of a class of M-like proteins distinct from M, Mrp, and Enn. SzM/SeM/Spa proteins appear to be decorated with a PNAG-like oligosaccharide, although this conclusion is based on immunochemical analysis rather than definitive chemical isolation of an oligosaccharide associated with these M-like proteins. Both <italic>szM</italic> and <italic>sezV</italic> are required for robust SEZ virulence, and homologues of these linked virulence genes were identified in all SEZ, SEE, and M18 GAS genomes in the database. Thus, the <italic>szM/seM/spa</italic> and <italic>sezV</italic> loci appear to define a subtype of virulent streptococci.</p><p>We used labeled MAb F598 to PNAG to carry out a FACS-based screen of a Tn library in SEZ strain ATCC 35426 to identify insertion mutants that were deficient in surface expression of PNAG. The screen appeared to work well, and even after one round of selection, mutants lacking F598 binding were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1C</xref>); after three rounds of selection, the population was nearly uniformly PNAG negative. However, the library diversity was compromised by Tn jackpots. Linkage between the phenotype (the absence of F598 binding to the Tn insertion mutant) and the genotype (the site of transposon insertion) was not established for several insertions. Whole-genome sequencing led to the identification of mutations in the <italic>sezV</italic> and <italic>szM</italic> loci that were shared among independently derived PNAG-negative SEZ mutants. We were unable to enrich for PNAG-negative cells when a WT (nonmutagenized) SEZ culture was FACS sorted, and it is not clear why PNAG-negative mutants were easily detected in the Tn library.</p><p>Although SezV lacks sequence similarity to Mga, it appears to be a functional analogue of this central GAS virulence activator. In GAS, Mga activates expression of virulence-associated and linked M and M-like proteins (Mrp and Enn) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Like Mga, SezV proved to be a critical activator of SzM expression and to be required for SEZ virulence in mice. The SezV regulon was relatively small since <italic>szM</italic> was the only locus with a &#x0003e;5-fold reduction in transcript levels in the absence of <italic>sezV</italic>. SezV does not appear to regulate expression of SzP, the other M-like protein in SEZ/SEE, suggesting that there are additional SEZ virulence regulators that have yet to be identified. SezV also appears to downregulate (directly or indirectly) the expression of several genes, including an operon coding for the synthesis of a <italic>cne</italic>-containing fimbrial Fim1 pilus. It is tempting to speculate that the SezV coordinated induction of SzM expression and repression of pilus expression corresponds to a SEZ virulence program that facilitates the organism&#x02019;s dissemination from sites, such as the oropharynx, where it is a commensal, to sites such as the bloodstream, lungs, and brain, where it is pathogenic. The presence of the predicted sensor kinase-like domain in SezV suggests the possibility that there may be host-derived stimuli that trigger SezV activity.</p><p>The key role of SzM in SEZ virulence was not known, but a SzM homologue in SEE (SeM) has been linked to virulence (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In addition, McLellan et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) found that Spa, a SzM homolog in M18 GAS, appears to a play a more substantial role in pathogenicity than the canonical M18 protein. Similar to canonical M proteins, SzM proteins likely promote virulence through their immunomodulatory functions. Timoney and coworkers have demonstrated that SzM from SEZ strain NC78 can inhibit phagocytosis and bind to and modify the activity of components of the coagulation cascade such as plasminogen (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In addition to roles in pathogenicity, SzM/SeM/Spa proteins from SEZ, SEE, and M18 GAS strains have proven to be effective immunogens eliciting protective immune responses (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Our analysis of SzM/SeM/Spa sequences from &#x0223c;300 strains revealed that the highest variability is present in the N-terminal regions, whereas the C-terminal coiled-coil domains are more conserved. There appears to be greater variability in SEZ versus SEE, which is consistent with the idea that SEZ as a whole is more genetically variable than SEE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig.&#x000a0;S4E</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, SzM and its activator SezV answered the screen for mutants that were not bound by an MAb (F598) to PNAG. Two observations lend support to the idea that SzM is decorated by a PNAG-like carbohydrate. First, purified SzM was bound by F598, whereas F429, an isotype-matched control antibody that includes identical constant regions as F598 bound with much lower affinity. Second, periodate and dispersin B, reagents that cleave carbohydrates, ablated SzM&#x02019;s reactivity with MAb F598 but not to anti-SeM sera. Specific glycosylation of proteins with oligomers of PNAG (or a related oligosaccharide) has not been described, but O-glycosylation of a streptococcal adhesin has been reported (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). However, it is premature to conclude that SzM is decorated by a PNAG-related oligosaccharide. We did not identify N- or O-linked oligosaccharides bound to SzM by mass spectrometry, and the transposon screen did not yield genes obviously implicated in the synthesis of a polysaccharide. Regardless of whether F598 is recognizing an oligosaccharide linked to SzM, our observation that this antibody binds to a wide range of SEZ, SEE, and M18 GAS strains raises the possibility that immunity to PNAG may have therapeutic applications in animal and human diseases caused by streptococci bearing SzM-like M proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth.</title><p>Bacterial strains are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table&#x000a0;S3</xref> in the supplemental material.

A detailed graphical depiction of the method can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref>.

Bacteria were spread on a THY plate with Km and Spc after dilution, followed by incubation at 28&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02009;days. More than 100 individual colonies were screened to verify that pMar4s was present as an independent plasmid (i.e., it had not yet undergone integration or transposition). Each colony was streaked onto six different plates with various antibiotics and grown at 28&#x000b0;C for 3&#x02009;days or overnight at 37&#x000b0;C, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref>. Colonies that were unable to grow on a THY+Spc plate at 37&#x000b0;C were collected from Spc and Km THY plates, and frozen stocks were made (25% glycerol). After reverifying the antibiotic resistance profile of the frozen stock strains, a final Tn library was constructed by spreading &#x0003e;5.4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> colonies from a frozen stock onto 245-cm<sup>2</sup> square plates (Corning) of THY media, followed by incubation at 37&#x000b0;C overnight.

For routine measurement of antibody binding, live bacteria were labeled with MAb F598 or F429 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488). FACS enrichment of the SEZ transposon library was conducted as follows. An aliquot of the library was stained with AF488-F598 prior to loading on the FACS. From bacteria whose fluorescence intensity was below a specified threshold, the lowest &#x0223c;10% (screen A) and &#x0223c;20% (screen B) of AF488-F598 labeled bacteria were collected. After enrichment, the bacteria were outgrown overnight either in liquid THY plus 1% dextrose media (A) or on solid THY plates (B) prior to re-enrichment by FACS using a threshold similar to that used for the first round. For bacteria grown on solid THY, prior to FACS sorting, the bacteria were scraped from the plate and resuspended in THY media. With each round, the percentage of bacteria that were below the threshold increased. There were two rounds of selection for screen A and three rounds for screen B. Bacteria from each round and the input were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted for Tn-seq. Several individual bacterial colonies from the final round of each screen were also picked and stored as frozen stocks. Some of these non-F598-binding strains were subjected to WGS, leading to bacterial strains with transposon insertions in RS01795, <italic>sezV</italic> (RS09465), and <italic>szM</italic> (RS09460).</p></sec><sec id="s4.5"><title>Tn-seq analysis.</title><p>Tn-seq library construction and data analysis was performed as previously described (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted, transposon junctions were amplified (a custom primer, Himmer3outMar, was designed for the pMar4s transposon plasmid), sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq, and data were analyzed using a modified ARTIST pipeline. Sequence reads were mapped onto the SEZ ATCC 35246 genome. Reads at each TA site were tallied and assigned to annotated genes. We sequenced the original Tn library, as well as the input Tn library used for the FACS screen (a thawed aliquot of the original Tn library) and the output Tn libraries after FACS selection for absence of F598 binding. For each output sample, a multinomial distribution based on the distribution in the output sample was used to resample reads in the corresponding input sample multiple times and total reads in the simulated inputs was adjusted to match that of the respective output sample. A Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test was used to identify genes that have significantly different insertion profiles and read distributions between the output and simulated input samples. Note that only sites in which there were nonzero reads in either the simulated input and/or output were used, as has been previously described (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The log<sub>2</sub>-fold change was also calculated for each gene based on the reads in the output and simulated input library.

To identify transposon insertions in WGS reads, the reads were processed as for Tn-seq analysis. Putative mutations that result in loss of MAb F598 binding were found by identifying mutations present in the strains that could not bind F598 and absent from strains that could bind F598. For newly sequenced GAS strains, libraries were prepared and sequenced as for SEZ strains.
