The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between personality traits, parental education and health-related lifestyles in a cohort of Spanish adolescents. This is a longitudinal study with a source population of 1,123 third-year students (aged 14&#x02013;15) in secondary schools in Spain. At the baseline evaluation sociodemographic variables, parental education and personality (Big Five Questionnaire for Children) were collected. At 18 months of follow-up health related lifestyles, including adherence to a healthy diet (KidMed index), tobacco and alcohol consumption, physical exercise, sleep problems and recreative screen and social network time were collected. A total of 824 adolescents (73.4%) completed the 18 months assessment and 695 (84.3%) presented valid data. Higher conscientiousness was associated to a lower risk for non-adherence to Mediterranean diet (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7, 95% CIs=0.5&#x02013;0.9), tobacco (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5, 95% CIs=0.3&#x02013;0.7) and alcohol consumption (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6, 95% CIs=0.5&#x02013;0.8), excessive use of screens (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7, 95% CIs=0.5&#x02013;0.9) and social network sites (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7, 95% CIs=0.5&#x02013;0.8). Higher levels of extraversion was significantly related to a lower risk of physical inactivity (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7, 95% CIs=0.6&#x02013;0.9), but they are at a higher risk of low adherence to Mediterranean diet (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.3, 95% CIs=1.0&#x02013;1.7), tobacco (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.7, 95% CIs=1.7&#x02013;4.3) and alcohol consumption (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.9, 95% CIs=1.5&#x02013;2.4) and excessive use of social network sites (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.6, 95% CIs=1.3&#x02013;1.9). High levels of emotional instability were associated with tobacco consumption (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.5, 95% CIs=1.0&#x02013;2.2) and sleep problems (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.0, 95% CIs=1.5&#x02013;2.7). Finally, we found an association with lower parental education and adolescents&#x02019; low adherence to Mediterranean diet (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.6, 95% CIs=1.0&#x02013;2.4) and sleep problems (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.8, 95% CIs=1.0&#x02013;3.0). Cluster analysis of health-related behaviours indicated the presence of two different clusters (unhealthy and healthy adolescents) that were associated with personality traits. Conscientiousness, extraversion, emotional instability and parental education are independent factors associated with the acquisition of adolescent healthy lifestyles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Public health</kwd><kwd>Psychiatric disorders</kwd><kwd>Risk factors</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Acquisition of healthy lifestyles during adolescence is critical for the prevention of most non-communicable diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mental illnesses). These diseases commonly occur in adulthood and could be prevented by adopting healthy lifestyles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In addition, those conditions entail high financial and social costs for the society<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Numerous studies have shown an association between personality and health status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The behavioural mediation model postulates that the observed association between personality and health would be the result of adopted healthy lifestyles (e.g., healthy diet, physical exercise, etc.), along with the avoidance of behaviours that could be harmful to health (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, etc.). The association between personality and healthy lifestyles begins in early stages of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and promoting healthy lifestyles among children or adolescents reinforce the adoption of healthy habits and could delay or prevent chronic illnesses in the future.</p><p id="Par4">The Big Five is a theory of personality traits that identifies five distinct factors as central to personality: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, and emotional instability (neuroticism). However, is still controversial whether personality traits are stable over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">High conscientiousness scores have been related with healthier lifestyles in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A literature review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> indicated that conscientiousness trait in adults predict health status throughout life and is also associated with a lower risk of mortality. Recent research suggests that lower conscientiousness levels in childhood are associated with a lower health status (measured in terms of blood pressure, glucose level, lipid profile, body mass index, and medication consumption) in the adulthood. These associations were maintained even after controlling for conscientiousness in adult life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These results indicate that the association between conscientiousness and mortality could be mediated by lifetime health-related behaviours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The mechanisms involved constitute an important field of research, given that lifestyles are potentially modifiable, especially if interventions are performed early.</p><p id="Par6">Promoting healthy lifestyles should have an important impact in the prevention of diseases. All lifestyles factors are potentially modifiable and there is a robust evidence that interventions to promote healthy lifestyles are effective in the prevention of diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Southern European countries have the highest rate of child obesity in Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, one possible cause is the loss of the traditional Mediterranean diet in child and adolescents. The Mediterranean diet is considered one of the healthiest dietary patterns that contributes to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and could have a protective effect on the incidence of depression in young adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Despite all these benefits, in general and especially among children and adolescents, there has been a progressive abandonment of the food pattern based on the Mediterranean diet in our environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Regular physical activity entails benefits that contribute to the well-being of individuals with respect to physical, mental and social aspects. Performing physical exercise at least 90&#x02009;minutes a week reduces all causes of death, including all types of cancer, and there is an increase in life expectancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, high levels of physical exercise in childhood and adolescence predicts high levels of physical exercise in adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Adolescents who are sleep deprived have greater intolerance to stress, emotional dysregulation, behavioural disorders, depression, and other emotional disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Different longitudinal studies have indicated that lack of sleep, emotional dysregulation, and depressive symptoms interact with each other simultaneously as causes and consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In this way, emotional instability could favour emotional dysregulation responses, increasing cognitive activity and inhibiting sleep. In turn, sleep deprivation would alter emotional processing and, therefore, its regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">There is a lack of robust evidence on the association between personality and lifestyles related to health in a large sample of adolescents. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between personality traits, parental education, and health-related lifestyles among south European adolescents (aged 14 to 15 years). We hypothesized that high levels of conscientiousness and high parental education would be related to healthier lifestyles among adolescents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par11">Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the lifestyles of adolescents included in the study by sex.

High conscientiousness scorers were more likely to adhere to the Mediterranean diet, smoked less, consumed less alcohol, and made better use of social networks. High extraversion scorers were more likely to engage in physical exercise; however, they were more likely to smoke and drink regularly, and adhered poorly to the Mediterranean diet. High scores in emotional instability were related to higher consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and sleep problems.

According to a review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, the most important aspect of conscientiousness would be self-regulation that includes impulse control. Self-regulation is originated in childhood and adolescence, and is completely developed in the adult stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In our study, the association observed between conscientiousness and adherence to the Mediterranean diet could be mediated by the capacity for self-regulation.

The association of parental education and adolescents sleep problems&#x02014;which has not been previously reported in the literature&#x02014;could be mediated by reduced ability to effectively protect sleep hygiene and emotional regulation of adolescents, and, perhaps, also their sociability, since the two-way interaction between sleep and social bond has also been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Sleep deprivation in adolescents is linked to screens and social networks use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.

In addition, personality traits can help identifying high-risk groups and perform appropriate interventions based on their characteristics. Finally, the confirmation of the importance of parents and socio-economic status in the acquisition of healthy lifestyles during adolescence. Our results indicated that adolescents whose parents had lower educational level were more likely to eat unhealthy food and report sleep problems.

The KIDMED index included 16 questions about food habits, and classified individuals according to the scores of the Mediterranean Diet Quality index differentiated into three categories: high adherence, optimal Mediterranean diet (8 and 12 points); medium adherence, need for improvement in the food pattern to adapt it to the Mediterranean model (4 and 7 points); and low adherence, very low quality of the diet (0 and 3 points).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Physical activity</title><p id="Par37">The level of weekly physical exercise was assessed with a question about the number of days per week they performed some sport extra-curricularly: (1) never; (2) once a week; (3) twice a week; (4) three times a week; (5) four times a week; and (6) five or more times a week. This variable was categorised as performing weekly physical exercise (yes/no).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Tobacco</title><p id="Par38">Smoking was assessed using seven items adapted from a previously validated questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, which assessed the consumption of tobacco categorised as weekly tobacco consumption (yes/no).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Alcohol consumption</title><p id="Par39">Alcohol consumption was quantified using the following question: How often do you drink alcoholic beverages? = (1) never-almost never; (2) sometimes a month; (3) on weekends; and (4) daily or almost daily. This variable was categorised as weekly consumption of alcoholic beverages (yes/no).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Sleep problems</title><p id="Par40">Sleep problems were assessed with the following question: Do you have sleep problems? = (1) never-almost never; (2) sometimes a month; (3) many nights (one or more nights a week); and (4) every night. This variable (yes/no) was categorised according to having sleep problems one or more times per week. In addition, the number of hours they slept on school days and on weekends was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Screen time and use of social networks</title><p id="Par41">Television, screen, and social media hours were collected separately for school days and weekends. The variable was categorised as excessive use of screens (yes/no) and/or social networks (yes/no) if more than two hours per day were used on school days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par42">The listwise deletion method (with complete case deletion) was used to account for missing data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Quantitative variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation, and qualitative variables in the form of absolute frequencies and percentages. The analysis of the differences between groups for the quantitative parameters was performed using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test. Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square test was used to assess the differences between the qualitative variables. Listwise deletion method (complete case) were used for handling missing data.</p><p id="Par43">The effect of personality on healthy lifestyle habits was assessed by standardising the values of different personality traits and adjusting different binary logistic regression models in which the dependent variables were: (1) low adherence to the Mediterranean diet (KIDMED&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;7); (2) not performing physical exercise at least once a week; (3) weekly tobacco consumption; (4) weekly alcohol consumption; (5) having weekly sleep problems; (6) excessive use of screens; and (7) excessive use of social networks.</p><p id="Par44">A general linear model was also adjusted. The dependent variable was adherence to the Mediterranean diet as a continuous variable, and the independent variables were the levels of conscientiousness, parental education, and age and sex of the adolescents.</p><p id="Par45">Cluster analysis (k-means algorithm) was used to identify groups of students who shared common health-related lifestyles. This technique identifies subgroups of cases in adolescents based on shared characteristics. All variables were standardized before the cluster analysis. This method identifies uniform groups by maximizing inter-group variance and minimizing intra-group variance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Subsequent analyses (t-test and Chi-Square) were used to identify differences between the clusters and sociodemographic characteristics (gender and parental education) and personality traits.</p><p id="Par46">It was considered that there were statistically significant differences when the <italic>p</italic>-value was &#x0003c;0.05. All data were analysed using the SPSS Statistics 24 software (IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois, United States).</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are extremely grateful to the teachers and students of the participating schools for collaborating with us and supporting this study.
