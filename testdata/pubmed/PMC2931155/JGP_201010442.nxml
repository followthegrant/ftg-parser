Channels comprised of unedited (Q) subunits are strongly blocked by polyamines, but insensitive to fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), whereas homomeric edited (R) channels resist polyamine block but are inhibited by AA and DHA. In the present study, we have analyzed fatty acid modulation of whole-cell currents mediated by homomeric recombinant GluK2 (formerly GluR6) channels with individual residues in the pore-loop, M1 and M3 transmembrane helices replaced by scanning mutagenesis. Our results define three abutting surfaces along the M1, M2, and M3 helices where gain-of-function substitutions render GluK2(Q) channels susceptible to fatty acid inhibition. In addition, we identify four locations in the M3 helix (F611, L614, S618, and T621) at the level of the central cavity where Arg substitution increases relative permeability to chloride and eliminates polyamine block. Remarkably, for two of these positions, L614R and S618R, exposure to fatty acids reduces the apparent chloride permeability and potentiates whole-cell currents &#x0223c;5 and 2.5-fold, respectively. Together, our results suggest that AA and DHA alter the orientation of M3 in the open state, depending on contacts at the interface between M1, M2, and M3. Moreover, our results demonstrate the importance of side chains within the central cavity in determining ionic selectivity and block by cytoplasmic polyamines despite the inverted orientation of GluK2 as compared with potassium channels and other pore-loop family members.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Amphiphilic compounds, including the cis-unsaturated fatty acids arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), regulate the activity of ion channels, transporters, and a variety of other membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boland and Drzewiecki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meves, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roberts-Crowley et al., 2009</xref>). In most cases the specific mechanism of regulation remains unknown, but it is thought to involve partition of the compounds into the membrane where they may alter the bulk mechanical properties of the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lundbaek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>), displace annular lipids immediately surrounding the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Powl and Lee, 2007</xref>), or bind to specific domains along the protein&#x02013;lipid interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossfield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gawrisch and Soubias, 2008</xref>). Despite these uncertainties, we have begun to use scanning mutagenesis to investigate how changes in the structure of glutamate receptors alter their susceptibility to modulation by free AA and DHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilding et al., 2008</xref>). Members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family are particularly attractive for this analysis because different family members may be potentiated, inhibited, or unaffected by exposure to AA or DHA, depending on their subunit composition and editing status. NMDA receptors, made up of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collingridge et al., 2009</xref> for current IUPHAR subunit nomenclature), are potentiated after treatment with AA or DHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishikawa et al., 1994</xref>), whereas neuronal &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors are weakly inhibited by AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kovalchuk et al., 1994</xref>). Currents mediated by native kainate receptors, as well as some recombinant receptors, are strongly inhibited by fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilding et al., 1998</xref>), although susceptibility of recombinant receptors to fatty acid inhibition depends on the editing status at the Q/R site within the channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilding et al., 2005</xref>). Recombinant channels in which all of the subunits include an R at the Q/R site are inhibited by DHA, but inclusion of unedited subunits with Q at this location dramatically reduces inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilding et al., 2005</xref>). Editing status at the Q/R site also governs the permeation properties of kainate and AMPA receptors and their susceptibility to pore block by polyamines. Channels homomeric for Q at the Q/R site exhibit more potent polyamine block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowie and Mayer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamboj et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koh et al., 1995</xref>) and higher relative permeability to calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dingledine et al., 1999</xref>) than channels that include one or more edited (R) subunits.</p><p>The recently solved crystal structure of homomeric AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>) revealed a tetrameric pore similar to an inverted potassium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>), as was predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wo and Oswald, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wood et al., 1995</xref>) based on sequence homology and analysis of subunit topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Dingledine, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollmann et al., 1994</xref>). Although several portions of the AMPA receptor channel that face the cytoplasm, including the M1&#x02013;M2 and M2&#x02013;M3 loops, were not resolved in the GluA2 crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>), the overall layout of the GluA2 pore generally supports previous structural interpretations that relied on homology to the pore-loop motif of potassium channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panchenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuner et al., 2003</xref>). In particular, the Q/R editing site lies at the apex of the pore loop, preceded by an &#x003b1;-helical domain and is likely followed by the open coil that forms the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Scanning mutagenesis studies have yielded several insights into the structural basis of GluK2 regulation by polyamines and DHA. Work by Mayer and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panchenko et al., 2001</xref>) identified locations within the pore loop where amino acid substitution with alanine or tryptophan reduced, or in one case enhanced, channel block by polyamines. In addition, our previous work showed that R at the Q/R site was not unique in conferring sensitivity to inhibition by DHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilding et al., 2008</xref>). Instead, substitution with R at several locations in the upstream pore helix of GluK2(Q) resulted in homomeric channels that were strongly inhibited by DHA. Collectively, these results suggest an important role for pore-loop conformation in determining channel sensitivity both to polyamines and to lipid-derived antagonists.</p><p>In the present study, we have analyzed DHA inhibition in homomeric GluK2(Q) channels containing 70 of the Ala and Trp substitution mutations generated by Mayer and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panchenko et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, we have extended our Arg scan of the pore of GluK2(Q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilding et al., 2008</xref>) to include substantial portions of the M1 and M3 transmembrane helical domains. Together with previous work, our results identify more than 30 gain-of-function substitutions: point mutations that confer susceptibility to strong DHA regulation on GluK2(Q) channels that otherwise exhibit little or no functional regulation by DHA. The distribution of these mutation sites defines three surfaces at the interface of the M1, M2, and M3 helices where Arg substitution at any single location converts GluK2(Q) from being insensitive to free DHA to being strongly inhibited. Although our results do not directly address whether modulation involves specific binding of DHA to the channel, they demonstrate that positive charge anywhere along the contact surface between the pore helix and adjacent M1 and M3 helices leads to reduced channel activity in the presence of DHA, suggesting that DHA impedes the relative movement of M1, M2, and M3 associated with opening of wild-type channels that have undergone Q to R editing or mutant channels bearing specific Arg, Trp, or Ala substitutions along this interface domain. In addition, we have identified several positions along one face of the M3 helix at the level of the central cavity where substitution with Arg yields channels that are permeable to chloride as well as monovalent cations; for two of these Arg substitution mutants, exposure to DHA reduced relative chloride permeability and potentiated, rather than inhibited, whole-cell current amplitude. Collectively, our results suggest that exposure to DHA alters the relative orientation of M3 in the open state, changing which face of the helix is directed toward the central cavity. Finally, the persistence of DHA modulation in the near absence of internal polyamines, as well as the incomplete overlap in sites where amino acid substitution alters polyamine block and DHA modulation, indicates that polyamines are not required for channel regulation by DHA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>cDNA constructs, cell culture, and transfection</title><p>Wild-type GluK2(R) cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egebjerg et al., 1991</xref>), provided by Steve Heinemann (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA), was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector for expression in HEK293 cells.

For experiments that required rapid solution exchange, the drug reservoirs were kept under &#x0223c;10 p.s.i. of static air pressure, and computer-gated electronic valves were used to control solution flow to the delivery pipette. Because of the relatively small maximal amplitude of currents mediated by mutant subunits, whole-cell recordings were used to analyze desensitization, despite unavoidable limitations on the speed of extracellular solution exchange (tau &#x0223c;5&#x02013;15 ms).</p><p>DHA stocks (50 mM in DMSO) were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C in aliquots under argon gas and freshly diluted each day for recording.

Averages of five ramps, recorded in control solution immediately before or after exposure to kainate, were subtracted from the mean ramp current during kainate application. In most recordings there was little or no hysteresis between rising and descending ramps, thus interaction with polyamines was assumed to be at steady state (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rozov et al., 1998</xref>).

Based on homology to GluA2 and to the membrane-embedded domains of potassium channel subunits, our earlier study showed that Arg substitutions in M2 where the side chain was oriented toward the M1 and M3 transmembrane &#x003b1; helices significantly enhanced DHA inhibition. These results suggested that susceptibility to DHA may depend on interactions between the M2 helix and adjacent helices but did not rule out other possible mechanisms. For example, altered sensitivity to DHA might result from a local conformational change within M2 that did not involve any substantial change in contact with M1 and/or M3. To gain a better understanding of the structural basis for channel regulation by DHA we analyzed inhibition of homomeric channels formed by 70 Ala and Trp substitution mutants provided by Mark Mayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panchenko et al., 2001</xref>). Substitution with Ala provides a small nonpolar side chain that represents a conservative replacement for most small residues, and is likely to be tolerated at positions occupied by hydrophobic residues. In contrast, the large Trp side chain would be expected to induce local structural changes when replacing a variety of smaller residues. We also generated 58 new Arg substitution mutants that extend our scan of the GluK2 pore along major segments of the M1 and M3 helices. The large positively charged Arg side chain was chosen because Arg replaces Gln in wild-type edited subunits. Thus, Arg substitution mutants effectively move the Arg side chain from position 590 to a different location within the channel domain of GluK2(Q). Most experiments were performed on cells that were pretreated with concanavalin A, to increase the amplitude of steady-state whole-cell currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huettner 1990</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Homology among glutamate receptor and potassium channel subunits.

Together, these three surfaces delineate the interface where the M2 helix is likely to make close contact with the anti-parallel M1 and M3 helices. Insertion of positive charge at almost any location within this interface, including Q to R substitution by RNA editing of wild-type subunits, changes the contact between M2 and M1/M3, altering the relative motion of these helices when channels open in the presence of DHA. Our results further demonstrate only a partial overlap in the M2 locations where Ala, Trp, or Arg substitutions affect DHA inhibition, and positions where substitution affects polyamine block. Trp substitutions in M2 enhanced DHA inhibition and reduced polyamine block when the large Trp side chain replaced a smaller wild-type residue (G, A, S, T, N), whereas Trp substitution for larger residues (F, L, V) had little or no effect, except near the carboxy-terminal end of M2 immediately preceding the Q/R site. Ala substitution enhanced DHA inhibition at only two locations in M2, T576 and F583, both of which are on the side of the pore helix predicted to face directly toward M1 and M3. Interestingly, T576, located near the opposite end of the pore helix from the Q/R site, is the only position where all three substitutions (A, W, and R) enhanced DHA inhibition and reduced polyamine block.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Locations where Arg substitution regulates fatty acid inhibition and potentiation.

The weakest potentiation was observed for GluK2(Q) L600R, which is positioned on the cytoplasmic end of M3, below the interface where M2 contacts M3. Significantly stronger potentiation was observed for Arg substitutions at L614 and S618, which are predicted to point into the central cavity just beyond the tip of the pore loop midway between the intracellular and extracellular ends of the M3 helix. Importantly, the potentiation of GluK2(Q) L614R was shown to be largely a result of increased unitary current amplitude, with a more modest increase in estimated open probability. This stands in sharp contrast to DHA potentiation of NMDA receptor channels and DHA inhibition of GluK2(R), which exclusively involve changes in P<sub>open</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishikawa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilding et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the mechanism of potentiation for M3 mutant GluK2(Q) homomeric channels appears to be fundamentally different from modulation of wild-type NMDA receptors and GluK2(R).</p><p>Subunits with Arg or Lys substituted for L614 or S618, or with Arg substitutions at F611 or T621, displayed increased permeability to Cl ions, as evidenced by positive shifts in reversal potential when CsCl was substituted for internal cesium glucuronate or when sodium glucuronate replaced extracellular NaCl. All of these residues are predicted to face the central cavity, at least when the channels are open (see below). Substitution with positively charged side chains at these locations, as well as G606, G607, and W610, also eliminated block by cytoplasmic polyamines. Previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burnashev et al. (1996)</xref> demonstrated significant chloride permeability for homomeric wild-type GluK2(R) channels (PCl/PCs = 0.74). In addition, our earlier Arg scan of pore-loop residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilding et al., 2008</xref>) showed that between V571 and P597 residues with positively charged side chains supported chloride permeation only when substituted at position 590, the Q/R site, which is believed to point up into the cavity from the apex of the pore loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>). Collectively, these results are consistent with experiments on other channels of the pore-loop superfamily that have highlighted the importance of residues facing the central cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>) in determining channel permeation properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">K&#x000fc;hn et al., 2007</xref>) and susceptibility to block by polyamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shyng et al., 1997</xref>) or divalent ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu and MacKinnon, 1994</xref>). The fact that DHA potentiation of L614R results primarily from an increase in ion conductance and is associated with an apparent change in relative chloride permeability, suggests that DHA changes the relative energy barriers for flux of chloride and cations, possibly by altering the orientation of M3 in the open state and repositioning the substituted side chains away from the pore axis.</p><p>An important difference between channel modulation by DHA and block by cytoplasmic polyamines is that polyamines occupy the conductance pathway, causing channel block that is strongly voltage dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowie and Mayer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamboj et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koh et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast, DHA modulation exhibits little or no voltage dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilding et al., 2005</xref>) and likely involves changes within the membrane, either displacement of annular lipids surrounding each channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossfield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Powl and Lee, 2007</xref>) or alterations in bulk membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casado and Ascher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruno et al., 2007</xref>). Despite this apparent difference in mechanism, our results demonstrate broad overlap in structural requirements for regulation. Of the 66 locations where substitution mutants expressed as functional homomeric channels, nearly half (47%) exhibited both a reduction in polyamine block and an increase in modulation by DHA for at least one of the substituted amino acids (A, R, or W). Fewer locations showed selective regulation by either polyamine block (21%) or DHA modulation (9%) alone, and substitution had no significant effect on block or modulation at roughly a quarter of all locations that allowed functional expression (23%).</p><p>In K channels the inner helix bundle crossing and central cavity face the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>). K channel block involves entry of polyamines into the central cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phillips and Nichols, 2003</xref>) and is sensitive to placement of charged residues along the inner helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurata et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, the inverted orientation of glutamate receptor channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Dingledine, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollmann et al., 1994</xref>) means that cytoplasmic polyamines would need to pass through the selectivity filter to access the central cavity, which faces the extracellular solution. For both K channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopatin and Nichols, 1996</xref>) and glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">B&#x000e4;hring et al., 1997</xref>), the potency of polyamine block is reduced by permeant ion flux (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rozov et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, detailed kinetic analysis by Mayer and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowie et al., 1998</xref>) provided evidence for block of both closed and open conformations of GluK2(Q) by cytoplasmic polyamines, although the lack of voltage dependence to closed channel block suggested that polyamines did not penetrate far into the membrane field in the closed state. Previous analysis of the effect of amino acid substitutions on glutamate receptor polyamine block has focused on the pore loop and selectivity filter where polyamines are most likely to be retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panchenko et al., 2001</xref>), and on adjacent locations on the cytoplasmic face of the channel where substituted residues may repel polyamines from approaching the pore. Our results show that polyamine block is eliminated by substitutions in the central cavity far above the selectivity filter. For example, T621 is located at the distal end of the cavity just before the M3 helix bundle crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>), yet T621R substitution drastically reduced polyamine block. Permeability to chloride was a feature of some, but not all, of the M3 substitutions that eliminated polyamine block. Thus, influx of extracellular chloride at positive potentials may help to dispel polyamines from the pore; but, apparently such influx is not required. Indeed, there was no evidence for restoration of polyamine block for Arg or Lys substitutions of L614 or S618 when nearly all of the external chloride was replaced with glucuronate. Together, our results indicate that the presence of positively charged side chains along one face of the M3 helix is sufficient to eliminate block.</p><p>In contrast to amino acid replacements within the pore loop, subunits with Arg substitutions at several locations in the M1 and M3 helices failed to express as functional channels or produced whole-cell currents that were too small for accurate determination of inhibition after exposure to DHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>, black). Nearly all of the locations where Arg substitution abrogated channel function are predicted to lie along the sides of M1 and M3 that face outward, away from the channel pore, toward the M4 helix or surrounding lipids. However, at several outward-facing locations near the cytoplasmic or extracellular ends of M1 and M3, Arg substitutions were tolerated and did not enhance GluK2(Q) susceptibility to inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>, green). In addition, Arg and/or Trp substitutions at several locations along the M2 helix, including L577 and S580, promoted strong DHA inhibition, but in the closed conformation appear to face outward from the pore at the interface between adjacent subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 C</xref>, right). In AMPA receptors, the subunit junctions have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>) as potential interaction sites for auxiliary proteins that regulate channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tomita, 2010</xref>). Whether accessory proteins specific for kainate receptors, such as the recently identified NETO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), may occupy this position or whether this side of the M2 helix faces directly toward annular lipids remains to be determined.</p><p>In the present study, interpretation of our mutagenesis scan is based on homology to the recently published x-ray structure of homomeric GluA2 AMPA receptor channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>); whereas previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panchenko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sobolevsky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilding et al., 2008</xref>) was referenced to crystal structures of KcsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>) and other related potassium channels. GluK2 and GluA2 share a much higher proportion of sequence that is either identical or represent conservative substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kein&#x000e4;nen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egebjerg et al., 1991</xref>) than for potassium channel subunits, supporting the use of GluA2 as a superior template. Indeed, the significantly lower primary sequence homology between GluK2 and K channel subunits in the M1 segment, as compared with the region that includes M2 and M3, led us to use a different M1 alignment, offset by six residues, for our previous homology model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilding et al., 2008</xref>). Independent evidence concerning glutamate receptor M3 helix orientation comes from studies of functional modification of cysteine-substituted channels by methanethiosulfonate reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wollmuth and Sobolevsky, 2004</xref>). For the AMPA receptor, GluA1 subunit residues homologous to GluK2 G607, W610, F611, L614, S618, and T621 all were accessible to modification by extracellularly applied methanethiosulfonate reagents when channels were opened by glutamate coapplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sobolevsky et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The cytoplasmic loops from M1 to M2 (R552 through V571) and M2 to M3 (Q591 through L595), which includes the selectivity filter downstream of the Q/R site, are not resolved in the x-ray structure of GluA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the accuracy of these segments of our model is much less certain, and interpretation of substitutions in these domains must remain tentative until further structural information is available. Also of importance is the fact that GluA2 was crystallized with a competitive antagonist, ZK200775, lodged in the agonist binding site and thus presents the channel in a presumably closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>). Channel opening is likely to involve movement of M3 and possibly also the M1 helix, which may alter their orientation relative to M2. In particular, opening of K channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perozo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yi et al., 2001</xref>) and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flynn and Zagotta, 2001</xref>) is thought to involve coordinated rotation of the inner and outer (M3 and M1) helices, which, if it occurs in GluK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sobolevsky et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2004</xref>), would reorient residues relative to the central axis of the pore. For example, a backward rotation about the M3 helical axis of approximately &#x0223c;30&#x000b0; from the closed conformation would position L614 and S618 directly toward the central axis. Given the twofold symmetry of the agonist binding domain dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobolevsky et al., 2009</xref>), equivalent rotation of all four subunits seems unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sobolevsky et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that only two of the four M3 Arg substitutions in a homomeric tetramer may be essential for altering channel selectivity, polyamine block, and DHA modulation. In addition, differences in ionization state among the four substituted side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Root and MacKinnon, 1994</xref>) could determine which subunit pair plays the greater role in influencing channel properties.</p><p>In summary, we have now identified &#x0003e;30 gain-of-function substitutions that render GluK2(Q) susceptible to modulation by cis-unsaturated fatty acids. Our results do not resolve whether DHA regulates GluK2 by binding to a specific region of the channel or by altering physical properties of the surrounding membrane, which might be better addressed by loss-of-function mutations that eliminate inhibition of GluK2(R). Nevertheless, our results indicate that, depending on the underlying structure of the channel, exposure to DHA changes the motion of M1 and M3 relative to M2 as channels gate, as well as the final orientation of M3 in the open state. Locations where point mutations render channels susceptible to DHA inhibition are spread along the interface between the pore-loop helix, including the Q/R editing site, and adjacent segments of M1 and M3, suggesting that relative motion of these domains is affected by DHA exposure. In addition, DHA modifies the effect of Arg substitutions located further up the M3 helix at the level of the central cavity, increasing unitary conductance and reducing relative chloride permeability, which strongly suggests a DHA-induced difference in orientation of M3 to reposition these side chains away from the central axis of the pore in the open state.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Mark Mayer, Steve Heinemann, and Peter Seeburg for providing channel subunit cDNAs and to Colin Nichols and Nazzareno D&#x02019;Avanzo for critical reading of the manuscript.</p><p>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NS30888).</p><p>Lawrence G.
