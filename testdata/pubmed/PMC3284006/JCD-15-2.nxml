Rajan, B.Sc., MDS, FDSRCPS (Glasg), D.Sc., founding father of the Federation of Operative Dentistry of India (FODI), the Indian Association of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics (IACDE). A loss that is irreparable to the world of dentistry at large, and in particular, to the specialty of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics. Commencing his career with a humble beginning he rose to reach great heights in dentistry both academically and administratively. He was the former Principal of the Tamilnadu Government Dental College. Taking into view the dearth of qualified dental surgeons to serve the community, he had the brilliant vision of starting Ragas Dental College and Hospital in the year 1989, which is a pioneer dental institute. He was the first dental surgeon to become Vice-Chancellor of the Tamilnadu Dr. MGR Medical University. The monumental edifice in Chennai, which is the University today, stands as a glorious example of his constant efforts and achievement toward the betterment of the University and its activities.</p><p>Born in Poochikadu Village, Tirunelveli District, Tamilnadu, in the year 1932, he had his schooling in Tirunelveli. Later he came to Chennai and completed his B.Sc. from Presidency College and subsequently joined the Dental course in Madras Medical College. At every stage he had to cross many hurdles and it was sheer hard work and determination to fight against odds that resulted in his future achievements. He was also a former special representative for the Government of Tamilnadu in New Delhi.</p><p>As President of the Dental Council of India he managed its affairs efficiently and cordially. As President of Indian Dental Association, he brought glory to the association. His contribution to the world of academics in dentistry is par excellence. Such is the glory of this great laureate and his contribution to the field of dentistry, and it will ever be remembered. He was a great leader, administrator, and a mentor to many. A fitting tribute to his memory will be to follow his footsteps and remember his contributions always. May his glory live forever.</p><p>Now this organization is going to spell a new name, &#x02018;Indian Association of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics&#x02019;. This change has become a necessity for various reasons. The purpose, objective, and functioning remains the same. We have charted out various activities for the ensuing year and this can be fulfilled with the full cooperation and efforts of our members. I request that the members send me their valuable suggestions for the betterment of our Association and Specialty. You can contact me at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ramachandran_principal@yahoo.co.in">ramachandran_principal@yahoo.co.in</ext-link></p><p>Your suggestions will be thankfully received and faithfully applied.</p><p>Jai Hind</p></body></article>
