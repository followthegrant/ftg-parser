However, the molecular events underlying its development remain unclear. We sought to identify SAR-associated altered gene expression in nasal epithelial cells during natural exposure to JC pollen. We recruited study participants in 2009 and 2010 and collected nasal epithelial cells between February and April, which is the period of natural pollen dispersion. Fifteen patients with SAR-JC and 13 control subjects were enrolled in 2009, and 17 SAR-JC patients, 13 sensitized asymptomatic subjects (Sensitized), and 15 control subjects were enrolled in 2010. Total RNA was extracted from nasal epithelial cells and 8 SAR-JC patients and 6 control subjects in 2009 were subjected to microarray analysis with the Illumina HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChip platform. Allergen-stimulated histamine release was examined in the peripheral blood basophils isolated from patients with SAR. We identified 32 genes with significantly altered expression during allergen exposure. One of these, <italic>CST1</italic> encodes the cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin SN. <italic>CST1</italic> expression in nasal epithelial cells was significantly upregulated in both the 2009 and 2010 SAR-JC groups compared with the control groups. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the increased expression of CST1 in the nasal epithelial cells of SAR patients. Addition of exogenous CST1 to basophils inhibited JC allergen-stimulated histamine release in vitro. We propose that CST1 may contribute to inactivation of protease allergens and help re-establish homeostasis of the nasal membranes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by research grants from Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) grant number 20590327, from Japan Science and Technology Agency, Japan, and from a Grant-in-Aid for Science Research from the Ministry of health and Welfare (H23-Immunoloy-006).

In Japan, the prevalence of rhinitis was 16% in 1992 and 21% in 2002 <xref rid="pone.0067057-Nishima1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) due to the Japanese cedar (JC) <italic>Cryptomeria japonica</italic>pollen is an IgE-mediated type I allergy that affects the nasal mucosa and causes sneezing, itchiness, and nasal obstruction. It is one of the most common causes of allergy in Japan and is thus a major public health issue <xref rid="pone.0067057-Okuda1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. We have recently reported that the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in Japanese adults is 44.2%, and the most common allergen is the JC pollen <xref rid="pone.0067057-Sakashita1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although all patients with SAR are positive for allergen-specific IgE, it is well known that the presence of specific IgE alone is insufficient to develop SAR. Therefore, there is a gap in our understanding of the events that link sensitization to the development of the disease. Two different basic theories on the pathogenesis of allergy have been suggested. One is that allergy is caused by unbalanced and overactive immunological responses against allergens, mostly driven by infiltration of type 2 helper T lymphocytes (Th2), mast cells, and eosinophils into the site of allergic diseases. The other more recent hypothesis is dysregulation of the epithelial barrier, so called &#x0201c;epithelial barrier dysfunction hypothesis,&#x0201d; that is, dysfunction and disruption of the epithelial barrier has been suggested for the primary defects in allergic diseases. Disruption of the skin barrier by filaggrin null mutations has been extensively reported to be associated with the development of atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases <xref rid="pone.0067057-McAleer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067057-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Recently, Chen et al. reported that Pen c 13, a major allergen secreted by <italic>Penicillium citrinum</italic>, degraded occludin, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, and E-cadherin by nasal Pen c 13 challenge in BALB/c mice, showing increased airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammatory cell infiltration, and mucous overproduction in the lung, as well as increased total IgE and Pen c 13-specific IgE <xref rid="pone.0067057-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These data support the notion that dysfunction of epithelial barriers may lead to allergic diseases.</p><p>There have been few investigations at the molecular level of the characteristics that distinguish SAR patients from subjects who are allergen-specific IgE-positive, but remain asymptomatic. Such investigations will be essential to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which allergic diseases develop, and they could lead to the discovery of novel preventive therapeutics.</p><p>One approach to understanding the molecular basis of allergic inflammation is to identify the differences in the gene expression during natural allergen exposure of patients with varying disease status. Microarray gene expression profiling permits thousands of genes to be analyzed simultaneously. Recently, we used microarray analysis to show the upregulation of interleukin-17 receptor B (<italic>IL17RB</italic>) expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of SAR patients during natural allergen exposure <xref rid="pone.0067057-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Our study identified fewer genes that were modulated by allergen than those that had been observed in other microarray studies in which CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were stimulated in vitro, suggesting that changes in the gene expression during natural exposure to allergen in vivo may be subtle. However, it may be more informative to investigate SAR-related gene expression in nasal mucosa rather than in peripheral blood cells, because nasal mucosa is the site of the allergic inflammatory response. Indeed, a microarray analysis of nasal epithelial samples from patients with allergic patients revealed gene expression signatures that were strongly associated with exacerbated or uncontrolled asthma <xref rid="pone.0067057-GiovanniniChami1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067057-Guajardo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. A recent study using nasal epithelial cells revealed a Th2-driven epithelial phenotype in pediatric patients with house dust mite allergy <xref rid="pone.0067057-GiovanniniChami1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Although the entire nasal mucosa and underlying tissues are involved in the development of SAR, we may gain valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of allergen sensitization and SAR development by comparing gene expression profiles in nasal epithelial cells from healthy subjects, patients with SAR, and sensitized subjects who are positive for allergen-specific IgE, but have not yet developed SAR.</p><p>In the present study, we performed a microarray analysis of nasal epithelial cells from SAR patients and Control subjects, and analyzed a candidate gene for RT-PCR using samples of Controls, SAR patients, as well as Sensitized subjects to identify gene signatures that reflect the status of the SAR patient during natural allergen exposure. We observed that the expression of the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin SN (<italic>CST1</italic>) was upregulated specifically in SAR-JC patients during natural allergen exposure. Our results also showed CST1 may inhibit JC allergen-stimulated histamine release in vitro.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the ethics committees of the University of Tsukuba and the University of Fukui, Japan.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Subjects</title><p>Study participants were selected from 1575 hospital workers and university students, who participated in an epidemiological survey on allergic rhinitis between 2003 and 2007.

It is a basic glycoprotein localized in the pollen cell wall, which has pectate lyase activity <xref rid="pone.0067057-Taniguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The epitope of Cry j1 is recognized by specific IgE of Cry j1 and released histamine from basophils by interacting antigen and antigen-specific IgE. Alteration of Cry j1 structure by heat denaturation leads to reduction of IgE-binding activities <xref rid="pone.0067057-Hashimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067057-Sakaguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, histamine release from the basophils of patients induced by adding Cry j1 might be due to the degranulation via crosslinking of Cry j1-specific IgE already bound on the IgE receptor. Takai et al. reported that interaction of Der f 1, one of the major allergen of house dust mite with protease activity, and cystatin A, which belongs to cystatin superfamily, inhibited the binding of IgE in mite-allergic volunteers' sera, suggesting that cystatin A might change the binding site between antigen and antigen-specific IgE <xref rid="pone.0067057-Takai1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus, cystatin SN might affect the binding site between antigen and antigen-specific IgE, leading to the suppression of histamine release from basophils in the present study.</p><p>Cysteine proteases are widely expressed proteolytic enzymes that play roles in inflammatory tissue destruction as well as tissue remodeling <xref rid="pone.0067057-Koblinski1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The proteolytic activity of these enzymes is controlled by a family of inhibitors known as the cystatin superfamily <xref rid="pone.0067057-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and cystatins inhibit cysteine proteases by forming tight but reversible complexes with their target enzymes. Members of the type 2 cystatin subfamily are widely distributed <xref rid="pone.0067057-Henskens1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and include<italic>CST1</italic>, <italic>CST2</italic>, <italic>CST3</italic>, <italic>CST4</italic>, <italic>CST5</italic>, <italic>CSTP1</italic>,and <italic>CSTP2</italic>, which share &#x0003e;70% sequence similarity <xref rid="pone.0067057-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The <italic>CST1</italic> is expressed in the submandibular gland, gall bladder, and uterus <xref rid="pone.0067057-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. CST1 has been shown to bind tightly to the cysteine protease, papain, which is a potent allegen, and to inhibit the cysteine protease activity of papain <xref rid="pone.0067057-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Airborne allergens, such as those derived from pollen, cockroaches, fungi, and house dust mites, are proteases with the capacity to induce an inflammatory response. Previous studies have shown that the proteolytic activity of these allergens may facilitate sensitization, possibly by disrupting the balance between protease and antiprotease activities. This theory is supported by the observation that the protease allergens reduce the antiprotease activity of the mucosa <xref rid="pone.0067057-Deb1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067057-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067057-Takai2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067057-Kalsheker1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Der p 1 and Der f 1, the major allergens derived from house dust mites, are cysteine proteases that degrade &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin inhibitor in the airway <xref rid="pone.0067057-Takai2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067057-Kalsheker1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and inactivate lung surfactant proteins A and D <xref rid="pone.0067057-Deb1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Cystatin A, a member of the cysteine protease inhibitor family, has been shown to suppress induction of Der f 1-specific IgE by modifying the interaction between Der f 1 and cystatin A, which may modulate the allergic inflammation and sensitization processes <xref rid="pone.0067057-Takai1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus, the cystatin family may play protective roles against allergens with protease activity.</p><p>Measurement of allergen-specific IgE in serum is widely used to diagnose allergic diseases such as SAR and asthma; however, subjects with allergen-specific IgE do not necessarily develop the allergic disease. Although many reports have described the pathophysiological features of allergic inflammation, biomarkers or genes that predict the onset of allergic rhinitis are yet to be reported. In this study, we observed that <italic>CST1</italic> was not expressed in cells from non-sensitized subjects, and that <italic>CST1</italic> expression was significantly lower in the IgE-positive Sensitized subjects than in the SAR-JC subjects. These data suggest that <italic>CST1</italic> may be a candidate marker gene to predict allergic rhinitis. We detected that 2 subjects in the Sensitized group showed particularly high <italic>CST1</italic> expression in the nasal mucosa, and we speculate that these subjects may have been close to developing SAR symptoms.</p><p>A recent study using nasal epithelial cells from children with dust mite allergy showed that <italic>CST1</italic> was the most highly upregulated gene and that <italic>CST1</italic> was also strongly induced by stimulation with IL-4 and IL-13 <xref rid="pone.0067057-GiovanniniChami1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Therefore, <italic>CST1</italic> is likely to be upregulated in response to protease-containing allergens and the Th2 environment in the nasal mucosa. Because GSEA revealed that the genes upregulated in nasal brushing samples from mite allergic patients and the genes induced by IL-4 and IL-13 were significantly enriched in our dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0067057-t003">Table 3</xref>), our data support the notion that pathways underlying allergic rhinitis are common regardless of the allergen.</p><p>The balance between protease and antiprotease activities might thus be a key to distinguish between the sensitization stage and allergic response, and we suggest that cystatins contributes re-establishing homeostasis of the nasal mucosa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0067057.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
