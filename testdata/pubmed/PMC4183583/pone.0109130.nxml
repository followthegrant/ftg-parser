However, despite the rich information embedded in these networks, these networks face important data quality challenges of noise and incompleteness that adversely affect the results obtained from their analysis. Here, we apply a robust measure of local network structure called common neighborhood similarity (CNS) to address these challenges. Although several CNS measures have been proposed in the literature, an understanding of their relative efficacies for the analysis of interaction networks has been lacking. We follow the framework of graph transformation to convert the given interaction network into a transformed network corresponding to a variety of CNS measures evaluated.

Using a large set of human and fly protein interactions, and a set of over <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula> GO terms for both, we find that several of the transformed networks produce more accurate predictions than those obtained from the original network.

In particular, since functionally related proteins tend to be highly inter-connected in these networks, several approaches like neighborhood-based prediction <xref rid="pone.0109130-Schwikowski1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and FunctionalFlow <xref rid="pone.0109130-Nabieva1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> have been proposed for predicting the functions of unannotated proteins using this type of data <xref rid="pone.0109130-Sharan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>However, despite the rich information embedded in protein interaction networks, they face several data quality challenges that adversely affect the results obtained from their analysis. One such pervasive problem is noise in the data, which manifests itself primarily in the form of spurious or false positive interactions <xref rid="pone.0109130-vonMering1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109130-Hart1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Studies have shown that the presence of noise in these networks has significant adverse affects on the performance of several types of analyses, including protein function prediction algorithms <xref rid="pone.0109130-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Another important problem facing the use of these networks is their incompleteness, i.e., the absence of biologically valid interactions from the currently available data sets <xref rid="pone.0109130-vonMering1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109130-Hart1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109130-Hakes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This lack of completeness is mainly caused by the specific targeting of bait and prey proteins by individual studies (based on criteria such as functional annotations), which can only generate relatively small samples of the entire interactome of an organism. Not surprisingly, the incompleteness of such valuable data leads to missed biological insights that could be valuable <xref rid="pone.0109130-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109130-deSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus, noise (false positives) and incompleteness (false negatives) are major challenges facing protein interaction data that need to be addressed in order to obtain richer information from them.</p><p>Here, we apply a set of techniques that make use of the local structure of an interaction network to address these challenges. For the purpose of explaining and implementing these techniques, we represent a protein interaction network as an undirected graph, with proteins being represented by nodes and interactions by edges (For this reason, the sets of terms (&#x0201c;network&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;graph&#x0201d;), (&#x0201c;protein&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;node&#x0201d;) and (&#x0201c;interaction&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;edge&#x0201d;) will be used interchangeably in this paper.). We also assume that weights reflecting the reliability of individual interactions are assigned to the corresponding edges. Most analyses of protein interaction networks are based on this representation, and focus on the direct interactions connecting two nodes.</p><p>In addition to the direct interactions, the structure of the entire protein interaction network provides information about several other types of higher-level associations between proteins. One of the most widely studied of these associations is that based on the idea of <italic>common neighborhood</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0109130-Brun1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109130-Pandey2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, where it is hypothesized that two proteins that have several common direct neighbors (interaction partners) are likely to have a <italic>functional association</italic> between them and vice versa. Consequently, several measures for the <italic>common neighborhood similarity</italic> (CNS) of two proteins, based on different variants of the number of their common neighbors, have been proposed. Several of these similarity measures have been used for clustering the proteins in the given network into functional modules <xref rid="pone.0109130-Brun1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0109130-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and many of the resultant modules were hard to discover directly from the original network. Chua <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0109130-Chua1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> used a CNS measure named FS (Functional Similarity) to predict the functions of unannotated proteins, and their approach showed better performance than several other function prediction approaches. Pandey <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0109130-Pandey2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> adapted H-Confidence (HC), a measure of cohesiveness from association analysis in data mining <xref rid="pone.0109130-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, into a CNS measure for protein interaction networks.</p><p>Despite the demonstration of the utility of the different CNS measures in various contexts, an understanding of their relative efficacies for the analysis of protein interaction networks has been lacking due to several reasons. Firstly, as discussed above, each of these measures has been used for different applications involving different interaction data sets, thus making their relative comparison difficult. Furthermore, even in cases where these measures have been used in the context of function prediction <xref rid="pone.0109130-Chua1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109130-Pandey2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> or functional module discovery <xref rid="pone.0109130-Samanta1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109130-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, different sets of functional classes and evaluation measures are used, making this comparison harder. Our goal in this work is to close this gap by conducting an extensive comparative evaluation of the CNS measures within the uniform context of protein function prediction from both unweighted and weighted interaction networks. We follow the systematic framework of graph transformation <xref rid="pone.0109130-Pandey2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> to generate a transformed network corresponding to each of the CNS measures evaluated. The effectiveness of each measure is then estimated by comparing the quality of function predictions made from their corresponding transformed network with those from the original network. In recent work <xref rid="pone.0109130-Pandey3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, we employed this methodology for evaluating the performance of CNS measures in processing several yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) protein interaction networks. We found that CNS-based graph transformation indeed improved the quality of protein function predictions. The H-Confidence measure produced the most accurate predictions due to its ability to resist the adverse effects of noise and incompleteness in interaction data.</p><p>Proteins interaction networks of higher eukaryotes, such as human (<italic>H. sapien</italic>) and fly (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>), are much larger, and structurally and functionally more complex than the yeast network. Furthermore, a thorough understanding of these higher networks is essential for their use in studying diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. These factors motivated us to directly investigate the efficacy of CNS measures for processing higher eukaryotic interaction networks and subsequently predicting protein function from them. Using large sets of human and fly interactions from the BioGRID database <xref rid="pone.0109130-Stark1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and annotations with over <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula> GO Biological Process terms for both, we find that several of the transformed networks produce more accurate function predictions than those obtained from the original network, although some CNS networks derived from the binary version of the original network do not perform well. Among these, the HC-based CNS measure performs well, especially for the larger human protein interaction network. Our investigation suggests that the ability of the CNS measures to identify and drop noisy edges during graph transformation is an important reason for these better predictions. CNS measures are also effective at enhancing the functional coherence, i.e., the extent to which functionally related proteins are connected by an edge, leading to more accurate function prediction than the original network. Overall, these results are expected to provide a better understanding of the efficacy of CNS measures for processing protein interaction data and the utility of these measures for enhancing the functional content of these data.</p><p>Finally, before discussing our methods and results in detail, we note that several other methods have also been proposed for assessing the reliability of protein interactions using other data sources, such as microarray data and amino acid sequences <xref rid="pone.0109130-Deng1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109130-Deane1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109130-Suthram1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, since our focus is on using the information in the given interaction network itself for this task, we do not evaluate these methods in this study. These two types of approaches provide complementary information about the reliability of an interaction, and their combination is expected to provide an even more accurate estimation of these reliabilities. However, this investigation is outside the scope of this paper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this section, we discuss the interaction data set, functional annotations, CNS measures and evaluation methodology used in this study.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Interaction data and functional annotations</title><p>We obtained our interaction data sets from the BioGRID database <xref rid="pone.0109130-Stark1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> in April, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e004.jpg"/></inline-formula>.

TOM measures the strength of the association between two nodes in a graph based on the similarity of their common neighborhood to the smaller of the individual neighborhoods of the two nodes.

</p><p>The basic definition of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e086.jpg"/></inline-formula> is quite straightforward.

<xref rid="pone.0109130-Pandey2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> slightly to define the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e103.jpg"/></inline-formula> measure as: <disp-formula id="pone.0109130.e104"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e104.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>
</p><p>The change here is the addition of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e105.jpg"/></inline-formula> term in the numerator to incorporate the presence/absence of the interaction between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e106.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e107.jpg"/></inline-formula>. As per this definition, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e108.jpg"/></inline-formula> rewards cases where the set of common neighbors (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e109.jpg"/></inline-formula>) is very similar to the sets of individual neighbors of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e110.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e111.jpg"/></inline-formula>. However, due to the use of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e112.jpg"/></inline-formula> term in the numerator, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e113.jpg"/></inline-formula> penalizes the cases where the degree of at least one of the nodes is substantially higher than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e114.jpg"/></inline-formula>, thus avoiding a bias in favor of high-degree or hub nodes in the network.

</p><p>This definition of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e123.jpg"/></inline-formula> enables a more conservative estimation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e124.jpg"/></inline-formula>-based common neighborhood similarity due to the use of the sum of the product of the edge weights, both of which are at most <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e125.jpg"/></inline-formula> and thus their product is expected to be much smaller than the minimum of the two values.

Our goal is to examine how the association networks so generated compare with the original interaction networks in terms of predicting protein function from them. However, this comparison can be biased due to varying number of edges in (size of) the networks. Thus, in the first step, we create <italic>transformed</italic> versions of the networks, whose number of edges is comparable to that of the original network. For this, a threshold is chosen for each CNS measure such that the number of pairs with a score higher than this threshold is as close as possible to the number of interactions in the original network. The pairs that score higher than the threshold are structured as a network, and constitute the <italic>transformed network</italic> for the corresponding measure. Most of our analysis is based on these transformed networks. In addition, we also examine the effect of thresholding on the results obtained after transformation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Next, two different protein function prediction algorithms are run on the original as well as the transformed networks to make predictions over the corresponding selected sets of GO BP process terms/classes for human and fly. The first algorithm used was Nabieva <italic>et al.</italic>'s FunctionalFlow algorithm <xref rid="pone.0109130-Nabieva1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We also used a simple neighborhood-based algorithm inspired by Schwikowski <italic>et al.</italic>'s function prediction algorithm <xref rid="pone.0109130-Schwikowski1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Here, the likelihood score of a query protein performing certain function is simply counted as the sum of the weights of its interactions with proteins that are known to be annotated with that function, and these scores are collected for all the unannotated proteins in the data set for all the relevant functions. The predictions from both these algorithms are collected within a five-fold cross-validation setup.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The collected predictions are evaluated using the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e129.jpg"/></inline-formula> measure, which was shown to be a reliable metric in a recent large-scale protein function prediction assessment <xref rid="pone.0109130-Radivojac1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This measure is simply the maximum value of the F-measure across all the values of precision and recall at many thresholds applied to the prediction scores. To confirm the observed trends, we also evaluated the predictions using the commonly used AUC (Area under the ROC Curve) measure.</p></list-item></list><p>All the CNS measures and this evaluation methodology were implemented in Matlab (Mathworks). Where necessary, the computations were parallelized using Matlab's Distributed Computing toolbox. Also, note that our graph transformation process was based only on the CNS scores of the protein pairs. It is easy to introduce constraints, e.g. two proteins must be connected since they are in the same pathway, into this process by ensuring that they are satisfied in the transformed networks. However, since there is no single source of these constraints, and we didn't want to bias our results by choosing any particular source, we did not incorporate any such constraints into our methodology. We plan to study this feature in future work, and invite others as well to do the same.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>In this section, we discuss the results of our evaluation, and also the subsequent analyses that we carried out to explain the observed trends.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Details of transformed networks</title><p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0109130-t001">Table 1</xref> lists the details of the different transformed networks generated using the methodology described above. As can be seen, the number of interactions in these networks, as well as the number of connected proteins with at least one interaction, are almost the same as the original network, thus ensuring that the downstream analysis of these networks is not biased due to a variation in the size of the networks. The only exceptions to this observation are the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e130.jpg"/></inline-formula> networks, which contained slightly different number of edges than the original networks, although the differences were minor. A much bigger variation is observed in the number of connected proteins, i.e. proteins with at least one edge, in the transformed networks. Here, the transformed networks derived from the binary version of the original network had substantially fewer connected proteins than the original network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e131.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e132.jpg"/></inline-formula> for human and fly respectively), while those derived from the continuous version had effectively the same number of connected proteins as the original network. Although this observation itself indicates a weakness of the binary CNS measures, we eliminated its influence on the rest of the evaluation by assessing the function prediction results on only the connected proteins in each network.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0109130-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0109130.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Details of transformed networks derived from the original human and fly interaction networks using different CNS measures.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0109130-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0109130.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">Human</td><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">Fly</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CNS Measure</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"># Interactions</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"># Connected proteins</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Range of edge weights</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#Interactions</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#Connected proteins</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Range of edge weights</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

For this, using each CNS, we generated transformed networks of sizes varying from a quarter of the size of the original network to eight times the size, progressing by a factor of two in each step. Next, FunctionalFlow is run on each of these networks and the predictions evaluated as the median <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e207.jpg"/></inline-formula> score over all the classes considered. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109130-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the results of this investigation for the fly transformed networks.

These results show that the relative efficacies of the CNS measures are not dependent on the threshold used for graph transformation. Examining the individual variation of the precision and recall scores contributing to these <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e213.jpg"/></inline-formula> scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109130.s003">Figure S3</xref>), it can be observed that this order of performance is influenced more by precision than recall. Some of the measures, such as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e214.jpg"/></inline-formula>, achieve high rates of recall with smaller networks, but their precision performance remains relatively low across all the sizes considered. In contrast, measures like <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e215.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e216.jpg"/></inline-formula> achieve balanced levels of precision and recall (approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e217.jpg"/></inline-formula>&#x02013;<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e218.jpg"/></inline-formula>). Since <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e219.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the (conservative) harmonic mean of the two, the latter set of continuous CNS measures perform better overall as compared to binary CNS measures like <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e220.jpg"/></inline-formula> across all sizes/thresholds. Furthermore, across all these evaluation measures (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e221.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e222.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e223.jpg"/></inline-formula>), the performance of the measures becomes effectively stable when the size of the transformed network is the same as that of the original network (ratio of size&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e224.jpg"/></inline-formula>) and beyond. Thus, to obtain a stable relative order of performance of these measures and the reasons underlying this performance, as well as to reduce the effect of network size on the interpretation of the results, we analyze the results at this threshold.

Through a detailed analysis of the continuous CNS measures <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e227.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e228.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e229.jpg"/></inline-formula>, which performed the best in our function prediction experiments, we provide evidence in support of these hypotheses in the next two subsections.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Robustness of CNS measures to noise</title><p>One of the hypotheses underlying the use of common neighborhood similarity information is that it can be used for filtering out noisy or spurious associations in a network, since two proteins connected by a true association are more likely to have a larger number of common neighbors than two proteins connected by a spurious association. We investigated if this hypothesis holds in our study, and if it contributes to better function predictions after graph transformation. Since it is difficult to identify the noisy edges in the original network a priori, we followed a simulation-based methodology for validating this hypothesis. Under this methodology, we generated several randomly perturbed versions of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e230.jpg"/></inline-formula> network using the random rewiring model <xref rid="pone.0109130-Guelzim1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0109130-Milo1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> where two edges in the original network are chosen randomly and two new edges are created by swapping their end points. The weights of the original edges are also randomly reassigned to the new edges. Applying this model to a varying fraction of the edges in the original network (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e231.jpg"/></inline-formula>) gave us several &#x0201c;noisy&#x0201d; versions of the network, and we created transformed versions of each of these networks using the continuous and binary CNS measures used in our study.</p><p>Next, we examined how the extent of noise in the noisy networks and their transformed versions affected the performance of the FunctionalFlow algorithm, measured in terms of the median <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e232.jpg"/></inline-formula> score over all the GO BP terms considered. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109130-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows the results of this analysis for the continuous CNS measures as the noisy fraction of the (a) human and (b) fly networks ranges from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e233.jpg"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e234.jpg"/></inline-formula>. As expected, the results from all the networks, both the original and the transformed ones, become worse as the extent of noise increases, converging to a common score when the networks are completely noisy or randomized. Consistent with the order in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109130-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e235.jpg"/></inline-formula> (green line) is consistently the best at resisting the effect of noise in the original human network, and can perform better than the original network even when a vast majority of the edges in the network are noisy.

As a result, it scores the highest in terms of the overall functional coherence of its transformed network, especially for human.

Thus, the enhanced (or deteriorated) functional coherence of the CNS-transformed network, which is inherently connected to their ability to predict protein function, serves as another factor underlying the function prediction trends discussed earlier. From this point of view, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e270.jpg"/></inline-formula> is quite effective at enhancing functional coherence, and consequently produces improvements in function prediction over the original network, which are especially substantial for the human network.</p><p>We conducted a similar analysis of how functional coherence is affected during transformation using binary CNS measures, the results of which are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0109130.s005">Figure S5</xref>. These results show several contrasting trends to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109130-g005">Figure 5</xref>. First, the binary measures retain very few of the edges in the original network. Second, among the large number of edges that are dropped and added during this transformation, the latter set is substantially less functionally coherent than the former. As a result, the overall functional coherence of the networks transformed using these measures is lower than those of the continuous CNS networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109130-g005">Figure 5</xref>). However, among these binary measures, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e271.jpg"/></inline-formula> is able to attain reasonable functional coherence for both the human and fly networks. As a result, this measure is able to perform well in conjunction with the neighborhood-based function prediction algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109130-g001">Figure 1(b)</xref>), which is based on the same principle of direct connectivity between functionally related proteins. This suggests that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e272.jpg"/></inline-formula> may be a good option for networks where edge weights may not be available at all.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed in this section, that while CNS-based graph transformation is generally useful, transformation based on CNS measures that are able to utilize continuous edge weights or reliabilities in the original network are especially effective for tasks such as protein function prediction.

<xref rid="pone.0109130-Braun1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, we only explored second-degree common neighborhood-based topological features to evaluate associations between proteins. However, several other topological features, including global ones, have been studied for protein interaction networks <xref rid="pone.0109130-Winterbach1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Thus, the problem of how these features can be used within a graph transformation framework to improve analysis results should be investigated. Finally, another interesting direction would be to examine how CNS measures and other topological features perform for other types of networks that have their own characteristics, such as genetic interaction networks <xref rid="pone.0109130-Costanzo1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> that contain both positive and negative interactions, and regulatory and signaling networks <xref rid="pone.0109130-Barabasi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> that include both directed and undirected edges.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109130.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Comparison of function prediction results from the original and transformed human networks in terms of the median AUC score over all the GO BP classes considered.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0109130.s001.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109130.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Comparison of function prediction results from the original and transformed fly networks in terms of the median AUC score over all the GO BP classes considered.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0109130.s002.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109130.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>Comparison of protein function prediction results from CNS-transformed fly networks of varying sizes in terms of the (a) precision (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e277.jpg"/></inline-formula>) and (b) recall (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e278.jpg"/></inline-formula>) measure contributing to the median <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e279.jpg"/></inline-formula> score shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0109130-g003">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0109130.s003.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109130.s004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>Performance of the FunctionalFlow protein function prediction algorithm, evaluated in terms the median <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0109130.e280.jpg"/></inline-formula> score, on the original and binary CNS-transformed (a) human and (b) fly networks at different levels of noise.</p><p>(TIFF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0109130.s004.tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0109130.s005"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><p>Functional relevance of the different components, namely the common, dropped and added edges, of the binary transformed (a) human and (b) fly networks.
