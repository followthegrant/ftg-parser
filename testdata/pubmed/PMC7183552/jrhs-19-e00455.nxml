The implementation of primary health care needs a comprehensive and effective health care system<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Iran&#x02019;s health system has organized at three levels: nation, province and district. At the district level, one of the sub-units of district Health Network is the City Health Center (CHC), which is the last decision-making authority in the field of management services related to the headquarter units and allocation of resources<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Improving healthcare performance is a prominent universal program and represents a significant part of improving public health across the world<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. One of the most significant features seems to be related to effectiveness, success and performance of health managers in the health organizations is the Emotional intelligence (EI). EI can affect the improving logical actions, such as judgment, decision-making and priority setting, which are important issues in the success and improving performance of manager<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. EI includes a set of abilities, talents and non-cognitive skills that improve individual capability to successfully manage environmental demands and requirements<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>
Human relations, perceiving and feeling of others, self-control, control of the momentary demands, kindness to others, and apply the emotions in thinking and understanding, are subjects of emotional intelligence<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. There is an overall agreement that EI plays an important role in work settings to regulate and strengthen emotions, attitudes and behaviors among employees and managers<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p>
Emotional intelligence is a skill to identify the meaning of emotions and relationship between them and the ability to monitor their own feelings and others<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Goleman introduced the concept of EI, which includes managing with stress, demands and forces created by organizational changes<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Emotional Intelligence define as a kind of social intelligence, which contains the skill to perceive self and others emotions, differentiate between them and handle information to lead other`s behavior<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. However, this is not a unified concept; it has two main forms: EI as theoretical concept at work environment or as a form of intelligence or personality trait<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>
Goleman, therefore, emphasizes the importance of EI in the workplace and believes that not only managers, but also everyone who workings in the organization requires EI <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Job performance refers to "the value and quantity of activities completed by an individual or group at the workplace. The behavior of employees at work should help the organization's purpose <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, performance must be defined as the job outcomes, since it has a strong relationship with organization strategic objectives, client satisfaction and economic results<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p>
Since the health system in each country plays an effective role in the development of the country<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and health organizations without experienced managers cannot be effective and efficient,&#x000a0;therefore investing in empowering managers and promoting their communication skills and emotional intelligence leads to provide more effective and efficient health services in the community.</p><p>
Given the importance of primary health care, the effect of emotional intelligence on job performance of CHC&#x02019;s managers has been examined in this study. The main question was how much emotional intelligence effect on job performance of CHC&#x02019;s managers and which components of emotional intelligence was the best predictor of performance?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>
This was a correlational and analytical study conducted in 2016. The research community was the technical health managers of the nine CHCs covered by Hamadan University of Medical Sciences in west of Iran. In this research, no sampling was performed and all participants were selected by census. These include all health managers working in the headquarters of district health networks and CHC of the nine cities covered by Health Center of Hamadan Province. All 108 managers were selected.</p><p>
We used the Siberia Shering Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> to collect data. The Shering emotional intelligence questionnaire consists of 33 questions that evaluate five components of emotional intelligence. These components are self-awareness, self-control, self- motivation, empathy or social consciousness and social skills that respectively include 8, 7, 7, 6 and 5 questions. Each respondent received six separate grades, 5 of related to each dimensions, and one is overall score. Responses are graded according to Likert scale, ranging from 1 to 5. In a study on librarianship and information professionals and psychologists, the validity of the Shering questionnaire has confirmed. Moreover, the reliability of the questionnaire was 0.92, using Cronbach's alpha <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The level of emotional intelligence and its dimensions has measured through questionnaires answered by the participants themselves. The maximum score of Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire was 165 and the minimum score was 33. If the emotional intelligence&#x02019; total score and the score of the dimensions was below 50% of the maximum score was considered poor, between (50.1%) to (75%) intermediate, and above 75% was considered favorable.</p><p>
Due to the busy work of the managers, researchers referred to the CHC on the day specified by the managers on phone call. After giving the necessary clarifications and responding to the questions of the contributors about the purpose of the study and how to use the results, participants&#x02019; written consent received. Then the questionnaire was completed by the contributors, in the presence of the researcher to response the likely questions of the participants.</p><p>
The performance of the technical health managers of the CHCs is assessing twice a year (every six months) by the health center of province. To determine the level of job performance, the score of managers' performance has used. In this study, the criteria to determine the managers&#x02019; job performance were the results of second six months of 2016. The performance scores were judged according to the classification of the province&#x02019; health center, which divided the performance into three; poor, intermediate and desirable levels. To collect performance' data, the researchers, with prior coordination, went to the province' health center, and a pre-designed form, for collecting performance data of all CHCs' managers, was completed by the relevant technical units of province health center.</p><p>
Inclusion and exclusion criteria included employment as the current unit manager for at least six last months and the ability and willingness to participate in the study.</p><p>
Data were analyzed using SPSS ver.16 software (Chicago, IL, USA). In addition to using frequency distribution tables, Pearson correlation test was used to determine the relationship between emotional intelligence dimensions and performance of managers. Structure equation model (ESM) has used to make latent variable (e.g., emotional intelligence and its subscales) by statistical software AMOS 23. Linear regression model was used to model job performance (i.e., dependent variable) and five subscales of emotional intelligence (i.e., independent variables).</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethical considerations" id="s3"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>
Ethical permission was obtained from Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. A formal letter of cooperation was written to the Management Health Centers. Participants were informed about the purpose, advantage, the confidentiality of the information, and the voluntary nature of participation. The data were collected upon receipt of written consent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s4"><title>Results</title><p>

Finally, linear regression between performance and total scores of emotional intelligence (i.e., a linear combination on five dimensions of emotional intelligence) shows that per an increment in the emotional intelligence score of managers, 0.718 units will be added to the performance score (log performance) = -0.652+0.321 (emotional intelligence), <italic>P</italic>=0.012).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>
Totally, 108 questionnaires were distributed of which 98 questionnaires were completed and returned (91%). There is a significant correlation among self-awareness, self-control, self-motivation and sympathy dimensions of emotional intelligence with health manager`s performance. Moreover, the results of present study revealed that there is significant relationship between emotional intelligence overall score and health manager`s performance, that means by improving emotional intelligence in terms of these dimensions, the performance of managers improves. In fact, knowing and understanding emotions and recognizing its contribution to organizations and individuals can effective in decision-making and appropriate more rational behaviors of managers and improve performance.</p><p>
While there was an important correlation between intrapersonal dimension (sympathy and social skills) of emotional intelligence and job performance, there was no relationship with other subscales<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. There was significant relationship between the self-awareness, self-control and self-motivation and job performance. Moreover, the results of this study indicated that the relationship between Empathy and social skills and job performance was not confirmed<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. On the other hand, emotional intelligence dimensions empathy, self-motivation and social skills had positively correlated with the performance of managers, but self-control and self-awareness components did not have a significant relationship with the performance of managers<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, emotional intelligence and its all dimensions had a positive and significant effect on the performance of the staff. Any increase in each dimension increases the performance of the staff <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, this result was approved by Fujino et al study<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>
In fact, knowing and understanding own&#x02019; emotions and identifying its effect on organizations and individuals can affect decision-making and proper and more logical behaviors of managers and develops their job performance. Since this result was not confirmed with some studies <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, the impact of this dimension on performance needed to more examination in upcoming studies.</p><p>
Regression between performance and emotional intelligence total scores (i.e., a linear combination on five dimensions of emotional intelligence) showed that an increase in the EI score, 0.718 units will be added to the performance score. This means that by improving EI, the performance of managers improves. This result is confirmed by many studies <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Furthermore, this hypothesis has been confirmed by the meta-analysis study<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. In another study, this result was not approved<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p><p>
Successful health managers use the abilities of emotional intelligence very harmoniously, which we have recognized them as the key to high executive performance of a manager. Managers, who have high EI, have special skills in executing their jobs, show better performance and can make positive attitudes and intuition between their personnel <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p>
Health managers by understanding emotions of others, expressing positive and empathic feelings and as well as adjust their emotions and control them would create more effective relations with others and, therefore, better acceptance and as a result, will be able to have better interpersonal relations (one of the elements in evaluating job performance). This positive control has excessive and favorable impression on the others evaluation<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Above hypothesis was not confirmed by some study <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, where, higher emotional intelligence did not lead to better performance of managers necessarily.</p><p>
Multiple linear regression analysis (stepwise method) showed that all aspects of emotional intelligence (except social skills) have a significant effect on the performance of participants. Self-awareness and self-control have been the strongest and weakest components to predict participants&#x02019; job performance scores. In a study, between all dimensions of emotional intelligence, self-motivation had the highest correlation with the managers&#x02019; performance <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Training and developing managerial skills especially human and social skills in administrators and managers of CHCs can decrease job stress and enhance effective performance<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Social skills and self-motivation were the strongest and weakest dimensions to predict the performance scores respectively <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>
The most important result of this research is to reveal positive correlation between emotional intelligence and its sub-scales with health managers' job performance. In fact increase in the emotional intelligence score of managers, 0.718 units will be added to the performance score. These results reveal the weakness and strengths of technical health managers of CHC in the field of emotional intelligence. Moreover, this study could be an introduction to more comprehensive research with different samples in various departments of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. The results of such studies could be the basis for health managers&#x02019; strengthening programs. In addition, using these results the positive points and weaknesses of monitoring and evaluation systems in CHC can be known and improved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="acknowledgements" id="s7"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>
