Previous studies demonstrated that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) regulates Nox1 expression and ROS generation in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the role of PDI in conductance and resistance arteries during hypertension development remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate PDI expression and NADPH oxidase dependent ROS generation during hypertension development. Mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) and thoracic aorta were isolated from 6, 8, and 12 week-old spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar rats. ROS production (dihydroethidium fluorescence), PDI (WB, imunofluorescence), Nox1 and NOX4 (RT-PCR) expression were evaluated. Results show a progressive increase in ROS generation in MRA and aorta from 8 to 12 week-old SHR. This effect was associated with a concomitant increase in PDI and Nox1 expression only in MRA. Therefore, suggesting a positive correlation between PDI and Nox1 expression during the development of hypertension in MRA. In order to investigate if this effect was due to an increase in arterial blood pressure, pre hypertensive SHR were treated with losartan (20 mg/kg/day for 30 days), an AT1 receptor antagonist. Losartan decreased blood pressure and ROS generation in both vascular beds. However, only in SHR MRA losartan treatment lowered PDI and Nox1 expression to control levels. In MRA PDI inhibition (bacitracin, 0.5 mM) decreased Ang II redox signaling (p-ERK 1/2). Altogether, our results suggest that PDI plays a role in triggering oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in resistance but not in conductance arteries, increasing Nox1 expression and activity. Therefore, PDI could be a new player in oxidative stress and functional alterations in resistance arteries during the establishment of hypertension.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>protein disulfide isomerase</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>NADPH oxidase</kwd><kwd>Nox1</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>mesenteric resistance arteries</kwd><kwd>aorta</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="6886"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among the factors involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension evidence indicates an important role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Pechanova et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Several studies associate hypertension with high concentrations of ROS in animal models (Heitzer et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Kitamoto et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Beswick et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and in humans (Lacy et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Lee et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Indeed, the increase in ROS in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) may contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary artery disease (Shah and Channon, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), kidney damage (Adler et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), endothelial dysfunction (Rodrigues et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and remodeling of pulmonary arteries (Demarco et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>An important source of ROS in the cardiovascular system is the NADPH oxidase family of enzymes. These enzymes generate superoxide, that can reduce the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) as well as serve as a precursor for other species such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (Rey et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The NADPH oxidase comprises a family of enzymes known as Nox that catalyze the reduction of molecular oxygen generating superoxide. Although all Nox isoforms are transmembrane proteins capable of generating ROS, they differ in distribution and cellular localization, association with regulatory subunits, ROS generated and activation mechanisms. These differences are responsible for the different functions of Nox and confer specificity to the action of ROS as second messengers, making the generation of these species a controlled and compartmentalized event. Unlike phagocytic NADPH oxidase, vascular NADPH oxidase can be regulated by gene transcription of its subunits. Thus, NADPH oxidase activity can be regulated through assembly of the regulatory subunits to the membrane or by increased expression of the enzyme (Brandes and Schroder, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>In the cardiovascular system Noxes can regulate vascular function proliferation, migration and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) as well as cell differentiation and angiogenesis (Cave et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Garrido and Griendling, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Some aspects differ between Nox1 and Nox4 isoforms. Nox 4 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus (Ambasta et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and generates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Takac et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) constitutively and independent of cytosolic subunits (Ellmark et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). On the other hand, in VSMC Nox1 is located in caveolae (Hilenski et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), plasma membrane and endosomes (Miller et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and generates O<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sub>2</sub>. The generation of ROS by Nox1 can be stimulated by Ang II. Initially, the binding of Ang II to the AT1 receptor activates protein kinase C which phosphorylates p47phox. This initial phase of ROS generation is rapid and occurs within seconds after Ang II stimulation. Maintenance of Nox1 activation requires transactivation of EGFR and activation of ERK1/2 which leads to an increase in Nox1 expression and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (Stanic et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In fact, several studies have shown that expression of Nox1 is increased in injured arteries of Wistar rats (Szocs et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), of diabetic rats (Wendt et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and in SHR (Matsuno et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Tabet et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Furthemore, mice with deficiency of Nox-1 show a decrease in blood pressure (Gavazzi et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>Studies from our group identified PDI as a protein which associates with NADPH oxidase subunits regulating Ang II dependent ROS generation in VSMC. Moreover, this association was also demonstrated in leukocytes (Santos et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Paes et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and endothelial cells (Laurindo et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, Nox1 is associated with an increased generation of ROS in Ang II infusion hypertension models (Dikalova et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Taken together, these studies indicate a close association between the expression of PDI and the expression and activity of vascular NADPH oxidases. Therefore, understanding the role of PDI in the activation of vascular NADPH oxidases in diseases such as hypertension may provide a new approach for the development of new forms of therapeutic intervention in the treatment of this disease. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine PDI expression and NADPH oxidase dependent ROS generation and signaling in conductance and resistance arteries during hypertension development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals and tissue preparation</title><p>All procedures carried out were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences (ICB) at University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) in accordance with the guidelines from the Brazilian College for Animal Experimentation (COBEA) under Federal Law 11794.

A separate group of animals received vehicle (water) and was used as control. Untreated or treated age- and weight-matched SHR or Wistar rats were decapitated and thoracic aorta and mesenteric arteries were removed. Afterwards, arteries were washed with ice-cold PBS, and maintained at 4&#x000b0;C in Krebs-Henseleit (KHS) solution (112.0 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.1 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25.0 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 11.1 mM glucose).

In the presence of superoxide and other reactive species, DHE is oxidized to 2-Hydroxyethidium and ethidium, which are trapped by intercalation with DNA resulting in bright red fluorescence (excitation: 480; emission: 580 nm). Thoracic aorta and mesenteric arteries of SHR and Wistar rats were embedded in Tissue Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA). Unfixed frozen cross sections (5 &#x003bc;m) were incubated with DHE (5 &#x003bc;mol/L; Molecular Probes) diluted in phosphate buffer with DTPA (100 &#x003bc;mol/L); in a light-protected and humidified chamber at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min. A group of artery slices were treated with PEG-SOD (150 U/mL) for 30 min before incubation with DHE. Fluorescence was detected with a 490&#x02013;590 nm long-pass filter, under a microscope (Axiovert, Zeiss) with a 20&#x000d7; objective lens coupled to a digital camera. Fluorescent images were recorded with exposure intensity adjusted relatively to 6 weeks Wistar rats.

The specificity of the SYBR&#x000ae; green assay was confirmed by melting-point analysis. Relative expressions of targeted genes were calculated from the cycle threshold (Ct) value using the &#x00394;Ct method for quantification.

In particular in VSMCs, PDI associates with NADPH oxidase subunits (Janiszewski et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) regulates basal NADPH oxidase activity and Ang II-induced activity (Fernandes et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and is involved in PDGF-induced Nox1-dependent migration (Pescatore et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, involvement of PDI in hypertension vascular dysfunction associated with increased NADPH oxidase activity has not been investigated. In this study we show for the first time that PDI expression increases during hypertension development in resistance but not in conductance arteries. Furthermore, we observed that the increase in PDI is accompanied by an increase in Nox1, but not Nox4, expression and that PDI plays a role in Ang II-induced redox signaling in hypertension.</p><p>Hypertension is widely known to be associated with high levels of ROS and an increase in Nox1 activity and expression. Nox1 transgenic mice show augmented ROS levels and increased pressor and hypertrophic responses to Ang-II. Therefore, Nox1-derived ROS could contribute to increased wall thickness in hypertension development (Dikalova et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In the present study we used spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), a model of genetic hypertension. Our data confirms previous studies showing an increase in blood pressure (BP) from 6 to 12 weeks of age (Nabha et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In addition, it has been shown that SHR exhibit high levels of ROS in the kidney only a few weeks after birth, before the rise in blood pressure or in inflammatory markers, which is suggestive that ROS enhancement precedes the increment in blood pressure (Chabrashvili et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). However, in the vasculature there is still some controversy. We investigated ROS generation, PDI and Nox expression in resistance (mesenteric arteries) and conductance arteries (aorta) in normotensive (6 week-old), pre-hypertensive (8 week-old) and hypertensive (12 week-old) SHR. We show here that ROS generation increases in mesenteric arteries concomitantly with the increase in blood pressure or else, after 8 weeks. In contrast, in aorta increased ROS generation is already present in 6 week-old SHR, despite normal blood pressure. Therefore our results confirm previous studies (Nabha et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) which show that at least in the aorta increase in ROS generation precedes the increase in blood pressure. Furthermore, we show that Nox isoform expression differed in resistance and conductance arteries during the establishment of hypertension. Nox1 was the source of ROS in resistance arteries and Nox4 in conductance ones. Additionally, our data demonstrate that only in mesenteric resistance arteries ROS generation seems to be Nox1 dependent. In fact, high expression of Nox1, and Nox4 was reported in VSMC isolated from mesenteric arteries of 12 week-old SHR but in accordance to our findings, only siNox1 inhibited ROS production in these cells (Briones and Touyz, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In aorta, some authors show high levels of Nox1, 2, and 4 (Akasaki et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), while others show higher expression of Nox1 and 2, but not Nox4 (Wind et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the age of these rats was either not informed or older than the ones used here.</p><p>Interestingly, PDI expression only increased in mesenteric arteries, and concomitantly to Nox1 expression, despite previous data from our group which showed that PDI associates with both Nox1 and Nox4 (Janiszewski et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In fact, evidence of a closer relationship between Nox1 and PDI in VSMCs, was demonstrated recently. Overexpression of PDI in aortic VSMCs resulted in an increase in Nox1 expression, while silencing of PDI decreased Nox1 expression. In contrast, neither PDI overexpression nor silencing altered Nox4 expression in these cells (Fernandes et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Furthermore, PDI also regulates Ang II and PDGF induced effects on Nox1 expression, while no effect was observed in Nox 4 (Fernandes et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Pescatore et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The present data corroborates these studies and provides a potential role for PDI in Nox1 derived ROS generation in hypertension. Therefore, although, the exact mechanisms regarding PDI-NADPH oxidase interaction remains to be elucidated, the present study is the first to provide evidence for the role of PDI in Nox1 signaling in hypertension.</p><p>Our data also show differential eNOS expression in aorta during development of hypertension. Particularly, we show an increase of eNOS in aorta in the early stages of the disease. Corroborating these data previous studies have shown that 3 week old SHR present an enhancement of aorta and kidney protein expression of eNOS and NO generation, suggesting that NO-pathway is upregulated in SHR before the onset of hypertension (Vaziri et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). On the other hand, the present data demonstrated a reduction of eNOS expression in aorta of 12 week old SHR. In this context, the literature shows contradictory results of eNOS expression in aorta of SHR after established hypertension. Indeed this expression has been shown to be enhanced (Vaziri et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) or reduced (Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Xu and Liu, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Also, eNOS activation is decreased (Filho et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and ROS production in aorta of SHR was associated with eNOS uncoupling (Li et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Taken together, the increase in Nox1 and Nox4 and the reduction of eNOS expression in 12 week old arteries from SHR could be associated with the maintenance of hypertension.</p><p>Ang II signaling through Nox derived ROS can activate MAP kinases, tyrosine kinases, transcription factors and modulate intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i), participating in processes like growth, migration, deposition of extracellular matrix and inflammation (Knock and Ward, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In order to investigate the effect of Ang II on PDI expression, pre hypertensive, 7 week-old SHR were treated with AT1 receptor antagonist. Treatment with losartan decreased blood pressure and ROS generation in both mesenteric resistance arteries and aorta. However, only in SHR mesenteric arteries losartan treatment lowered PDI and Nox1 expression to control levels. It is known that antagonism of AT1 receptor can lower ROS generation and expression of several NADPH oxidase subunits in SHR (Zalba et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Akasaki et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), however this is the first report that Ang II increases PDI expression during the development of hypertension.</p><p>To further investigate the mechanisms involved in this effect, mesenteric resistance arteries from Wistar and SHR were isolated and stimulated with Ang II in the presence of PDI non specific inhibitor bacitracin. PDI inhibition resulted in a reduction in Ang II induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in both strains. It has been shown that in VSMCs from mesenteric arteries of SHR, the increase in ROS generation is involved in the increase of EGFR transactivation and as a consequence, in increased ERK 1/2 phosphorylation induced by Ang II (Li et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown that PDI silencing decreases Ang II redox signaling in aortic VSMCs (Janiszewski et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and TNF-&#x003b1; signaling in endothelial cells (Camargo Lde et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Altogether our results suggest a role for PDI in Ang II increased signaling in resistance vessels from SHR rats.</p><p>One interesting finding of this study is that SHR mesenteric arteries presented higher expression of PDI. It has been reported that increase in one subunit is accompanied by increase in other subunits of NADPH oxidase (Fukui et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Dikalova et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). We have previously shown that PDI colocalizes with NADPH subunits (Janiszewski et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and the increased expression of this protein in SHR reinforces the role of PDI as a regulatory protein of the oxidase complex. Moreover, Fernandes et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) demonstrated that overexpression of PDI in rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells resulted in preemptive activation of NADPH oxidase with enhanced production of ROS. Therefore, in the present study increased PDI expression in resistance mesenteric arteries could account for increased Nox1 expression and activity, and consequently higher ROS generation and Ang II responses in these vessels.</p><p>Altogether our results show that PDI expression increases concomitantly to Nox1 in resistance arteries during hypertension development and that this effect is dependent on Ang II signaling through the AT1 receptor. Therefore, PDI could be a novel regulator of Nox1 signaling in resistance arteries contributing to oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in hypertension.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the Rosangela Eichler for helping with the RT-PCR analysis.
