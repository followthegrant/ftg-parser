Even as Colombia is currently implementing a spectrum of legal, social, economic, and health programs for &#x0201c;victims of armed conflict,&#x0201d; with particular focus on internally displaced persons (IDPs), the dynamics of forced migration on a mass scale within this country are little known beyond national borders.

The authors of this commentary are embarking on a global mental health research program in Bogota, Colombia to define best practices for reaching the displaced population and implementing sustainable, evidence-based screening and intervention for common mental disorders. Presenting the defining characteristics of internal displacement in Colombia provides the context for our work and, more importantly, conveys the compelling and complex nature of this humanitarian crisis. We attempt to demonstrate Colombia&#x02019;s unique position within the global patterning of internal displacement.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>internal displacement</kwd><kwd>internally displaced persons</kwd><kwd>victims of armed conflict</kwd><kwd>humanitarian crisis</kwd><kwd>complex emergency</kwd><kwd>forced displacement</kwd><kwd>forced migration</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction: Internal Displacement Globally and in Colombia</title><sec><title>Global internal displacement</title><p>Worldwide, in 2012, a total of 28.8 million persons were displaced from their homes due to generalized violence and human rights violations, while remaining within the borders of their countries of origin, the highest figure ever recorded.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Based on the United Nations report, <italic>Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement</italic>, the international humanitarian aid community uses the following consensus definition for internally displaced persons (IDPs):<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>&#x0201c;Internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.&#x0201d;</p><p>Therefore, IDPs are different from &#x0201c;refugees,&#x0201d; persons who seek refuge by fleeing from their home countries and crossing an international frontier to reside, albeit under austere conditions, in another nation.

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva, Switzerland, together with the Norwegian Refugee Council, monitors both types of displaced populations simultaneously &#x02013; and separately.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>According to the IDMC,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> &#x0201c;In 2012, an estimated 32.4 million people in 82 countries were newly displaced by disasters; 144 million over five years.&#x0201d; Clearly, the number of disaster-displaced persons is dauntingly large. As a recent example, three million persons were abruptly and acutely displaced when Super Typhoon Haiyan pummeled the Philippines in November 2013.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>Conflict-displaced and disaster-displaced populations differ fundamentally in terms of the events that precipitate displacement. While natural disasters are non-intentional &#x0201c;acts of nature,&#x0201d; armed conflict involves intentional, human malevolence and harm. Conflict-induced displacement is a human-perpetrated act.</p><p>Massive internal displacement due to violence, extortion, and human rights violations can be described within a disaster classification scheme as an <bold>intentional anthropogenic (human-generated), armed-conflict disaster that escalates to a protracted complex emergency/humanitarian crisis</bold>.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>Most disaster-displaced persons are able to return to their homes within days or months to repair or rebuild once the natural disaster threat subsides. However, conflict-displaced persons usually cannot return home because their communities of origin are controlled, and typically occupied, by the armed actors who forced their expulsion. Disaster-displaced persons temporarily vacate their homes due to pre-impact disaster threat, or hazardous conditions during impact, or post-disaster devastation. However, unlike conflict-displaced persons, these individuals and families have not been dispossessed of their property and driven from their communities; they can return when the physical hazards subside.</p><p>Duration of displacement is another point of divergence. Disaster-related displacement tends to be transient and time-limited. In contrast to the relative brevity of disaster displacement, for more than 90% of nations where IDMC maintains surveillance of conflict-displaced IDPs, the agency describes the situation as &#x0201c;protracted.&#x0201d;<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p>As an on-point case example, Colombia has recently experienced both types of displacement simultaneously. In 2010, extending into 2011, deluging rains caused extensive river and &#x0201c;overland&#x0201d; flooding and triggered mudslides for a period of more than eight months.

No longer flood-displaced, they resumed their precarious status as conflict-displaced IDPs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Defining Features of Conflict-Associated Internal Displacement in Colombia</title><p>What dynamics are operating to make the Colombian IDP situation special and distinct from internal displacement elsewhere in the world?

Yet, as the map clearly displays, far away from these major concentrations of IDPs, and geographically separated by vast oceans, the entire Western Hemisphere is devoid of IDP populations except for the nations of Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. On closer inspection, among these three, Colombia alone has appreciable numbers. In fact, Colombian IDPs account for 95% of the Western Hemisphere&#x02019;s total of six million.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><p><bold>Figure&#x000a0;2.</bold> World map of internal displacement, 2012.</p></caption><graphic id="F0002" xlink:href="kdsh-02-01-10927885-g002"/></fig><p>Furthermore, with an estimated national population of 45.7 million citizens in July, 2013,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> one-in-eight Colombian citizens is displaced.

Children are born into displacement and it is likely they will remain IDPs lifelong. So far, no effective remedies have been found to allow IDPs to safely return to their communities of origin and reclaim their property. As a consequence, year over year, the Colombian tally of IDPs grows larger. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref> displays this trend clearly; IDP numbers achieve a new peak each year.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><fig id="F3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><p><bold>Figure&#x000a0;3.</bold> Trends in annual total numbers of IDPs and rate of increase in IDPs, 1998&#x02013;2012.</p></caption><graphic id="F0003" xlink:href="kdsh-02-01-10927885-g003"/></fig></sec><sec><title>4) Colombian internal displacement is protracted in time</title><p>Internal displacement in Colombia has continued unabated for decades.

Only occasionally, and briefly, has crisis displacement caused another nation to surpass Colombia&#x02019;s tally of IDPs. This happened, for example, in 2009 when the Darfur conflict moved Sudan slightly ahead of Colombia in total numbers of IDPs, but only for that year (IDMC 2010).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>6) Internal displacement in Colombia: One of the most compelling stories no one knows</title><p>Despite Colombia&#x02019;s exceptional status numerically, the narrative of forced displacement in Colombia is neither widely publicized nor broadly disseminated throughout the international community.

In Colombia, internal displacement has been a long-term reality rather than a breaking news story.</p><p>Raging war is a magnet for media. Concentrated news coverage has been devoted in recent years to IDPs and refugees in the Middle East (Syria, Iraq, Turkey) and equatorial Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia). Each of these regions represents about 20&#x02013;25% of IDPs worldwide.

Although the far-ranging Eastern Plains (Llanos Orientales) and the fertile coffee-growing regions are optimal for cultivation of crops, both licit and illicit, there are other areas unsuitable for agriculture but desirable for other purposes. For example, the spectacular Colombian Andes are trisected into three towering ranges (cordilleras), separated by the two deeply channeled river valleys of the Rio Magdalena and the Rio Cauca. Rugged, impassable mountain terrain, interspersed with lush, impenetrable valleys, provides cover for armed groups. Guerrilla forces divide their personnel into small units, allowing them to move nimbly and escape detection as they traverse secluded habitats that they know well and control. Armed groups have displaced residents from villages along the Andes ranges and the intervening river valleys. Additional displacements have occurred in the northern departments (states) bordering the Atlantic Ocean and the western departments along the Pacific Ocean.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>IDPs as victims of armed conflict</title><sec><title>11) In Colombia, those who are displaced have no defining identity, nor unifying organization, nor historical enemies</title><p>Internal displacement in Colombia might be regarded as an &#x0201c;enemy-less&#x0201d; enterprise. Diverging from the situations found in other countries with large populations of IDPs, those who are displaced in Colombia are not enemies of the State, nor militants engaged as parties to armed conflict, nor distinctive groups singled out for ethnic cleansing or genocidal actions. Colombia&#x02019;s IDPs are primarily a diffuse and unorganized amalgam of rural peasant landholders (&#x0201c;campesinos&#x0201d;) and indigenous or Afro-Colombian peoples whose territories are appropriated to benefit various armed actors, narco-traffickers, and criminal bands.</p><p>Displacement is about acquisition of land, not about vanquishing a foe. No armed group has declared war against the Colombian campesino. Campesinos have no defining identity, no unifying organization, and no historical enemies. As rural peasants, the landholding campesinos possess very modest acreages of a valuable and desired commodity &#x02013; their lands. With large expanses of Colombia beyond the reach of governmental protection, campesinos have been vulnerable for generations to seizure of their lands by the numerous means described, with the most common theme being forced dispossession of land through actual or threatened harm and extortion.</p><p>In Colombia, population displacement is a means, not a goal. The ever-expanding population of Colombian IDPs results from the &#x0201c;territorial imperative&#x0201d; of the armed insurgency and allied narco-trafficking operations rather than from any intentional military campaign to inflict harm. The existence of Colombian&#x02019;s large population of IDPs may be viewed as &#x0201c;collateral damage&#x0201d; in someone else&#x02019;s conflict. &#x0201c;Collateral displacement&#x0201d; might be a better term.</p></sec><sec><title>12) Special populations are disproportionately represented among IDPs</title><p>Colombian IDP populations depart markedly from national population demographics in terms of high proportions of women, children, and ethnic minorities.

Once resettled, IDPs may not register their status as displaced persons despite the access to services that that such a declaration will bring. There are three principal reasons for keeping their IDP status hidden: 1) IDPs may possess sensitive and potentially incriminating information regarding the activities of subversive groups in their communities of eviction and therefore their migration may be monitored by those who do not want this information divulged; 2) in some communities, IDPs are wrongly viewed as having affiliation with the very armed groups that caused their displacement; and 3) IDP leaders who have actively sought redress for property losses and restoration of rights, and some persons who have actively advocated on behalf of IDPs, have been threatened or killed.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> These threats and assassinations perpetuate the terror for IDPs who are already victims.

These stressors elevate risks for psychopathology, including diagnoses of such common mental disorders major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety as well as somatic complaints and increased consumption of alcohol, prescription medications and illicit drugs.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that half of IDPs exhibit mental health problems, yet mental health needs are largely unmet and only rarely addressed with evidence-based interventions.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref></p><p>Displacement is not characterized as a focal traumatic event. Rather displacement entails a succession of exposures to trauma and loss. Many IDPs have experienced a period of repeated threats in their home village culminating in an event so disturbing or life-threatening as to trigger displacement (e.g., massacre). This is followed by a migratory journey in search of safer habitation and a transition period of multiple temporary resettlements. Thereafter IDPs experience a prolonged life struggle of survival in often-hostile urban environments living &#x0201c;permanently&#x0201d; displaced. Throughout this trajectory, IDPs experience extreme adversities that elevate their risks for physical and mental disorders.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref></p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Concluding Comments</title><p>Taken together these 15 characteristics of internal displacement in Colombia present a case example without parallel elsewhere in the world. Colombia&#x02019;s IDP population, the largest in the world, is geographically remote from all other centers of conflict-induced displacement. IDP tallies accrue due to the unidirectional nature of displacement that occurs continuously over decades. Expulsion of landholding peasants &#x02013; particularly women and children - and indigenous/Afro-Colombian peoples from their rural homelands is perpetrated by multiple armed actors (guerrilla, paramilitary, narco-traffickers, criminal bands) intent upon expanding their land holdings to gain power and strategic advantage for their illicit operations, including drug and arms trafficking. Once displaced, Colombian IDPs are unable to find safe refuge and they must adjust to the hardships of marginal urban existence while living in environments of danger, health threat, and exposure to violence. The tortuous journey from expulsion through all phases of relocation and resettlement involves significant loss and trauma with attendant high risks for developing debilitating psychological disorders.</p><p>Given these dynamics, the extremity of life as a Colombian IDP is a challenging humanitarian crisis that needs to be broadcast to an international audience. Fortunately, the plight of IDPs is fully acknowledged within Colombia and, as an outcome of the recently-passed Law of the Victims, a broad spectrum of programs is currently being implemented with potential for improving the health, economic, and social well-being of IDPs nationwide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig.&#x000a0;10</xref>).</p><fig id="F10" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><p><bold>Figure&#x000a0;10.</bold> Primary care clinic serving internally displaced persons, Santa Fe, Bogota, Colombia.</p></caption><graphic id="F0010" xlink:href="kdsh-02-01-10927885-g010"/></fig></sec></body><back><sec><title>Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest</title><p>No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="web">Albuja S, Arnaud E, Beytrison F, Caterina M, Charron G, Fruehauf U, Glatz AK, Halff K, Howard C, Kok F, et al. <italic>Global Overview 2012: People internally displaced by conflict and violence.</italic> Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre and Norwegian Refugee Council, Geneva Switzerland, 2013.
