The injury-induced suppression of the pineal gland hormone, melatonin, which is triggered by darkness, allows the mounting of innate immune responses. We have previously shown that cultured pineal glands, which express toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), produce TNF when challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here our aim was to evaluate which cells present in the pineal gland, astrocytes, microglia or pinealocytes produced TNF, in order to understand the interaction between pineal activity, melatonin production and immune function. Cultured pineal glands or pinealocytes were stimulated with LPS. TNF content was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. TLR4 and TNFR1 expression were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Microglial morphology was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In the present study, we show that although the main cell types of the pineal gland (pinealocytes, astrocytes and microglia) express TLR4, the production of TNF induced by LPS is mediated by microglia. This effect is due to activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. In addition, we observed that LPS activates microglia and modulates the expression of TNFR1 in pinealocytes. As TNF has been shown to amplify and prolong inflammatory responses, its production by pineal microglia suggests a glia-pinealocyte network that regulates melatonin output. The current study demonstrates the molecular and cellular basis for understanding how melatonin synthesis is regulated during an innate immune response, thus our results reinforce the role of the pineal gland as sensor of immune status.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The pineal gland, a circumventricular organ, plays an integrative role in the neuro-endocrine-immune response <xref rid="pone.0040142-Markus1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040142-Venegas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In mammals, the major cellular component of the pineal gland is the pinealocyte. In rats, this cell type comprises around 90&#x00025; of the gland and the remainder consists mainly of glial cells and nerve fibers <xref rid="pone.0040142-Mller1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The pinealocytes are responsible for synthesizing melatonin, the darkness hormone, while the functions of astrocytes and microglia in the pineal gland are currently unclear.</p><p>The pineal gland only synthesizes melatonin at night due to nocturnal gene transcription and an increase in the activity of the enzyme arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT) induced by noradrenaline activation of beta-adrenoceptors <xref rid="pone.0040142-Borjigin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040142-Ganguly1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The daily rhythm of melatonin is driven by pineal production. Gastrointestinal cells, immunocompetent cells, and astrocytes also synthesize melatonin, which plays a local role related to tissue protection <xref rid="pone.0040142-Bubenik1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040142-Maldonado1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The pineal and extrapineal sources of melatonin production have been linked to independent physiological or pathophysiologycal contexts. Pineal melatonin, the darkness hormone, is responsible for effects dependent on low levels (pM range) of the indolamine, whereas extrapineal melatonin acts as a paracrine or autocrine mediator reaching higher concentrations (mM range) <xref rid="pone.0040142-Markus1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. &#x02018;Chronobiotic&#x02019; levels of melatonin inhibit both the rolling and adherence of leukocytes to the endothelial layer, and reduce vascular permeability <xref rid="pone.0040142-Lotufo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-Lotufo2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, avoiding unnecessary innate immune responses. In order to develop a full innate immune response, nocturnal pineal melatonin synthesis is suppressed both in birds and mammals <xref rid="pone.0040142-Markus1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-SkwarloSonta1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-Majewski1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition, immune-competent cells present in inflamed tissues are stimulated to synthesize melatonin, which acts in a paracrine manner as an anti-inflammatory mediator <xref rid="pone.0040142-Markus1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-Carrilovico1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-Pontes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-Maldonado1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This new approach in interpreting data regarding the two main functions of melatonin suggests that it is necessary to stop translating environmental lighting changes to the body, in order to allow the induction of inflammatory responses, which are essential for proper healing.</p><p>Prolonged disruption of chronobiotic pineal function correlates with several pathologies. An understanding of the mechanistic basis involved in the suppression of pineal melatonin synthesis during induction of innate immune responses will provide new insights in the relationship between the temporal organization of physiological functions and the genesis and maintenance of the pathological status.</p><p>Recently we have reported that the rat pineal gland responds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. This pathogen-associated molecular pattern triggers the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB). In the pineal gland, LPS induces a rapid and transient activation of this pathway that can suppress melatonin synthesis <xref rid="pone.0040142-DaSilveiraCruzMachado1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In addition, LPS also triggers TNF production <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0040142-DaSilveiraCruzMachado1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. TNF inhibits melatonin synthesis by blocking AA-NAT gene transcription in cultured rat pineal glands <xref rid="pone.0040142-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. High levels of TNF correlate with the inhibition of nocturnal melatonin in humans <xref rid="pone.0040142-Pontes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-Pontes2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-Perras1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, TNF is one of the first pro-inflammatory agents produced at the beginning of an immune response and amplifies and prolongs inflammatory responses. In the rat pineal gland, TNF is recognized by TNFR1 expressed on astrocytes, microglia and pinealocytes <xref rid="pone.0040142-CarvalhoSousa1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, the source of TNF production in cultured pineal glands is currently unknown.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism of action of LPS in the pineal gland, by evaluating its effect on different cell types. Therefore, we evaluated the localization of LPS receptors in different pineal gland cell types, and the downstream activation of NF-kB nuclear translocation which results in TNF synthesis. In addition, we analyzed the mechanism involved in the control of melatonin synthesis by LPS. Our data show that TLR4 is expressed on microglia, astrocytes and pinealocytes. In addition, we demonstrated that LPS induced microglial activation and TNF production, which may interact with TNFR1 that is up-regulated on pinealocytes. Our data also highlight the relevance of the NF-kB pathway in regulating melatonin synthesis. In this context, the production of TNF by microglia indicates an additional mechanism for controlling melatonin output and suggests a glia-pinealocyte regulatory network during inflammation. Therefore, we reinforce the hypothesis that the pineal gland is a sensor of immune status and provide a molecular basis that explains how melatonin synthesis is suppressed, as observed during clinical and experimental inflammatory conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>Pre-pubertal male and female Wistar rats (6 weeks, 84 animals) from the animal facility of the Department of Physiology (IB-USP, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil), were kept under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 07h00, considered as <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> time zero (ZT 0)) and received water and food <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

Besides producing melatonin, the pineal gland can also be induced to synthesize several cytokines, such as such as transforming growth factor-beta1, interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and TNF <xref rid="pone.0040142-DaSilveiraCruzMachado1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040142-Tsai3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The understanding of the relationship between the synthesis of melatonin and cytokines by pineal glands challenged with danger signals is in the center of the questions regarding the role of pineal gland in an innate immune response. The present paper focused on demonstrating that the microglia present in the pineal gland, instead of astrocytes or even pinealocytes are the cells that answer to LPS for synthesizing TNF.</p><p>A rise in nocturnal melatonin is one of the mechanisms that inhibit leukocyte migration to healthy tissues <xref rid="pone.0040142-Markus2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Reduction of nocturnal plasma melatonin, a prerequisite for the proper induction of an inflammatory response, is based on the ability of the pineal gland to detect and respond to danger signals. We have previously shown that intravenous LPS injection significantly reduces plasma melatonin at night, and increases the expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0040142-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In addition, LPS reduces noradrenaline-induced melatonin synthesis by triggering the NF-kB pathway through activation of TLR4 <xref rid="pone.0040142-DaSilveiraCruzMachado1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Besides modulating melatonin synthesis, LPS triggers the pineal synthesis of TNF, detectable in the culture medium after 2 h and attaining a maximal concentration after 4 h of incubation <xref rid="pone.0040142-DaSilveiraCruzMachado1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We observed that pinealocytes, astrocytes and microglia expressed TLR4, and therefore could be directly activated by LPS, as suggested by the activation of microglia after intravenous injection of LPS <xref rid="pone.0040142-JiangShieh1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> or by <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation (present work). Other circumventricular organs, such as the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, area postrema, choroid plexus, meninges, subfornincal organ and median eminence also express TLR4 <xref rid="pone.0040142-Laflamme1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-Wuchert1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, besides the pinealocytes, microglia and astrocytes are also able to respond to LPS, raising the question of whether TNF is synthesized by one specific cell type.</p><p>As isolated pinealocytes were not able to synthesize detectable amounts of TNF, we focused on the glial cells. The pharmacological inhibition of astrocytes or microglia indicated that only pineal gland microglial cells were able to produce TNF. This correlated with observed effects of LPS administration in the central nervous system, as the rolling and adhesion of leukocytes and TNF production are blocked by minocycline <xref rid="pone.0040142-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, an inhibitor of microglia activation that inhibits TNF synthesis in several areas of the central nervous system. Although astrocytes are known to synthesize TNF when stimulated with LPS, our data show that under the experimental conditions of the present study, no TNF is produced by pineal gland astrocytes.</p><p>TLR4 signal transduction occurs mainly through NF-kB, an important downstream signaling pathway for controlling physiological and pathophysiological conditions <xref rid="pone.0040142-Kaltschmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040142-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and a master modulator of cytokine production <xref rid="pone.0040142-ONeill1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. NF-kB acts as either a repressor or inductor of gene transcription. Usually the homodimer p50/p50, which lacks a transactivating domain, represses gene transcription while the heterodimer p50/RelA induces gene transcription <xref rid="pone.0040142-Vallabhapurapu1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. We have previously demonstrated that LPS induced the nuclear translocation of p50/p50 and p50/RelA dimers in the rat pineal gland <xref rid="pone.0040142-DaSilveiraCruzMachado1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. As melatonin is synthesized by pinealocytes, and these cells express TLR4 we concluded that activation of the NF-kB pathway in pinealocytes inhibited melatonin production. This inhibition is probably mediated by the p50/p50 homodimer, while TNF production is dependent on the activation of the p50/RelA heterodimer in microglia, as it is inhibited by minocycline and ALLN. In summary, we concluded that LPS acts on pinealocytes and microglia, impairing the production of melatonin, and inducing the synthesis of TNF, respectively.</p><p>As activation of TNFR1 impairs noradrenaline-induced melatonin synthesis <xref rid="pone.0040142-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-CarvalhoSousa1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> this strongly suggests that TNF produced by microglia amplifies the LPS-effect mediated by activation of TLR4 on pinealocytes. It is interesting to note that the peak of TNF production by microglia <xref rid="pone.0040142-DaSilveiraCruzMachado1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and the maximal TNFR1 expression attained in pinealocytes (present paper) occurred 240 min after incubation of pineal glands with LPS. This fine-tuning between the timing of agonist production and expression of the receptor suggests that the amplification of the LPS effect by TNF represents a second activation of the nuclear translocation of NF-kB. Reinforcing the idea of this strict control in the timing of the response, LPS initially induced a reduction in pinealocyte expression of TNFR1 (from 30 to 120 min). It is interesting to note that in mouse bone marrow granulocytes, receptor shedding induced by LPS reduced the expression of TNFR1 over a similar time-course (20 min), by a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase dependent mechanism <xref rid="pone.0040142-Pedron1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, a signaling cascade known to participate in control of the amplitude and duration of the nocturnal peak of the key enzyme in melatonin synthesis <xref rid="pone.0040142-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Therefore, the initial reduction of TNFR1 receptors also favors the idea that the peak of NF-kB activation in pinealocytes induced by TNF is programmed to occur after the initial wave triggered by direct LPS activation of TLR4 <xref rid="pone.0040142-Covert1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>The relevance of pineal production of TNF is currently unclear, although TNF can inhibit noradrenaline-induced transcription of AA-NAT and the synthesis of N-acetylserotonin <xref rid="pone.0040142-Fernandes1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040142-CarvalhoSousa1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This mechanism is also important for controlling the nocturnal melatonin surge in humans. The suppression of the nocturnal melatonin surge in innate immune responses to mastitis <xref rid="pone.0040142-Pontes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> or surgery incision <xref rid="pone.0040142-Pontes2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> is inversely correlated with TNF. In addition, it was observed that the return of nocturnal melatonin pineal output was strictly dependent upon the conclusion of the TNF peak <xref rid="pone.0040142-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040142-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), the pineal gland is a target for LPS, as TLR4 is expressed on pinealocytes, astrocytes and microglia. The effect of LPS on pinealocytes, the effector cells of the pineal gland, occur not only by direct stimulation of TLR4, but also by inducing TNF production in microglia. In addition, the expression of TNFR1 on pinealocytes is under fine-tuned temporal control. Finally, the complexity of LPS effects on the pineal gland provides the first insight into strategies that can ensure proper control of the expression of circadian timing during the evolution of an innate immune response.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful to Debora Aparecida Moura for her technical assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>Funding for this study was provided by Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de S&#x000e3;o Paulo - FAPESP - (07/07871-6) to RPM; Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa - CNPq - 305378/2009-0 - to RPM; and RPM senior fellow CNPq, LP and EKT - post-doc fellows FAPESP, and SSCM and CECS - PhD fellows FAPESP.
