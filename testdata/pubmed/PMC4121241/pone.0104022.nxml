<italic>vivo</italic> transduction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is encumbered by differentiation which reduces engraftment. We hypothesized that inhibiting DNA methyltransferase with decitabine would block differentiation of transduced CD34<sup>+</sup> cells under cytokine stimulation and thus improve transduction efficiency for engrafting HSCs. Human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in cytokine-containing media were treated with or without decitabine for 24 or 48 hours, and then these cells were transduced with a GFP-expressing lentiviral vector. Utilizing decitabine pre-treatment for 48 hours, we observed an equivalent percentage of successfully transduced cells (GFP-positivity) and a higher percentage of cells that retained CD34 positivity, compared to no decitabine exposure. Cell proliferation was inhibited after decitabine exposure. Similar results were observed among CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from six different donors. Repopulating activity was evaluated by transplantation into NOD/SCID/IL2R&#x003b3;<sup>null</sup> mice and demonstrated an equivalent percentage of GFP-positivity in human cells from decitabine-treated samples and a trend for higher human cell engraftment (measured 20&#x02013;24 weeks after transplantation), compared to no decitabine exposure. In conclusion, <italic>ex</italic>
<italic>vivo</italic> decitabine exposure inhibits both differentiation and proliferation in transduced human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and modestly increases the engraftment ability in xenograft mice, while the transduction efficiency is equivalent in decitabine exposure, suggesting improvement of lentiviral transduction for HSCs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the intramural research program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

In this study, we confirmed that decitabine has several beneficial effects in the transduction process. First, decitabine maintains CD34 expression of human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells during the entire lentiviral transduction process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g003">Figure 3</xref>), whether supplemented during prestimulation or transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Decitabine also partially prevents IL3-induced cell differentiation by maintaining CD34 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g004">4</xref>).

<italic>vivo</italic> culture revealed a tendency to increase engraftment ability of human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in xenograft mice 6 months after transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>There are additional effects exerted by decitabine that were not expected during the lentiviral transduction process. We observed that decitabine exposure reduced the variability of GFP intensity in bulk CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, evidenced by the lower CV of the GFP mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) in a single donor of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and the smaller standard deviations of the GFP MFI from 6 donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g004">4</xref>). The lower CV of GFP intensity was observed even in post-transduction decitabine exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g004">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that this effect was mainly mediated by modification of the MSCV promoter activity to drive GFP expression in the vector construct.</p><p>Since some of the variation from transduction might result from different stages of cell differentiation, when decitabine &#x0201c;restricts&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;halts&#x0201d; cell differentiation, variation in differentiation and subsequent transduction would be reduced. This finding is consistent with reduced expansion during the expanded culture of 3&#x02013;4 weeks after transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, within each well in the 96-well plate containing 100 human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, there was a dramatic reduction in number of wells in which the cells expanded after cytokine-free culture. Interestingly, the subclonal expansion was observed in only GFP-positive cells (except one subclone from non-transduced CD34<sup>+</sup> cells), suggesting that lentiviral integration could induce cytokine-independent expansion ability which might be reduced by decitabine exposure during prestimulation.</p><p>Adding IL3 into prestimulation and transduction media (including SCF, FLT3L, and TPO) significantly reduced %CD34 in human CD34<sup>+</sup> cell culture, this trend was reversed with either 24-hour decitabine exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g002">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g003">3</xref>) or 48-hour decitabine exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104022-g004">4</xref>). However, we previously demonstrated that IL3 supplementation into CD34<sup>+</sup> cell culture media decreases CD34 expression during <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vitro</italic> culture with lentiviral transduction, but it did not change engraftment ability of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in xenograft mice <xref rid="pone.0104022-Uchida1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This finding can be explained by IL3 inducing more expansion of differentiated cells from CD34<sup>+</sup> cells but not reducing repopulation potential of hematopoietic repopulating cells. These results suggest that IL3 is not necessary for most lentiviral transduction in hematopoietic repopulating cells, with or without decitabine exposure.</p><p>Decitabine exposure during a 48-hour prestimulation revealed equivalent %GFP in lentivirally transduced CD34<sup>+</sup> cells <italic>in</italic>

In these studies, decitabine reversed the suppressors of fetal hemoglobin in erythroid cells.

This property of not only maintaining stem cell capacity but also erythroid differentiation potential from human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells is desirable for gene therapy application in red cell disorders.</p><p>In summary, decitabine maintained CD34 expression during lentiviral transduction, reduced transduction variability of human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, and modestly increased the engraftment potential of transduced hematopoietic repopulating cells in xenograft mice. These observations are helpful in developing novel strategies to optimize lentiviral transduction of human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0104022-Aiuti1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
