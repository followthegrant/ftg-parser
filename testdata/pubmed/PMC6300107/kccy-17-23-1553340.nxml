Failure to resolve these defective attachments before anaphase onset can lead to missegregation of chromosomes. Aurora B kinase is concentrated at the inner centromere where it contributes to multiple kinetochore functions, one of which is in error-correction. Analysis of several CIN cell lines showed that many aspects of Aurora B kinase functions were normal. Furthermore, the amount and activity of Aurora B kinase was not reduced at the kinetochores of CIN cells that were examined. However, phosphorylation of a centromeric biosensor for Aurora B in OVCAR10, MCF7 and U2OS cells was consistently reduced relative to non CIN cells. This suggested a localized problem with Aurora B&#x02019;s ability to phosphorylate substrates important for error correction. This possibility was supported by our ability to improve error correction and reduce the frequency of lagging chromosome in CIN cells by directing endogenous Aurora B to the region of centromere that was tested by the biosensor. Our studies suggest that the kinetochores of CIN cells have a defect that limits accessibility of Aurora B to substrates that are important for error-correction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Chromosome instability</kwd><kwd>Aurora B</kwd><kwd>kinetochore biorientation</kwd><kwd>error correction</kwd><kwd>lagging chromosomes</kwd><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>osteosarcoma</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Cancer Institute</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000054</named-content></funding-source><award-id>CA06927</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Institute of General Medical Sciences</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000057</named-content></funding-source><award-id>GM083988</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">DoD</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000005</named-content></funding-source><award-id>OC100172</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Institutes of Health</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>GM083988</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">U.S. Department of Defense</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000005</named-content></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-17-1-0136</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">PA Cure</named-content></funding-source><award-id>6914501</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Greenberg Foundation</named-content></funding-source><award-id>5936002</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">a core</named-content></funding-source><award-id>CA06927</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Institutes of Health</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id>GM086877</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Cancer Institute</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000054</named-content></funding-source><award-id>CA191956</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">U.S. Department of Defense</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000005</named-content></funding-source><award-id>OC100172</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (GM086877), a core grant (CA06927), the DoD (OC100172), PA CURE, an appropriation from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

The CIN condition is highly complex as it is not merely the disruption of chromosome segregation but must include other alterations that allow the tumor cell to tolerate an unstable aneuploid state [<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. These properties allow tumor cells to rapidly change gene expression patterns on a global scale and rapidly adapt to adverse growth conditions and likely to survive chemo- and radiotherapy [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. This prompted us to investigate the molecular basis of CIN as such information may reveal novel ways to improve treatment.</p><p>There are two types of defects that can cause chromosome missegregation. The mitotic checkpoint ensures that a cell does not prematurely enter anaphase before all of its chromosomes have established bipolar attachments and achieved metaphase alignment. Indeed, disruption of the mitotic checkpoint will result in chromosome missegregation in vitro and in vivo [<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>]. The mitotic checkpoint is however essential as homozygous mutants are not viable presumably because the cells cannot tolerate massive levels of chromosome missegregation. Cells with reduced expression of mitotic checkpoint proteins (i.e. heterozygous mutants, or hypomorphs) are viable and can become aneuploid if chromosomes fail to properly attach to the spindle in a timely manner. Despite the importance of the mitotic checkpoint, mutations in these genes are infrequent in human cancers and thus may not be the predominant mechanism for chromosome instability [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Chromosome missegregation can also occur due to defects in the process that correct improper microtubule attachments to kinetochores [<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. A proper attachment is one where the plus end of the microtubule terminates perpendicularly into the face of the kinetochore. Because of the stochastic manner by which kinetochores search and capture microtubules, defective attachments can sometimes occur. For example, merotelic attachments occur when one sister of a kinetochore pair is attached to microtubules from opposite poles. If unrepaired, merotelic attachments will give rise to lagging chromosomes [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. Other defects such as monotelics and syntelics, where only one or both kinetochores are attached to the same pole, respectively, can also occur. The kinetochore therefore possesses an error correction mechanism to resolve these defective attachments, and disrupting this system will result in chromosome missegregation [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>].</p><p>The kinetochore associated error-correction mechanism is centered on the conserved Aurora B/Ipl1 kinase whose function, amongst others, is to sever aberrantly attached microtubules [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]. Through an iterative process, bad attachments are ultimately converted to proper attachments. How Aurora B, which is localized at the inner centromere, distinguishes good versus bad is believed to rely on its spatial relationship with substrates that bind microtubules [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]. Proper attachments generate poleward forces that physically stretch the kinetochore and displace substrates away from Aurora B. Kinetochores that are not properly attached do not stretch and the microtubule binding proteins remain within proximity of Aurora B where they are phosphorylated and release the defectively attached microtubules. Defective attachments can be induced in normal or non-CIN tumor cells by disrupting microtubule dynamics with drugs or depletion of depolymerases, such as Kif2b and MCAK, which regulate microtubule turnover [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. Indeed, the reduced dynamicity of kinetochore:microtubules in CIN cancer cells is a defect that stabilizes aberrantly attached microtubules and thus interferes with error correction [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. Furthermore, these errors can be corrected by overexpressing Kif2b or MCAK. These studies suggest an elegant model that explains how kinetochore biorientation is temporally and spatially regulated. During prometaphase, Plk1 activates and recruits Kif2b to kinetochores where it prevents the accumulation of aberrant attachments during congression [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. Once chromosomes are aligned, Kif2b is released, and MCAK takes over. More recent evidence suggests that a dysfunctional Rb tumor suppressor pathway alters centromeric cohesion [<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>] such that the geometries of the sister kinetochores favor merotelic attachments [<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]. Given that the majority of tumor cells are deficient in the Rb pathway [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>], this along with defective repair mechanisms are likely promote chromosome instability.</p><p>In this study, we characterized a panel of CIN cancer cells for the integrity of their mitotic checkpoint, spindle organization and kinetochore:microtubule attachments, and found they all shared a problem with correcting defective attachments. We then focused on error correction as this is essential for resolving defective attachments. Given the central role of Aurora B in error correction, we used a previously described FRET biosensor that specifically monitors Aurora B kinase activity at the centromeres on a limited number of CIN cell lines. We detected a slight reduction in phosphorylation of the biosensor that suggested the selective impairment of error-correction and not other Aurora B dependent functions at the kinetochore. This reduction was not due to a lowered amounts or activity of Aurora B at centromeres of CIN cells. Using a construct that can recruit endogenous Aurora B to the region occupied by the biosensor, it was possible to improve error correction and reduce the frequency of lagging chromosomes in CIN cells. The cumulative data suggest that there is a localized kinetochore defect in CIN cells that limits access of Aurora B to substrates that are important for error-correction.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Aneuploid cancer cell lines exhibit chromosome instability (CIN)</title><p>OVCAR 3, OVCAR 5 and OVCAR 10 are aneuploid ovarian cancer cells that were derived from patients with varied history and treatment status [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>]. We first used timelapse microscopy to obtain evidence of chromosome missegregation. As can be seen (Figure 1(a) and B), chromosomes in all three lines were able to achieve metaphase alignment in a timeframe similar to that of Hela cells. The average times from NEBD to metaphase, and the metaphase to anaphase transition did not differ by more than 10&#x000a0;minutes amongst the four cell lines. The ovarian cancer cells did not exhibit noticeable kinetochore attachment defects that would have significantly delayed mitotic progression. However, a high percentage (55&#x02013;80%) of the ovarian cancer cells exhibited what appeared to be lagging chromosomes in anaphase when compared to Hela cells (5%) or HCT116 (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(c)</xref> and data not shown).<fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/15384101.2018.1553340-F0001</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Ovarian cancer cells exhibit high incidences of lagging chromosomes.

We therefore used deconvolution microscopy to examine the kinetochore-microtubule attachments of metaphase aligned chromosomes in the ovarian and in other cancer cells. The proteosome inhibitor MG132 was used to prevent cells from exiting mitosis and thus ensure cells had sufficient time to reach metaphase. Examination of Hela and HCT116 cells showed that 95% of the kinetochores were bioriented as they exhibited proper &#x0201c;end-on&#x0201d; microtubule attachments (Figure 2(a), inset and B). By contrast, multiple types of defective attachments were commonly observed in cancer cells from ovary (OVCAR3, 5, 10, A1847, SKOV3, PEO1), breast (MCF7), colon (HT29 and Caco2) and bone (U2OS). The defects included merotelic (one sister attached to both poles), monotelic (attached to one pole), syntelic (both sisters attached to the same pole), and connections with the lateral surface of the microtubule were observed (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(a)</xref>, insets). The frequencies of aberrant attachment ranged from 20% to over 40% in these cells (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(b)</xref>).<fig id="F0002" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/15384101.2018.1553340-F0002</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Kinetochores of CIN cancer cells accumulate defective attachments.

To accomplish this, we seeded mitotic shakeoffs (no drug treatments) onto slides and allowed them to divide before fixing. This approach allowed us to directly visualize segregation events in individual dividing cells. Only 0.5% of the Hela cells, which are not classified as CIN (Macville et al., 1999), and 0.3% of the diploid HCT116 colorectal cancer cells missegreated the chromosomes that were examined. Nearly 10-fold higher numbers of OVCAR10 (3%) and MCF7 (2%) cells exhibited missegregation. These missegregation frequencies were comparable to U2OS osteosarcoma cells that are classified as CIN. OVCAR3 and 5 exhibited similar frequencies of between 2&#x02013;3% (data not shown). The missegregation frequency is likely higher as we only tracked only one or two specific chromosomes.<fig id="F0003" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/15384101.2018.1553340-F0003</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Frequency of chromosome missegregation as determined by FISH.

Progeny cells that shared the same number (1:1 segregation) of FISH signals were compared to those that showed unequal FISH signals (deviations from 1:1). % of all divided cells that exhibited deviations from 1:1 for each cell line was calculated from counting &#x0003e;300 pairs of divided cells.

S1 and S2). Timelapse studies showed that under normal growing conditions, cells completed mitosis in ~50&#x000a0;minutes. In the presence of drugs, over 90% of the cells were delayed for over 50&#x000a0;minutes, with over 50% of the cells delayed for &#x0003e; 500&#x000a0;minutes. In all cases, the cells either died while arrested in mitosis or exited mitosis. The duration of the mitotic delay was similar to that of the checkpoint proficient Hela cells. Thus, OVCAR 3, 5, and 10 cells exhibit a proficient mitotic checkpoint.</p><p>A possible source for CIN is multipolar spindles derived from multiple centrosomes [<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>]. Multipolar spindles establish many aberrant kinetochore attachments that have been argued to exceed the capacity of the error correction mechanism. These aberrant attachments persist after the multipolar spindle coalesces into a bipolar spindle. We stained OVCAR3, 5, 10, MCF7 and normal RPE1 cells with &#x003b3;-tubulin antibodies and counted the number of centrosomes in cells that were in mitosis (images not shown). 1% of RPE cells had more than 2 centrosomes. Between 5&#x02013;6% of mitotic OVCAR3, 5, 10 and MCF7 cells had greater than 2 centrosomes. The 5&#x02013;6-fold increase however, cannot account for the high number of cells that exhibited aberrant attachments as described above.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2002"><title>Aurora B kinase functions are largely intact during mitosis</title><p>The stochastic nature by which kinetochores encounter microtubules can occasionally result in non-productive attachments. AuroraB/Ipl1 kinase plays a central role in error correction by promoting the release of microtubules that are not properly attached to kinetochores [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]. We examined the expression of Aurora B and its associated subunits in the chromosomal passage complex (CPC) in OVCAR3, 5, 10 and MCF7 cells. Western blots of mitotic lysates showed that CPC components (Aurora B, INCENP and survivin) were expressed to comparable levels in all the cells examined (Fig. S3A). In addition, the presence of the activating phospho-T232 within the T-loop of Aurora B&#x02019;s catalytic domain indicated that it is an active kinase during mitosis. This is supported by the presence of phospho-S10 in histone H3, a major in vivo substrate of Aurora B (Figs. S3A and C). MCAK, a microtubule depolymerase that contributes to error correction by promoting the release of aberrantly attached microtubules [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>], is also expressed in the cell lines examined (Fig. S3A).</p><p>Quantitation of Aurora B, and one of its substrates, pS7 CENP-A, showed that their levels at kinetochores, after normalization with ACA, were actually higher in the CIN cell lines than normal RPE1 cells (Fig. S3B, D). Thus, the error-correction defects of OVCAR3, 5, 10 and MCF7 cells cannot be simply explained by loss of Aurora B kinase activity.</p><p>Beyond its role in error correction, Aurora B is required for other essential kinetochore activities that include centromere cohesion, microtubule binding and the spindle checkpoint [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>]. All of these functions appear intact in these CIN cells because their chromosomes were able to achieve metaphase alignment within a normal timeframe. Furthermore, their ability to complete cytokinesis also indicated that Aurora B functions were not grossly perturbed during mitotic exit. This is further supported by the fact that proteins such as Hec1/Ndc80 (Fig. S4A) together with MCAK, BubR1 and Sgo2 (data not shown) whose localization at kinetochores depends on Aurora B [<xref rid="CIT0039">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0045">45</xref>], were all present in the CIN cell lines examined. In addition, phosphorylation of histone H3T3 by the Haspin kinase [<xref rid="CIT0046">46</xref>] that is critical for the recruitment of CPC to kinetochores [<xref rid="CIT0047">47</xref>] was also present at kinetochores of these CIN cells (Figs. S4A). This is consistent with the presence of Aurora B (see above) as well as TD60, which is another CPC subunit, at the kinetochores of the CIN cells that were examined (Fig. S4B). Beyond this, other essential kinetochore proteins such as CENP-F, Bub1, Plk1, were also present at the kinetochores of these CIN cells (Figs. S4B and C). We then conducted a functional test for Aurora B by treating the OVCAR 3, 5 and 10 cells with a kinase inhibitor (Hesparadin) or with a siRNA. In all cases, the treated cells exhibited mitotic defects consistent with loss of Aurora B functions [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>] (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(a,b)</xref>). The cumulative data show that many Aurora B functions are intact in CIN cells.

The biosensor consists of CFP donor and YFP acceptor, the centromere targeting domain of CENP-B, and an Aurora B substrate peptide that is connected to a FHA2 phospho-binding domain via a flexible linker (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5(a)</xref>). Maximal FRET (emission ratio of YFP:CFP is high) occurs when the sensor is unphosphorylated. Phosphorylation of the sensor by Aurora B, as in the case when kinetochores lack attachments, induces a conformational change that reduces FRET (emission ratio of YFP:CFP is low). This biosensor was previously used to monitor Aurora B kinase activity at kinetochores and to show that its ability to phosphorylate its substrates was spatially regulated by microtubule attachment status [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. OVCAR10, U2OS, MCF7 and Hela cells were transfected with the sensor and blocked in mitosis with nocodazole to prevent microtubule assembly (this should lead to phosphorylation of the biosensor and low FRET). To confirm that the biosensor was phosphorylated by Aurora B, a parallel sample was treated with an Aurora kinase inhibitor (ZM447439). <xref rid="F0005">Figure 5(b)</xref> shows a representative image of the FRET signal from the biosensor (YFP emission) after excitation of the CFP in nocodazole arrested mitotic cells that were treated with ZM447439. As expected, the FRET signals for the different cell types were highest in the presence of ZM447439 when compared to the nocodazole alone samples (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5(c)</xref>). The reduced FRET seen in the nocodazole treated samples is therefore due to phosphorylation of the biosensor by Aurora B kinase. Amongst the nocodazole treated samples, the FRET signals for the OVCAR10, U2OS and MCF7 cells were always slightly higher than Hela cells. Statistical analysis (Student T-test) showed that the difference between Hela cells and each of the CIN cell lines was significant (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), while the difference between the CIN cell lines was not (p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05). This suggested that the biosensor is less efficiently phosphorylated by Aurora B in the CIN cells versus non-CIN cells. The higher amounts of unphosphorylated biosensor at the kinetochores of CIN cells would produce the higher FRET signal relative to a more extensive phosphorylation of the biosensor in Hela cells.<fig id="F0005" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/15384101.2018.1553340-F0005</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Assessing Aurora B kinase activity at centromeres of CIN cells.

We therefore attempted to rectify this deficit by recruiting Aurora B closer to its targets by using a CENP-B:INCENP:mCherry fusion construct [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. This construct is targeted to centromeres through CENP-B, and uses INCENP (lacking its own centromere targeting domain) to recruit endogenous Aurora B. As the CENP-B targeting domain is identical to what was used for the biosensor, we expected Aurora B to localize to areas that should improve access to defective attachments. OVCAR10 and MCF7 cells were transfected with CENP-B:INCENP:mCherry construct or one lacking INCENP, and their kinetochore:microtubule attachments were examined after arresting cells at metaphase with MG132. Comparison of the mcherry positive kinetochores between OVCAR10 cells that were transfected with the two constructs showed that the frequency of biorientation was improved with the CENP-B:INCENP:mCherry construct (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(a,b)</xref>). In some OVCAR10 cells, nearly all the kinetochores expressing CENP-B:INCENP:mCherry appeared to be properly bioriented. OVCAR10 cells expressing CENP-B:INCENP:mCherry showed a near 5-fold reduction (25% vs. 5%) in the number of defective attachments than the cells transfected with just the CENP-B: mCherry construct (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(b)</xref>). A 2&#x02013;3 fold reduction in defective attachments was seen in MCF7 cells that expressed CENP-B:INCENP:mCherry (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(b)</xref>). We note that not all cells expressing CENP-B:INCENP:mCherry had normal attachments. Cells expressing high levels of CENP-B:INCENP:mCherry at the kinetochores invariably had fewer attached kinetochores (data not shown). This was expected if Aurora B is chronically phosphorylating and severing microtubule attachments as has been shown in Hela cells [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. These results demonstrated that endogenous Aurora B is fully functional in OVCAR10 and MCF7 cells, and the defect in error correction is consistent with its inability to access its targets.<fig id="F0006" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/15384101.2018.1553340-F0006</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Improving error-correction in Ovcar10 and MCF7 cells.

The CENP-B:INCENP:mCherry or CENP-B:mcherrry constructs were co-transfected with the FRET biosensor into Hela, OVCAR10 and MCF7 cells. FRET was performed exactly the same as described above on kinetochores that were positive for mcherry and CFP. Cells were blocked in mitosis with nocodazole and in the presence and absence ZM447439. All of the ZM447439 treated samples exhibited strong FRET because Aurora B was inhibited and thus the biosensor was unphosphorylated (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(c)</xref>, purple and green bars). In the nocadozole alone treatment, Hela, OVCAR10 and MCF7 cells co-transfected with the biosensor and the CENP-B:mcherry (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(c)</xref>, blue bars) exhibited FRET signals comparable to what was reported in <xref rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> for biosensor alone. Hela cells showed the strongest phosphorylation (low FRET) of the biosensor relative to OVCAR10 and MCF7 cells (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(c)</xref>, blue bars). Importantly, for cells co-transfected with the CENP-B:INCENP:mCherry, the biosensor, in all cases, showed increased phosphorylation (lower FRET) when compared to the CENP-B:mcherry control (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(c)</xref>, compare red vs blue bars). Student T-test showed that the differences in Hela (P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), OVCAR 10 and MCF7 were significant (P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01). This data directly demonstrates that endogenous Aurora B can increase phosphorylation of the biosensor in OVCAR10 and MCF7 cells if it is relocated closer to the biosensor. By extension, the relocalization of Aurora B by the CENP-B:INCENP:mCherry construct can explain the improved attachment status of kinetochores in these two CIN cell lines.</p><p>The ability to restore the integrity of kinetochore microtubule attachments prompted us to test whether this strategy could be used to reduce the incidence of lagging chromosomes of CIN cells. CB:INCENP:mcherry and CB:mcherry were transiently transfected into OVCAR10 cells that stably expressed H2B:GFP so that chromosome segregation could be monitored in real-time (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(d)</xref>). Only 9% of the mitotic cells that expressed CB:mcherry at their kinetochores divided without evidence of lagging chromosomes. In contrast, 38% of the cells transfected with CB:INCENP:mcherry divided without lagging chromosomes (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(d)</xref>). This result suggests that with the improvement in the frequency of biorientation by the CB:INCENP:mcherry construct, the frequency of lagging chromosomes and by extension, chromosome missegregation was reduced.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have characterized a panel of tumor cell lines and presented evidence that show that they exhibit chromosome instability. Chromosome instability in our panel of CIN cells was not due to defects in the mitotic checkpoint as they are able to delay mitosis (12&#x02013;18&#x000a0;hours) when treated with the spindle poisons, nocodazole and taxol. Although experimental disruption of the mitotic checkpoint functions will lead to aneuploidy, this pathway is not commonly targeted by tumor cells to achieve CIN [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Kinetochore attachment defects have also been proposed to result from an extended mitotic delay as a result of overexpression of key mitotic checkpoint proteins [<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. In the CIN cell lines that we studied, the timing of mitosis was not delayed when compared to Hela cells. The CIN cells were able to reach metaphase and enter anaphase within the same timeframe as Hela or HCT116 cells. This is consistent with studies of many other CIN cell lines where mitotic timing and spindle checkpoint functions were intact [<xref rid="CIT0049">49</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0050">50</xref>].</p><p>Chromosome instability is largely the result of defective microtubule attachments [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0051">51</xref>]. Those studies showed that CIN cancer cells routinely accumulate defective attachments that can result from reduced kinetochore:microtubule dynamics or from multipolar spindles. In both cases, the failure to resolve the defective attachments before anaphase onset will cause chromosome missegregation. In the CIN cells that were examined in this study, all of them accumulated a variety of defective attachments that failed to be resolved before anaphase onset. These defects can explain the increase in frequency of lagging chromosomes that were observed. The defective attachments are not monitored by the spindle assembly checkpoint as this failsafe system only recognizes kinetochores that have unoccupied microtubule binding sites. The mechanism that distinguishes good versus bad attachments is mediated by a pool of Aurora B kinase that is concentrated at the inner centromere. Defective microtubule attachments do not generate tension that is capable of spatially separating the microtubule binding proteins away from Aurora B. Subsequent phosphorylation of these proteins by Aurora B promotes the release of the microtubules. In the case of a productive attachment that generates kinetochore tension, the microtubule binding proteins become physically separated from the negative influences of Aurora B.</p><p>Western blots and immunofluorescence staining showed that Aurora B along with its subunits in the Chromosome Passenger Complex (CPC) were expressed and localized at centromeres of the CIN cells examined in this study. In addition, the levels of phosphoS7 CENP-A, a substrate of Aurora B, was also not noticeably reduced in CIN cells relative to non CIN cells. While it is difficult to accurately compare the staining intensities of Aurora B and other proteins across cell lines, there must be sufficient amounts of these proteins to provide critical kinetochore functions. Aurora B provides functions essential for chromosome congression and alignment, mitotic checkpoint and cytokinesis [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>]. Our timelapse studies did not reveal noticeable defects in these activities that would indicate such Aurora B deficiencies. Indeed, the cells we tested were still sensitive to Aurora inhibitors as they exhibited all of the defects associated with loss of Aurora B functions. That Aurora B was functional was also supported by the observations that proteins such as Tripin/Sgo2 [<xref rid="CIT0045">45</xref>], BubR1 [<xref rid="CIT0042">42</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0043">43</xref>] and MCAK [<xref rid="CIT0040">40</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0041">41</xref>], whose localization at kinetochores depend on Aurora B, were present in the cell lines that were examined. Finally, FRET biosensor experiments detected Aurora B kinase activity at the kinetochores of OVCAR10, MCF7 and U2OS cells, albeit slightly reduced from Hela cells. The cumulative data suggest that Aurora B kinase is largely functional in the CIN cells that were examined, and defective kinase activity cannot be the basis for CIN. This is perhaps expected given the essential roles that are played by Aurora B at the various stages of mitosis.</p><p>The molecular defect that prevents CIN cells from recognizing and repairing defective attachments remain to be identified. The small but statistically significant reduction in the phosphorylation of the biosensor in the CIN cells that were examined, relative to the signal observed for Hela cells suggests a localized defect. As nocodazole was used to block microtubule assembly, the difference in FRET is unlikely due to differences in microtubule attachments at the kinetochores amongst these cells. When we used a CENP-B:INCENP construct to recruit Aurora B to the same location that was occupied by the biosensor, the frequency of biorientation in OVCAR10 and MCF7 cells was improved. The CENP-B:INCENP construct likely recruited Aurora B to sites that were critical for error correction. Relocalization of Aurora B towards the kinetochore in Hela cells has been shown to prevent stable attachments owing to the persistence of kinase activity near the attachment sites [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. For OVCAR10 and MCF7 cells, the change in the amount or location of Aurora B probably enhanced the destabilization of microtubules which would then provide new opportunities to achieve biorientation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of either MCAK or Kif2b in MCF7 cells reduced the incidence of lagging chromosomes. Given that Aurora B acts upstream of these depolymerases, our strategy may in fact be mediated through the actions of endogenous Kif2b or MCAK. Nevertheless, there are other targets within the kinetochore that are substrates for Aurora B&#x02019;s error correction activity.</p><p>A critical point of our study is that the defect in error correction must be subtle. Otherwise, the error rate would be so high that the resulting massive missegregation rates would be lethal. We currently do not know how often aberrant attachments occur during the course of establishing bipolar attachments in normal cells. Thus, we cannot say if there is an increase rate of aberrant attachments in CIN cells due to abnormal spindle geometries as has been proposed [<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>]. Regardless of the cause of the defective attachments, it is clear that the cells we examined had a defect in their Aurora B dependent error correction. We are currently seeking to understand the nature of the inaccessibility issue that we propose to be an explanation for why Aurora B kinase cannot resolve defective attachments in CIN cells. Based on the original spatial model for how physical stretching of the centromere/kinetochore complex by proper end-on microtubule attachments displaces the microtubule binding factors away from Aurora B kinase, we hypothesize that Aurora B is physically located too far away to efficiently perform its error correction functions. There could be a subtle architectural problem with the centromere/kinetochore complex that is shared amongst CIN cells.</p><p>The fact that we were able to improve proper bipolar attachments that reduced the frequency of lagging chromosomes suggest that it is possible to reduce missegregation in CIN cells. This then opens the opportunity to test whether limiting chromosome instability in cancer cells will reduce their ability to adapt. The exciting prospect is whether it is possible to block the evolutionary capacity of cancer cells and thus limit their ability to adapt to changing growth environments, and also overcoming drug treatments.</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="S0004-S2001"><title>Cell culture, transfections and antibodies</title><p>All cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
