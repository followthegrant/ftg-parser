Introduction</title><p>The past decades of obesity research have seen a change of paradigm. Adipose tissue was once labeled as a passive storage organ, while obesity comorbidities were predominantly linked with energy metabolism disorders. Currently, it is widely recognized that adipose tissue also plays a major endocrine role and that progressive metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis manifest a strong immune component. Moreover, molecules secreted by the expanding adipose tissue modulate systemic inflammation and contribute heavily to the pathology of the aforementioned diseases [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p> Acylation stimulating protein (ASP), identical to C3adesArg, is a protein generated through the alternative complement pathway of the immune system [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. C3a/C3adesArg is rapidly produced during acute immunological responses such as bacterial infection, which triggers the classical or lectin pathways of the complement system. However, in the absence of acute immune response, spontaneous activation of the alternative pathway of complement, mediated through adipsin, factor B, and complement C3 convertase, leads to the generation of C3a. C3a is rapidly desarginated by carboxypeptidase B or N to generate C3adesArg, termed ASP based on its specific metabolic effects. ASP acts through its only known receptor, C5L2. This 7-transmembrane receptor is widely expressed, with expression in tissues such as liver, muscle, adipose tissue, immune cells, and brain, and C5L2 shares significant homology with other complement receptors such as C3a receptor and C5a receptor [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>In vitro</italic>, the functional role of ASP/C3adesArg has been extensively studied on adipocytes. Its primary effect is the promotion of fat storage, accomplished by increasing diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and GLUT4 translocation [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which drive fatty acid and glucose uptake into cells and provide the substrates for triglyceride synthesis. These effects have been shown to be independent and additive to those of insulin [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In adipocytes, ASP action is mediated through activation of PI3kinase, phospholipases C and A2, Akt phosphorylation, and protein kinase C [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </p><p>The presence of C5L2 is required for ASP response in adipocytes [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but in other cell types, the interaction of ASP with C5L2 remains controversial. However, C5a is also a ligand for both C5L2 and C5aR [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. While C3a binds C3a receptor (C3aR), initiating a potent proinflammatory signaling cascade, C3adesArg does not bind C3aR, and it has canonically been considered as an inert fragment, indicative of complement system activation, and subsequent proteolytic cleavage of C3a [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, C3adesArg has also been shown to be implicated in several immune processes, with less potency than C3a [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For example, C3adesArg retains indirect chemotactic properties on hematopoietic cells [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and can also induce cytokine secretion by cultured macrophages and modulate liver regeneration [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. </p><p>ASP has been shown to possess a metabolic role in both humans and rodents. Acute postprandial production of ASP within the adipose tissue bed has been demonstrated in human studies, and this acute production directly correlates with dietary fatty acid uptake into adipose tissues [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. By contrast, ASP levels are chronically increased in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases in humans [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and higher circulating levels of fasting ASP in humans are associated with a delayed clearance of postprandial triglyceride [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This suggests that acute ASP responses may be very different from the metabolic profile associated with chronically elevated ASP, and the exact consequences of acute versus chronic ASP in these diseases remain unclear. </p><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of acute ASP administration on <italic>in vivo</italic> glucose metabolism and rapid inflammatory responses in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. We hypothesized that ASP could modulate both adipose inflammation and alter systemic glucose disposal.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Animals</title><p>Male C57Bl/6 wild-type mice were obtained through breeding in our internal colony. All mice were individually housed in a sterile barrier facility with a 12&#x02009;h light 12&#x02009;h dark cycles. At 8 weeks, mice were placed on high-fat-high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet (58% kcal fat D12331; Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 12 weeks. All mice were weighed and randomly separated into two groups of equal body weight at week 11. Throughout the study, treated mice received a total of three ASP doses (high physiological) intraperitoneally (1.5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/g body weight), and control mice received three PBS (vehicle) injections at the following times: (i) before glucose tolerance test (GTT) early week 11, (ii) ITT late week 11, and (iii) GTT sacrifice week 12, with a minimum of 5 days recovery between each injection. Blood was collected through cardiac puncture, and tissues were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were subsequently transferred to &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C and stored for further analysis. All protocols were approved and were conducted in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care (CCAC) guidelines and approved by the Laval University Animal Care Committee.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Recombinant ASP</title><p>Recombinant human ASP was prepared as previously described, using a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-Sepharose column for initial purification via binding to the 6XHis-tag sequence at the amino-terminal, followed by HPLC purification as described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. No denaturing agents were used at any step in the purification to avoid ASP inactivation. Recombinant ASP purity was assessed with mass spectrometry and was endotoxin-free as evidenced by the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) endotoxin assay (Lonza, Walkersville, MD). </p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Plasma Analysis</title><p>Blood was collected through cardiac puncture. Plasma triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and glucose were measured using colorimetric enzymatic kits as follows: plasma triglyceride (Roche Diagnostics, Richmond, VA, USA), NEFA (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA, USA), and glucose (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA).

ASP Alters Substrate Partitioning</title><p>An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT) with/without ASP was performed. The recombinant ASP dose was chosen to represent a high-physiological concentration of endogenous ASP, such as seen in severely obese individuals [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Glucose and insulin levels were monitored throughout a 90-minute timeframe after the injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A more efficient glucose clearance was achieved with acute ASP supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Concomitant insulin levels showed a statistical tendency to be lower in the ASP-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.08).

Macrophage Infiltration and Polarization Is Influenced by ASP</title><p>Macrophage infiltration and polarization were evaluated in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>, macrophage marker F4/80 was not significantly altered by ASP treatment, although it tended to increase in the skeletal muscle (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07). No change was seen in anti-inflammatory M2 polarization marker (CD163). However, in all tissues, proinflammatory M1 polarization marker was significantly higher or tended to increase (adipose tissue, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, skeletal muscle, <italic>P</italic> = 0.07, liver, <italic>P</italic> = 0.10), suggesting a preferential activation of infiltrating macrophages to an M1 phenotype with acute ASP treatment.</p><p>In order to further investigate the direct role of ASP in the physiological changes observed in mice, <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of ASP on macrophage migration and polarization in RAW 264.7 macrophages were evaluated. ASP showed dose-dependent chemoattractant migration properties when incubated alone with macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>), and these effects were further additive to those of 3T3-L1 adipocyte-conditioned media. ASP by itself had very limited capacity to induce macrophage M1 or M2 phenotype polarization (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(c)</xref>). However, RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with INF-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> and LPS to stimulate M1 polarization, as assessed by CD11c mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>), showed further M1 polarization with ASP treatment, in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>). By contrast, while treatment with IL-4 and IL-13 increased M2 polarization, as assessed through CD163 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>), ASP did not further enhance this effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>In the present study, the inflammatory role of acute high-physiological ASP administration in a context of established obesity was evaluated. Previous studies have focused either on the metabolic role of ASP in adipocytes or the immune role of ASP/C3adesArg in immune cells. This study examines a broader, more integrative physiological role of ASP. This study clearly demonstrated that ASP/C3adesArg acutely enhances glucose-insulin clearance mechanisms in spite of its acute paradoxical <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> proinflammatory effects.</p><p>One advantage of the current study is that acute ASP effects rather than chronic effects were evaluated. In previous studies, effects of chronic administration of ASP were evaluated in either C3KO or wild-type mice [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], demonstrating effects on decreased insulin sensitivity, weight gain, and lipid/glucose metabolism. However, it is difficult to establish whether these effects are direct or indirect or a consequence of resistance induced by chronic stimulation. Similar concerns are an issue in knockout mice models where the proinflammatory effects [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] may result from indirect disruptions in the immune system. Specifically, C3KO mice lack ASP but also lack an active complement system; C5L2KO mice lack ASP/C5L2 interaction but also lack C5a/C5L2 interaction which could disrupt the balance in C5a/C5aR-mediated effects.</p><p>The results shown in this study are not consequent to changes in body weight or food intake, which could have been confounding factors. We can therefore directly relate the changes observed to acute bolus ASP-mediated effects. The dose of ASP used was high physiological-pathological, as it theoretically could increase circulating ASP levels in obese mice by up to tenfold (from 400&#x02009;nM to 4,2&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) and would mimic the high concentration of ASP generated following an acute immune activation of the complement system or seen in obese individuals. The most striking results obtained are the rapid, global increases in plasma inflammatory cytokines and the M1 polarization of tissue macrophages upon acute ASP treatment. We show additional <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence that supports a direct role for ASP in macrophage recruitment and M1 activation that is additive to classic cytokine effects. Notwithstanding the demonstrated proinflammatory ASP effects, acute ASP enhances plasma glucose excursion in DIO mice, with increased uptake into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and reduced liver glucose uptake, and this effect is mediated in the presence of lower circulating insulin levels. While this could point towards increased insulin sensitivity, we also demonstrated that a single acute dose of ASP does not directly alter insulin sensitivity. We therefore speculate that the known <italic>in vitro</italic> activating effect of ASP on GLUT4 translocation in adipocyte and muscle cells [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] could explain the increase in muscle and adipose tissue glucose uptake, while passive concentration-dependent uptake in the liver, relying mostly on GLUT2 transporters, would indirectly be lowered. </p><p>Our study, while demonstrating intriguing novel properties of ASP, is also consistent with previously published results. Chronic ASP supplementation decreased plasma NEFA, as in the present study [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. An acute ASP bolus, on the other hand, has been shown to increase glucose excursion following a fat load [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], while C5L2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (ASP receptor) deficient mice showed delayed glucose clearance [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, the potential chemoattractive role proposed for ASP [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] has been demonstrated specifically in this study. He et al. also showed that high levels of ASP increased TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL-6 liver expression [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We demonstrate here that this phenotype is also present in other tissues as well as in the circulation and extends to other major cytokines. By contrast, leptin levels were acutely decreased by ASP bolus. This effect could be potentially linked with the reduction of insulin secretion, a well-known stimulator of leptin release.</p><p>Inflammation and macrophage recruitment are inherent components of several biological systems related to tissue injury and infections and are beneficial in the short term. At the same time, the capacity of immune cells to exert their respective functions is modulated by their metabolic status. To label ASP acute effects as deleterious because of the proinflammatory capacities is likely an oversimplification of a potentially complex process. Certain cytokines exhibit both proinflammatory and glucose-sensitizing effects, while others have dual roles (that are either concentration dependent or time dependent) in immunity. Adiponectin is a well-known adipokine that improves insulin sensitivity but has been shown to exert both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory effects, depending on the context [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. IL-6 is another prime example of a cytokine with paradoxical effects; IL-6 increases glucose excursion through a short-term insulin-sensitizing process in spite of its role in inflammation [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Long-term exposure to IL-6 may then, paradoxically, induce insulin resistance [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. </p><p>Humans with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have been shown to exhibit higher chronic plasma ASP levels [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These morbidities are associated with macrophage infiltration and M1 polarization within several tissues. However, even in the absence of chronically increased ASP, adipose tissue acutely increases local ASP production postprandially [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, the response to an acute increase versus chronically elevated levels may differ and may depend on the concomitant diet (such as high-fat and high-sucrose diet). While it has been suggested that C3adesArg is simply an inactive immune by-product representative of complement activation, we clearly demonstrate in this study a direct role of ASP within these inflammatory processes. The relative contribution of acute ASP-stimulated inflammation in obesity-related diseases remains to be investigated. As with several signaling pathways in obesity, it could be that chronic substrate overload leads to excessive activation of the ASP signaling pathway, eliciting a deleterious response that could exacerbate the development of comorbidities through a low-grade proinflammatory phenotype transition [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>The present study sheds new light on the dual role of ASP in energy metabolism and inflammation. ASP exhibits both substrate storage and proinflammatory properties that have been strongly associated with several pathologies. Effectively, neutralizing a hormone that can be both produced locally and acts locally represents a strong pharmaceutical challenge. A TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> inhibitor, for example, failed at altering insulin sensitivity in a human cohort [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Additional studies on C5L2, the only known receptor for ASP, are needed to better understand ASP-C5L2 signal transduction and to assess the potential of C5L2 as a pharmaceutical target in obesity and metabolic syndrome.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The authors have no conflict of interests to declare.</p></ack><ack><title>Author's Contribution</title><p>A.
