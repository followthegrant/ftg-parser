The photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX is metabolized from 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) intracellularly, and PDD/PDT using 5-ALA have been approved in dermatologic malignancies and gliomas. However, the molecular mechanism that defines the efficacy of PDD/PDT is unknown. In this study, we analyzed the functions of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in PDD using 5-ALA. Most of the human gastrointestinal cancer line cells examined showed a homogenous staining pattern with 5-ALA, except for the pancreatic cancer line PANC-1, which showed heterogeneous staining. To analyze this heterogeneous staining pattern, single cell clones were established from PANC-1 cells and the expression of ABC transporters was assessed. Among the ABC transporter genes examined, <italic>ABCG2</italic> showed an inverse correlation with the rate of 5-ALA-positive staining. PANC-1 clone #2 cells showed the highest level of <italic>ABCG2</italic> expression and the lowest level of 5-ALA staining, with only a 0.6% positive rate. Knockdown of the <italic>ABCG2</italic> gene by small interfering RNAs increased the positive rate of 5-ALA staining in PANC-1 wild-type and clone cells. Interestingly, PANC-1 clone #2 cells showed the high sphere-forming ability and tumor-formation ability, indicating that the cells contained high numbers of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Knockdown or inhibition of <italic>ABCG2</italic> increased the rate of 5-ALA staining, but did not decrease sphere-forming ability. These results indicate that gastrointestinal cancer cell lines expressing high levels of ABCG2 are enriched with CSCs and show low rates of 5-ALA staining, but 5-ALA staining rates can be improved by inhibition of ABCG2.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>KAKENHI</institution></funding-source><award-id>15H04722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawai</surname><given-names>Noriko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>KAKENHI</institution></funding-source><award-id>17H01540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torigoe</surname><given-names>Toshihiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16cm0106309h0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torigoe</surname><given-names>Toshihiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by KAKENHI (15H04722 and 17H01540) (to Y.H. and T.T.) and the project for the Development of Innovative Research on Cancer Therapeutics from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (16cm0106309h0001) (to T.T.).

Recently, PDD and PDT with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) have been used for the diagnosis of glioma [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the application of PDD/PDT is expanding to various cancers. PDD is an especially useful approach for intraoperative cancer diagnosis, such as gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer, and can detect intraperitoneal lymph node metastasis or peritoneal metastasis because the presence of peritoneal dissemination or distant lymph node metastasis is critical for the surgical approach used, and the accessibility of pathological diagnosis using frozen sections is often limited.</p><p>The detection rate of PDD is essential for its successful application; however, its sensitivity is varied in various cancers and its detection rate is sometimes low and not satisfactory [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, the identification of novel biomarkers for PDD and the improvement of the success rate of PDT are important. 5-ALA is transported into the cytoplasm by the amino acid transporters PEPT1 and PEPT2, and the intermediate coproporphyrinogen III is synthesized. Coproporphyrinogen III is transported from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB6. In the mitochondria, the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is synthesized from coproporphyrinogen III. PpIX is exported by ABCG2 from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm and from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, several molecules are involved in the accumulation of PpIX, and several approaches have been tried to improve the efficacy of 5-ALA PDD/PDT [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216503.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that 5-ALA PDD is useful for the detection of lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination, indicating that this approach can be a powerful tool during surgical treatment [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216503.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are defined as small subpopulation of cancer cells that are endowed with high tumorigenicity, capacity for self-renewal, and differentiation ability [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and CSCs are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to several molecular mechanisms, namely, high expression of anti-apoptosis proteins, dormant state, and high expression of transporters [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216503.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, an effective treatment for CSCs is essential to improve current cancer therapy.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the efficacy of 5-ALA PDD using gastrointestinal cancer cell lines. We found that the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 showed lower PpIX accumulation than the other cell lines examined. Analysis at clone level revealed that high ABCG2 expression was responsible for the lower accumulation of PpIX. Furthermore, ABCG2-high clone cells were enriched with CSCs, and inhibition of ABCG2 improved 5-ALA PDD. Thus, ABCG2 might be a novel target to improve the detection and therapeutic efficacy of 5-ALA PDD/PDT for CSCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Mice were maintained and experimented on in accordance with the guidelines of and after approval by the Committee of Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Animal Experimentation Center under permit number (08&#x02013;006).

A phase III clinical trial of surgery with 5-ALA PDD for malignant gliomas revealed that it significantly improved progression-free survival [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], indicating that 5-ALA PDD is an effective approach for the diagnosis of malignant tumors. However, most of the patients enrolled in that study showed disease progression, demonstrating that detection efficacy needs to be improved. In this regard, several analyses at the molecular level have been reported.</p><p>ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP) transports various endogenous and exogenous chemicals [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], thereby mediating drug resistance and affecting the pharmacological action of many compounds in different drug-resistant cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A study using diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells revealed that ABCG2 is a transcriptional target of the hedgehog signaling transcription factor GLI1 [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is one of the major signaling pathway activated in pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A phase Ib/II clinical trial using Vismodegib, an SHH inhibitor, plus gemcitabine did not improve progression-free or overall survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], suggesting difficulties in targeting SHH signaling. Regarding hedgehog signaling, a study using PANC-1 cells revealed that sphere-forming CSCs showed high expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factor SNAI1 and hedgehog signaling ligand SMO [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], indicating that the activation of SHH signaling, CSC phenotype, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition are deeply related to each other. In the present study, ABCG2-high PANC-1 clone #2 cells showed high sphere-forming ability compared with ABCG2-low clone #4 cells. Therefore, ABCG2-high pancreatic CSCs might be well targeted by 5-ALA PDT using an ABCG2 inhibitor, and this approach could be another way to target SHH signaling-activated pancreatic cancer cells. ABCG2 knockdown using siRNAs increased accumulation of PpIX, however, the PpIX positive rate did not reached 100% even in clone #4 cells. PANC-1 cells express both ABCB6 and ABCG2, however the expression levels of PEPT1 and PEPT2 were very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216503.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Therefore, the accumulation rates of PpIX in PANC-1 clone cells might also depend on also low expressions of PEPT1 and PEPT2. A recent study revealed that C6 rat glioma cells with low PpIX accumulation are enriched with glioma stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Interestingly, the accumulation of PpIX in glioma stem cells was not enhanced by ABCG2 inhibition using reserpine, but was enhanced by deferoxamine-mediated iron chelation, suggesting that PpIX accumulation depends on several factors.</p><p>ABCB6 is a transporter for the uptake of 5-ALA, and high ABCB6 expression is related to high PpIX accumulation [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. High ABCB6 expression is related to the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer and the progression of prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0216503.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216503.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although, the molecular mechanisms by which ABCB6 expression is related to chemotherapy resistance or cancer progression are unknown, ABCB6-high malignant cancers are considered to be suitable targets for 5-ALA PDD/PDT because ABCB6-high cancer cells are thought to accumulate PpIX. However, the expression levels of ABCB6 were equivalent between PANC-1 W/T cells and clone cells by RT-PCR, and ABCB6 expression might not be related to PpIX accumulation in pancreatic cancer cells. These results suggest that ABCB6 expression might not be an accurate marker for predicting the efficacy of 5-ALA PDD/PDT in pancreatic cancer. The accumulation of data using clinical samples from subjects with pancreatic cancer should be conducted in the future.</p><p>In summary, we reported that most of the gastrointestinal cancer cell lines examined showed homogenous 5-ALA staining. However, the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 showed heterogeneous 5-ALA staining. High ABCG2 expression might be responsible for low 5-ALA staining, and CSCs are enriched in the ABCG2-high population. Inhibition of ABCG2 improved 5-ALA staining, but had no effect on cancer stemness. These results indicate that ABCG2 expression might become a novel biomarker for poor 5-ALA PDD/PDT efficacy, and the combination of 5-ALA PDD/PDT with an ABCG2 inhibitor might improve efficacy. Finally, CSCs could also be targeted by the combination of 5-ALA PDD/PDT with an ABCG2 inhibitor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0216503.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Information of RT-PCR primers.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0216503.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank J.
