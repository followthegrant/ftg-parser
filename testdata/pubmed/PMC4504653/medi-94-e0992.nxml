This wide range of SB occlusion rate can be attributable to the difference of reference vessel diameter of SB in these studies. Smaller reference vessel diameter was an independent predictor of SB occlusion reported in the previous study.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In our study, the mean reference vessel diameter of SB was 1.72&#x0200a;mm, which was smaller than the study of Hahn et al<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (SB occlusion rate: 8.4%) and larger than the studies by Kralev et al<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> (SB occlusion rate: 12.5%) and Aliabadi et al<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> (SB occlusion rate: 19%). The rate of SB occlusion increases as the reference vessel diameter of SB becomes smaller.</p><p>Identifying the predictors of SB occlusion could help interventional cardiologists to avoid abrupt closure of SB. In our study, several independent predictors have been disclosed by multivariable analyses. Among them, irregular plaque and true bifurcation lesion have been reported as independent predictors of SB occlusion.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Previous studies have found that irregular plaque was linked to occlusive coronary artery thrombosis at sites of plaque fissure, rupture, or superficial erosion, which are largely involved in the pathogenesis of such acute events.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Plaque surface morphology on coronary angiography can be a highly sensitive marker of plaque instability. The instability of irregular plaque may contribute to the SB occlusion. Preprocedural SB TIMI flow grade are index indicating the baseline coronary blood flow. Arteries with lower TIMI flow grade are easier to have SB occlusion. Diameter ratio between MV and SB was also an important predictor, which was concordant with the results of the previous study.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Diameter ratio between MV and SB reflects the relative plaque volume of MV. Larger diameter ratio between MV and SB indicates relatively larger plaque burden to SB. Preprocedural diameter stenosis of distal MV, preprocedural diameter stenosis of bifurcation core, diameter stenosis of SB before MV stenting, and MV lesion length were also indexes reflecting the plaque volume and risk of SB occlusion. SB predilation was an effective way to decrease the stenosis of SB ostium and thus decrease the risk of SB occlusion.</p><p>The effect of bifurcation angle on the rate of SB occlusion during PCI is controversial. Previous studies have reported that smaller angle in coronary bifurcations predicted higher SB compromise, restenosis, and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) rates based on small sample size.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In addition, Yoshitaka Goto et al<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> reported that bifurcation angle was not associated with SB compromise after MV stenting. On the other hand, Dzavik et al<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> found that bifurcation angle &#x0003e;50&#x000b0; is an independent predictor of MACE after bifurcation crush stenting. In our study, a wide bifurcation angle predicted SB occlusion after MV stenting. Part of the explanation was that bifurcations with smaller bifurcation angle was easier for flow diversion into SB and too large bifurcation angle might increase the pressure drop and flow resistance,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> thus increasing the SB occlusion risk. Another potential explanation was that increasing bifurcation angle decreased wall shear stress and increases oscillatory shear index significantly around the carina,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> which might induce plaque proliferation at the bifurcation region.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Higher plaque volume in bifurcation core may contribute to the higher SB occlusion risk.</p><p>Small SBs occlusion was thought to be well tolerated.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In our study, both the rate of PMI and periprocedural MI were significantly higher in SB occlusion group than no SB occlusion group. CK-MB levels were significantly higher after stenting in patients with SB occlusion than in patients without SB occlusion. Previous studies have reported that even a small increase in CK-MB levels after PCI is associated with significantly higher risk of late mortality.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> However, the present study showed no significant differences in clinical outcome during the 12-month follow-up. The low residual SYNTAX score in both the groups (3.5&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;5.3 in no SB occlusion group vs 4.2&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6.0 in SB occlusion group, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.29) may explain the low incidence of MACEs. Greater sample sizes and a longer follow-up period are required to fully determine the effect of small SB occlusion on clinical outcome.</p><p>Prevention of SB occlusion may be useful for avoiding PMI. Identifying the predictors of small SB occlusion could help to prevent SB occlusion. For small SBs with high occlusion risk, jailed-balloon technique is recommended in consideration of that this technique was associated with lower rates of SB loss and a high procedural success rate.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, the mean reference of SB was 1.7&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;0.2&#x0200a;mm in the present study and not all SBs were suitable for jailed-balloon technique. Thus, other approaches for preventing PMI were also needed. Previous studies have reported that a single high loading dose of atorvastatin or clopidogrel could reduce the incidence of PMI in elective PCI.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Other novel approaches such as intravenous vitamin C infusion, trimetazidine intake before elective PCI, and lower inflation maximal pressure were also considered to be associated with less PMI.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>Compared with the previous studies,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> the strength of our study is that the present large-scale study has included all the clinical, angiographic, and procedural factors, as well as other innovative parameters such as diameter ratio between MV and SB, which is significantly predictive of SB occlusion. Another strength of our study is that the study was conducted in a consecutive cohort of bifurcation patients, which could reflect the real-world clinical practice. In addition, not only the baseline but also the procedural angiography is analyzed in the present study, risk factors in procedural cineangiograms such as diameter stenosis of SB before MV stenting were reported to be independent predictors of small SB occlusion for the first time. Last, but not least, the bifurcation core is the area most adjacent to SB and as such a smaller diameter stenosis could be a correlate of plaque shift during MV PCI. The present study performed QCA analysis with the use of a computer-based system dedicated to bifurcation analysis, thus bifurcation core is involved as a novel and important parameter in QCA analysis. Preprocedural diameter stenosis of bifurcation core is found to be an independent risk factor of small SB occlusion. We have brought this vital definition, bifurcation core, to the forefront.</p><sec><title>Study Limitation</title><p>First, our study is limited by the retrospective single-center design and unknown confounding factors cannot be excluded. Second, selection of treatment strategies, stent types, and other instruments were at the discretion of operators. Our findings are subject to selection bias and compounded with unmeasured variables. Third, this study principally included patients with coronary bifurcation disease that is defined by European Bifurcation Club and excluded patients with bifurcation lesions with SB &#x0003e;2&#x0200a;mm in diameter. The incidence and predictors of SB occlusion would be expected to be different in larger SB. Last, because of the sample size, follow-up period, and low residual SYNTAX score, the incidence of MACE is low and further analysis of clinical outcomes is not available. Greater sample sizes and a longer follow-up period are required in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>After MV stenting in coronary bifurcation intervention, 9.1% SB with reference vessel diameter &#x02264;2&#x0200a;mm occluded. True bifurcation lesion, irregular plaque, predilation in SB, preprocedural SB TIMI flow grade, preprocedural diameter stenosis of distal MV, preprocedural diameter stenosis of bifurcation core, bifurcation angle, diameter ratio between MV and SB, diameter stenosis of SB before MV stenting, and MV lesion length are independent predictors of small SB occlusion. Patients with small SB occlusion had significant higher incidence of PMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to the staff in the Department of Cardiology and Catheterization Laboratory at Fuwai Hospital.
