In the present study, the spatial-cognitive importance of aCC and DMS was assessed in the hidden-platform version of the Morris water maze (MWM). Brain lesion experiments that focused on areas of connectivity between these regions indicated their involvement in spatial cognition. MWM learning curves were markedly delayed in DMS-lesioned mice in the absence of other major functional impairments, whereas there was a more subtle, but still significant influence of aCC lesions. Lesioned mice displayed impaired abilities to use spatial search strategies, increased thigmotaxic swimming, and decreased searching in the proximity of the escape platform. Additionally, aCC and DMS activity was compared in mice between the early acquisition phase (2 and 3 days of training) and the over-trained high-proficiency phase (after 30 days of training). Neuroplasticity-related expression of the immediate early gene <italic>Arc</italic> implicated both regions during the goal-directed, early phases of spatial learning. These results suggest the functional involvement of aCC and DMS in processes of spatial cognition that model associative cortex-dependent, human episodic memory abilities.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by an interdisciplinary research grant from the University of Leuven&#x02014;Research Council (IDO/06/004, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://admin.kuleuven.be/raden/en/research-council">https://admin.kuleuven.be/raden/en/research-council</ext-link>) and a GOA research program (to L.A. and R.D.).

The task requires rodents to associate a configuration of distal environmental cues with the position of a hidden escape platform [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. During training, the animals gradually learn to swim away from the walls, and adopt more proficient search strategies [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They usually progress from non-spatial or repetitive strategies to cognitively demanding, but more efficient, spatial strategies [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Apart from the established hippocampal dependence of this task, striatal and prefrontal telencephalic regions have been implicated in MWM learning as well, although their involvement in the spatial-cognitive aspects of the task is still debated [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Both neural activation and lesion studies have shown that dorsal striatum, and more specifically its medial part, is crucial during the early phase of MWM training. Woolley and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported increased activation of dorsomedial striatum (DMS) in mice during the first three days of training, and lesion studies showed that rats with DMS damage needed more time to acquire the hidden platform position [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Impaired performance in these animals might be, at least partly, attributed to disinclination or inability to acquire spatial search strategies. Increased tendency to keep on swimming along the wall of the pool (thigmotaxis) was indeed reported in rats with striatal lesions [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], rats with striatal dopamine depletion [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], PDE10A knockout mice with altered medium spiny neuron activity [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and parkin-deficient mice [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>There are indications that DMS interacts with other telencephalic structures to control spatial-cognitive functions. Notably, DMS is innervated by neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), most prominently those in anterior cingulate cortex (aCC), as part of a distinct corticostriatal network [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Studies about aCC involvement in spatial learning and memory found that this brain region may play a role in storage and retrieval of remote memories (appr. 30 days after encoding) [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but not in the acquisition of spatial information as aCC lesions failed to impair place learning [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, reports failed to compare the involvement of mPFC and DMS in MWM learning [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A more recent study of Woolley and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported that mPFC was activated in the mouse brain during early MWM place learning (the first 3 days of training), but not during late place learning. This early mPFC activation coincided with DMS activation, which definitely supports the involvement of the corticostriatal circuit in rodent and human spatial learning [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we used complementary techniques to examine further the spatial-cognitive importance of aCC and DMS. In experiment 1, we compared the different effects of aCC and DMS lesions on specific, previously unexamined spatial-cognitive parameters, since lesion techniques remain the most established way to study regional brain function in mice [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In view of previous studies, DMS damage might impair MWM performance more profoundly than aCC lesions. Detailed analysis of the swimming paths allowed us to compare the involvement of each brain region in the use of cognitively demanding spatial search strategies. However, lesion studies are often confounded by functional compensation by other brain areas. In experiment 2, we therefore determined the involvement of these brain areas during early and late learning by visualizing regional expression of a known plasticity marker. Immediate early genes (IEG), in general, and particularly <italic>Arc</italic> (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; also known as Arg 3.1 [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]), are considered valid imaging tools to examine the neural substrate of learning and memory [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

To define the time dependence of this involvement, we compared regional activation between mice following short (2 days and 3 days, acquisition phase) and extended (30 days, overtrained phase) training. Quantified regional expression of <italic>Arc</italic> will be a read-out for neuroplasticity-related brain activation. More specifically, we used learning-dependent changes in <italic>Arc</italic> expression to visualize aCC and DMS involvement during MWM learning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>Female C57BL/6J mice, 8 weeks of age, were purchased from Janvier Labs (Le-Genest-Saint-Isle, France) and group housed (6&#x02013;9 mice per cage; cage dimensions: 46 cm x 27 cm floor, 23 cm high).

The maze consisted of a circular pool (150 cm diameter, 33 cm high), which was filled with opaque water (25 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C) to a depth of 16 cm, and an escape platform (15 cm diameter, 15 cm high) hidden 1 cm below the water surface in the middle of a fixed quadrant. The pool was situated in a room enriched with distal visual cues. Each trial began at one of four randomized starting locations by placing the mouse at the edge of the pool facing its centre. During trials, the experimenter remained seated at a fixed location. When a trial was not completed within 2 min, the mouse was guided to the platform and remained there for 15s. A training session consisted of four swimming trials during which the animal needed to find the position of the hidden platform. Trials in each session were separated by a 15-min break, and when two sessions were performed on a single day they were separated by 2h. Five consecutive training days were followed by 2 resting days. MWM navigation was recorded using Ethovision video tracking equipment and software (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Experiment 1: Effects of aCC and DMS lesions on MWM learning</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Brain lesion procedure</title><p>Animals used in the lesion experiments (n = 34) were randomly assigned to one of the experimental groups: aCC lesions (n = 11), DMS lesions (n = 11), and a sham control group (aCC sham, n = 6; DMS sham, n = 6). Mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 5% chloral hydrate (1% of body weight) and positioned on a stereotaxic frame (Narishige scientific instruments, Tokyo, Japan). Corneal drying was prevented by ophthalmic ointment and 0.05 ml lidocaine (20 mg/ml) was injected subcutaneously before making an incision in the skin above the skull. Next, holes were drilled into the skull and bilateral electrolytic lesions were produced by applying direct current (0,5 mA for 30 s) through a tungsten-coated 0.2 mm needle (Teflon insulated Tungsten wire, advent research materials, Oxford, UK). Sham animals were submitted to the same surgical procedure but no current was delivered after placement of the electrode. Coordinates relative to Bregma were: (1) aCC, +1.0 mm anteroposterior (AP), &#x000b1;0.2 mm mediolateral (ML), -1.5 mm dorsoventral (DV); (2) DMS, +0.2 and +1.2 mm AP, &#x000b1;1.5 mm ML, -2.5 and -3.0 mm DV [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Post-surgery, each animal was treated with 5% glucose saline (10% of body weight) and placed on a heat pad in the recovery cage. Paracetamol (30 mg/ml) was administered in drinking water 24-h pre- and post-surgery.

The animal was placed at the centre of three enclosed arms (30 cm long x 6 cm wide x 31 cm high) and was allowed to freely explore the arms during 10 min. Alternation behaviour was confirmed as soon as the mouse entered three different arms consecutively. The percentage of spontaneous alternations (%SA) was calculated by the formula [(sum alterations / sum arm entries&#x02013; 2) x 100] [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and the number of total arm entries was considered to reflect spontaneous locomotor activity [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Morris water maze training</title><p>DMS-, aCC-, and sham-lesioned mice received a total 15 days of training. Overall task performance was evaluated by calculating the time required to find the hidden platform (latency in s), average distance between the mouse and the hidden platform (mean distance to platform, cm), swimming speed (velocity, cm/s) and time spent in the 15% outer rim of the pool (thigmotaxis, %). Swimming trials were further categorized into differential search strategies according to previously described methods (see [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] for a detailed description). Briefly, three different categories of search strategy were identified ranging from proper spatial strategies (i.e., swimming directly to the platform or with one small explorative loop) to strategies that involved systematic scanning of the pool without relying on spatial information (i.e., non-spatial strategies), or those that merely consisted of repetitive looping (i.e. swimming in tight circles). Probe trials were performed after each 5 days of training (i.e. probe 1 was performed on day 6, probe 2 on day 11 and probe 3 on day 16, before continuing acquisition training) to determine whether mice actually showed a preference for the platform area as a demonstration of spatial memory. During these trials, the platform was removed from the pool, animals were allowed to swim freely during 100 s, and time spent in each quadrant was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All behavioural data are presented as means with standard error of the mean (SEM).

More specifically, DMS-lesioned animals primarily relied on peripheral looping strategies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0176295.t002">Table 2</xref>; 64%) on the first day of training and progressed to circling strategies after the first week of training (D5 = 39%; D10 = 51%; D15 = 53%).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0176295.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0176295.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Search strategies to locate the hidden platform.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0176295.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0176295.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Day of training</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Main search strategy</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesion group</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spatial</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aCC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn003">**</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn003">**</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DMS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sham</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn003">**</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">86<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn004">***</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-spatial</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aCC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DMS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn003">**</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sham</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn004">***</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Repetitive looping</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aCC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn004">***</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn003">**</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DMS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sham</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn004">***</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn004">***</xref></td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>The different search strategies over the trial blocks of day 5, 10 and 15 were categorized to one of the three main categories (spatial, non-spatial and repetitive looping) for each lesion group.

Although this test is mostly viewed as a hippocampus-dependent task [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], other telencephalic regions such as mPFC and dorsal striatum (part of a functional corticostriatal system) also appear to play a crucial, but less understood role in this type of learning [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To compare aCC and DMS involvement directly, we performed electrolytic lesions that selectively targeted these brain regions, and demonstrated that DMS lesions severely impaired MWM performance. DMS-lesioned animals displayed impaired learning, increased thigmotaxis, and decreased search precision. Also, these animals failed to show preference for the target quadrant relative to the other quadrants during the probe trials.</p><p>Even though dorsal striatum has been classically related to motor control [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], it seems unlikely that the effects of DMS lesions observed here were essentially caused by sensorimotor impairment. Firstly, several studies reported that sensorimotor functions were affected by lesions in dorsolateral striatum (DLS), rather than DMS [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that DMS lesions did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity as measured in the Y-maze, nor affected motor coordination and equilibrium in the rotarod task. They even showed a tendency to stay longer on the rotating rod compared to sham controls. Moreover, there was no difference in swimming speed in DMS-lesioned mice during the first day of MWM training. Reduced swimming speed at a later phase might have resulted from their inability to find the platform, and ensuing extinction of active escape strategies.</p><p>In accordance with our previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], animals with DMS lesions showed increased thigmotaxis and more dispersed searching for the hidden platform. Devan and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] also reported thigmotaxis in rats, but only during early trials, whereas Lee and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] failed to find thigmotaxic swimming in mice. We, on the other hand, observed thigmotaxis during the entire course of training, possibly due to the fact that, in our study, the medial part of the striatum was specifically targeted. Thigmotaxis has been implicated as a symptom of altered search strategy and impaired goal-directed learning [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Indeed, our search strategy analyses confirm that DMS-lesioned mice were unable to employ goal-directed learning strategies, and relied predominantly on repetitive looping instead of spatial searching. Consequently, these animals failed to display preference for the platform position during the probe trials, even after 15 days of training.</p><p>On the other hand, aCC damage affected spatial cognition more subtly, but notwithstanding conflicting literature reports, we observed significantly impaired spatial cognition in aCC-lesioned mice using detailed behavioural analysis of MWM performance. We observed slightly slower learning curves, increased thigmotaxis, and decreased search precision in this group compared to controls. Search strategy analyses were consistently inflexible and erratic deployment of goal-directed spatial search strategies in these mice. Whilst sham controls flexibly switched between the different strategies, aCC animals preferred more repetitive strategies during early learning. Furthermore, although the aCC group showed a preference for spatial search strategies from the second week, they were less able than control animals to maintain stable use of these strategies. These detailed analyses qualify previous lesion studies that failed to report aCC involvement in spatial task acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We therefore conclude that both DMS and aCC lesions impair the cognitively demanding deployment of spatial search strategies, although to a different extent.</p><p>In addition, elevated <italic>Arc</italic> expression in both aCC and DMS during early MWM learning indicate that both brain regions are involved in goal-directed, early spatial learning. Anatomical connectivity between these regions has been established (Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, available: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org">http://connectivity.brain-map.org</ext-link>), whereas our present observations suggest that these brain regions also play a joint role in spatial cognition. Consistent with our observation that aCC lesions affect MWM learning in a different way from DMS lesions, studies using different methodology indicated that this involvement might in fact be functionally dissociated. Indeed, aCC has been suggested to have a more general, executive function and several studies implicated this brain structure in effort-based decision making [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. For example, it has been suggested that aCC controls cost-benefit decisions about the possible course of action. Consequently, Walton and Mars [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] observed a higher firing rate in aCC during actions that maximized overall reward gain by encoding a cumulative history of recent rewards. Such a function of aCC could definitely be convergent with our observations that aCC is important for deployment of efficient navigation strategies. During the early stages of spatial learning, mPFC areas such as aCC might be involved in cost-benefit choices between competing strategies. Spatial strategies are definitely the most cognitively effortful ones (high cost), but could deliver the most economical yield in terms of successful platform situation (high benefit), compared to strategies with lower success rates, which is also in accordance with the putative error prevention role of the aCC [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and the role of mPFC in task difficulty [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>The current study aimed to investigate the differential role of the anatomically connected aCC and DMS in early phases of learning and memory. Brain lesion experiments demonstrated impaired learning curves and inability to deploy spatial search strategies in mice with DMS damage in the absence of other major motor or working memory impairments, whereas aCC lesions had a more subtle effect. In addition, expression of the neuroplasticity-related, IEG <italic>Arc</italic> suggested the involvement of aCC and DMS in goal-directed, early phases of MWM learning. It must be noted that more studies are needed to further investigate the significance of aCC activation in relation to DMS. To determine if early spatial learning and memory depends on the integrity of circuits connecting aCC and DMS, one might investigate whether increased <italic>Arc</italic> expression in aCC is also observed in trained DMS-lesioned animals, or use disconnection lesions or reversible activation studies to disrupt communication between brain regions [<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0176295.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0176295.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Dataset.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0176295.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by an interdisciplinary research grant from the KU Leuven (IDO/06/004, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://admin.kuleuven.be/raden/en/research-council">https://admin.kuleuven.be/raden/en/research-council</ext-link>) and a GOA research program (to L.A. and R.D.).
