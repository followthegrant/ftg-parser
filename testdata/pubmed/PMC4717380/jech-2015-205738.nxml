Specifically, studies of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) point to reduced ACEI access related to female sex, old age and socioeconomic position. Thus far, most studies have either been rather small, lacking diagnostic data, or lacking the possibility to account for several individual-based sociodemographic factors. Our aim was to investigate differences, which could reflect inequity in access to ACEIs based on sex, age, socioeconomic status or immigration status in Swedish patients with HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Individually linked register data for all Swedish adults hospitalised for HF in 2005&#x02013;2010 (n=93&#x02005;258) were analysed by multivariate regression models to assess the independent risk of female sex, high age, low employment status, low income level, low educational level or foreign country of birth, associated with lack of an ACEI dispensation within 1 year of hospitalisation. Adjustment for possible confounding was made for age, comorbidity, Angiotensin receptor blocker therapy, period and follow-up time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Analysis revealed an adjusted OR for no ACEI dispensation for women of 1.31 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.35); for the oldest patients of 2.71 (95% CI 2.53 to 2.91); and for unemployed patients of 1.59 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.73).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Access to ACEI treatment was reduced in women, older patients and unemployed patients. We conclude that access to ACEIs is inequitable among Swedish patients with HF. Future studies should include clinical data, as well as mortality outcomes in different groups.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ACCESS TO HLTH CARE</kwd><kwd>GENDER</kwd><kwd>Health inequalities</kwd><kwd>Cardiovascular disease</kwd><kwd>SOCIO-ECONOMIC</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heart failure (HF) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Sweden, the prevalence of HF is around 2%, the incidence 3.8/1000 person-years, and the mortality rate 3.1/1000 person-years. Age-adjusted HF mortality is higher (HR=1.29) in men than in women.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Renin&#x02013;angiotensin system (RAS) blockade with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) reduces mortality and morbidity from HF with reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> In HF with preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF), the role of ACEIs is unclear.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> RAS blockade is a cornerstone in HF therapy, and ACEIs are recommended as base treatment in clinical guidelines worldwide. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are alternative RAS-blocking drugs in case of ACEI intolerance.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, not all patients with HF have access to RAS blockade. Prescription of ACEIs is 54&#x02013;62% in European surveys of pharmacotherapy in HF.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Similar results have been found in Sweden.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Low-socioeconomic position is a strong predictor for developing HF.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Furthermore, sex and age inequity in ACEI treatment of HF has been suggested.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> socioeconomically deprived persons<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and immigrants/ethnic minorities<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> are undertreated. These findings suggest inequity in HF treatment and access to ACEIs, based on sex, age, socioeconomic factors and immigration status.</p><p>The Swedish health and medical services act states that the goal for healthcare and medical services is good health and equal healthcare for all of the population. Hence, investigating the attainment of this goal is warranted to enhance every patient's access to the best available medical care.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no previous study of ACEI access in HF had the combined advantages of total national coverage of HF hospitalisations, individual-level sociodemographic data, ARB use and comorbidities. This study aimed to investigate differences in access to ACEIs based on sex, age, socioeconomic status or immigration status in Swedish adults hospitalised for HF during 2005&#x02013;2010. We hypothesised that female sex, old age, foreign country of birth, low education, unemployment or low income is associated with a risk of not being dispensed ACEI within 1&#x02005;year of being hospitalised for HF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>Data from registers at the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and Statistics Sweden were linked by personal identifiers. The Swedish National Patient Register (NPR)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> contains individual data for all inpatient hospital discharges in Sweden since 1987.

More than 99% of hospital stays are registered, and the overall validity is 85&#x02013;95%.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The validity for HF diagnosis is 95% when registered as primary diagnosis.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> holds records of all dispensed drugs in Sweden since 1999, and since July 2005 with personal identifiers. For drug dispensations, the registration is complete (although demographic data are missing in 0.02&#x02013;0.6% of cases). The register has been described previously.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies (LISA by Swedish acronym)<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> combines information from several sociodemographic population registers. Variables include country of birth, educational level, occupational status and income level. All Swedish citizens older than 16&#x02005;years residing in Sweden on 31 December are registered yearly.

Significant associations were included in stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis to further assess the relation between sociodemographic covariates and dispensation of an ACEI. Adjustment was made for possible confounding (ie, ARB dispensation, year and follow-up time). The dependent (outcome) variable was &#x02018;lack of ACEI dispensation at least one time within 1&#x02005;year of the index date&#x02019;. Explanatory covariates were sex, country/region of birth, age class, educational level, employment status and income class. The significance level was set at p&#x0003c;0.05. The first model produced crude ORs for the effect on ACEI dispensation of all of the hypothesised explanatory covariates separately (model 1). The second model was adjusted for age (model 2). In model 3, age, comorbidity, ARB use, year and follow-up time were added. Finally, all confounding and explanatory covariates were entered in model 4. An age-stratified multivariable logistic regression was also performed, with adjustment for comorbidity, ARB use, year and follow-up time. The explanatory covariates entered were: sex, country/region of birth, educational level, employment status and income class.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study conforms to the Helsinki declaration.

In 2012, 69% of patients with HF-PEF and 87% of those with HF-REF had RAS-blocking treatment. These findings indicate that RAS blockade treatment for HF-REF has improved, whereas it is still less used for HF-PEF, which may reflect the lack of evidence and guidelines regarding ACEIs in HF-PEF.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Equity</title><p>Equity in health and healthcare has been systematically studied since the 1980s.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

It appears as though the farther away from gainful employment, the greater the risk was for under-treatment, as reflected in the lower OR for sporadically employed versus unemployed patients. Although retirement pensioners can be assumed to fall into the unemployed group, there was still a unique effect of unemployment after age adjustment in the multivariate analysis. Additionally, the disadvantage of a lower employment grade was similar in the subgroup analysis of patients of working age. An interesting finding is that age-stratified analysis showed a negative effect (even stronger than in the younger stratum) of unemployment even in the age classes where a larger proportion would not be continuously employed. Conversely, this might be interpreted as a positive effect of some kind of employment, at a higher age, on access to ACEIs.</p><p>These findings are relevant because few studies have investigated ACEI access and socioeconomic status. One previous investigation in the UK found that ACEIs are more rare in socioeconomically deprived living areas.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>There was no negative effect on ACEI dispensation of educational level or income class in the adjusted models. The meaning of this finding is unclear, but one interpretation is that the social consequences of unemployment are more important in access to healthcare than are material resources or ability to access and understand medical information.</p></sec><sec id="s4b2"><title>Sex</title><p>Female patients had a 30% higher risk of not being dispensed ACEIs (<xref rid="JECH2015205738TB3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>), in line with previous studies.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In the EuroHeart survey, women and older patients were less likely to receive ACEIs.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Additionally, in Swedish primary care, women with HF were prescribed less ACEIs than men.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A German HF study also disclosed a lower proportion of ACEIs provided to women than to men.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>A recent Swedish study found that women with ST-elevation MI (STEMI) had higher in-hospital mortality than men, and received less evidence-based therapies including ACEIs.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Unadjusted 1-year mortality was higher in women, but the sex difference was reversed when adjusting for differences in evidence-based treatment, indicating that this factor is important in early STEMI mortality.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Aggregated cross-sectional drug dispensation data also showed a relative risk of 0.7 for women to be dispensed ACEIs compared with men.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Many previous ACEI studies did not address ARB prescription as an explanation for women receiving less ACEIs than men. Women are more prone to adverse effects from ACEIs,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> so physicians may switch more women to treatment with ARBs, in accordance with guidelines. In our study, adjusting for ARB dispensation did not explain the sex difference, in accordance with a previous Swedish investigation.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>In the 20&#x02013;64-years subgroup analysis, women had an even higher risk compared with men of not being dispensed an ACEI (adjusted OR 1.73 (95% CI 1.55 to 1.93)). This finding is in line with a previous one that young females with STEMI fare worse than young men with respect to ACEI treatment and mortality.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This possibly reflects a failure to recognise and accurately treat heart disease in this patient group because of a belief that cardiovascular illness does not affect young women. In addition, women compared to the men in our study had in general lower employment grade, less education and less income, indicating that Swedish female patients with HF have an aggregation of negative socioeconomic circumstances.</p></sec><sec id="s4b3"><title>Country of birth</title><p>There was no disadvantage in ACEI access associated with country of birth. Our study may be underpowered for detecting such differences because groups of foreign-born patients were small. However, a Swedish study of patients with HF in 1994&#x02013;2003 also found treatment for foreign-born patients to be equitable.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In contrast, another investigation found less ACEI prescriptions after acute MI for foreign born than for Swedish patients.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Immigrants are assuredly not a homogeneous group. Any categorisation by country or region of birth will be somewhat inadequate in capturing common problems for &#x02018;immigrants&#x02019; in access to care or health. The risks of discrimination, as well as social segregation and socioeconomic challenges, vary between immigrant groups. A study by Hollander <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> concluded, for example, that cardiovascular mortality is higher among refugee versus non-refugee immigrants. Several other studies have demonstrated low access to healthcare for immigrants.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In our study, however, the inclusion criterion was that patients be hospitalised for HF, meaning that the foreign-born patients under study are a selection of immigrants who have already achieved some access to healthcare.</p></sec><sec id="s4b4"><title>Age</title><p>Age was a strong independent predictor for not being dispensed an ACEI in our study, (OR 2.71 (95% CI 2.53 to 2.91)). This is noteworthy, as ACEI treatment reduces HF symptoms, which benefits all patients, regardless of life expectancy. Adjusting for comorbidity did not eradicate the effect of age, which implies inequitable treatment of older patients, in accordance with previous investigations.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The individually linked register data in this study are vast and detailed. Consequently, this material permits multifaceted analyses of drug dispensation in relation to multiple sociodemographic factors. Several possible confounding factors were included in the analyses to minimise systematic errors. Furthermore, the inpatient register is nearly a total register with almost 100% of hospitalisations registered. This gives our study high power and excellent generalisability for hospitalised patients. Nonetheless, there are some potential methodological limitations to our study.</p><p>We could not identify whether patients had preserved or reduced ejection fraction because ICD codes do not distinguish between these two types of HF. Consequently, interpreting adherence to evidence-based, guideline-recommended therapy for HF-PEF is difficult as recommendations are not clear on this point. In addition, women more often than men have HF-PEF,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> which adds complexity. However, in the &#x02018;RiksSvikt&#x02019; report,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> even within the HF-PEF group, men receive RAS blockade to a higher extent than women. Furthermore, although more studies are required to confirm such a result, a mortality analysis of the &#x02018;RiksSvikt&#x02019; population showed significantly better survival for patients with HF-PEF with ACEI treatment than for those without ACEI treatment.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In summary, although our result that women received less ACEIs is difficult to interpret, there is still reason for concern that women, especially those &#x0003c;65&#x02005;years of age, may be undertreated.</p><p>The outcome being defined as a lack of an ACEI dispensation within 1&#x02005;year of hospitalisation could influence the interpretation of inequity in access to ACEI. Patients might die before having the chance to collect a prescribed ACEI, which is more likely to happen for the sickest and oldest patients. We have handled this risk by adjusting for comorbidities, as well as for days of follow-up in the regression models. Hence, we do not believe this substantially influenced our results.</p><p>Dispensation of a drug is a proxy for receiving a prescription. Different patient adherence could thus lead to bias in interpreting our results as inequitable treatment. However, non-adherence to a prescription may reflect inequality in healthcare based on patients&#x02019; capacity to receive and understand medical information, their motivation towards health, or financial and physical ability to acquire prescribed drugs. In our study, women generally had a lower income than men. According to the Swedish public health survey in 2013, 25% of women and 15% of men refrain from collecting prescribed drugs due to lack of money.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> It is thus possible that female, unemployed or old patients in our study were less adherent to prescribed ACEIs. Nonetheless, reduced access to RAS blockade for these patients is relevant from an equity view.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrated differences in ACEI treatment among Swedish patients hospitalised for HF. Access to ACEI treatment was reduced in women, and in patients of higher age and lower employment status. In contrast, there was no inequity based on country of birth, educational level or income. Although reasons for these differences in ACEI treatment are not completely elucidated, we conclude that ACEI access is inequitable among Swedish patients with HF.</p><p>The principal goal in the Swedish health and medical services act is to achieve good and equal healthcare for all Swedish citizens. To this end, mechanisms of inequity in health and healthcare need to be further investigated. In future studies, we plan to combine clinical data with our register data for more elaborate analyses, taking into account ejection fraction and actual prescribing. These studies should include mortality analysis in different patient groups with HF.
