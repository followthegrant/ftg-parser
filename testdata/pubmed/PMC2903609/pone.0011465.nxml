A second member of this family, Themis2 (<underline>Q91YX0</underline>), also known as ICB1 (Induced on contact with basement membrane 1), remains unreported at the protein level despite microarray and EST databases reporting Themis2 mRNA expression in B cells and macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here we characterise Themis2 protein for the first time and show that it acts as a macrophage signalling scaffold, exerting a receptor-, mediator- and signalling pathway-specific effect on TLR responses in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Themis2 over-expression enhanced the LPS-induced production of TNF but not IL-6 or Cox-2, nor TNF production induced by ligands for TLR2 (PAM3) or TLR3 (poly I&#x02236;C). Moreover, LPS-induced activation of the MAP kinases ERK and p38 was enhanced in cells over-expressing Themis2 whereas the activation of JNK, IRF3 or NF-&#x003ba;B p65, was unaffected. Depletion of Themis2 protein by RNA inteference inhibited LPS-induced TNF production in primary human macrophages demonstrating a requirement for Themis2 in this event. Themis2 was inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated upon LPS challenge and interacted with Lyn kinase (P25911), the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Vav (P27870), and the adaptor protein Grb2 (Q60631). Mutation of either tyrosine 660 or a proline-rich sequence (PPPRPPK) simultaneously interrupted this complex and reduced by approximately 50&#x00025; the capacity of Themis2 to promote LPS-induced TNF production. Finally, Themis2 protein expression was induced during macrophage development from murine bone marrow precursors and was regulated by inflammatory stimuli both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We hypothesise that Themis2 may constitute a novel, physiological control point in macrophage inflammatory responses.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macrophages by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) leads to the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators such as TNF, IL-6 and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (Cox2) which not only represent the acute response to infection or trauma but also shape pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses <xref rid="pone.0011465-Akira1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Many of the signalling components controlling these events are now well characterised and include: Toll-like and IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptors such as MyD88; the kinases IRAK 4 (IL-1 receptor associated kinase 4) and TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1); the p38, ERK and JNK MAP kinases; the IkB kinases and members of the AP1, NF-&#x003ba;B and IRF (interferon regulatory factor) families of transcription factors. Despite this, the search for novel TLR signalling components has continued <xref rid="pone.0011465-Hacker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> motivated in part by the fact that the above mentioned signalling components are common to multiple TLRs and so only partially explain the receptor specificity apparent in TLR responses <xref rid="pone.0011465-Amit1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Struck by recent data highlighting the role of tyrosine kinases <xref rid="pone.0011465-Horwood1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011465-Smolinska1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and tyrosine kinase substrates <xref rid="pone.0011465-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011465-Jefferies1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011465-Doyle1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> in TLR signalling we adopted a proteomic approach to recover tyrosine phosphoproteins as putative signalling components from a murine macrophage cell line <xref rid="pone.0011465-Peirce1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

The HPLC system was coupled to a linear ion trap-orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) via a nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon Biosystems) fitted with a 5 cm Picotip FS360-20-10 emitter. The spray voltage was set to 1.2 kV and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 200&#x000b0;C. Full scan MS survey spectra (m/z 350&#x02013;1800) in profile mode were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 after accumulation of 500,000 ions. The five most intense peptide ions were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation with multistage activation of the neutral loss of phosphoric acid from the parent ion (neutral loss masses&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;49, 32.33 and 24.5 for z&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2,3 and 4).

Precursor ion charge state screening was enabled and all unassigned charge states, as well as singly charged species, were rejected. The lock mass option was enabled for survey scans to improve mass accuracy. Data were acquired using LTQ-orbitrap 2.5.5 software and analysed using Xcalibur 2.0.7 software. Mascot generic files were created from the raw files using raw2msm (gift from M.

While Themis2 protein has not hitherto been reported Themis2 mRNA is expressed primarily in macrophages and B cells (BioGPS). In contrast Themis1 is predominantly expressed in T lymphocytes. Murine Themis1 and Themis2 share 29&#x00025; identity and 65&#x00025; homology at the amino acid level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011465.s002">Fig. S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Themis2 is tyrosine phosphorylated and interacts with Lyn kinase</title><p>Themis2 lacks any predicted enzymatic activity or protein interaction domains but, consistent with its identification in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of RAW macrophages <xref rid="pone.0011465-Peirce1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, it does contain a number of predicted sites of tyrosine phosphorylation (NetPhos 2.0). Most prominent among these is Y660, part of a YEEI motif, a putative peptide substrate for Src or Fes family kinases <xref rid="pone.0011465-Songyang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Indeed, Y660 was the only detectable site of inducible tyrosine phosphorylation in tandem mass spectrometric analyses of Flag-tagged Themis2 immunoprecipitated from stably transfected RAW cells stimulated with pervanadate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011465.s003">Fig. S2</xref>). To examine whether Themis2, like Themis1 in T cells <xref rid="pone.0011465-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, is inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated by physiological stimulation we challenged RAW cells with LPS, immunoprecipitated phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and blotted for endogenous Themis2. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g001">Figure 1a</xref>, LPS induced the time-dependent accumulation of phosphotyrosine on Themis2 without affecting the total levels of Themis2 protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011465.s004">Fig. S3</xref>). Once phosphorylated, the YEEI motif containing Y660 is predicted to bind to Src family kinase SH2 (Src homology 2) domains <xref rid="pone.0011465-Songyang2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This prompted us to examine whether Themis2 might interact with a member of the Src kinase family, particularly one, such as Lyn <xref rid="pone.0011465-Stefanova1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, previously linked to TLR4 signalling. Anti-Flag immunoprecipitates, from LPS-stimulated stable RAW cell transfectants expressing Flag-tagged Themis2, were blotted with either anti-Flag-HRP or anti-Lyn kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). LPS stimulation led to the co-immunoprecipitation of Lyn with Themis2 which increased up to 1 hour but returned to baseline by 2 hours, correlating closely with the time course of Themis2 tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011465.s004">Fig. S3</xref>). The time-dependent increase in the recovery of Lyn also initially correlated with increased expression of Flag-Themis2 upon LPS challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>). As discussed below, this we attributed this up-regulation to the LPS sensitivity of the CMV promoter in the Flag expression vector. However, compared to the 1 h time point, Lyn co-precipitation with Themis2 was lost by 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>) notwithstanding increased levels of Themis2 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>) suggesting that the interaction of Lyn with Themis2 may be regulated by LPS-stimulation. Confirming the fidelity of the Lyn/Themis2 interaction, Flag-tagged Themis2 was detectable in anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates of LPS-treated, but not resting, Flag-Themis2 expressing RAW cells, nor in Lyn immunoprecipitates of matched numbers of identically treated untransfected RAW cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0011465.s005">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0011465-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0011465.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Themis2 is inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated and interacts with Lyn kinase.</title><p>

Themis2 is a previously uncharacterised member of this family whose mRNA is selectively expressed in B cells and macrophages. The data presented here describe Themis2 protein for the first time and characterise its function in macrophages.</p><p>We demonstrate that Themis2 behaves as a regulator of TLR signalling with an unusually specific mode of action, controlling the generation of TNF induced by TLR4 engagement without affecting TNF generated in response to ligands for TLRs 2 or 3, nor the TLR4-dependent production of other inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 or Cox2. Such specificity is in marked contrast to the majority of known TLR signalling components which are common to multiple TLRs <xref rid="pone.0011465-Akira1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011465-Hacker1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The molecular basis of this specificity remains to be clarified but may be explained by its interaction with the RhoGEF Vav. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav, linked to activation of its RhoGEF activity <xref rid="pone.0011465-Crespo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, is induced following TLR4 engagement on RAW cells <xref rid="pone.0011465-English1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Moreover, contrary to the sharing of signalling components by different TLRs noted above, several RhoGEFs and members of the Rho/Rac family GTPases they regulate, have been shown to modulate TLR signalling in a receptor or mediator-selective manner. These include RhoA <xref rid="pone.0011465-Manukyan1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and the RhoGEFs Def6 <xref rid="pone.0011465-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, AKAP13 <xref rid="pone.0011465-Shibolet1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and Vav itself <xref rid="pone.0011465-Miletic1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Further supporting a role for Vav in the effects of Themis2, the deficits resulting from genetic deletion of all three Vav proteins strikingly mirror the events modulated by over-expression of Themis2. Thus, LPS-induced TNF responses are deficient in Vav null macrophages despite normal IL-6 and Cox2 production <xref rid="pone.0011465-Miletic1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This parallel extends to the signalling pathways affected: LPS-induced p38 and ERK MAP kinase activation are inhibited in Vav null macrophages while JNK and NF-&#x003ba;B responses are spared <xref rid="pone.0011465-Miletic1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Similarly, RAW cells over-expressing Themis2 exhibit enhanced LPS-induced p38 and ERK activation despite normal JNK responses and nuclear localisation of NF-&#x003ba;B and IRF3.</p><p>How might the noted effects on p38 and ERK signalling modulate TNF production? While the role of p38 and ERK in LPS-induced TNF expression is now well established they are believed regulate both overlapping and distinct elements of the process. ERK activation is associated with the regulation of TNF transcription, possibly via the phosphorylation of AP1 family members such as Egr1 <xref rid="pone.0011465-Guha1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011465-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that the up-regulation of transcription of the TNF-luciferase reporter by Themis2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g006">Fig. 6f</xref>) is causally linked to the up-regulation of LPS-induced ERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g004">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). p38 activation modulates TNF protein expression by regulating the expression and function of the ARE-binding protein Tristetraprolin (TTP) and thereby robustly enhancing the stability of TNF message <xref rid="pone.0011465-Brook1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011465-Brook2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011465-Hitti1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. However, ERK also regulates TTP protein stability <xref rid="pone.0011465-Brook2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and ERK and p38 activities can jointly regulate TNF mRNA stability <xref rid="pone.0011465-Rutault1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Therefore it is entirely possible that such post-transcriptional mechanisms also contribute to the observed effects of Themis2 on TNF protein expression. It will therefore be of interest, in future experiments, to examine whether Themis2 has any effect on TNF mRNA stability.</p><p>The correlation in the pathways and cytokines modulated by Vav deletion and Themis2 over-expression suggest that the functional impact of Themis2 on these events is mediated primarily through its interaction with Vav. The molecular basis of this interaction is now the focus of ongoing work in our laboratory. Vav contains an SH2 domain and two SH3 domains which could respectively mediate interaction through tyrosine phosphorylation of Themis2, for example at Y660, or through proline-rich sequences such as that common to both Themis1 and 2 (PPPRPPK). Our data suggest that the interaction with Vav is both constitutive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>) and independent of Y660 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>), arguing against an association mediated by the Vav SH2 domain and inducible tyrosine phosphorylation on Themis2. In addition, alanine point mutants of prolines 2 and 4 (indicated in bold face) of the P<bold>P</bold>PR<bold>P</bold>PK motif had no obvious effect on the Vav/Themis2 interaction despite inhibiting its interaction with Grb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>, discussed below) arguing against this motif as a Vav binding site. However, Themis2 contains a number of motifs conforming to the patterns (RxPxxP, PxxPxR or PxxP) reported for SH3 ligands, any one of which could mediate the interaction with Vav. Mutational analyses of these putative SH3-binding motifs, now underway in our laboratory, will help to define the site of interaction between Themis2 and Vav and address its functional significance.</p><p>While further study is required to clarify the role of Vav, our current data do support a role for other protein/protein interactions in Themis2 function. The Src family kinase Lyn appears to interact with Themis2 in a manner that correlates with the tyrosine phosphorylation of Themis2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>) and is at least partially dependent on Y660 since the interaction is lost in the Y660F Themis2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Using tandem mass spectrometry we directly demonstrated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Y660 in vivo, albeit using a robust chemical stimulus, pervanadate. The same phosphopeptide was not detectable in a similar study using Themis2 derived from LPS-treated RAW cells (data not shown), probably a reflection the lower stoichiometry achieved using a physiological stimulus. However, the fact that mutation of Y660 abolishes the LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Themis2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) strongly suggests that this site is indeed targeted during LPS signalling. Together, these data suggest a model in which LPS drives the tyrosine phosphorylation of Themis2 at Y660 which allows Lyn to bind via its SH2 domain. The functional importance of this interaction is supported by the observation that the ability of Themis2 to promote LPS-induced TNF production is significantly inhibited by mutation of Y660 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g006">Fig 6c</xref>). How might the loss of Lyn binding impact upon LPS signalling? As discussed above Vav is known to be a target of LPS-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0011465-English1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and this controls its RhoGEF activity <xref rid="pone.0011465-Crespo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Indeed, the Src family kinase Hck, a close relative of Lyn, is reported to phosphorylate Vav following LPS challenge of RAW macrophages <xref rid="pone.0011465-English1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. One possibility under active investigation is that by providing a platform on which both proteins are recruited, Themis2 might serve to facilitate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav by Lyn.</p><p>The data presented here also suggest that, as reported for its relative Themis1 <xref rid="pone.0011465-Lesourne1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011465-Patrick1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, Themis2 interacts with the adaptor protein Grb2. Our data are consistent with a role for the PPPRPPK motif in this interaction since mutation of prolines 2 and 4 in this sequence simultaneously inhibited interaction with Grb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>) and the ability of Themis2 to promote LPS-induced TNF release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g006">Fig. 6c</xref>). Together these data strongly suggest that the Themis2 protein complex defined here must be retained intact for optimal LPS-induced TNF release. The reported interaction between Grb2 and Themis1 <xref rid="pone.0011465-Lesourne1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> is proposed to involve both SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2. In this light it is notable that the Y660F mutation of Themis2 also appears to reduce its interaction with Grb2, although not to the extent of the 2PA proline mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011465-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). Thus, like the Themis1, the interaction between Themis2 and Grb2 may involve contributions from both proline-rich and phosphotyrosine ligands.</p><p>While little literature precedent exists describing a role for Grb2 in TLR signalling, the strategy of clustering together the same group of signalling proteins appears to have been adopted by at least one pathogen to subvert TLR signalling in B cells. The murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) protein, M2, interacts with Grb2 <xref rid="pone.0011465-Herskowitz1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, Vav, and the Src kinase Fyn <xref rid="pone.0011465-PiresdeMiranda1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Akin to the effects of Themis2 over-expression reported here, M2 augments the LPS-driven proliferation of B cells and selectively regulates the generation of some inflammatory mediators (e.g. IL-10) but not others (e.g. RANTES) <xref rid="pone.0011465-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. While MHV68 M2 and Themis2 share little amino acid sequence homology they both appear to function as scaffolds for assembling signalling complexes of Vav, Grb2 and members of the Src kinase family and seemingly share the capacity to modulate LPS responses and selectively modulate inducible cytokine production.</p><p>Just as Themis1 is required for the development of T cells so Themis2 is induced upon differentiation of macrophages from bone marrow precursors under the influence of M-CSF. It is also of interest that other modulators of macrophage phenotype regulate the level of Themis2 protein expression. We show that IFN&#x003b3;, a cytokine known to promote inflammatory macrophage responses including TNF production <xref rid="pone.0011465-Dunham1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, increases the expression of Themis2 protein whereas TGF&#x003b2; and dexamethasone, which inhibit LPS-induced TNF production <xref rid="pone.0011465-Dunham1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, reduce Themis2 levels. Since we also demonstrate that <italic>in vivo</italic> immune responses to both inflammatory (CIA) and infectious (influenza) disease are also associated with profound regulation of Themis2 protein levels it is tempting to speculate that Themis2 expression may represent an important physiological point of control by which macrophage inflammatory phenotype and function, and specifically the magnitude of TNF responses, may be dynamically regulated. The mechanisms by which Themis2 protein levels are regulated by inflammatory signals have yet to be investigated but it is worth noting that the 3&#x02032;UTR of Themis2 contains several AREs associated with the binding of proteins controlling mRNA stability <xref rid="pone.0011465-Dean1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Indeed one sequence, UUAUUUAUU, found in the Themis2 3&#x02032;UTR represents the cognate binding site for TTP <xref rid="pone.0011465-Blackshear1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, a post-transcriptional regulator induced by inflammatory stimuli and implicated in the control of the expression of multiple inflammatory genes <xref rid="pone.0011465-Sandler1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. It will also be informative to dissect the 5&#x02032; promoter region of Themis2 to define potential sites of transcriptional regulation.</p><p>In summary, we identify Themis2 as a novel macrophage signalling scaffold that selectively regulates TNF expression downstream of TLR4 and whose expression is itself regulated during macrophage differentiation and <italic>in vivo</italic> models of infectious and inflammatory disease. As such, Themis2 could represent a novel site at which therapies designed to intervene in chronic inflammatory diseases involving TNF, such as rheumatoid arthritis, might usefully be targeted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0011465.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Peptides defining Themis2 and Vav. <sup>a</sup> Mascot ion scores reflect the probability (p) of chance identification of the same peptide: scores&#x0003e;29 for the Themis2 search, or &#x0003e;30 for the Vav search, denote p&#x0003c;0.05. <sup>b</sup> Scaffold probability reflects the percentage confidence that each peptide sequence identified is a non-random event.
