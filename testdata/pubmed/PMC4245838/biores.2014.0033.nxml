The globular solution conformation of FN was retained following adsorption onto PMA, whereas spontaneous organization of FN into protein (nano) networks occurred on PEA. This distinct distribution of FN at the material interface promoted a different availability, measured via monoclonal antibody binding, of two domains that facilitated integrin binding to FN: FNIII<sub>10</sub> (RGD sequence) and FNIII<sub>9</sub> (PHSRN synergy sequence). The enhanced exposure of the synergy domain on PEA compared to PMA triggered different focal adhesion assemblies: L929 fibroblasts showed a higher fraction of smaller focal plaques on PMA (40%) than on PEA (20%). Blocking experiments with monoclonal antibodies against FNIII<sub>10</sub> (HFN7.1) and FNIII<sub>9</sub> (mAb1937) confirmed the ability of these polymeric substrates to modulate FN conformation.

This layer may also be intentionally deposited, for example, through adsorption of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, or via chemical attachment to the substrate.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;5</xref></sup> These proteins include fibronectin (FN), vitronectin, and fibrinogen, known as the soluble matrix proteins of biological fluids.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Cell adhesion is the first step in their response to a microenvironment, and plays a fundamental role in subsequent cell differentiation, growth, viability, and phenotypic response.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Therefore, controlling the cellular response through a robust material-based strategy is applicable for a myriad of applications in biomedical research, spanning from regenerative medicine to disease biology.</p><p>FN is a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein that is found in both soluble and insoluble forms in extracellular fluids and connective tissues, respectively.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref></sup> It is a main component of the ECM and therefore a likely protein candidate whose state can be tailored to target cell response. The FN molecule is a dimer of &#x0223c;440&#x02009;kDa, whose subunits contain three types of repeating units (FN repeats I, II, and III) that mediate interactions with other ECM proteins and cell surface receptors, and regulate FN-FN interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The RGD sequence, located in the FN repeat III<sub>10</sub>, is of key importance in controlling cell adhesion, with further regions, such as the PHSRN sequence (synergy site), in the FN repeat III<sub>9</sub>, promoting &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin binding to FN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Cells have evolved to recognize adhesive proteins through integrins, a family of trans-membrane heterodimers that serve as a link between the ECM and the cell actin cytoskeleton.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Subsequent to binding, integrins cluster and develop into complexes, called focal adhesions, composed of structural (e.g., vinculin) and signaling molecules (e.g., focal adhesion kinase). These plaques anchor cells to the surface and their formation triggers cell response.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Overall, FN adopts a fundamental role in mediating and promoting cell adhesion, and in regulating cell survival and phenotypic response.</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label><bold>FIG. 1.</bold></label><caption><p>Mechanistic model for the material-based modulation of FN conformation. <bold>(A)</bold> Structure of FN showing three different types of domains (I, II, and III) and binding regions for integrins. <bold>(B)</bold> Secondary structure for the main integrin binding domains of FN (FNIII<sub>9&#x02013;10</sub>) highlighting the RGD and PHSRN sequences in yellow along the specific binding sites for HFN7.1 and mAb1937 antibodies, adapted from PBD ID: 1FNF.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>
<bold>(C)</bold> FN takes on a globular conformation on PMA (<italic>left</italic>), whereas a (nano)network is formed on PEA (<italic>right</italic>) via the FNI<sub>1&#x02013;5</sub> domains. <bold>(D)</bold> After blocking the cell binding and/or synergy domains (FNIII<sub>9&#x02013;10</sub>), no other integrin binding domains are accessible by cells on PMA (<italic>left</italic>), whereas they are still accessible on PEA (<italic>right</italic>). FN, fibronectin; PEA, poly(ethyl acrylate); PMA, poly(methyl acrylate).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fig-1"/></fig><p>Several studies have demonstrated that surface chemistry is a key parameter that can alter the amount and conformation of adsorbed FN.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;20</xref></sup> For example, using differently terminated self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), Garc&#x000ed;a and coworkers demonstrated that hydrophilic surfaces (OH-SAM) induced the least amount of structural change in FN or in the recombinant fragment FNIII<sub>7&#x02013;10</sub>, while hydrophobic CH<sub>3</sub>-SAM provoked the largest structural changes.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Surface chemistry can therefore be used to manipulate the state and activity of the protein through simple physical adsorption. We have previously demonstrated that poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA) surfaces induce the organization of FN into physiological-like fibrillar (nano) networks upon adsorption onto the polymeric substrate.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, the removal of a methyl group from the monomer [i.e., using poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) instead] prevented this phenomenon, leading to FN adsorption in a globular conformation. In this work, we characterized the state of the protein on these surfaces in relation to protein concentration and surface chemistry. We used L929 fibroblast, plated on engineered FN substrates, and determined the cellular response in relation to the presentation of FN at the material interface. Overall, we intended to establish a simple and robust tissue culture platform that enables us to control the state of the intermediate adsorbed protein layer, thereby tailoring the microenvironment presented to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). We propose that this material-based platform is a versatile tool to both direct and elucidate mechanisms underlying cell response for applications spanning from tissue engineering to disease biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Samples preparation</title><p>PEA and PMA polymers were synthetized by radical polymerization of ethyl acrylate and methyl acrylate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), initiated by benzoin at 1&#x02009;wt% and 0.35&#x02009;wt%, respectively.

Modulation of FN activity at the material interface led to changes in integrin binding, organization of focal adhesions, and signaling that promoted cell differentiation with different efficiencies.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Focal adhesions are supramolecular structures that link adsorbed FN at the material interface with the actin cytoskeleton. Focal adhesion structure, size, composition, and dynamics depend on the information received from the surrounding matrix. Availability of key FN domains can promote integrin clustering, and this in turn can determine cell signaling and fate.<sup><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;35</xref></sup> Moreover, the composition, function, and size of focal adhesions have been correlated to each other: <italic>focal complexes</italic> &#x0223c;1&#x02009;&#x003bc;m are involved in migration and low-tension phenotypes that contain paxillin, vinculin, and phisphorylated proteins; <italic>focal adhesions</italic> &#x0223c;2&#x02013;5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m are involved in intermediate tension phenotypes; <italic>super-mature adhesions</italic> &#x0003e;5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m are involved in high-tension phenotypes.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p><p>Here we show that FN conformation and distribution can be fine-tuned by using material surfaces with very similar chemical and physical chemistries.

However, the micro-/nanoscale distributions of FN differed significantly, with globular aggregates on PMA compared to an interconnected FN (nano) network on PEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The different state of the adsorbed protein on the two polymers was also confirmed by dynamic contact angle measurements: contact angle hysteresis was significantly higher on FN-coated PEA due to a stronger decrease of the receding angles compared to PMA. This might suggest a higher protein surface coverage on PEA, compatible with the unfolding of the dimer arms and the formation of fibrils, compared to the maintenance of a globular conformation on PMA. Also, the extended conformation of FN on PEA might favor the molecular rearrangement of the protein in contact with water compared to the compact conformation on PMA.</p><p>The different FN presentation on the material surface has consequences at the molecular level for the availability of the integrin binding region of FN (FNIII<sub>9&#x02013;10</sub>). Importantly, after FN adsorption from a solution of concentration of 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL, the availability of the RGD domain remained constant for both PEA and PMA, whereas the synergy sequence (PHSRN) located at the III<sub>9</sub> domain was preferentially available for cell engagement on PEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>). This has important consequences in terms of integrin binding and focal adhesion assembly.

The size distribution of focal adhesions remained constant while the concentration of FN on the surface increased on PMA. However, on PEA, the distribution showed a higher fraction of larger focal adhesions as the concentration of FN on the surfaces increased (this can also be observed using the median&#x02014;even if this is a poor representation of the whole distribution; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).

Therefore, when the synergy sequence of FN (PHSRN) was not available for interaction (on PEA), cells were still able to adhere using only the RGD domain (and &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> rather than &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>).<sup><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Likewise, the number and size of focal adhesions was significantly diminished on PMA after blocking with either antibody, whereas a significant number of focal adhesions (but smaller) were still found on PEA after blocking each one of the domains, or both simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). This result directly correlated with the extended conformation of FN molecules on PEA (that leads to the organization into nanonetworks observed by AFM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) and the globular-like shape of the protein on PMA. Even after blocking FNIII<sub>9&#x02013;10</sub>, other domains were still available for integrin binding on PEA (e.g., FNI<sub>5</sub> and the variable region) but not on PMA, as a change in the conformation of the molecule (fibrillogenesis) was required for these domains to be exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>).<sup><xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Overall, we present a mechanistic model for the different conformation of FN induced by the underlying material surface that accounts for the availability of the integrin binding domains (FNIII<sub>9&#x02013;10</sub>) and the effect of blocking antibodies (HFN7.1, mAb1937) as discussed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s019"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that FN conformation can be triggered by material surfaces with very similar chemical composition (PEA and PMA differ in only one methyl group in the side chain) and physical properties (wettability and charge). FN is organized in nanonetworks on PEA, while a globular conformation was observed on PMA. As a consequence, FN molecules were adsorbed in an extended conformation on PEA, which provides better availability of the synergy sequence and other integrin-binding domains of the molecule (e.g., FNI<sub>5</sub>). The distinct organization of FN on PEA led to a higher fraction of larger focal adhesions, whereas smaller focal-complex points were observed on PMA. The maintenance of focal adhesions, even after blocking FNIII<sub>9&#x02013;10</sub> with monoclonal antibodies on PEA, but not on PMA, confirmed the different conformation of FN on these polymeric surfaces. Our results suggest that cells are highly sensitive to the organization of FN on material surfaces regardless of the properties of the underlying polymeric coating. In summary, PEA and PMA can be used as a simple material platform to fine-tune the microenvironment presented to cells by controlling the intermediate layer of protein adsorbed onto the substrates.
