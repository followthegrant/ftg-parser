The opiate dependent subjects were found to score higher both on SS and AL than those in the control groups. Further, there was a gradient of the degree of correlation between these two psychological variables amongst the three groups studied. The opiate dependent group showed the highest positive correlation. The general population control group showed the lowest degree of correlation, and the self-matched control group was intermediate.</p><p>These findings are consonant with an &#x0201c;SS-AL combination&#x0201d; hypothesis for the genesis of opiate addiction. Briefly, the hypothesis states that a higher sensation-seeking need, coupled with an inability to meet this need through socially sanctioned channels, leads on to repeated experiences with drug taking behavior, thus fostering dependence. The present study provides preliminary data supporting this hypothesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>alienation</kwd><kwd>sensation seeking</kwd><kwd>opiate</kwd><kwd>dependence</kwd><kwd>hypothesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
