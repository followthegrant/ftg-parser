However, the conditions for synaptic integration and activation of intrinsic responses may to a large extent depend on the level of background synaptic input. In this respect, the deep cerebellar nuclear (DCN) neurons are of particular interest: they feature a massive background synaptic input and an intrinsic, postinhibitory rebound depolarization with profound effects on the synaptic integration. Using <italic>in vivo</italic> whole cell patch clamp recordings from DCN cells in the cat, we find that the background of Purkinje cell input provides a tonic inhibitory synaptic noise in the DCN cell. Under these conditions, individual Purkinje cells appear to have a near negligible influence on the DCN cell and clear-cut rebounds are difficult to induce. Peripheral input that drives the simple spike output of the afferent PCs to the DCN cell generates a relatively strong DCN cell inhibition, but do not induce rebounds. In contrast, synchronized climbing fiber activation, which leads to a synchronized input from a large number of Purkinje cells, can induce profound rebound responses. In light of what is known about climbing fiber activation under behaviour, the present findings suggest that DCN cell rebound responses may be an unusual event. Our results also suggest that cortical modulation of DCN cell output require a substantial co-modulation of a large proportion of the PCs that innervate the cell, which is a possible rationale for the existence of the cerebellar microcomplex.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>For practical reasons, studies of synaptic integration and intrinsic neuronal properties have mostly been performed in excised pieces of brain tissue (brain slices/in vitro preparations).

The simulation was carried out using different numbers of PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In order to calibrate the model against recorded data, we adjusted the synaptic weights of the afferent PCs so that the simulated membrane potential obtained a RMS value of about 1.5 mV, i.e. in the range of the recorded data. Notably, in order for the simulated membrane potential to stay within the same RMS range as the recorded signal, the mean unitary IPSP amplitude had to be very small, i.e. less than 0.1 mV in simulations with &#x0003e;200 PCs.</p><p>With this model, we found that periods of low amplitude fluctuations could only be obtained with a large number of non-synchronized PCs onto the DCN neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, bottom). In contrast, if a low number of non-synchronized PCs converged on the DCN, the simulation indicated that the baseline would display a multitude of fast IPSP events (i.e. with deviations higher than 2 standard deviations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, top). To further verify that the model produced an accurate reflection of the recorded low amplitude fluctuation periods in our DCN cells, we made a power spectral density analysis of the recorded and simulated subthreshold membrane potentials. Again, with a high number of PCs in the model, the power spectral density of the baseline activity became nearly identical to that of the DCN cell recording, which was not the case for simulations with a low number of PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Inferior olive stimulation</title><p>In the next step, we wanted to test how synchronization of PC spike output was reflected in the membrane potential of the DCN cell. Because of the microcomplex organization of the cerebellum (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref>), in which the DCN cells only receive inputs from Purkinje cells within a single or a few sagittal microzones, electrical microstimulation within the inferior olive (IO) to simultaneously activate the PCs of single microzones should be an effective way to activate a large set of the inhibitory PC input to a DCN neuron. Using this approach, we found that thresholds for evoking DCN cell IPSPs, in the subset of DCN cells that were located within the same microcomplex as the stimulation electrode in the IO, were less than 15 uA. At current intensities of 50 uA or less we could evoke IPSPs of up to 20 mV in amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) (15&#x0002b;/&#x02212;2.6 mV, N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;14). These IO-evoked giant IPSPs were maximal, since further increases in the IO stimulation intensity did not result in larger IPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g004">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). The DCN cells were recorded at a membrane potential of &#x02212;45 to &#x02212;50 mV to prevent the IPSPs from reaching the reversal potential for chloride. The reversal potential has been estimated to &#x02212;78 mV in granule cells using the same recording solution (J&#x000f6;rntell and Ekerot, 2006), which is also close to the chloride reversal potential of &#x02212;75 mV recorded for DCN cells <italic>in vitro</italic> with the perforated patch technique <xref rid="pone.0018822-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0018822-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0018822.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>IPSPs evoked in DCN neurons by IO stimulation.</title><p>(A) Superimposed averages of IPSP responses evoked at different intensities of IO-stimulation in the same DCN cell.

As the stimulation intensity reached 300 uA, at least half of the microzones of the C3 zone was activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Notably, in DCN cells for which the thresholds for IO-evoked IPSPs were higher (blue lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), saturation of the evoked IPSPs required considerably higher stimulation intensities.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Spontaneous giant IPSP</title><p>The predominant low amplitude fluctuation periods of the DCN cell membrane potential trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) were intermittently interrupted by episodes of large spontaneous IPSP-like events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g005">Fig. 5A,B</xref>). These events could have very large peak amplitudes (typically 3&#x02013;10 mV) when recorded at a membrane potential of &#x02212;45 to &#x02212;50 mV and are referred to as &#x02018;spontaneous giant IPSPs&#x02019; below. Spontaneous giant IPSPs had a falling phase with a similar time course as submaximal IPSPs evoked by IO stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>) (Since each olivary cell innervates on average 7 PCs <xref rid="pone.0018822-Sugihara2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, the IO evoked submaximal IPSPs must have been generated by at least 7 PCs, but possibly more since the IO stimulation could have activated more than one olivary cell). Spontaneous giant IPSPs typically occurred in bursts with highly irregular intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>) (the average CV for intervals between spontaneous giant IPSPs was 98&#x00025;&#x0002b;/&#x02212;6&#x00025;) and at an average rate of 8&#x02013;17 Hz (12.2&#x0002b;/&#x02212;1.2, all data from 14 DCN recordings of at least 30 seconds each, 0 pA bias current). About 10&#x00025; (9.8&#x0002b;/&#x02212;6.1&#x00025;) of the intervals between spontaneous giant IPSPs were longer than 1 s, excluding that they were generated by any single PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The high CV of the intervals and the occurrence of very long intervals suggested that the spontaneous giant IPSPs were generated by spontaneous discharges in the climbing fibers, which occur in similar patterns <xref rid="pone.0018822-Chorev1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Bengtsson1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The widely varying peak amplitudes further suggested that the spontaneous giant IPSPs were generated by synchronous activation of multiple olivary cells with a highly variable recruitment. Both spontaneous and IO-evoked giant IPSPs also shared the conspicuous feature of a precisely timed, preceding EPSP (peak amplitude: 0.5&#x02013;1.5 mV (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10 cells)), which is elicited via the direct climbing fiber collateral input to the DCN cell <xref rid="pone.0018822-Llinas1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The fact that the spontaneous giant IPSPs always were smaller than the maximal IO-evoked IPSPs suggested that they represented the activation of a subpopulation of the IO cells of the particular microcomplex to which the DCN cell belonged. The coactivation of small subpopulations of the IO cells could also explain how spontaneous giant IPSPs episodically could occur at much higher rates than the spontaneous climbing fiber discharge &#x02013; bursts of giant IPSPs could represent the sequential activation of different subpopulations of IO cells innervating the microcomplex.

However, movement initiation is associated with a strong depression of IO excitability <xref rid="pone.0018822-Apps4" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Gibson1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Horn1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Horn2" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> and during normal motor control, strong inhibition followed by rebound excitation is a pattern that is not observed in the DCN cell firing behaviour <xref rid="pone.0018822-vanKan1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Mason1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. A remaining possibility is that climbing fiber activation sufficiently synchronized to evoke rebounds occurs only when a strong afferent drive to the IO and synchronization of IO neurons coincide. This could for example be triggered by situations that require cerebellar learning. Alternatively, full-blown rebounds may be experimental artefacts in the sense that the degree of synchronous activation obtained by intracranial stimulation is unphysiological. The conductance machinery underlying the rebound could instead serve the purpose of speeding up the DCN cell response to situations that lead to a fast reduction in the PC simple spike output. This would help DCN cells to overcome the temporal limitations imposed by the lingering decay phases of the spontaneously activated PC IPSPs following inhibition from the cortical interneurons. Future studies are needed to resolve whether rebound responses actually occur under behavior or whether the conductance machinery that underlie them have other functions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Adult cats were prepared as previously described <xref rid="pone.0018822-Jorntell1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Jorntell4" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Briefly, following an initial anesthesia with propofol (Diprivan&#x000ae; Zeneca Ltd, Macclesfield Cheshire, UK), the animals were decerebrated at the intercollicular level and the anesthesia was discontinued. The animals were artificially ventilated and the end-expiratory CO<sub>2</sub>, blood pressure and rectal temperature were continuously monitored and maintained within physiological limits. Mounting in a stereotaxic frame, drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, pneumothorax and clamping the spinal processes of a few cervical and lumbar vertebral bodies served to increase the mechanical stability of the preparation. Our EEG recordings were characterized by a background of periodic 1&#x02013;4 Hz oscillatory activity, periodically interrupted by large-amplitude 7&#x02013;14 Hz spindle oscillations lasting for 0.5 s or more. These forms of EEG activities are normally associated with deep stages of sleep. The pattern of EEG activity and the blood pressure remained stable, also on noxious stimulation, throughout experiments.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Recordings and stimulation</title><p>The initial delineation of the forelimb area of the C3 zone in the cerebellar anterior lobe and the continuous monitoring of the general condition in the sensitive mossy fiber-to-granule cell-to-parallel fiber pathway were performed as described previously <xref rid="pone.0018822-Ekerot3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Also the general recording procedures and the procedures for placing stimulation electrodes in the inferior olive have been described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0018822-Jorntell4" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. In vivo patch clamp recordings were made from deep cerebellar nuclear cells with patch pipettes pulled to 6&#x02013;14 MOhm (potassium-gluconate based internal solution, chloride 7.3 mM, same solution as in <xref rid="pone.0018822-Jorntell4" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Jorntell5" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. A special adaptation for the DCN recordings was to pull the final 10 mm of the patch pipettes to one long, narrow part (&#x0003c;200 um) using a custom-made box-filament on a Sutter micropipette puller (P-97, Sutter Instruments Co., USA). Extracellular metal electrode recordings (exposed metal tips 3&#x02013;15 um) were made from DCN neurons, Purkinje cells of the C3 zone, and climbing fiber field potentials in the molecular layer of the C3 zone.</p><p>In order to localize the anterior interposed nucleus (AIP), all experiments started with a topographical exploration using a metal electrode. The microelectrode was inserted at around the border between the C2 and C3 zones just rostral to the primary fissure at 90&#x000b0; angle relative to the horizontal stereotaxic plane. To keep track of the electrode location, we continuously monitored the spontaneous activity and the field and unitary responses evoked by electrical skin stimulation throughout electrode tracks. The dorsal border of the AIP was identified by a marked increase in background noise (presumably reflected neuronal multi-unit activity) relative to the overlying white matter, and the characteristic field potentials evoked by electrical skin stimulation <xref rid="pone.0018822-Garwicz2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Ekerot5" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. The medial and lateral borders of the AIP could be identified on the basis of the receptive field topography for climbing fiber-activated Purkinje cell inputs, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0018822-Garwicz2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Ekerot5" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Jorntell6" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. The ventral part of the nucleus was characterized by a reduction in background noise.</p><p>Patch clamp pipettes were lowered under high positive pressure (3&#x02013;10 atmospheres) until we reached the dorsal part of the nucleus according to the previous identification done with the metal electrode. Once inside the nucleus, the positive pressure was reduced but not removed. When dramatic increases in tip resistance occurred as the electrode was advanced, the positive pressure was removed and a seal formation was attempted. Once obtained (0.5&#x02013;6 GOhm), rapid application of negative pressure was used to gain access to intracellular space (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;24). The failure rate to both establish and break seals was markedly higher than in granule cells <xref rid="pone.0018822-Jorntell5" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Bengtsson2" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. In addition to the measures we have previously used, for DCN neuron recordings major quality checks for the recordings were the spike amplitudes (at least 35 mV) and the amplitudes of the spontaneous and IO-evoked giant IPSPs. Resting membrane potential was defined as the average potential recorded between spikes at 0 pA bias current within 30 s after intracellular access (&#x02212;50 to &#x02212;55 mV). Whenever spike amplitudes or giant IPSP amplitudes deteriorated by more than 20&#x00025; from the initial record after we gained intracellular access, the recording was stopped since it was taken as an indication that the seal between the recording electrode and the cell membrane deteriorated. Access resistance was 7&#x02013;15 MOhm and compensated off-line. Some neurons were stained by neurobiotin in the electrode solution. After sagittal sectioning, the neurons, which were always located in the AIP, were studied in the confocal microscope. The reconstruction shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018822-g001">Fig. 1</xref> was made from transparent z-stacks of confocal images from three contiguous sagittal sections. The full extent of the dendrites was not reconstructed, since the dendrites extended more than 0.4 mm in each direction perpendicular to the plane of section (sagittal), which made them very difficult to follow. Patch clamp recordings from granule cells and Purkinje cells were obtained using the same protocols as previously described <xref rid="pone.0018822-Jorntell5" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, with the difference that Purkinje cells were recorded with electrodes with 4&#x02013;8 MOhm resistance.</p><p>Input from the skin was quantified using pairs of closely spaced percutaneous needles (stimulation with one square pulse at 0.1 ms, 1 Hz, 1 mA) and a strain-gauge device mounted on the index finger of the investigator <xref rid="pone.0018822-Jorntell4" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Jorntell5" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.</p><p>Periods of inhibited spike activity and postinhibitory rebound spike responses were defined as coherent periods, that followed immediately after a spike inhibition (more than 2 standard deviations below prestimulus baseline), during which the spiking activity was increased relative to the prestimulus baseline activity by at least 2 standard deviations (SDs) for 10 ms or more.</p><p>In order to characterize the degree of randomness of the membrane potential over time, we used Welch's method to estimate the power spectral density (PSD) (Matlab). This analysis was applied to the intracellular activity in DCN cells prevented from firing using hyperpolarizing bias current and in the traces simulated by the model (see below).</p><p>We defined the onset of IPSPs (and EPSPs in granule cells) after computing the standard deviation of the second time derivative (smoothed by adjacent averaging of &#x000b1;5 samples of digitized data) of the membrane potential during a 10 ms interval representing baseline membrane activity starting 5 ms before the onset of the PSP. The point when the recorded second time derivative first exceeded a value greater than 2 standard deviations over more than 5 sample bins (sample time 40 us) was taken as a probable start of a PSP. The potential PSP was then searched for a time-course typical for IPSPs (EPSPs in granule cells) as assessed by template-matching (using scalable EPSP templates created from isolated unitary EPSPs from the same recorded neuron using in-house software, see <xref rid="pone.0018822-Bengtsson2" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>) and if a match was found it was classified as an IPSP (/EPSP). The amplitude of a PSP was measured as the difference between the average membrane potential during a &#x000b1;0.5 ms epoch around its the peak amplitude and the average membrane potential during a 1 ms epoch preceding the onset of the PSP.</p><p>Recordings of climbing fiber field potentials in the cerebellar cortex were made with a tungsten-in-glass microelectrode inserted in the superficial part of the cortex (inserted 100 um below the cortical surface). Each folium of the cortex was investigated with 15&#x02013;20 recording spots within the C3 zone.</p><p>All data are given as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation unless stated otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Model of synaptic integration of IPSPs in DCN cells</title><p>A simple model of DCN cell synaptic integration, similar to that previously used for granule cells <xref rid="pone.0018822-Jorntell5" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Bengtsson2" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, was used to calculate the summation of Purkinje cell IPSPs. The only purpose of this model was to analyze the pattern of membrane potential fluctuations which could be obtained as a result of varying the number and temporal density of Purkinje cell synaptic inputs. As the model was used for simulations within a very narrow membrane potential range, it was simplified to not include any active membrane conductances. Different Purkinje cell inputs were assigned one random out of 4 standardized IPSP amplitudes, with the largest IPSP having four times the amplitude of the smallest IPSP. The model assumed a background tonic excitation or leak to counterbalance the tonic inhibition level to bring the membrane potential to &#x02212;50 mV on average (cf <xref rid="pone.0018822-Gauck1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018822-Raman1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>). The spike times of Purkinje cell simple spikes, recorded at a temporal resolution of 0.1 ms, was used to activate the IPSPs of the model. The simulation runs were made with 4, 13, 40, 120 and 600 PC inhibitory synapses, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The experimental procedures were approved in advance by the Malm&#x000f6;/Lund Animal Research Ethics Committee (permit number and approval-ID: M32-09).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Palmi Thor Thorbergsson at the Dept. of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, for helping us with the power spectral density analysis.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>The work was supported by SENSOPAC (an Integrated Project funded by the EU under FP6, IST-028056-SENSOPAC), by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grant (R01 NS-040863), the Swedish Research Council (project no.
