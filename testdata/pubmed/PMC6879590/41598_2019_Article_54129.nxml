We therefore studied the usefulness of combining HER2 and MET targeting by small-molecule inhibitors lapatinib and foretinib, respectively, both in <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> models of experimental EAC. We characterized MET and HER2 activation in a panel of human EAC cell lines, and the differential susceptibility of these EAC cell lines to single agent or combination of foretinib and lapatinib. We then explored the antitumor efficacy with survival advantage following foretinib and lapatinib monotherapy and in combination in murine subcutaneous xenograft and peritoneal metastatic survival models of human EAC. The OE33 EAC cell line with strong expression of phosphorylated both MET and HER2, demonstrated reduced sensitivity to foretinib and lapatinib when used as a single agent. The co-administration of foretinib and lapatinib effectively inhibited both MET and HER2 phosphorylation, enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth by inducing apoptosis, and significantly enhanced mouse overall survival, overcoming single agent resistance. In the OE19 EAC cell line with mainly HER2 phosphorylation, and the ESO51 EAC cell line with mainly MET phosphorylation, profound cell growth inhibition with induction of apoptosis was observed in response to single agent with lack of enhanced growth inhibition when the two agents were combined. These data suggest that combination therapy with foretinib and lapatinib should be tested as a treatment option for HER2 positive patients with MET-overexpressing EAC, and could be a novel treatment strategy for specific EAC patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cancer therapeutic resistance</kwd><kwd>Oesophageal cancer</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The two main subtypes of esophageal cancer are esophageal squamous cell-carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. While esophageal squamous cell-carcinoma still accounts for 90 percent of the cases of esophageal cancer worldwide, esophageal adenocarcinoma has become the dominant type in the United States and the Western world, and the number of cases is ever increasing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The overall 5 year survival rate of EAC is below 20 percent, and the prognosis for EAC remains poor even with modern combination therapies due to development of high resistance to chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and despite recent advances in surgical and radiation techniques as well as in systemic treatment options<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Moreover, 50&#x02013;60 percent of EAC are unresectable at the time of diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although EAC seems to respond well initially to conventional chemotherapy, clinical benefit is limited and most patients eventually die from distant metastatic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed.</p><p id="Par3">A major target for esophageal cancer therapies is the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A subset of EAC has been shown to overexpress HER2. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody to HER2 is currently the only FDA approved targeted therapy used for HER2 positive metastatic EAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In EAC models, there has been limited examination of HER-2 targeted agents. Unfortunately, HER2 positive advanced EAC patients frequently develop resistance to Herceptin through mechanisms still poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. An alternative anti-HER2 strategy has been the use of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target not only HER2 but other HER family proteins. Lapatinib is a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits both EGFR and HER2. However, lapatinib, a dual EGFR and HER2 inhibitor, has shown disappointing results in clinical trials of metastatic EAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and the mechanisms that contribute to lapatinib resistance are unknown. The resistance to lapatinib in EAC may be related to MET-EGFR crosstalk but lacks supportive <italic>in-vivo</italic> data. Foretinib is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor that inhibits cellular hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced c-MET phosphorylation and prevents HGF-induced response to tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Recent studies indicated that EAC is driven by amplification of c-MET and HER2 in a subset of patients who may be resistant to lapatinib therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. HER2 and MET overexpression is highly prevalent (20 to 30%) in EAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and HER2-MET co-overexpression is also frequent in EAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus lapatinib and foretinib combination therapy could be a novel strategy for treating EAC with overexpression/activation of MET and HER2.</p><p id="Par4">In this study, we therefore hypothesized that MET activation may lead to lapatinib resistance in HER2-driven esophageal adenocarcinoma, and tested the feasibility of MET targeting by small-molecule inhibitor Foretinib in EAC cells. We present for the first time the <italic>in-vivo</italic> administration of lapatinib with foretinib for treating experimental EAC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell lines, cell culture and reagents</title><p id="Par5">Human esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines (ESO26, OE33, ESO51, SK-GT-2, OE19, OACM5.1&#x02009;C and Flo-1) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Lois, MO). All cell lines except Flo-1 were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, New York, USA) whereas Flo-1 was cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2&#x02009;mM GlutaMax (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100&#x02009;mg/ml streptomycin at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air &#x02013; 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Briefly, aliquots of OE19 cells in the exponential growth phase were seeded into 25&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks. Lapatinib (10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) was added for 48&#x02009;hours during the mitotic phase, and then the cells were transferred into drug-free culture medium for around 15 days until the cells reached 80% confluency, after which lapatinib was added for the next 48&#x02009;hours at twice the previous concentration. We continued this process while observing cell death every day, changing to fresh complete culture medium, and performing drug sensitivity to lapatinib by WST-1 assay every month. This process was continued until the concentration of lapatinib in the medium reached 80&#x02009;&#x003bc;M after around 150 days.

Using only <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies, it has been suggested that MET activation may confer lapatinib resistance in EAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In this study, we verified this resistance <italic>in-vitro</italic> and, with lapatinib and foretinib treatment, we identified MET activation as a possible resistance mechanism to lapatinib in HER2 and MET co-activated EAC cells in <italic>in-vivo</italic> murine subcutaneous xenograft and peritoneal metastatic survival models of human EAC. In addition, we have shown induction of MET phosphorylation by stepwise inhibition of multiple ErbB family members. We found that the phosphorylation of MET protein was upregulated after stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of lapatinib in OE19 cells indicating that the MET signaling pathway might be involved in the resistance of EAC to lapatinib.</p><p id="Par21">EGFR and HER2 are tyrosine kinase receptors, and act as receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF), a potent mitogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. EGFR/HER2 showed frequent expression in EAC and influenced patient survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Despite a strong clinical response to the HER2 inhibitor in some HER2-positive esophagogastric cancer patients, some HER2-positive patients did not show significant clinical benefits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and alternative growth signaling pathways were suggested in HER2-inhibitor resistance mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Similarly in our study, signaling through alternative growth pathways like MET were noted to produce HER2-targeted lapatinib resistance. Though these <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies shed some insight into the mechanism of lapatinib resistance, they may not represent the situation <italic>in-vivo</italic>. Also, <italic>in-vitro</italic> experiments are not enough for pre-clinical development of any novel combination therapies. For translation of pre-clinical experiments to clinical trials <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiments are indispensable.</p><p id="Par22">We show that lapatinib is a potent inhibitor of HER2 phosphorylation and foretinib is a potent inhibitor of MET phosphorylation in EAC cells. We found that cell lines with HER2 activation had the best response to lapatinib, whereas cell lines with MET activation showed the best response to foretinib. Contrary to that, OE19 EAC cells without MET phosphorylation but with MET expression were sensitive to foretinib. Foretinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in cancer cell proliferation, and its mechanism of action is incompletely understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Its effect on OE19 cells may be due to hitherto unidentified mechanisms. HER2 phosphorylation in HER2 driven OE19 EAC cells rendered OE19 cells more sensitive to single-agent lapatinib induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis than that of foretinib. Similarly, MET phosphorylation in MET driven ESO51 EAC cells rendered ESO51 cells more sensitive to single-agent foretinib induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis than that of lapatinib. In addition, lack of enhanced growth inhibition and apoptosis was observed when lapatinib was combined with foretinib in OE19 and ESO51 EAC cells. HER2 and MET co-activation rendered OE33 EAC cells less sensitive to single-agent lapatinib or foretinib induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, but enhanced growth inhibition with apoptosis was noted when combining lapatinib with foretinib. Interestingly, we found that foretinib consistently increased both pHER2 and HER2 expressions in OE33 cells, but not in OE19 cells. This effect could be due to preferential killing of OE33 cells with MET activation by foretinib with a resultant increase in the OE33 cell population having HER2 activation/overexpression. Thus this study also supports our hypothesis that in EAC cells where MET and HER2 are co-expressed, these two receptors can work together to prevent cell apoptosis and enhance cell growth.</p><p id="Par23">Molecular mechanisms of lapatinib resistance have been studied extensively in many cancers including esophageal adenocarcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. But in clinical trials lapatinib failed to show survival benefit in HER-2 positive esophageal cancer. Therefore, to predict which patients will more likely to get a benefit from combination therapy is of great interest. This study has the advantage of <italic>in-vivo</italic> targeting of HER2 and MET pathways by using FDA approved, clinically utilized small molecule inhibitors. Our subcutaneous xenograft studies evaluated comparative antitumor effects of lapatinib and foretinib monotherapy as well as combination therapy in HER2 and MET co-activated OE33 EAC tumor xenografts. This study clearly demonstrated the advantage of <italic>in-vivo</italic> targeting of HER2 and MET pathways by lapatinib and foretinib combination over single agent therapy. Combining lapatinib with foretinib significantly decreased net tumor volume, relative tumor volume (RTV) and average tumor weight without effecting mice average weight over single agent therapy. This enhanced antitumor effect could indicate important clinical implications. The combination of anti-MET therapy with anti-HER2 therapy could have a direct clinical benefit in a subset of EAC patients. Further investigation of the mechanisms of the antitumor activity of lapatinib plus foretinib combination therapy, compared to lapatinib or foretinib monotherapy, by immunohistochemical analyses of tumor tissues revealed a significantly reduced Ki67-proliferative index, and also a significantly enhanced cleaved caspase 3-apoptosis index. This effect of enhanced apoptosis with combination therapy was further confirmed by western bot analysis. Similar to <italic>in-vitro</italic> effects, we found that the <italic>in-vivo</italic> use of lapatinib or foretinib caused a decrease in phosphorylation of HER2 and MET. Thus, these signaling pathway changes are likely present not only <italic>in-vitro</italic>, but also <italic>in-vivo</italic>. These markers might therefore represent valid markers of <italic>in-vivo</italic> activity and warrant clinical validation.</p><p id="Par24">In addition, we assessed a possible survival benefit of lapatinib or foretinib alone and as a combination therapy.

However, these subcutaneous implantation models do not represent a patient environment and have been shown to rarely metastasize. A better model would be an orthotopic EAC model. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to establish a mouse orthotopic EAC model, and its reproducibility remains challenging. Furthermore, an invasive procedure is required that induces inflammation and therefore may inadvertently influence subsequent therapeutic interventions. Because of this, we used a simple, less invasive, and more patient-like EAC survival model as published before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Our results showed that combination of lapatinib with foretinib significantly increased mouse survival over lapatinib or foretinib alone. This survival benefit was further enhanced when lapatinib plus foretinib was combined with the standard chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin plus paclitaxel. Our data demonstrates that the combination of lapatinib plus foretinib did inhibit tumor progression in an OE33 experimental EAC model with co-activation of HER2 and MET. Therefore, combing lapatinib with foretinib appears to represent a new targeted therapy regimen in HER2 and MET co-activated EAC.</p><p id="Par25">In conclusion, our results showed that lapatinib plus foretinib combination therapy had increased antitumor activity.
