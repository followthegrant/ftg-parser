A positive correlation between protein kinase C &#x003b6; (PKC&#x003b6;) activation and d-flow has been reported, but the exact role of d-flow&#x02013;mediated PKC&#x003b6; activation in atherosclerosis remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that PKC&#x003b6; activation by d-flow induces endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis by regulating p53. We found that d-flow&#x02013;mediated peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) increased PKC&#x003b6; activation, which subsequently induced p53 SUMOylation, p53&#x02013;Bcl-2 binding, and EC apoptosis. Both d-flow and ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> increased the association of PKC&#x003b6; with protein inhibitor of activated STATy (PIASy) via the Siz/PIAS-RING domain (amino acids 301&#x02013;410) of PIASy, and overexpression of this domain of PIASy disrupted the PKC&#x003b6;&#x02013;PIASy interaction and PKC&#x003b6;-mediated p53 SUMOylation. En face confocal microscopy revealed increases in nonnuclear p53 expression, nitrotyrosine staining, and apoptosis in aortic EC located in d-flow areas in wild-type mice, but these effects were significantly decreased in p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. We propose a novel mechanism for p53 SUMOylation mediated by the PKC&#x003b6;&#x02013;PIASy interaction during d-flow&#x02013;mediated EC apoptosis, which has potential relevance to early events of atherosclerosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>A hallmark of atherogenesis is focalized endothelial dysfunction, which includes altered vasoregulation, activation of inflammatory processes, and compromised barrier function caused by endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Song et al., 2008</xref>). Manifestations of dysfunctional ECs are readily observed in certain areas of the arterial tree, where disturbed flow (d-flow), hence reduced time-averaged shear stress, develops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Traub and Berk, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Won et al., 2007</xref>). Steady laminar flow (s-flow) promotes release of factors from ECs that inhibit coagulation, leukocyte diapedesis, and smooth muscle cell proliferation while simultaneously promoting EC survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reinhart-King et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, d-flow alters the profile of secreted factors and EC surface molecule expression that favors the opposite effects, thereby contributing to the development of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Traub and Berk, 1998</xref>). We have previously reported the critical role of PKC&#x003b6; activation in EC apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garin et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, s-flow interferes with PKC&#x003b6; signaling, thereby down-regulating the proapoptotic effect of the kinase. In contrast, unique atheroprone signals elicited by d-flow remain unclear.</p><p>Acting as a sensor for DNA damage, the transcription factor p53 is a key regulator of the life or death of a cell, depending on whether or not the cell can cope with the damage and repair it. Although the most-studied function of p53 is its role as a transcription factor that increases the expression of proapoptotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murray-Zmijewski et al., 2008</xref>), recent studies have revealed its nontranscriptional proapoptotic activities. Cytosolic p53 directly interacts with the B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) family member proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 and antagonizes their antiapoptotic function by stabilizing the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mihara et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, antiapoptotic effects of p53 have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mercer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garner and Raj, 2008</xref>). It is particularly interesting that p53 inhibits apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells and protects against atherosclerosis formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Vlijmen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mercer et al., 2005</xref>). However, it remains unclear how these p53 functions, especially its apoptotic effect in ECs, are regulated by flow.</p><p>SUMOylation is a posttranslational modification consisting of covalent conjugation of ubiquitin-like proteins called SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) to target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hilgarth et al., 2004</xref>). It is a reversible modification that affects target protein functions, such as subcellular localization, protein partnering, DNA binding, and regulation of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hilgarth et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carter et al. (2007)</xref> proposed an interesting model for p53 nuclear export and stabilization. Masking of the C-terminal nuclear export signal (NES) results in nuclear localization of unmodified p53. A low level of ubiquitination by MDM2 exposes the NES, promoting p53 to interact with protein inhibitor of activated STATy (PIASy) and further modification by SUMOylation causes p53 nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carter et al., 2007</xref>). These data suggest an important role of SUMOylation in p53 nuclear export. In this study, we investigate the role of PKC&#x003b6; and PIASy on d-flow&#x02013;mediated endothelial p53 nuclear export and apoptosis, which may contribute to EC dysfunction and subsequent atherosclerotic plaque formation. Furthermore, we show that the cytoplasmic expression of p53 and EC apoptosis are increased in ECs in the area of d-flow in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>D-flow and ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, but not s-flow, activate PKC&#x003b6;</title><p>We first verified the potential role of shear stress in PKC&#x003b6; activation in cultured ECs using a cone and plate type of flow apparatuses as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reinhart-King et al., 2008</xref>). To generate d-flow, we used cones with radial grooves that were 1-mm deep. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 (A and B)</xref> shows tracks of fluorescent beads suspended in culture media when grooved and nongrooved cones were rotated at the same speed. Although the nongrooved cone created straight unidirectional tracks indicating s-flow, tracks made by the grooved cone were short and not oriented in the same direction, indicating nonlaminar movement of the media in the dish. Using these cones, we determined the effect of s- and d-flow on PKC&#x003b6; activation in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). D-flow increased PKC&#x003b6; phosphorylation at both Thr410 and Thr560 after 10 min of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), whereas s-flow failed to activate PKC&#x003b6;, although ERK5 was activated by s-flow as we reported previously (not depicted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Woo et al., 2008</xref>). PKC&#x003b6; phosphorylation at Thr560 was sustained longer than phosphorylation at Thr410.

Coimmunoprecipitation using nonimmune IgG yielded no SUMOylated bands (Fig. S1 A).

No significant fluorescent signal was observed in aorta samples treated with nonimmune rabbit IgG (not depicted) or with antigen-preabsorbed anti-p53 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201010051/DC1">Fig. S5 A</ext-link>). In LP areas, p53 was localized mainly in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, D and F</xref>). In contrast, in HP areas, significant levels of anti-p53 staining were detected outside the nucleus, although anti-p53 staining was still associated with the nucleus. This cytoplasmic staining was localized primarily to the area underneath the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, E and F</xref>). These results appear to suggest that d-flow causes p53, which is present mainly in the nucleus in ECs exposed to s-flow (i.e., LP area), to translocate into the cytoplasm especially to the area directly below the nucleus.</p><p>We also examined whether ECs in the HP area underwent more apoptosis than ECs in the LP area. Aortas of 7-wk-old C57BL/6 mice were immunostained first for VE-cadherin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201010051/DC1">Fig. S4 A</ext-link>, red) followed by the TUNEL staining (Fig. S4 A) or were coimmunostained for annexin V (Fig. S4 B, red) and VE-cadherin (Fig. S4 B, green). Although, in the LP area, TUNEL- and annexin V&#x02013;positive cells were rarely detected, such cells were frequently detected in the HP area (Fig. S4, A and B). Next, we studied the role of p53 in EC apoptosis in the 7-wk-old p53-deficient C57BL/6 mice (p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, G and H</xref>). p53 was absent in lung ECs isolated from p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 H</xref>, right). Interestingly, annexin V&#x02013;positive cells in the HP area were significantly decreased in the p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, G and H</xref>), supporting the critical role of p53 on d-flow&#x02013;mediated apoptosis in vivo. Because we found the critical role of ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> in d-flow&#x02013;mediated PKC&#x003b6; activation, p53 SUMOylation, and apoptosis, we investigated the expression of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins by double staining aortas with anti&#x02013;VE-cadherin and antinitrotyrosine (Fig. S5, B&#x02013;D). Antinitrotyrosine staining was significantly higher in HP areas than in LP areas. Our data collectively suggest that d-flow induces ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> production, PKC&#x003b6; activation, and nuclear export of p53, which increases EC apoptosis, and may prime ECs in the d-flow (HP) area to become susceptible to atherogenesis under the influence of various systemic risk factors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several atheroprotective signals activated by s-flow have been identified, but atheroprone signaling activated by d-flow is not well understood. The main finding of this study is that d-flow&#x02013;mediated ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> production activates PKC&#x003b6; and induces p53 SUMOylation, p53 nuclear export, p53&#x02013;Bcl-2 binding, and subsequent apoptosis. p53 appears to have both yin and yang effects on blood vessel physiology. Recent studies show its protective effect against cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tian et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garner and Raj, 2008</xref>). Because p53 positively regulates the expression of p21, an antiapoptotic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garner and Raj, 2008</xref>), p53 may exert its antiapoptotic effect by increasing p21 expression. Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al. (2000)</xref> have reported that laminar shear stress increased p53 expression and JNK-mediated p53 phosphorylation, which leads to endothelial growth arrest via increasing GADD45 and p21<sup>cip1</sup> expression. Therefore, it is important to emphasize here that p53 can induce growth arrest by inhibiting apoptosis via regulating p21. The interplay between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis is possibly critical in maintaining endothelial function because p53 may be able to reduce cells with DNA damages from apoptosis by preventing entry into the S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garner and Raj, 2008</xref>). However, it remains unclear how p53 determines which of these two activities, pro- or antiapoptotic, to implement. Of note, most of the p53 antiapoptotic effects have been explained by its nuclear localization, as nuclear p53 protects cells from apoptosis, especially under low stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tian et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garner and Raj, 2008</xref>). Indeed, our current study has revealed the antiapoptotic localization of p53 in ECs in the LP area exposed to steady laminar stress, which we consider to be a low stress condition. In contrast, ECs exposed to d-flow and ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> had increased cytoplasmic p53 localization (i.e., nuclear export of p53), which enhanced EC apoptosis via increased p53&#x02013;Bcl-2 binding.</p><p>Little information is available regarding the pathological significance of p53 subcellular localization, especially in ECs. Our study suggests that PKC&#x003b6; activation by d-flow and ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and subsequent p53 nuclear export promote EC apoptosis. This notion is consistent with an earlier study showing that human cytomegalovirus infection of ECs induces p53 accumulation in the cytoplasm and apoptosis via a p53-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shen et al., 2004</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest the involvement of cytoplasmic p53 in EC apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Utama et al., 2006</xref>). Our en face confocal data are consistent with this idea because increased cytoplasmic anti-p53 staining and increased TUNEL and annexin V stainings are found in ECs located in the area exposed to d-flow (i.e., HP area).</p><p>In our in vitro study, we found the importance of ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> on d-flow&#x02013;mediated PKC&#x003b6; activation, p53 SUMOylation, and EC apoptosis using ebselen, L-NAME, and Mn-TBAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). In addition, we found that nitrotyrosine staining was significantly increased in d-flow (HP) areas in vivo (Fig. S5, B&#x02013;D), where PKC&#x003b6; activation, nuclear exports of p53, and EC apoptosis were increased. We used 10&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;M ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> as the final concentration, which is in agreement with the concentration of ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> used in previous studies by other investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levrand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szab&#x000f3; et al., 2007</xref>). Because ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> is a transient intermediate in free radical chemistry and is highly reactive, it is difficult to measure actual concentrations of ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> in vivo. However, 10&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;M ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> are thought to be physiological because it has been suggested that the rates of ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> production in vivo in specific compartments have been estimated to be as high as 50&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;M/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levrand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szab&#x000f3; et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, it has also been estimated that the rate of ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> generation may reach up to 1 mM/min in an inflamed organ (lung) in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ischiropoulos et al., 1992</xref>). ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> has several possible ways to activate PKC&#x003b6;. One of the major effects of ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> is protein tyrosine nitration, which can regulate a variety of kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liaudet et al., 2009</xref>). First, ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> can activate various receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klotz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). Second, ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> can activate Src by displacing Tyr527 from its binding site to the SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roskoski, 2005</xref>). Finally, ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> can inhibit phosphatases via oxidation of cysteine-bound thiols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takakura et al., 1999</xref>). Although the direct effect of ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> on PKC&#x003b6; remains unclear, these molecules may be involved in signaling events upstream of PKC&#x003b6;. Therefore, we hypothesize that activation of a variety of kinases may be involved in ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-mediated PKC&#x003b6; activation. Further studies are necessary to determine the major signaling events.</p><p>In addition to regulating cell physiology through kinase activities, active kinases can also regulate cell physiology by altering their interaction with other molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akaike et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boggon and Eck, 2004</xref>). PKC&#x003b6; contains the pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory sequence (aa 116&#x02013;122), and the release of the kinase domain (aa 268&#x02013;587) from this autoinhibitory domain leads to PKC&#x003b6; activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, we were unable to show PKC&#x003b6;-mediated phosphorylation of PIASy in our in vitro kinase assay (Fig. S3), but we found that activation of PKC&#x003b6; increased the PKC&#x003b6;&#x02013;PIASy interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Using a mammalian two-hybrid assay, we then determined the C-terminal kinase domain of PKC&#x003b6; (aa 401&#x02013;587) was a PIASy binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Of note, the deletion of the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain of PKC&#x003b6; (aa 1&#x02013;200) increased PKC&#x003b6;&#x02013;PIASy association, suggesting that this domain is a negative regulator not only of its kinase activity but also its binding ability with PIASy. Therefore, releasing the PKC&#x003b6; N-terminal inhibitory effect (i.e., activation of PKC&#x003b6;) is critical for both kinase activation and PKC&#x003b6;&#x02013;PIASy association, and the regulation of PIASy activity most likely depends on PKC&#x003b6;-mediated increase in PKC&#x003b6;&#x02013;PIASy association but not phosphorylation. We also found that PKC&#x003b6; binds to the RING domain of PIASy, which contains its catalytic site and may alter the structure and enzymatic activity of PIASy. Our findings suggest that d-flow&#x02013;mediated PKC&#x003b6;&#x02013;PIASy association is critical for p53 SUMOylation to induce the endothelial p53 nuclear export and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 and p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with a C57BL/6 background (P53N4-M) were purchased from Taconic.

Apoptosis was also quantified by Western blot assessment of the cleavage of the caspase 3 using the cleaved caspase 3 antibody. All measurements were performed blinded, and at least three independent experiments were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Mammalian two-hybrid analysis and transfection of cells</title><p>Cells were plated in 12-well plates at 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well. The mammalian two-hybrid assay was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woo et al., 2006</xref>). In brief, cells were transfected in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with Lipofectamine mixture containing the pG5-luc vector and various pBIND and pACT plasmids (Promega) for 4 h. Cells were washed, and fresh DME supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was added. The pBIND vector contains the yeast GAL4&#x02013;DNA-binding domain upstream of a multiple cloning region, and the pACT vector contains the herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain upstream of a multiple cloning region. Various PKC&#x003b6; mutants and PIASy were cloned into the pBIND and pACT vector, respectively. Because pBIND also contains the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase gene, the expression and transfection efficiencies were normalized with the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity. Cells were collected 36 h after transfection unless indicated otherwise, and the luciferase activity was assayed with the Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega) using a luminometer (TD-20/20; Turner Designs). Transfections were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec><title>GST pull-down assay</title><p>HeLa cells (10<sup>6</sup> cells) were plated in 100-mm dishes and transfected in Opti-MEM with Lipofectamine mixture containing the Flag-tagged PIASy-truncated mutants for 4 h. Cells were washed and cultured for 24 h in fresh complete growth medium. Cell lysates were made by incubating cells in 0.5 ml radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. After centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 rpm, the whole-cell lysates were incubated with 100 ng of recombinant GST-fused PKC&#x003b6;, anti-FLAG, and IgG Sepharose beads with constant mixing for 2&#x02013;5 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 8 min. Samples were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-PKC&#x003b6;.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy</title><p>To determine whether the p53 localization is regulated by PKC&#x003b6; activation, HUVECs grown in 6-well plates were transduced with Ad-LacZ or Ad-DN-PKC&#x003b6; for 24 h. After treatment with 100 &#x000b5;M ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> for 4 h, the cells were quickly washed two times with cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were incubated with blocking buffer (5% goat serum and 0.1% NP-40 in PBS) for 60 min to block nonspecific binding and incubated with anti-p53 (1:200 dilution in 2% goat serum and 0.1% NP-40 in PBS) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 546&#x02013;labeled anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;labeled anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG<sub>1</sub> (1:2,000 dilution; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were counterstained with DAPI to identify nuclei. All of the images were collected using an epifluorescence microscope (BX51) equipped with a charge-coupled device camera (Spot; Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) and an Acroplan water 60&#x000d7; W lens.</p><p>To determine the colocalization of p53 with Bcl-2 or PKC&#x003b6; with PIASy, HUVECs were stimulated with d-flow for 3 h. After fixation, permeabilization, and 10% goat serum in PBS with 0.1% NP-40 for 1 h, the cells were incubated with mouse anti-p53 and rabbit anti&#x02013;Bcl-2 or mouse anti-PKC&#x003b6; and rabbit anti-PIASy (1:200) antibodies in 2% goat serum with PBS overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 546&#x02013;labeled anti&#x02013;mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;labeled anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG<sub>1</sub> (1:2,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were analyzed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (FV1000; Olympus) equipped with a Plapon 60&#x000d7; 1.42 NA oil lens objective. Quantification of the overlay image was performed using the Photoshop (CS; Adobe) program.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation (SUMO assay) and Western blot analysis</title><p>Cells were collected in PBS containing 10 mM <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide, and cell extracts were prepared in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1:200-diluted protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma-Aldrich], 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide, and 0.1 mM iodoacetamide). Immunoprecipitation with a mouse monoclonal anti-Flag, HA, or p53 was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woo et al., 2006</xref>). Bound proteins were released in 2&#x000d7; SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto an enhanced chemiluminescence nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond), and visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. p53 SUMOylation was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-p53 followed by Western blotting with anti-SUMO2/3. Results were normalized to the lowest phosphorylation level within each set of experiments, and statistical significance was determined by comparing the mean level of the control group to each of the experimental data points.</p></sec><sec><title>En face immunohistochemistry</title><p>The s-flow and d-flow areas within the aorta were identified based on the published and generally accepted anatomical locations where such flow patterns are known to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iiyama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hajra et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jongstra-Bilen et al., 2006</xref>). For example, a typical s-flow area is located in the greater curvature area and is marked as an LP region for lesion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hajra et al., 2000</xref>), which is also known as a high wall shear stress area. A d-flow area is the lesser curvature area (HP region; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iiyama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hajra et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jongstra-Bilen et al., 2006</xref>), which is also indicated as a low wall shear stress area. In the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref> legend, we indicated these two areas in the aortic arch. EC shape outlined by anti&#x02013;VE-cadherin staining was also used to identify s-flow areas (elongated cell shape) and d-flow areas (irregular cell shape). It has been reported that PECAM-1 (CD31) staining, another marker of ECs, was localized to endothelial junctions in the HP region, whereas in the LP region, it is more diffuse. Therefore, the PECAM-1 staining at EC borders was much stronger in the HP region than in the LP region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hajra et al., 2000</xref>). We found the similar tendency of VE-cadherin staining in the mouse aorta. Because these data were very consistent in every mouse, we do not think that this is caused by the damage that specifically occurred in the LP region. C57BL/6 wild-type mice (Taconic) were fed standard chow. Animals of 6&#x02013;8 wk of age were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. The arterial tree was perfused via the left ventricle with saline containing 40 USPU/ml heparin followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After adipose tissues were removed, aortas were cut open longitudinally and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked by TBS containing 10% goat serum and 2.5% Tween 20 for 30 min. Aortas were incubated with 10 &#x000b5;g/ml rabbit anti-p53 (FL-393; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; rabbit IgG was used as a control) and 7 &#x000b5;g/ml rat anti&#x02013;VE-cadherin (an EC marker; BD) in the blocking solution overnight. Specificity of anti-p53 staining was tested by staining with anti-p53 preabsorbed with recombinant p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as shown in Fig. S4. After a PBS rinse, anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG and anti&#x02013;rat IgG (1:1,000 dilution; Alexa Fluor 546 and 488, respectively; Invitrogen) were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using TO-PRO3 (Invitrogen). For the detection of apoptosis, we used two different methods. To perform an in situ TUNEL assay, aortas immunostained with anti&#x02013;VE-cadherin (with Alexa Fluor 546 anti&#x02013;rabbit IgG) were incubated in the TUNEL reaction mixture (Roche) for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (mixture without the enzyme TdT as a control). For annexin V labeling, we injected annexin V&#x02013;Alexa Fluor 568 into aortas via the left ventricle after perfusion with saline containing 40 USPU/ml heparin followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Then, these aortas were immunostained with anti&#x02013;VE-cadherin as described in the previous paragraph. Images were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Fluoview 300; Olympus) equipped with krypton/argon/HeNe laser lines and 20&#x000d7; 0.70 NA, 40&#x000d7; 1.0 NA, and 60&#x000d7; 1.4 NA objectives. For quantification of phospho- and total PKC&#x003b6; expression level, 10&#x02013;15 optical sections were collected at 0.3&#x02013;0.5-&#x000b5;m increments so that z stacks of &#x0223c;4-&#x000b5;m-thick cell blocks from the luminal surface were obtained. Images were collected using the same confocal settings. For quantification of EC apoptosis, aortas of 7-wk-old wild-type mice (<italic>n</italic> = 7 each) were prepared. Images were acquired as described in the previous paragraph. To analyze p53 subcellular localization, we took z-stack clip images of 50 optical sections collected at 0.1-&#x000b5;m increments from the luminal surface. We radially extended the edge of the nucleus by the length of the nuclear radius at each point along the edge of the nucleus and delineated an area for each cell. We defined the signal level in this area as total because practically all anti-p53 staining signals (&#x0003e;80&#x02013;90%) were included in this area. Staining signal levels in the cytoplasm and the nucleus were determined. Confocal images were obtained from s-flow and d-flow areas as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are reported as means &#x000b1; SD.
