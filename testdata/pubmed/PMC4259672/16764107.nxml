Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)</p><p>Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity
(ORI) and the Assistant Secretary for Health have taken final
action in the following case:</p><p>Steven Anthony Leadon, Ph.D., University of North Carolina:
Based on the report of an investigation conducted by the University
of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill and additional analysis
conducted by ORI in its oversight review, the U.S. Public Health
Service (PHS) found that Steven Anthony Leadon, Ph.D., former
Professor of Radiation Oncology, Department of Radiology, School of
Medicine, UNC, engaged in scientific misconduct while supported by
National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health
(NIH), grant R01 CA40453-09 to 15.</p><p>Specifically, PHS found that Dr. Leadon engaged in scientific
misconduct by falsifying DNA samples and constructing falsified
figures for experiments done in his laboratory to support claimed
findings of defects in a DNA repair process that involved rapid
repair of DNA damage in the transcribed strand of active genes,
included in four grant applications and in eight publications and
one published manuscript, which were included as an Appendix to the
Voluntary Exclusion Agreement entered into by Dr. Leadon and are as
follows:</p><p>Figures 1, 2, and 3 in the article by Gowen, L.C., Avrutskaya,

Required for Transcription-Coupled Repair of Oxidation DNA
Damage.'' Science 281:109-1012, 1988. In grant application 2 R01
CA40453-14 (p. 9), this article was used as justification for
proposed research on BRCA1 and related proteins that may be
required for transcription-coupled DNA repair of oxidative DNA
damage. Data from the research reported in this paper was also used
as preliminary data (Figure 2, p. 16) to support proposed
experiments on BRCA1.</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Figures 1A, 2A, and 3 in the article by Leadon, S.A. &#x00026;

misconduct. His position is that a systematic error was introduced
into the experiments in question and he recognizes that it could
have influenced or accounted for the results. Dr. Leadon states
that he has entered into a Voluntary Exclusion Agreement
(Agreement) because he cannot sustain the significant financial
burden of a legal proceeding to resolve the disagreements between
his position and that of HHS. By entering into this Agreement, Dr.
Leadon has voluntarily agreed:</p><p>(1) To exclude himself from knowingly contracting or
subcontracting with any agency of the United States Government and
from eligibility or knowing involvement in nonprocurement programs
of the United States Government referred to as ``covered
transactions'' as defined in the debarment regulations at 45 CFR
Part 76 for a period of five (5) years, beginning on May 10,
2006;<bold><break/></bold><bold><break/></bold>
(2) To exclude himself from serving in any advisory capacity to PHS
including, but not limited, to service on any PHS advisory
committee, board, and/or peer review committee, or as consultant
for a period of five (5) years, beginning on May 10, 2006;
and<bold><break/></bold><bold><break/></bold>
(3) To submit letters of retraction to the editors of the journals
listed below within ten (10) business days from the effective date
of this Agreement, stating as follows:<bold><break/></bold><bold><break/></bold>
