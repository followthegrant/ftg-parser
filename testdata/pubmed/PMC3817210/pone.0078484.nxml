In the purple sweet potato (<italic>Ipomoea batatas</italic> Lam.) cv. Ayamurasaki, expression of the <italic>IbDFR</italic> gene was strongly associated with anthocyanin accumulation in leaves, stems and roots. Overexpression of the <italic>IbDFR</italic> in Arabidopsis <italic>tt3</italic> mutants fully complemented the pigmentation phenotype of the seed coat, cotyledon and hypocotyl. Downregulation of <italic>IbDFR</italic> expression in transgenic sweet potato (DFRi) using an RNAi approach dramatically reduced anthocyanin accumulation in young leaves, stems and storage roots. In contrast, the increase of flavonols quercetin-3-O-hexose-hexoside and quercetin-3-O-glucoside in the leaves and roots of DFRi plants is significant. Therefore, the metabolic pathway channeled greater flavonol influx in the DFRi plants when their anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin accumulation were decreased. These plants also displayed reduced antioxidant capacity compared to the wild type. After 24 h of cold treatment and 2 h recovery, the wild-type plants were almost fully restored to the initial phenotype compared to the slower recovery of DFRi plants, in which the levels of electrolyte leakage and hydrogen peroxide accumulation were dramatically increased. These results provide direct evidence of anthocyanins function in the protection against oxidative stress in the sweet potato. The molecular characterization of the <italic>IbDFR</italic> gene in the sweet potato not only confirms its important roles in flavonoid metabolism but also supports the protective function of anthocyanins of enhanced scavenging of reactive oxygen radicals in plants under stressful conditions.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Basic Research Program (Grant No. 2013CB127000), the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (2012AA101204), and Shanghai Municipal Afforestation &#x00026; City Appearance and Environmental Sanitation Administration (G102410, F132427).

Anthocyanin biosynthesis has been well characterized in several plants, such as Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>), maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>), snapdragon (<italic>Anfirrhinum majus</italic>) and petunia (<italic>Petunia hybrida</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0078484-WinkelShirley1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Gonzalez1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Pourcel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Petroni1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. First, the upstream phenylpropanoid pathway converts the substrate L-phenylalanine to 4-coumarate CoA using phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumarate CoA ligase (4CL). Next, 4-coumarate CoA is catalyzed by chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI) and flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) to form dihydroflavonol. Finally, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) catalyzes dihydroflavanones to leucoanthocyanidins, which then are converted to anthocyanidin by anthocyanindin synthase (ANS). Therefore, DFR is a key enzyme in anthocyanin biosynthesis that controls the carbon flux direction. Simplified scheme of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078484.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p><p>DFR has also been known to affect the biosynthesis of other flavonoids, e.g. flavonols and proanthocyanidin <xref rid="pone.0078484-Almeida1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Pourcel2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The substrate dihydroflavonol of DFR can be catalyzed by FLS to produce flavonols, and the leucoanthocyanidins that result from DFR can subsequently be converted to proanthocyanidin by leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) <xref rid="pone.0078484-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Martens1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Yoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These are the two key branches in flavonoid pathways. Therefore, further understanding of DFR function in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in plants is of importance.</p><p>DFR uses NADPH as a cofactor to catalyze the reduction of dihydroflavonols to their respective colorless, unstable leucoanthocyanidins, which are common precursors for anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0078484-Pourcel1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Szankowski1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-White1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

In Arabidopsis, <italic>tt3</italic> (<italic>transparent testa</italic>) mutants lacking DFR activities failed to accumulate the brown tannins of proanthocyanidin in their seed coats. In addition, those mutants showed no anthocyanin pigments within the cotyledon or hypocotyl when grown in Murashige and Skoog media with a low nitrogen content unlike wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis seedlings, which had strong red pigmentation <xref rid="pone.0078484-Shirley1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

Due to their crucial role in the flavonoid pathway, various DFR genes have been isolated from other species such as grape (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>), apple (<italic>Malus domestica</italic>), pear (<italic>Pyrus communis</italic>), sweet orange (<italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>) and petunia (<italic>Petunia hybrida</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0078484-Beld1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-LoPiero1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Sparvoli1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Attention is now being focused on the purple sweet potato (<italic>Ipomoea batatas</italic> Lam.) because of its unique color and its nutritive and health-promoting benefits <xref rid="pone.0078484-Mano1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Montilla1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

For example, twenty-six anthocyanins were detected and characterized in the aqueous extract of the purple line cell line. These anthocyanins are exclusively cyanidin or peonidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucosides and their acylated derivatives <xref rid="pone.0078484-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Many studies have reported that purple sweet potato anthocyanins can protect the rat liver from hepatoxin-induced injury <xref rid="pone.0078484-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and have the antioxidative ability to scavenge active oxygen radicals <xref rid="pone.0078484-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. However, due to the unclear genetic background of those materials in those studies (i.e., the sweet potato is a vegetatively propagated allopolyploidy root crop), it is difficult to confirm the pharmaceutical function of sweet potato anthocyanins. Therefore, it is essential to use sweet potato with the same genetic background with or without anthocyanins to study the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and function. Meanwhile, flavonoids as antioxidants also protect plants under stressful conditions, but their biological function has not yet to be confirmed in sweet potato.</p><p>In the present study, we isolated the <italic>IbDFR</italic> gene from sweet potato and investigated its expression profiles in various tissues.

Generally, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents in the leaves of WT and transgenic lines were increased during cold treatment (Figures 8B,8D), indicating an enhanced ROS turnover during cold stress. After 24 h, all transgenic lines accumulated significantly more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in their leaves than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078484-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). For example, the change of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content in the DFRi-8 sample was from 63.8 &#x000b5;M to 101 &#x000b5;M, a 37.2-&#x000b5;M increase; for the WT, from 38.3 &#x000b5;M to 64.1 &#x000b5;M, only a 25.8 &#x000b5;M increase. Obviously, there was an increase in ROS accumulation in the transgenic plants compared with the WT. Thus, anthocyanins show antioxidant properties in sweet potato <italic>in vivo</italic> and protect the plants from oxidative damage under abiotic stress by increasing ROS scavenging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In flavonoid biosynthesis, DFR is a key enzyme in the catalysis of the stereospecific reduction of dihydroflavonols to leucoanthocyanidins that uses NADPH as a cofactor. It has been reported that anthocyanin concentration and DFR enzymatic activity are strongly correlated with flower pigmentation and during fruit ripening <xref rid="pone.0078484-Hisatomi1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Rosati1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Although the sequences of DFRs in sweet potato had been reported <xref rid="pone.0078484-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, the function of DFR in purple sweet potato has been less addressed and remains largely unknown. In this report, the expression pattern and function of <italic>IbDFR</italic> in purple sweet potato were intensively studied. <italic>IbDFR</italic> expression was strongly associated with anthocyanin accumulation in different organs and development, which suggests that <italic>IbDFR</italic> expression is a key step in anthocyanin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078484-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As evidenced in the DFRi transgenic plants, the accumulation of purple pigment in their leaves, stems and storage roots was dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078484-g004">Figures 4A-C</xref>). Furthermore, the pigmentation phenotype in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was fully complemented in the <italic>tt3</italic> mutants that express the <italic>IbDFR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078484-g003">Figure 3</xref>). When the anthocyanin biosynthesis branch was blocked, the proanthocyanidin metabolites decreased but flavonol biosynthesis increased, as evidenced by the increase of quercetin-3-O-hexose-hexoside and quercetin-3-O-glucoside significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078484-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that the change of <italic>IbDFR</italic> gene expression affects the flavonoid flux in purple sweet potato.</p><p>Anthocyanins and flavonols share common precursors, dihydroflavonols, which are substrates for both flavonol synthase and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase. Two quercetin derivatives were identified and characterized as the major flavonols in the DFRi and WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078484-g005">Figures 5A-C</xref>), which are consistent with a previous report of two major flavonols of sweet potato <xref rid="pone.0078484-Chun1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The increased accumulation of the two flavonol components in the DFRi plants indicates that, when the anthocyanin accumulation is inhibited, the increased conversion of dihydrokaempferol to quercetin by FLS and production of flavonols might occur. It has been reported that inactivation of DFR increases accumulation of quercetin in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0078484-Pelletier1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, whereas <italic>fls1</italic> mutants have elevated anthocyanin content <xref rid="pone.0078484-Owens1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Stracke1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Our results agree with these findings and indicate that metabolic flux in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway is controlled by substrate competition between FLS and DFR. It is likely that the change of FLS-to-DFR ratio in DFRi plant causes the increased accumulation of flavonols.</p><p>The redirection of the metabolic flux toward flavonols through downregulation of <italic>DFR</italic> offers a practical approach to the metabolic engineering of plant flavonoids. Indeed, under different biotic and abiotic stress, the fluctuation between flavonols and anthocyanins had been observed in many plants <xref rid="pone.0078484-Downey1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Mori1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Ramakrishna1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. This reflects that, as an integrative pathway, the metabolic flux of anthocyanin and other flavonoid biosynthetic pathways can be affected by environmental factors, leading to an alternative channel. The increase of the major flavonols, quercetin-3-O-hexose-hexoside and quercetin-3-O-glucoside, in DFRi transgenic sweet potato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078484-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) might also suggest that blocking the anthocyanin biosynthesis causes the increase of flavonols possibly by increased substrates.</p><p>Using the WT and transgenic sweet potato, the ROS scavenging capacity of anthocyanins was validated <italic>in vivo</italic> with or without stressful conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078484-g007">Figure 7</xref>), although a few studies have shown a similar effect using extracted anthocyanins from various sweet potato genotypes <xref rid="pone.0078484-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Ju1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Kano1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The reduced antioxidant activity in sweet potato lacking anthocyanins also confirmed the protective function of anthocyanins in plants as a conserved mechanism of stress resistance.</p><p>It has reported that anthocyanin-rich sweet potato could enhance the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, CAT and GPX, in rat livers <xref rid="pone.0078484-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The complexity of nutritional components in sweet potato creates uncertainty in the direct evaluation of anthocyanin functions as reported by Davies <xref rid="pone.0078484-Davies2" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Use of the WT and DFRi transgenic sweet potato plants will provide suitable material for various studies under the same genetic background except for the anthocyanin pathways. The reduced antioxidant capacity and greater sensitivity to cold treatment of the DFRi transgenic plants compared to the WT plants implies the important biological role of anthocyanins against oxidative stresses <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078484-g006">Figures 6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078484-g007">7</xref>). Plants under abiotic stress have evolved a defense system against oxidative stress by increasing the activity of ROS scavenging enzymes <xref rid="pone.0078484-Gill1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Many investigators have demonstrated that purple sweet potato could improve the antioxidative activity within cells because of its strong free radical scavenging activity <xref rid="pone.0078484-Kano1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Philpott1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078484-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Abiotic stresses such as low temperature, which is known to disturb redox homeostasis in plant cells, could induce ROS production, resulting in oxidative stress. ROS have been implicated in all stress types, and if they are not scavenged sufficiently, programmed cell death might occur <xref rid="pone.0078484-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. In our study, oxidative stress was enhanced in the cold-stressed leaves of the sweet potato as reflected by the increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content and ion leakage; however, these stress levels were much higher in the transgenic plants than in the WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078484-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These observations strongly support the notion that anthocyanins participate in maintaining ROS homeostasis during the plant development and growth, a finding that is in agreement with those of earlier reports <xref rid="pone.0078484-Mylona1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Thus, improvement of stress tolerance by enriching anthocyanin production in plants is considered an alternative approach to the nutritional point of view in crop improvement.</p><p>In conclusion, this study validated the biological function of the <italic>IbDFR</italic> gene in anthocyanin biosynthesis. The changes of anthocyanin accumulation by the downregulation of <italic>IbDFR</italic> expression also influence the flux distribution of other flavonoids, such as flavonols and proanthocyanidins, in purple sweet potato. We also verified the antioxidant property of anthocyanins in sweet potato, mainly through the induction or activation of ROS scavenging. Thus, this study has increased our understanding of DFR function in flavonoid metabolism, although some questions, such as how anthocyanin improves the ROS-scavenging capacity, remain to be answered. Nevertheless, the purple sweet potato and its transgenic plants provide invaluable sources of information for nutrition studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0078484.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
