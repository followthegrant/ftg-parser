It is reported that the ancient Greeks used silver coins as a way of disinfecting stored liquids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the late 1800's, silver nitrate solutions were used to prevent ocular infections in neonates. These same solutions were also found to be effective against typhoid and anthrax bacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Colloidal silver was approved by the FDA for use in wound treatment in 1920 and through the first half of the 20<sup>th </sup>century was used in applications such as decreasing the rubor in non-healing wounds and controlling infection in burn wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Around the Second World War and with the advent of sulfonamide drugs and heavier use of antibiotics, the use of silver decreased. Approximately 30 years later, silver began to receive renewed clinical attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Precious metals, including silver, gold, and platinum, have the lowest side effects when in contact with the skin of humans and animals. Of these, silver has been used in a variety of applications such as treating skin diseases and other medical services because silver has antimicrobial activity and is not harmful to human beings. In order to employ the antimicrobial activity of silver, antimicrobial fibers, which were obtained by physically binding silver to cellulose, latex, polyethylene, polypropylene and the like, have been widely used in the field of the medical services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The characteristics of silver which contribute to its scientific interest are as follows. First, yeasts, fungi, viruses, and a broad spectrum of anaerobic, aerobic, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative bacteria are susceptible to the effects of ionic silver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. As an advantage for its use in clinical applications, silver has also been categorized to be "oligodynamic", in that large bactericidal effects can be achieved by very small quantities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the active, soluble form as Ag<sup>+ </sup>or Ag<sup>0 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], a proposed mechanism of action in bacteria is to interfere with DNA replication, inhibit electron transport, and/or cause conformational changes on the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Second, when used in proper concentrations, the amount of silver necessary to exhibit antimicrobial activity is, for the most part, not toxic to mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Third, bacteria has a relatively low propensity to develop a tolerance to silver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The most important, recently used silver compounds include silver sulfadiazine (AgSD), metallic silver, silver acetate, and silver proteins. The silver compounds are used to prevent the infection in burn regions and ocular diseases and to eradicate warts, but some types of silver have had problems associated with cytotoxicity. In recent years, bandages have been treated with silver nitrate to obtain silver-engrafted bandages. However, the silver-engrafted bandages still have problems associated with the cytotoxicity to human beings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and silver leaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Cellulose, which is a common wound dressing, has also been impregnated with silver by a variety of methods. One method impregnated cellulose with silver nanoparticles by reducing silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>) with sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>). The nanoparticles formed small spheres that were evenly adsorbed throughout the cellulose. When tested against <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, the antimicrobial efficacy was found to be more than 99.99% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Another method used cellulose acetate (CA) that was produced by electrospinning fibers with AgNO<sub>3</sub>. The CA nanofibers were then irradiated by UV light at 245 nm to produce Ag nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Similar steps were followed to produce silver nanoparticles in CA, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) matrices for testing antimicrobial properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although these products do have varying degrees of antimicrobial efficacy, the continued development of products with maximized antimicrobial properties, good biocompatibility, and low cytotoxicity is a priority.</p><p>As described above, silver must be permanently engrafted into cellulose. The technology of permanently fixing silver in cellulose can be applied to fibers of medical wool or cotton, and is useful in a large number of applications including wood preservation, antibiotic bandages, water purification, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrate a method of making silver-impregnated cellulose (SIC), comprised of associating ionic silver with water soluble polymers, thus introducing the Ag+-polymer complex into the cellulose matrix. <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, <italic>Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas putida</italic>, and <italic>E. coli </italic>were used for antimicrobial testing. To determine the effects of silver on cytotoxicity to human cells, five different concentrations of SIC were tested on human fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Analytical Methods</title><p>Qualitative elemental analysis was conducted using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP, Perkin-Elmer Optima 3000 DV).

Oral cotton pellets (natural cotton pellets slightly coated with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC)) were then added to the resulting solutions to allow the cellulose matrix to react with the silver, thus to form cellulose-OAg complexes. These reactions were carried out for 24 hours. Upon completion, the cellulose-OAg complexes were washed three times with water, and then dried. The final pH levels of the cellulose-OAg complexes were within a range of 6 to 8.

AgCl, the source of silver for this reaction, reacts according to Equation 1 when dissolved in NH<sub>4</sub>OH. H+ was generally released from the cellulose hydroxyl group at the C-3 position because it had the highest acidity, causing the formation of an alkoxylate radical (R-O<sup>-</sup>). The cellulose radical (R-O<sup>-</sup>) was reacted with silver ions chemically binding the two components and forming a compound with a possible conformation that illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.<disp-formula id="bmcM1"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="1754-1611-3-20-i2.gif"/></disp-formula></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Possible conformation of the compound formed by a cellulose radical binding to silver ions</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1754-1611-3-20-1"/></fig><p>One silver ion may have up to four ligands, and hydroxyl groups in positions C-2 and C-3 of cellulose may bind to metal ions in a bidentate form. The silver bound in the alkoxylate form at the C-3 position and the interactions between the other hydroxyl groups cause the formation of a chelate compound, which prevents the metal ions from being leached in aqueous solutions. The cellulose-OAg complex represents a chemical bond between silver and the cellulose matrix. In addition to the chemical bonds, the silver physically binds to the cellulose, that is, silver is present in cellulose in the form of Ag<sub>2</sub>O, Ag and AgCl. The chemical binding of silver to cellulose to form the cellulose-OAg complex occured with a silver concentration of 0.0035 Ag w/v% in NH<sub>4</sub>OH solution. If the concentration of silver was below 0.0035 w/v%, no detectable physical binding of the silver was observed (See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). When the silver impregnated cellulose pellets are re-dissolved in water, no detectable amount of silver particle was leached from the cellulose-OAg complex. If the concentration of silver was below 0.0035 Ag w/v%, detectable amount of silver by ICP was the amount of the silver chemically bonded to cotton (cellulose matrix).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>ESEM picture of silver-coated cotton</bold>.

When NH<sub>4</sub>OH reacts with AgCl, other residual compounds are not formed except for NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, which is not harmful to humans. In this study, natural cellulose was used as the cellulose matrix. This cellulose is nontoxic and biodegradable, and has a huge pelletized surface area, making it ideal for environmental and medical applications. Cellulose may be obtained from various sources including both woody plants and non-woody plants, but the present invention is not particularly limited thereto. The cellulose-OAg complex is formed by the chemical binding of silver to the cellulose matrix. As a result, the cellulose-OAg complex is endowed with antimicrobial activity. The lowest concentration of silver in the matrix, which is sufficient for showing antimicrobial activity, is approximately 0.01 mg/g. This antimicrobial activity may be achieved using an NH<sub>4</sub>OH solution in which silver is present in a concentration of 0.00035 w/v% or more. When the silver concentration in the NH<sub>4</sub>OH solution is below this range, the silver chemically or physically bound to the cellulose matrix does not provide sufficient antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity is improved with an increased concentration of silver. However, exceeding a concentration 7.5 Ag w/v% is economically undesirable because of the limited solubility of AgCl in the NH<sub>4</sub>OH solution. When silver is present in excessive concentrations, it may be toxic to human cells. Therefore, the silver concentration should not exceed approximately 0.35 Ag w/v %, at which point the material begins to show cellular toxicity to the human cells. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established classifications for approximately 1,700 different generic types of devices and grouped them into 16 medical specialties referred to as panels. Each of these generic types of devices is assigned to one of three regulatory classes based on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. The three classes and the requirements which apply to them are: Class I (General Controls), Class II (General Controls and Special Controls), and Class III (General Controls and Premarket Approval). General Controls are the baseline requirements of the FDA Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&#x00026;C) Act that apply to all medical devices, Class I, II, and III. To use silver coated cotton as a medical device, test for <italic>in vitro </italic>cytotoxicity is initially required. Our <italic>in vitro </italic>cytotoxicity test meets the requirement of the test as per International Organization for Standardization (ISO 10993-5 Biological Evaluation of medical devices - Part 5: Tests for <italic>in vitro </italic>cytotoxicity, Reference Number ISO 10993-5:2009).</p><p>The status of binding (chemical or physical) between the cellulose and silver was shown in ESEM photographs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). When the silver solution was used in concentrations of 0.035 to 0.35 w/v %, silver crystals was formed on the surface of cellulose (cotton). However, no detectable physical binding of the silver was observed in concentrations of 0.0035 w/v % or less. The silver crystals had a hexagonal shape and their size was approximately 1 to 10 &#x003bc;m in diameter. If the silver crystals were brought in contact with the human body, these crystals could possibly enter the blood stream and accumulate in blood vessels having a diameter of approximately 20 &#x003bc;m. The components were analyzed using an energy dispersive x-ray analysis system (EDS). The distribution of each component obtained from the x-ray analysis system was displayed on the map, and concentrations of the components were derived from an analysis of the EDS-Map (Data not shown). The analysis showed that the chemically bonded ionic silver was uniformly distributed over a surface of the cellulose matrix when the NH<sub>4</sub>OH solution including 0.0035 Ag w/v % or less was used. Also, silver particles were not detected in a leaching test using water as a solvent. These results revealed that silver chemically binds to cellulose by means of the mechanism represented by Equation 1. But we cannot exclude that silver ion still can be released from the cellulose-OAg complex.</p><p>The mechanism of the antimicrobial action of silver ions is not well characterized yet, but is closely related to their interaction with thiol groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], although other target sites remain a possibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These and other findings imply that interaction of Ag<sup>+ </sup>with thiol groups in enzymes and proteins plays an essential role in bacterial inactivation, although other cellular components may be involved. Hydrogen bonding, the effects of hydrogen bond-breaking agents, and the specificity of Ag<sup>+ </sup>for thiol groups were discussed in greater detail by Russell and Hugo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Virucidal properties might also be explained by binding to thiol groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Lukens proposed that silver salts and other heavy metals such as copper act by binding to key functional groups of fungal enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Ag<sup>+ </sup>causes the release of K<sup>+ </sup>ions from microorganisms and the microbial cytoplasmic membrane is are associated with many important enzymes and is an important target site for Ag<sup>+ </sup>activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In addition to its effects on enzymes, Ag<sup>+ </sup>produces other changes in microorganisms. Silver nitrate causes marked inhibition of <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans </italic>growth and is deposited in the vacuole and cell wall as granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Ag<sup>+ </sup>also inhibits cell division and damages the cell envelope and contents of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Bacterial cells increase in size, and the cytoplasmic membrane, cytoplasmic contents, and outer cell layers all exhibit structural abnormalities, although without any blebs (protuberances) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The question that puzzles researchers most is how silver ions exhibit lower cytotoxicity to human cells, while showing significant anti-microbial effects. The answer may lie in the difference in membrane structure and enzyme properties between human cells and bacterial cells. It may also depend on the concentration of ionic silver and the structure of silver-polymer complex with cellulose. Furthermore, SIC, which has no particle leaching problems and no particle formation during molecular coating within a defined concentration range, has increased beneficial effects on human cells with increased antimicrobial activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Ag Biotech LLC provided the experimental materials including silver-impregnated cellulose and supported publication costs.
