Anti-inflammatory effects of MEAP were evaluated by using the ear edema test induced by dimethylbenzene and vascular permeability test induced by acetic acid. Anti-nociceptive activities of MEAP were evaluated by the chemical nociception in models of acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced hind paw licking, and by the thermal nociception in hot plate tests. Mechanisms of MEAP activities also were explored by evaluating expression levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and iNOS induced by LPS using real-time fluorogenic PCR and expression of COX-2 using Western blotting and an open-field test. The results indicated that the MEAP administered orally could significantly decrease ear edema induced by dimethylbenzene and increase vascular permeability induced by acetic acid. Additionally, the nociceptions induced by acetic acid and formalin were significantly inhibited. The anti-nociceptive effect could not be decreased by naloxone in the formalin test, and MEAP did not affect the normal autonomic activities of mice. Expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, iNOS) induced by LPS were decreased obviously by treatment with MEAP. Furthermore, COX-2 expression in the spinal dorsal horns of the pain model mice induced by formalin was significantly down-regulated by MEAP. In conclusion, MEAP has significant anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities, and the mechanisms may be related to the down-regulated expression of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81102901).

Inflammation is commonly associated with pain as a secondary process, resulting from the secretion of analgesic mediators <xref rid="pone.0089149-Osadebe1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. To protect against outer stimuli or tissue injury, various pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and nitric oxide (NO), are released by the host cellular immune response system <xref rid="pone.0089149-Nantel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the excessive release of pro-inflammatory mediators may activate the inflammatory cascade reaction, leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) <xref rid="pone.0089149-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a major pain enhancing inflammatory mediator, can be induced by cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in the process of inflammation. Previous investigations have demonstrated that it is beneficial for treating inflammatory diseases to down-regulate the expression of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and COX-2 <xref rid="pone.0089149-Chiu1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089149-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089149-Bogdan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>

In our study, MEAP showed a significant topical anti-inflammatory activity. However, assessment by the dimethylbenzene-induced ear edema model alone cannot be used to ascertain the anti-inflammatory effects of MEAP. Increased vascular permeability is an early and important vascular event in the inflammatory response <xref rid="pone.0089149-Khor1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Thus, the vascular permeability test was carried out to further demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of MEAP, which exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the increased vascular permeability in mice. Results from all of the animal model tests for anti-inflammation demonstrated the notable dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activities of MEAP, with the highest activity exhibited at the dose of 400 mg/kg. Furthermore, inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators can serve as a potential method for treatment of inflammatory diseases. In our investigations, MEAP was found also to significantly inhibit the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and iNOS) induced by LPS in RAW 264.7 cells, which is another line of evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory effects of MEAP.</p><p>The acetic acid-induced writhing test is the most useful model for preliminary studies of anti-nociceptive activity <xref rid="pone.0089149-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Intraperitoneal injections of acetic acid induces nociception though activation of chemosensitive nociceptors, or visceral surface irritation, leading to release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine, bradykinin, prostaglandin and serotonin <xref rid="pone.0089149-Leite1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In our study, MEAP showed significant anti-nociceptive activities in a dose-dependent manner in the acetic acid-induced writhing tests in mice. In addition, the acetic acid-induced writhing test is commonly used for evaluation of peripheral anti-nociceptive activity of drugs. Acetic acid can indirectly induce the release of endogenous mediators and stimulate the nociceptive neurons that are sensitive to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) <xref rid="pone.0089149-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>The hot plate test is widely used for evaluating central anti-nociceptive activities <xref rid="pone.0089149-Arslan2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Results of the hot plate test in our present study indicated that MEAP is not a centrally acting analgesic. Therefore, we presumed that the MEAP exerts peripheral anti-nociceptive activities and performed the formalin test to confirm the hypothesis. The formalin test is a pain model consisting of two different phases, which can be separated in time. The early phase is generated peripherally through the activation of nociceptive neurons by the direct action of formalin, and the late phase refers to the inflammatory pain response involving the release of molecules such as prostaglandin, histamine and serotonin <xref rid="pone.0089149-Devaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In our present study, the MEAP mainly suppressed pain of the late phase, which suggested that the anti-nociceptive mechanism of MEAP is related to the peripheral anti-nociceptive activity. This result was confirmed by testing MEAP in combination with naloxone (antagonist of morphine). By using the open-field test, a behavior model used to study exploratory and motor activity, we observed no obvious changes of locomotor activity (related to the central nervous system), which provided another piece of solid evidence to support the peripheral anti-nociceptive mechanism of MEAP activity.</p><p>Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the key enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandins, and COX-2, an inducible enzyme, is responsible for the production of the pro-inflammatory prostaglandins <xref rid="pone.0089149-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Many former investigations have shown the important role of COX-2 in the induction of pain and inflammation as well as the analgesic actions of NSAIDs. In addition, COX-2 can induce synthesis of PGE, and the PGE<sub>2</sub> released in inflamed tissues sensitizes the terminals of afferent nerve fibers, thereby enhancing nociceptive processing within the spinal cord and brain to evoke hyperalgesia <xref rid="pone.0089149-Svensson1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Thus, one apparently feasible approach against nociception is to suppress the release of COX-2. In our study, MEAP significantly and dose-dependently inhibited expression of COX-2 in the spinal dorsal horns of pain model mice induced by formalin, which indicated that MEAP may be a potent COX-2 inhibitor.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the experimental evidence acquired in our present study indicated that administration of MEAP can significantly suppress the ear edema induced by dimethylbenzene and vascular permeability induced by acetic acid. Furthermore, the MEAP could inhibit pain reflexes in response to chemical nociception induced by acetic acid and formalin. The results obtained in our present investigation also revealed that the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of MEAP may be related to the decreased expression levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2. However, further investigations are required to conclusively determine the bioactive compounds from MEAP.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0089149-Chiu1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
