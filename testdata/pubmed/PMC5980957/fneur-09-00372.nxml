In this study, we hypothesized that a mTBI during adolescence would predispose toward poorer neurobehavioral and neuropathological outcomes after a subsequent injury at adulthood. Mice received a mild weight drop injury (mTBI) at adolescence (postnatal day 35; P35) and/or at adulthood (P70). Mice were randomized to 6 groups: <italic>&#x02018;sham&#x02019;</italic> (sham-surgery at P35 only); <italic>&#x02018;P35&#x02019;</italic> (mTBI at P35 only); <italic>&#x02018;P35</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>sham&#x02019;</italic> (mTBI at P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;sham at P70); <italic>&#x02018;sham</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>P70&#x02019;</italic> (sham at P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;mTBI at P70); <italic>&#x02018;sham</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>sham&#x02019;</italic> (sham at both P35 and P70); or <italic>&#x02018;P35</italic>&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>P70&#x02019;</italic> (mTBI at both P35 and P70). Acute apnea and an extended righting reflex time confirmed a mTBI injury at P35 and/or P70. Cognitive, psychosocial, and sensorimotor function was assessed over 1-week post-injury. Injured groups performed similarly to sham controls across all tasks. Immunofluorescence staining at 1&#x02009;week detected an increase in glial activation markers in Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 brains only. Strikingly, 63% of Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 mice exhibited a skull fracture at impact, compared to 13% of P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 mice. Micro computed tomography of parietal skull bones found that a mTBI at P35 resulted in increased bone volume and strength, which may account for the difference in fracture incidence. In summary, a single mTBI to the adolescent mouse brain did not exacerbate the cerebral effects of a subsequent mTBI in adulthood. However, the head impact at P35 induced significant changes in skull bone structure and integrity. These novel findings support future investigation into the consequences of mTBI on skull bone.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mild traumatic brain injury</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000065</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">National Health and Medical Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000925</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn03">La Trobe University<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001215</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="79"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="10460"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) during sports and recreational activities are a common injury in children and adolescents, with an estimated 1.1&#x02013;1.9 million cases occurring annually in the US (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Adolescents appear to have a particularly high incidence of mTBI (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In high school students, mTBI accounts for 5&#x02013;13% of all sporting injuries (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In addition to a high incidence, evidence suggests that the adolescent brain may be particularly sensitive to the consequences of a mTBI compared to injuries sustained during childhood or adulthood (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Disruption of key developmental processes ongoing during adolescence are hypothesized to be responsible for prolonged symptoms often observed after brain injury at this age compared to adults (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>For many professional and amateur athletes, exposure to mTBIs is a recurring event, and repetitive mTBIs are associated with poorer outcomes. Repeated mTBIs are prevalent in many collision sports (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and the risk of a TBI is reportedly up to six times higher in an individual with a history of head injury compared to someone with no history (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In addition, a study of over 6,000 high school athletes found that those who suffered two or more mTBIs reported more physical and cognitive symptoms compared to those with only one mTBI (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Indeed, a second injury while still recovering from the first impact is thought to exacerbate the effect of the second hit (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), perhaps as a consequence of ongoing metabolic dysfunction post-injury (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In animal models, repetitive mTBIs have predominantly been shown to result in worsened outcomes including increased neuropathology and the protracted persistence of neurocognitive and psychosocial deficits (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) [as reviewed by Semple et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)]. Conversely, some intriguing studies have conversely detected a degree of neuroprotection or preconditioning afforded by a prior head impact (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>While it is now generally accepted that multiple mTBIs in adult athletes can have cumulative, detrimental effects on brain structure and function, the threshold at which these consequences occur remains unclear. The time interval between successive impacts appears to be an important determinant of outcome (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), although severity, age-at-insult, and the number of repeated injuries probably also play a role. Importantly, it is likely that many professional and amateur athletes who are exposed to a mTBI as adults, were also exposed to mTBI during adolescence <italic>via</italic> participation in sports and recreational activities during their youth (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). For example, an estimated 70% of all football players in the United States are under the age of 14, and football has the highest rate of sports-related mTBI among high school athletes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). A retrospective study of former NFL players aged 40&#x02013;69 found that participation in tackle football prior to the age of 12 (and potential exposure to mTBI at this time) was associated with greater later-life cognitive impairments (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and alterations in gray and white matter structures (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). While methodological limitations have been raised regarding these studies (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), whether a history of mTBI during childhood or adolescence influences an individual&#x02019;s vulnerability to later-life brain injuries is a clinically and socially important question that has yet to be systematically investigated. Such issues can be challenging to address in patient populations, where the interval between early exposure to mTBI and later-life impairments may be many years. Further, a causal relationship cannot be established with cross-sectional patient studies (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, in the current study, we utilized a clinically relevant mouse model of mTBI, mild weight drop (mTBI), to evaluate the effect of a mTBI during adolescence on a subsequent mTBI at adulthood. Neurobehavioral and neuropathological outcomes were assessed, to test the hypothesis that mice receiving a mTBI at both adolescence and adulthood would have poorer neurological outcomes compared to uninjured mice or those with a mTBI at either age only.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 94 C57Bl/6 male mice, sourced from the Walter and Elisa Hall Institute, Melbourne, were used in this study.

Mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in an induction chamber, then maintained at 2% isoflurane <italic>via</italic> nose cone during surgical preparation&#x02014;a longitudinal incision of the scalp to expose the skull, and s.c. administration of the analgesic buprenorphine (0.05&#x02009;mg/kg Temgesic<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Reckitt Benckiser). Ninety seconds after the induction of isoflurane, the mouse was removed from the nose cone and positioned on a stable surface under the weight drop apparatus, for alignment of the impactor rod with the center of the left parietal bone, midway between Bregma and Lambda and lateral of the sagittal suture. The 333&#x02009;g impactor rod fitted with a 3&#x02009;mm diameter tip was then raised to 1.5&#x02009;cm (for mTBI at P35) or 2&#x02009;cm (for mTBI at P70), and released. The release height was scaled according to age at the time of impact, determined from pilot experiments (Data S1 in Supplementary Material), to achieve a comparable injury severity at both time points based upon acute injury measures (e.g., self-righting time; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C,D). Sham-injured mice underwent identical surgical preparation and timing under anesthesia, but did not receive the actual impact. Following mTBI or sham injury, acute injury measures of apnea (latency until normal respiration resumed) and latency to self-right from a supine position were recorded (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The skull was examined for evidence of a visible fracture, defined as a break or depression in the skull. Mice were de-identified and randomized to a numbered code to blind investigators during all subsequent analysis. One hour following injury/sham at P35 and P70, the Neurological Severity Score (NSS) was evaluated. The NSS is a broad assessment of general neurological function, including reflexes, balance, and locomotion, and involves the generation of a composite score out of 10, with 10 indicating greatest impairment and 0 indicating no impairment (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).

An overhead camera tracked the animal&#x02019;s swimming trajectory, for analysis using Ethovision 3.0.15 tracking software (Noldus, SDR Scientific). A 1.63&#x02009;m diameter pool, filled with opaque water (21&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C) was used. Cued task training was conducted for 5 concurrent days prior to the surgery date (i.e., P28&#x02013;33, or P64&#x02013;P68), across two daily blocks of three trials each per day. Each trial ended when the mouse located the hidden platform, located 0.5&#x02009;cm below the water surface, or when 60&#x02009;s had elapsed, at which time the experimenter would guide the mouse to the platform, with time to find the platform as the primary outcome measure. Three trial starting locations (North, South, and East relative to a West-located platform), were used in a random order to prevent successive starts from the same location. On day 1 post-surgery, the &#x0201c;test&#x0201d; consisted of six trials with the platform hidden (consistent with the training phase), followed by three trials with the platform raised and visible, the latter task being to evaluate swim speed (velocity) to check for potentially confounding visual and/or motor deficits. This protocol, with training prior to the injury, was chosen to provide an indication of spatial memory/recall during the acute post-injury phase, while also allowing sufficient time to also test for a range of other behavioral outcomes within the first week post-injury. A similar design has successfully been employed by others to evaluate retrograde amnesia after chemical and mechanical injuries to the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p><p>An accelerating rotarod (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, USA) was used to test sensorimotor function on days 2 and 3 after surgery (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The rotarod accelerated from 4 to 40&#x02009;rpm over a 5&#x02009;min period, and the trial was terminated when the mouse fell from the rod. Performance on three consecutive trials was averaged per mouse, per day. A ledged beam task was also used to assess motor ability on day 2 after surgery (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). This involved placing the mouse on the widest end of a tapered beam on a 30&#x000b0; incline, and video-recording as they traversed the beam toward a darkened cage. Performance was evaluated over a 60&#x02009;cm section of the beam, and an error was defined as a weight bearing step onto the lower ledges of the beam. Errors were averaged from three consecutive trials per mouse.</p><p>An elevated plus maze (EPM; San Diego Instruments, USA) was used to test anxiety-like behavior on day 3 after surgery (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). A 10&#x02009;min trial period was recorded by an overhead video camera, and percent time spent in the open arms relative to closed arms of the maze was quantified using Ethovision tracking software. Social interactions were evaluated in a 36&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup> open field arena, on day 4 after surgery (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In this test, experimental mice were allowed a 10&#x02009;min period of solitary exploration for habituation to the arena, then a naive stranger mouse (sex, strain, and age-matched) was introduced.

Frozen brain sections were thawed and rehydrated, then incubated in blocking solution containing 10% normal donkey serum and 0.1% Triton-X-100 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Primary antibodies to detect glial fibrillary acidic protein (rabbit polyclonal GFAP, DAKO; 1:100), ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (goat polyclonal Iba-1, Abcam; 1:750), and beta amyloid precursor protein (rabbit polyclonal &#x003b2;APP, Invitrogen; 1:750) were applied for overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C.

However, our findings did not support this hypothesis. Instead, mice that received a mTBI at adulthood only (Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70) exhibited a significantly longer period of apnea and latency to self-right compared to sham animals, as well as compared to mice that received two mTBIs (P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70). None of the injured groups showed detectable impairments on any tests for cognitive, psychosocial, or sensorimotor function across the first week post-injury, nor evidence of neurological impairment on the NSS acutely post-injury. At 1&#x02009;week, only Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 mice showed a robust, significant elevation in GFAP and Iba-1 reactivity in the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus, which was surprisingly not present in the P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 group. A higher incidence of skull fracture in the Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 group may have been a confounding factor; however, sub-group analysis found that even those without an overt skull fracture showed pronounced acute injury measures and glial reactivity compared to the other groups, indicating that fracture was not solely accountable for these findings. Instead, investigation of skull bone properties by &#x003bc;CT revealed that a mTBI at P35 resulted in the parietal bone having a greater volume and strength by adulthood, which may have influenced the consequences of a subsequent mTBI at this time. These intriguing findings highlight the need for further research into age-specific effects of mTBI, and a greater understanding of how skull bone responds to concussive and sub-concussive impacts.</p></sec><sec id="S4-2"><title>Differing Thresholds for Neuroinflammatory Versus Neurobehavioral Consequences of mTBI</title><p>We confirmed that a head impact had indeed occurred in the mTBI groups in this study, by quantification of acute injury measures&#x02014;injured mice exhibited a period of apnea immediately following the impact, and a delayed self-righting response compared to sham-operated controls. This response was similar after mTBI at P35 or P70, suggesting that a comparable severity had been induced at these times. Somewhat surprisingly, mTBI failed to result in detectable impairments in any of the neurobehavioral domains examined, including general neurological, cognitive, sensorimotor, and psychosocial. This observation could be attributed to low sensitivity of these assessments to TBI-related deficits. The chosen tasks have previously been used to detect functional deficits in several other models of TBI, however, with sensitivity even for mild, concussive-like injuries (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Another possibility is that we did not examine the optimal time point for functional deficits after mTBI. Many symptoms of mTBI reportedly recover quickly, in both patients and adult animal models, typically resolving within 7&#x02013;10&#x02009;days (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). For example, a recent study by our group detected transient cognitive deficits in the Morris water maze only at 3&#x02009;days after mTBI in adult rats, while more subtle molecular and structural changes were evident until at least 30&#x02009;days after injury (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Further, a recent study by Tagge and colleagues, who reported very acute (2&#x02009;min post-injury) and transient neurobehavioral deficits after experimental mTBI, which had resolved by reassessment at 3&#x02009;h post-injury (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). This suggests that, for a very mild insult, even the 1&#x02009;h time point for evaluation of the NSS score may have missed some transient deficits resulting from the head impact. A third possibility is that our injuries were simply below the threshold required to induce detectable neurobehavioral consequences. Our model may, therefore, be better defined as a &#x0201c;sub-concussive&#x0201d; insult, whereby head impact results in acute dysfunction (delayed righting and apnea) but no overt neurological impairment by 1&#x02009;h post-injury (NSS), nor functional deficits over the first week post-injury. While we acknowledge that not every head impact is necessarily pathological, and the definition of sub-concussion remain controversial as a head impact without the clinical symptoms of a concussion (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), our findings are still of strong interest as even such a minor mechanical impact resulted in changes to the skull bone (after impact at P35) and a neuroinflammatory response (after impact at P70 alone). Despite an increasing concern regarding the consequences of repeated sub-concussive injuries in athletes (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), few experimental studies have focused on this paradigm, and additional studies are clearly warranted.</p><p>Despite the lack of behavioral deficits in this model, we did observe a sub-acute neuroinflammatory response at 1&#x02009;week after mTBI at adulthood, specifically in mice that had also received a sham injury at P35 (i.e., Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 group). This time point, and the markers of interest, were chosen based on previous studies demonstrating that even a single mild head impact can induce glial reactivity and axonal injury, including proliferation and hypertrophy, for at least 10&#x02009;days post-injury (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). In both the cortex and hippocampus ipsilateral to the site of impact, an increase in GFAP and Iba-1 staining reflects an increase in reactive astrocytes and microglia/macrophages, respectively, as a result of cell proliferation, migration, and/or activation (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). This observation is consistent with recent studies from our group, using mTBI in adult mice or mild fluid percussion injury in adult rats, whereby localized glial reactivity was also observed in the absence of behavioral deficits (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). These findings also align with an increasing number of reports of athletes with a history of concussive or sub-concussive injuries, who are clinically asymptomatic yet show persistent changes in functional connectivity or brain biochemistry (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Together, our findings indicate that the threshold at which a mTBI results in glial reactivity is lower than the level of injury required for neurobehavioral deficits or pronounced axonal injury to manifest. Again, this finding is consistent with the recent work by Tagge and colleagues, who recently observed astrogliosis and microgliosis in the ipsilateral cortex from 3&#x02009;days to at least 2&#x02009;weeks after experimental mTBI in mice, despite the resolution of any neurobehavioral impairments by 3&#x02009;h post-injury (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4-3"><title>Does an Adolescent mTBI Result in Poorer Outcomes After a Subsequent mTBI at Adulthood?</title><p>The lack of an exacerbated outcome for the P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 group in terms of neurobehavioral and neuropathological outcomes was surprising, contrary to our hypothesis and the majority of published findings to date in experimental mTBI models. The cumulative effects of repeated mTBI in terms of cognitive (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), sensorimotor (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), and psychosocial deficits (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), as well on the neuroinflammatory response (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), have been well-characterized in adult animals, albeit typically with an inter-injury interval of hours to days (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>).</p><p>Here, we instead chose to focus on the potential consequences of injuries occurring during two distinct developmental periods. The first injury was induced during adolescence, as this is a time when many young athletes, both amateur and professional, are first exposed to mTBIs through involvement in contact sports. Adolescence is a time of ongoing brain maturation and development (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), and several studies have suggested that adolescents have poorer outcomes after mTBIs compared to older athletes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). By examining the effects of a mTBI during adolescence (P35) followed by a second injury at adulthood (P70), we employed a longer interval (5&#x02009;weeks between injuries) compared to most previous repetitive mTBI studies. The time window between injuries is likely to be an important determinant of long-term consequences after repetitive mTBI, with a shorter window ensuring that a second injury occurs while the brain is still recovering from the first (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The very mild nature of our injury model may also have been below the threshold necessary to induce cumulative consequences after a subsequent impact.</p><p>As the weight drop model has not previously been characterized in P35 mice, we first conducted a pilot study and chose the 1.5&#x02009;cm drop height to induce mTBI as it produced apnea and a delayed righting reflex compared to sham controls. The lack of neurobehavioral deficits that one would expect to result from a mTBI does not negate the possibility that repeated impacts at this sub-concussive severity could result in cumulative effects after a second impact at a later time point. Increasing clinical evidence suggests that sub-concussive impacts, defined as a cranial impact that does not result in symptoms associated with concussion, may nevertheless have an adverse long-term effect in some individuals, particularly after repeated exposures (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>)</p><p>In contrast, we unexpectedly found that mice injured at both P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 showed a reduced inflammatory response compared to those injured at P70 only (Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 group). This finding raises the possibility that a head impact at P35 (i.e., adolescence) may have a neuroprotective or pre-conditioning effect on the response to a subsequent head impact at adulthood. This concept is supported by similar findings in a recent rat study, whereby a mTBI at P30 appeared to protect the brain against functional deficits following a second injury at P60 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), as well as evidence that repetitive mTBIs prior to a severe TBI resulted in reduced motor deficits compared to animals with severe TBI alone (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Taken together, it remains unclear whether this apparent beneficial effect of a prior head impact is a consequence of the effect on skull bone, or a phenomenon related to the response of the brain parenchyma itself. Future studies which both exclude or focus on the contribution of skull bone to repeated head impacts are now needed.</p></sec><sec id="S4-4"><title>Altered Skull Bone Properties After a mTBI at Adolescence</title><p>The finding that the Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 group showed a robust neuroinflammatory response compared to all other groups, including P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 mice, may have resulted from the large disparity in the frequency of skull fractures observed in the sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 group at the time of the P70 mTBI (63% compared to only 13% of Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 mice; see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). To consider the effect of this possible confound, we conducted additional statistical analyses of the Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 group, dividing them into those with versus without an apparent fracture. While a fracture clearly had a detrimental effect on latency to self-right and the extent of Iba-1 reactivity, other measures (e.g., the length of acute apnea immediately following injury, and the extent of GFAP reactivity), were not dependent on the presence of a fracture. Thus the increased rate of fractures within the Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 group does not solely explain the observed differences in acute injury measures and neuroinflammation.</p><p>Instead, we present the hypothesis that a head impact at adolescence resulted in some form of pre-conditioning, such that the brain and/or skull bone were more resistant to the consequences of a second impact sustained at P70 compared to those animals that had not received a prior injury. Based on the striking difference in skull fracture rate between these groups, whereby the P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 group had fewer fractures compared to Sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 mice, we focused our attention on the parietal skull bone plate using &#x000b5;CT, comparing those that had an injury at P35 (P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;sham) versus those that only received sham surgeries (sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;sham). One potential limitation of the study is that we did not collect bones from the other injury groups (i.e., those who had also received an impact at P70), so cannot speculate on the additional effect that this had on the calvarium.</p><p>The skull is comprised of internal and external layers of cortical bone separated by trabecular bone known as diploe. At P35 there appears to be little diploe between thin layers of compact bone, and an overall increase in bone volume is observed with increasing age when comparing bone samples collected at 1&#x02009;week compared to 6&#x02009;weeks after P35, consistent with a previous report in the developing rat (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>).</p><p>Independent of this age-dependent change, we observed striking changes in skull bone structure and integrity at 6&#x02009;weeks after P35 mTBI, compared to age-matched sham controls, resulting in bone of increased volume and strength.

As bone thickness influences how a mechanical impact is transduced to the underlying tissue (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>), we hypothesize that increased bone volume in the P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 group resulted in a reduced force of impact on the underlying cortical tissue, resulting in the reduced neuroinflammatory response observed in P35&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 compared to sham&#x02009;+&#x02009;P70 mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Schematic summary of study findings.

In addition, as mTBI was performed with the pericranium intact, direct impact to this tissue may have activated the osteogenic progenitor population of the inner cambium layer, triggering their proliferation and differentiation into osteoblasts (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Osteogenic responses to periosteal trauma are well-characterized following long bone trauma (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>), but have also been observed in the skull following trauma-induced subperiosteal hematoma (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Interestingly, the osteogenic cambial layer is at its thickest in the fetus and gradually becomes thinner with age (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), raising the possibility that trauma to the pericranium and underlying bone could induce a greater osteogenic response in juveniles than in adults. Indeed, the capacity for bone formation may be enhanced at adolescence compared to later in life, as this ability tends to be reduced with age (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Further, several studies have demonstrated that TBI can itself promote bone formation, with enhanced fracture callus formation and heterotopic ossification both common following multitrauma involving TBI (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). As such, we speculate that our findings may also reflect the osteogenic effects of TBI, possibly due to injury-induced activation of bone morphogenic protein and/or neurotrophic signaling. While outside of the scope of the current study design, future experiments incorporating histological techniques are required to reveal the precise mechanisms underlying the observed changes to skull bone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Contrary to our hypothesis, our study found that a single mTBI during adolescence did not exacerbate the short-term neurobehavioral or neuropathological consequences of a subsequent mTBI in adulthood. Instead, a mild head impact during adolescence appeared to protect against glial reactivity in response to mTBI at adulthood, which may be partly but not completely attributed to group differences in the rate of skull fracture. Evidently, future studies are required to delineate the biological mechanisms underlying this difference.</p><p>Importantly, our findings highlight the process of active remodeling of the skull bones during adolescence and adulthood. Mechanical loading in the form of concussive or sub-concussive impacts to the head can influence skull bone structure and function, with possible consequences for how the skull and indeed brain itself responds to a subsequent injury. These findings may have important implications for young athletes exposed to mTBI, although it is clearly premature to consider clinical recommendations as a result of these findings. Nonetheless, our results do support the concept that sub-concussive impacts that do not result in any detectable neurobehavioral impairments may have consequences, either positive or negative, when repetitive in nature.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Datasets are Available on Request</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this manuscript will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher upon request.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, and were approved by the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health Animal Ethics Committee (#15-052-UM).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>BS, SS, and SM conceptualized the study.
