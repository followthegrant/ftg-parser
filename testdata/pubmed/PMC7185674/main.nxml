This novel polysaccharide is noncytotoxic and nonproliferating to normal lymphocytes as well as tumor cell lines at 0&#x02013;1000 &#x003bc;g/ml. It activated different subsets of the lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells (331%), T cells (102%), and B cells (39%) at 100 &#x003bc;g/ml concentration. The significant activation of NK cells is associated with the dose-dependent killing of tumor cells by activated normal lymphocytes in a functional assay. Immune activation by RR1 in normal lymphocytes elicited the synthesis of interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; (1080 pg/ml), IL-6 (21,833 pg/ml), IL-12 p70 (50.19 pg/ml), IL-12 p40 (918.23 pg/ml), IL-18 (27.47 pg/ml), IFN- &#x003b3; (90.16 pg/ml), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; (2225 pg/ml) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (2307 pg/ml) at 100 &#x003bc;g/ml concentration, while it did not induce the production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b2;. The cytokine profile clearly demonstrates the Th1 pathway of T helper cell differentiation essential for cell mediated immunity, with a self-regulatory mechanism for the control of its overproduction. RR1 also activated the complements in the alternate pathway, demonstrated by a stepwise increase in C3a des Arg components. Incidentally, RR1 stimulation did not produce any oxidative stress or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the lymphocytes or any significant increase in nitric oxide production. The water solubility, high molecular mass, activation of lymphocytes especially NK cells, complement activation, Th1 pathway-associated cytokine profile, together with a low level of nitric oxide synthesis and absence of oxidative stress confer important immunoprotective potential to this novel &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucan.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>BRM, biological response modifier</kwd><kwd>CTL, cytotoxic lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>CD, cluster differentiation</kwd><kwd>FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate</kwd><kwd>GSH, reduced glutathione</kwd><kwd>GSSG, oxidized glutathione</kwd><kwd>IFN, interferon</kwd><kwd>LPS, lipopolysaccharide</kwd><kwd>MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein</kwd><kwd>MWCO, molecular weight cut off</kwd><kwd>NK, natural killer</kwd><kwd>NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance</kwd><kwd>NO, nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>PBS, phosphate-buffered saline</kwd><kwd>RPMI, Roswell Park Memorial Institute</kwd><kwd>SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome</kwd><kwd>TNF, tumor necrosis factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Immune stimulation</kwd><kwd>&#x003b1;-Glucan</kwd><kwd>Th1</kwd><kwd><italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic></kwd><kwd>Complement</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The possibility of bioterrorism, outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Bird Flu virus, continuing spread of HIV/AIDS and emergence of resistant pathogenic strains against current medications compel investigators to look for new protective measures against these threats. Immune activation is an effective as well as protective approach against emerging infectious diseases <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although immune system possesses a wide array of microbial detection and host defense mechanisms, pathogen evasion of the immune surveillance and destruction is a frequent occurrence. This escape of immune surveillance is also an important characteristic of several malignancies <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The fundamental role of innate immunity in host defense is becoming clearer as analysis of the human genome continues to identify new genes serving innate immune function. The innate immune system detects the pathogens or the nonself intruders using specific receptors and responds immediately by activation of the immune competent cells, synthesis of cytokines and chemokines, and release of inflammatory mediators to eliminate or contain the intruders. Innate immune activation also triggers and paves the way for adaptive immune response by antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes. The natural killer (NK) cells play a decisive role in the innate immune defense against virus-infected and malignant cells by virtue of their ability to recognize and destroy abnormal cells <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Cytokines play crucial roles in regulating various aspects of immune responses. Among cytokines, interleukin (IL)-12 plays a central role in coordinating innate and cell-mediated adaptive immunity <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Immune stimulation can provide both prophylactic as well as postexposure protection <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Usually, these protective measures are correlated with synthesis of IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3;, the cytokines of Th1 pathway of T cell differentiation associated with the adaptive immune system <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Several compounds that activate immune system such as microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), double-stranded RNA and DNA oligonucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs, have been reported earlier <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Stimulation of multiple receptors is reported to exhibit synergistic effect in cytokine production <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Complement activation cascade is another integral part of the immune system in which the cellular pathogens like intracellular bacteria are coated with complement components (opsonization) and readily undergo phagocytosis. Thus, complement activation plays an important role in microbial killing and is essential for transport and clearance of immune complexes.</p><p>Polysaccharides are known immune stimulants of which &#x003b2;-glucans have recently received considerable attention. &#x003b2;-Glucans or other biological response modifiers (BRMs), because of their structural identity with the conserved &#x0201c;pathogen-associated molecular pattern&#x0201d; activate the immune system by binding to specific receptors (pattern recognition receptors) of the innate immune system and stimulate the phagocytic, cytotoxic, and antimicrobial activities by the synthesis and release of cytokines, chemokines and reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Stimulation by particulate &#x003b2;-glucans can also enhance the ability of macrophages to recognize and clear apoptotic cells through upregulation of the polysaccharide receptors <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Specific &#x003b2;-glucan receptors have been reported on various immune cells including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, NK cells as well as nonimmune cells including endothelial cells, alveolar cells and fibroblasts <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. &#x003b2;-Glucans induce proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and IL-12 synthesis, required for IFN-&#x003b3; production and polarization of T helper cells to Th1 pathway <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. &#x003b2;-Glucans have also been found to synergize with monoclonal antibodies to suppress and/or eradicate tumors <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Yeast &#x003b2;-glucan has already been demonstrated to have significant degree of protection against anthrax (<italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>) infection in a mouse model <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, exogenous IFN-&#x003b3; and IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; are reported to modulate host's innate immune response in human macrophages, for improving the cell viability and reducing the number of germinated intracellular spores of anthrax <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The immunomodulatory effects of &#x003b2;-glucans are influenced by the molecular mass, chain length, degree of branching, tertiary structure and solubility of the polymer. Although no consensus could be made on the structure&#x02013;activity relationship <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, the (1&#x02192;3)-&#x003b2;-glycosidic linkage has been described as an explicit requirement for biological activity <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, Bao et al. <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> recently reported the isolation, characterization as well as in vitro and in vivo lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production by a branched (1&#x02192;3)-&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucan. Water solubility and lower degree of branching were found to be desirable requirements for biological activity based on the immunological properties of its derivatives. This observation along with the immunological properties of &#x003b1;-(2&#x02192;8) linked sialic acid as well as that of heteropolysaccharides having &#x003b1; conformations in the main chain <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> dispute the explicit requirement of (1&#x02192;3)-&#x003b2;-glycosidic linkage for the biological activity. In this paper, we describe a novel polysaccharide (RR1), an &#x003b1;-glucan, exhibiting unique immune boosting properties. RR1 is isolated from a medicinal herb, <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> (family Minispermaceae), well known in the Indian <italic>Ayurvedic System of Medicine</italic> for anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antiarthritic, antioxidant and immune stimulating properties <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Isolation and characterization of RR1</title><p>Our preliminary investigations with extracts of the <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> powder, purchased from Garry and Sun, Reno, NV revealed that the immune stimulating principle is confined in the aqueous fraction. The aerial part of the plant was air dried and powdered for RR1 extraction. The procedure adapted for the isolation is illustrated in the flow chart (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
). The final compound RR1 was isolated in about 0.1% yield of the total dry material used for extraction as a puffy solid that dissolved in water. The initial analysis of the final product in our laboratory and the <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra revealed that it is a polysaccharide. Therefore, detailed polysaccharide analyses such as the glycosyl composition, linkage, molecular weight and conformation of the glucose units at the anomeric center were performed at the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia, Athens, GA. The glycosyl composition analysis was done by the combined Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) of the per-<italic>O</italic>-trimethylsilyl derivatives of the monosaccharide methyl glucosides obtained from RR1 by acidic methanolysis according to the method of York et al. <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Inositol was used as internal standard in this analysis. The monosaccharide derivatives were identified by their characteristic retention time and further authenticated with their mass spectra. To perform glycosyl linkage analysis, the sample was permethylated thrice by the method of Ciucanu and Kerek <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, hydrolyzed with 2 M trifluoroacetic acid, reduced with NaBD<sub>4</sub> and acetylated with acetic anhydride/pyridine and the resulted partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAA) were analyzed by GC/MS. The sugar residues were identified by their characteristic retention times and mass spectral data. The conformations at the anomeric center of the glucopyranosyl units were obtained based on the 500-MHz proton NMR spectra recorded in D<sub>2</sub>O and by comparison with the anomeric proton signals of standard samples. The molecular mass was obtained from the size exclusion chromatography using Supelco silica column (1.0&#x000d7;30 cm), eluting with 50 mM ammonium formate buffer at a rate of 0.5 ml/min and detected by the refractive index. Dextran samples were used as standards and the molecular mass was obtained by comparing the retention time of the eluted peak with the standards.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram showing the steps in the isolation of RR1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Immune stimulating properties</title><p>RR1 samples were tested for any endotoxin contamination by the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay before the immune stimulation experiments and tests showed insignificant levels. To measure the immune stimulating property of RR1, we analyzed the activation of the different subsets of lymphocytes, syntheses of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p70 and p40, IL-18, interferon (IFN)-&#x003b1; and &#x003b3;, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and -&#x003b2;, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and the extent of oxidative stress elicited in human lymphocytes.

The glycosyl composition analysis showed glucose as the only component in RR1 while linkage analysis revealed three types of glucopyranosyl residues corresponding to three types of linkages: 4-linked glucopyranosyl residue (80%), 4,6-linked glucopyranosyl residue (12%) and terminal glucopyranosyl residue (8%). The <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a) showed well-resolved signals for the carbon atoms in the glucopyranosyl moieties&#x02014;C1 (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 99.97 ppm), C2 (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 73.68 ppm), C3 (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 71.89 ppm), C4 (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 77.09 ppm), C5 (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 71.52 ppm) and C6 (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 60.83 ppm). The downfield shifts in the C1 and C4 signals confirm the (1&#x02192;4) linkage while the signal at <italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 69.57 ppm may be due to the C6 of the (1&#x02192;6) linkage. The signals at <italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 5.44 ppm (not well resolved) and that at <italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 5.00 ppm in the 500-MHz proton NMR spectra (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b) are due to the &#x003b1; proton associated with the anomeric carbon of the glucopyranosyl units. On the other hand, the very weak signal at <italic>&#x003b4;</italic> 4.66 ppm may be due to that of the &#x003b2; anomer. However, the ratio of the signals of &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose to &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucose is about 99.9:1, and hence almost all glucose units appeared to be in the &#x003b1; configuration. Therefore, RR1 is an &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucan with (1&#x02192;4) linked glucopyranosyl units in the main chain with (1&#x02192;6) linked glucopyranosyl unit branches and a 0.15 degree of branching (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>

Cytokines are a group of low molecular weight regulatory nonantibody proteins secreted by immune component cells in response to stimulation. They bind to specific receptors of target cells triggering signal transduction pathways that ultimately lead to gene expression in target cells. Cytokines regulate the intensity and duration of immune responses by stimulating or inhibiting activation, proliferation and/or differentiation of various cells and by regulating the secretion of antibodies or other cytokines. The pleiotropy, redundancy, synergy and antagonism exhibited by cytokines permit them to coordinate and regulate cellular activities. Inflammatory responses are crucial in controlling and eliminating infectious agents as well as in promoting wound healing for restoration of tissue integrity.</p><p>IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; induce the production of each other as well as that of IL-6, and act synergistically and regulate several biological actions besides IL-1 being self-inductive <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The production of IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; in RR1-treated lymphocytes is consistent with that in the LPS stimulated human monocyte cell lines (THP-1) <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. IL-12 p70 is the bioactive isoform of IL-12 and is an important factor in the differentiation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells into effecter T helper type 1 (Th1) CD4+ lymphocytes secreting IFN-&#x003b3; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Besides, it is also reported to have stimulatory effects on NK cells <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Recently, IL-12 p70 has emerged as an efficient and minimally toxic antitumor cytokine due to its ability to elicit the Th1 response <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Beyond the immune system, this cytokine is also reported to have the capacity to inhibit UV-induced apoptosis and initiation of DNA repair in UV-damaged keratinocytes which ultimately protect the cells from malignancy <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. IL-12 p40, the homodimeric isoform, is a receptor antagonist of the bioactive heterodimeric isoform p70 in mouse <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In the RR1-treated cells, IL-12 p40, the regulatory cytokine is produced in many-fold excess to the bioactive form which may be natural mechanism to control the over production of the bioactive form p70. IL-18 is another potent inducer of IFN-&#x003b3; and apparently NK cells <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. RR1 induction of IL-18 production may be an early response in the development of Th1 response acting in consonance with IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3;.</p><p>MCP-1 is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and activated CD4 and CD8 T cells that is reported to induce granule release from NK and CD8+ cells, activate NK function in CD56+ cells, and act as a potent releasing factor for histamine from basophiles <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Furthermore, it is reported to exhibit antitumor effects by enhancing tumor specific immunity, presumably in a T-cell-dependent manner <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Our observations indicate that RR1 induces the production of this cytokine significantly at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml. The significant synthesis of TNF-&#x003b1; by RR1 stimulation can play a critical role in host resistance to infections and to the growth of malignancy. TNF-&#x003b1; and its receptors are essential for protection against tuberculosis and for NO synthesis in macrophages early in infection <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. RR1-induced IFN-&#x003b3; production may function in part to promote the activity of the components of the cell-mediated immune system such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), macrophages and NK cells in addition to its inhibitory role in Th2 response. It stimulates the bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells and, therefore, boosts the innate immune response <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Moreover, it may modulate MCP-1 synthesis in macrophages by LPS <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>CD4+ T cells contribute to the regulation of antigen specific (adaptive) immune system through the recognition of antigens and consequent production of cytokines. The distinct pattern of cytokine production by CD4+ cells form a dichotomy, Type 1 (Th1) characterized by IFN-&#x003b3; production and promotes elimination of intracellular pathogens and Type 2 (Th2) characterized by IL-4 production, involves IgE and eosinophils suitable for elimination of extra cellular pathogens. Cytokines act directly on T cells during primary activation and appears to be the most direct mediator among the factors influencing the terminal differentiation. The presence of IL-12 leads to Th1 response while IL-4 leads to Th2 development and the two pathways express mutually suppressive effect as well. IL-1 is identified as an inducer of IL-12 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> while IL-18 is an early response in the development of Th1 cells by induction of IFN-&#x003b3;. The cytokine profile, IL-12, IL-18, IFN-&#x003b3; together with IL-1 by RR1 stimulation and the dose-dependent synthesis of these cytokines clearly demonstrate the Th1 pathway which is essential for cellular immunity and killing of intracellular pathogens and malignant cells. This observation is in conformity with IL-12 induced IFN-&#x003b3;-dependent T cell development to Th1 and CD8+ cytotoxic effector cells <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Concurrent signaling as well as synergistic action by IL-12 and IL-18 induces prolonged IFN-&#x003b3; production and the continuous strong expression of IL-18R mRNA in T cells <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. The early inflammatory events, such as T cell adhesion to inflammatory sites, were also reported for IL-12 and IL-18 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. The higher level of the synthesis of the regulatory isoform IL-12 p40 may be a natural mechanism to contain the excessive production of Th1 response.</p><p>The iNOS enzyme controls the production of NO in macrophages. The insignificant level of iNOS induction by RR1 in the present investigation supports the insignificant increase in the production of NO. Our studies with monocytes isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by Monocyte Isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) or with human monocyte cell line THP-1 (ATCC) also did not induce any high level of NO with RR1 treatment (data not shown). NO is reported to play an important role in the modulation of T helper cell differentiation and polarization. Yamasaki et al. <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and Taylor-Robinson et al. <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> reported an inhibitory role of NO on Th1 cytokines while Bauer et al. <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> reported the same for Th1 as well as Th2 cytokines by NO from activated T cells. The low level of NO synthesis by RR1 does not appear to exert any inhibition of Th1 pathway. IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; are known upregulators of NO synthesis <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. As RR1 stimulation resulted in the synthesis of IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; and very little IFN-&#x003b1;, it is reasonable to assume that IFN-&#x003b1; priming may be a necessary step for triggering the production of higher levels of NO by polysaccharides <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>RR1 stimulation does not produce any oxidative stress in lymphocytes, indicated by the levels of the GSH, GSSG and their ratio, corresponding to the NO synthesis data. In addition, we could not observe any significant elevation in the amount of hydrogen peroxide in our investigations (data not shown). In this context, the low level of NO synthesis by RR1 suggests an immune mediatory role for NO. The noncytotoxic nature of RR1, even at fairly high concentrations (1000 &#x003bc;g/ml), may be attributed to the low level production of NO together with the ability of this polysaccharide not to induce oxidative stress in the cells.</p><p>In the present investigation, RR1 has activated the alternate pathway (C3a) of complement activation and there was very little effect on classical pathway (C4a). This observation is analogous with several reports on complement activation by other polysaccharides. C3a and C4a are bioactive cleavage products released from plasma components C3 and C4 during complement activation cascade in alternative and classical pathways <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> which are quickly converted to less active C3a des Arg and C4a des Arg forms and are involved in the mediation of cellular immune responses . The alternative pathway is self-amplifying and is important in the clearance and recognition of pathogens in the absence of antibodies <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. &#x003b2;-Glucans are reported to activate the alternative pathway and the host mediated antitumor activity exhibited by these polymers were correlated with the activation of the complement system <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Lipopolysaccharides activate the complement system via alternative as well as classical pathways; the lipid part activates the classical pathway while the polysaccharide moiety activates the alternative pathway <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>.</p><p>Immune stimulation by induction of cytokines and synthesis of NO, activation of macrophages, induction of phagocytic, cytotoxic and antitumor activities have been reported recently in polysaccharide or polysaccharide containing fractions of <italic>Phanax ginseng</italic>, <italic>Morinda citrifolia</italic>, and <italic>Echinacea</italic>
<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. RR1 is a branched &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucan structurally distinct from amylopectin and pullalan as no immune stimulation is reported by either amylopectin or pullalan. The similarity of its structure to the conserved molecular pattern of the cell wall components of fungal &#x003b2;-glucans may be the reason for the activation of immune system. On the other hand, the differences, the &#x003b1; conformation and the (1&#x02192;4) linkages, may account for the non-induction of iNOS <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> and the consequent noncytotoxicity and the absence of oxidative stress. This water soluble neutral &#x003b1;-glucan has molecular mass and branching sequence well within the range of the polysaccharides exhibiting significant immune stimulating properties <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The water solubility can overcome the granuloma formations exhibited by particulate &#x003b2;-glucans while the high molecular mass, being in the most potent range, may enable it to be retained by the host's organs for longer period without degradation <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. While the noncytotoxic nature, the significant activation of the lymphocytes, especially the NK cells and the alternate pathway of complement activation demonstrate the stimulation of the innate immune system, the cytokine profile resulting from the activation proclaims the stimulation of the antigen specific cell mediated (adaptive) immunity (Th1 pathway) with a self-regulating mechanism of its overrun. The absence of IL-4 synthesis (Th1 suppressor cytokine) and IL-10 (the inhibitor of IL-12) on stimulation with RR1 is in good agreement with the Th1 pathway of T cell differentiation. The IFN-&#x003b3; production by the concurrent signaling of IL-12 and IL-18 may serve as a potent anti anthrax agent, devoid of side effects, if any, of the exogenous IFN treatment as well. A stimulated innate immune system can fight the entry of any pathogens into the host and has the capacity to prevent primary infections from actually causing disease <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The unique immune stimulating properties of RR1 without exerting oxidative stress and any direct cytotoxic effect, thus far described, may make it a potent biodefense agent against a number of pathogens and human malignancies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hackett</surname><given-names>C.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Innate immune activation as a broad-spectrum biodefense strategy: prospects and research challenges</article-title><source>J.
