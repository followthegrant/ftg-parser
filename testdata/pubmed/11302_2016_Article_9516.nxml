In this respect, Cav2 and Kv7 channels have been investigated most frequently. The fine tuning of neuronal ion channel gating via G protein coupled receptors frequently relies on the formation of higher order protein complexes that are organized by scaffolding proteins and harbor receptors and channels together with interposed signaling components. However, ion channel complexes containing P2Y receptors have not been described. Therefore, the regulation of Cav2.2 and Kv7.2/7.3 channels via P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors and the coordination of these ion channels and receptors in the plasma membranes of tsA 201 cells have been investigated here. ADP inhibited currents through Cav2.2 channels via both P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors with phospholipase C and pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins being involved, respectively. The nucleotide controlled the gating of Kv7 channels only via P2Y1 and phospholipase C. In fluorescence energy transfer assays using conventional as well as total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy, both P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors were found juxtaposed to Cav2.2 channels, but only P2Y1, and not P2Y12, was in close proximity to Kv7 channels. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in TIRF microscopy, evidence for a physical interaction was obtained for the pair P2Y12/Cav2.2, but not for any other receptor/channel combination. These results reveal a membrane juxtaposition of P2Y receptors and ion channels in parallel with the control of neuronal ion currents by ADP. This juxtaposition may even result in apparent physical interactions between receptors and channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>P2Y receptors</kwd><kwd>Calcium channel</kwd><kwd>Kv7 channel</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>TIRF</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W1205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boehm</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>P2Y receptors are a group of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are expressed in almost every tissue of the vertebrate body, including the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. They are activated by nucleotides such as ATP, ADP, UTP, or UDP. To date, eight different subtypes are known which are preferentially linked to either G&#x003b1;q (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11) or G&#x003b1;i (P2Y12, P2Y13, and P2Y14) subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Many of these receptors have been shown to regulate the functions of neuronal ion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For example, the ADP sensitive P2Y1 receptor mediates inhibition of Kv7 potassium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], K2P channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], Cav2.2 calcium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and NMDA glutamate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] as well as opening of KCa2 potassium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similarly, activation of P2Y2 receptors leads to gating of KCa3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], as well as calcium-activated chloride [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] channels and to a reduction of NMDA receptor currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. P2Y12 receptors are involved in the inhibition of calcium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and K2P channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] by ADP.</p><p>According to the fluid mosaic model of the membrane, proteins embedded therein may diffuse in a two-dimensional manner and randomly collide with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This also holds true for GPCRs which can diffuse in the membrane and activate the G proteins through collision coupling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, from cell-attached patch-clamp recordings, it is known that the modulation of ion channels via either G&#x003b1;i or G&#x003b1;q coupled receptors is confined to a rather limited region surrounding the channels: in these experiments, ion channels enclosed by a patch pipette were not regulated if the appropriate agonists were applied to membrane regions not covered by the pipette, but only when they were present in the pipette solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These findings gave rise to the idea that channels and GPCRs have to be in close proximity for the latter to exert their modulatory actions on the channel. From beta adrenergic receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors, it is well known that scaffolding proteins like PSD95 or NHERF1/2 tether these to their effectors like NMDA glutamate receptors or CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In accordance with this notion, P2Y1 receptors were found to interact with NHERF2, and this interaction enhanced the signaling via G&#x003b1;q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In sympathetic neurons, however, which are usually devoid of NHERF2, expression of this protein attenuated the inhibition of calcium, but not that of Kv7 potassium channels via P2Y1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The closure of Kv7 channels in these neurons via P2Y6 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] is also independent of yet another scaffolding protein, AKAP79 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Similarly, P2Y12 receptors do interact with NHERF1, but this is not required for signaling via G&#x003b1;i [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Taken together, evidence for scaffold protein interactions of P2Y receptors as prerequisite for their signaling is rather limited and has not been demonstrated for the control of ion channels.</p><p>Nevertheless, the tight regulation of ion channels via P2Y receptors has been observed repeatedly in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and has even been reconstituted in non-neuronal cells by heterologous coexpression of, for instance, P2Y12 receptors and Kir3.1/3.2 concatemers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] or P2Y2 receptors and Kv7 channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Likewise, endogenous P2Y13 receptors of HEK293 cells mediate an inhibition of recombinant Cav2.2 channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. At least for Kir3.1 and Kir3.2, direct interactions with activating GPCRs have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. P2Y receptors have a tendency to interact with a number of different membrane proteins including other GPCRs and enzymes as shown by FRET measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Hence, it was tempting to speculate that P2Y receptors might also get in contact with neuronal ion channels, in particular Cav2 and Kv7 family members, as basis for the regulation of neuronal ion currents by nucleotides. Accordingly, electrophysiological and imaging methods were employed here to reveal whether direct interactions between P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors, on one hand, and Cav2.2 and Kv7.2/Kv7.3 channels, on the other hand, do occur in parallel to the modulation of neuronal ion currents by ADP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>The cell line tsA 201, a subclone of HEK293 cells stably expressing the SV40 large T-antigen, was cultured in antibiotic free Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) supplemented with 10&#x000a0;% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Lofer, Austria). For patch-clamp experiments, cells were seeded onto conventional 35&#x000a0;mm culture dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), whereas for fluorescence microscopy the transfected cells were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated glass cover slips or glass bottom dishes (IBIDI, Martinsried Germany). For the transfection of calcium channels into tsA 201 cells prior to electrophysiological recordings, JetPrime&#x000ae; (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France) was used according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. For all other transfections, the Turbofect&#x000ae; reagent (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Vienna, Austria) was used as follows: per 35&#x000a0;mm dish, a total of 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g DNA was mixed with 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of 150&#x000a0;mM NaCl and 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of transfection reagent, and after 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min preincubation, this mixture was added to the cell cultures.</p><p>Most of the plasmids as used here have been described before in more detail (Schicker et al. 2009): P2X2-CFP/-YFP, P2Y1-CFP/-YFP, P2Y12-CFP/-YFP, and NTPDase1-YFP. Plasmids for fluorescently tagged human Kv7.2 and rat Kv7.3 as well as human M1 muscarinic receptors were provided by Mark Shapiro (San Antonio, TX, USA). A construct coding for human Cav2.2-GFP was obtained from Gerald Obermair (Innsbruck, Austria), and the GFP tag was exchanged for EYFP. Cav2.2 was always coexpressed together with accessory rat &#x003b2;3 and rabbit &#x003b1;2&#x003b4;1 subunits (from G. Obermair). The identities of all plasmids were verified by sequence analysis. When non-fluorescent proteins were expressed, EGFP was used to identify successfully transfected cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (GB150-8P, Science Products, Hofheim, Germany) with a Sutter P97 puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA). Electrodes had tip resistances between 2 and 5 M&#x003a9; when filled with recording solution (see below). After establishing the recording conditions, series resistance values were between 10 and 20 M&#x003a9; and were routinely compensated for by 60&#x02013;70&#x000a0;%. Electrophysiological recordings were carried out at room temperature (20&#x02013;24&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) from tsA 201 cells approximately 48&#x000a0;h after transfection. Currents through Cav2.2 channels were recorded in whole-cell mode with a pipette solution consisting of the following (in mM): CsOH (145), L-aspartic acid (145), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2), HEPES (10), Cs-EGTA (0.1), and Mg-ATP (2), adjusted to pH&#x000a0;7.4 with Cs-OH. For Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, the external bath solution consisted of the following (in mM): CaCl<sub>2</sub> (10), TEA-Cl (145), and HEPES (10), adjusted to pH&#x000a0;7.4 with TEA-OH. With these solutions, the liquid junction potential is close to zero. Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were elicited once every 15&#x000a0;s by 30&#x000a0;ms depolarizations from a holding potential of &#x02212;80 to +20&#x000a0;mV. The currents were quantified by measuring peak current amplitudes unless indicated otherwise.</p><p>Currents through the Kv7.2/7.3 channels were recorded in perforated-patch mode to minimize their rundown. Pipettes were first front-filled with a solution containing (mM): KGluconate (133), NaCl (5.9), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (0.7), HEPES (10), EGTA (10) adjusted to pH&#x000a0;7.4 with KOH. Thereafter, the electrodes were backfilled with the same solution containing 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml amphotericin B (in 0.8&#x000a0;% DMSO). In these experiments, the external bath solution consisted of (mM): NaCl (140), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2.5), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2), KOH (3), glucose (20) and HEPES (10), adjusted to pH&#x000a0;7.4 with NaOH. These solutions result in a liquid junction potential of about 15&#x000a0;mV which was corrected for during experimentation. To activate these currents, cells were held at a potential of &#x02212;30&#x000a0;mV, and once every 15&#x000a0;s currents were deactivated by 1&#x000a0;s hyperpolarizations to &#x02212;55&#x000a0;mV. Currents through Kv7 channels were quantified by determination of deactivation amplitudes as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Epifluorescence microscopy</title><p>Epifluorescence three filter F&#x000f6;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In brief, tsA 201 cells were transfected as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were subjected to experiments at an inverted microscope using a &#x000d7;63 NA 1.4 oil immersion objective (Zeiss, Vienna, Austria). Immediately before the experiment, the culture medium was exchanged by a buffer containing the following (in mM): NaCl (140), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2.5), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2), KOH (3), glucose (20), and HEPES (10), adjusted to pH&#x000a0;7.4 with NaOH. Fluorescent proteins were exited using the emission of a 100-W mercury burner (Zeiss) passed through a dielectric filter (436/20 ECFP, 500/20 EYFP; Chroma, CT, USA) mounted in a filter wheel (Ludl, NY, USA) allowing for fast change of excitation filters. Resulting fluorescence was passed through a fixed double band dichroic mirror (Chroma, CT, USA) and a dielectric emission filter (480/40 ECFP, 535/30 EYFP/FRET), again mounted in a filter wheel. Images were captured using a cooled CCD camera (Coolsnap fx, Roper Scientific). For measurement of FRET, three images of each cell were captured: one donor (donor excitation/donor emission, <italic>I</italic><sub>D</sub>), one acceptor (acceptor excitation/acceptor emission, <italic>I</italic><sub>A</sub>), and one FRET image (donor excitation/acceptor emission, <italic>I</italic><sub>DA</sub>).

The pinhole was set to give a 1-&#x003bc;m optical section. To evaluate colocalization, images were background corrected, intensities for each channel were normalized, and channels were overlaid thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>TIRF microscopy</title><p>To visualize fluorescence emission from CFP or YFP-tagged proteins in the immediate vicinity of the membrane, total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF) was employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. All TIRF experiments were performed on an iMIC Digital TIRF microscope (FEI, Munich, Germany) using a &#x000d7;60 NA 1.49 Objective (Olympus, Vienna, Austria) in 360&#x000b0; rotating TIRF mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Images were captured using a cooled EMCCD camera (Andor, Belfast, UK). TIRF angles were calibrated for each sample using the built in calibration routine. All measurements were conducted using the same nominal calculated penetration depth (80&#x000a0;nm).</p><p>Donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching (DRAP) was used to measure FRET efficiency directly in TIRF mode. To this end, tsA 201 cells on poly-D-lysine-coated glass bottom dishes were used 48&#x000a0;h after transfection. Immediately before the experiment, the culture medium was exchanged by a buffer containing the following (in mM): NaCl (140), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2.5), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2), KOH (3), glucose (20), and HEPES (10), adjusted to pH&#x000a0;7.4 with NaOH. For measuring FRET efficiency images of both, ECFP and EYFP images were captured, followed by a 240-s bleaching step of the entire field of view using a 150-W Xenon lamp (FEI, Munich) passed through an EYFP excitation filter (Chroma, USA). This reduced the intensity of EYFP by 97.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4&#x000a0;%.

For bleaching, the illumination was switched to epifluorescence mode, and the preselected ROI was bleached using the 488-nm laser line. Analysis was performed using ImageJ. After subtracting the background, the fluorescence intensity of the bleached ROI was measured at each time point. To correct for bleaching caused by image acquisition, a control ROI in an adjacent, non-bleached cell was followed for its fluorescence intensity over time. All values were normalized to the mean value of the five pre-bleach images and afterwards corrected for acquisition-induced bleaching according to the following formula: FRAP<sub>corr</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;(FRAP<sub>norm</sub>&#x02009;+&#x02009;(1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;CTRL<sub>norm</sub>)).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate whether the modulation of neuronal ion currents by ADP is paralleled by a certain spatial arrangement of P2Y receptors and ion channels, P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors, respectively, were expressed in tsA 201 cells together with either Kv7.2/Kv7.3 heteromers or Cav2.2 channels.

Here, the regulation of these two neuronal channels via P2Y1 and/or P2Y12 receptors has been reconstituted by the transfection of tsA 201 cells. Therein, currents through these channels were not affected by ADP, unless either of these two receptors had been coexpressed with the channels.</p><p>Previously, endogenous P2Y1 receptors of rat superior cervical ganglion neurons have been shown to control the gating of Kv7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], while P2Y12 receptors mediate an inhibition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

The inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents through P2Y12 receptors included a slowing of activation kinetics that is characteristic of the voltage-dependent interaction between G protein &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits and channel proteins and was attenuated by pertussis toxin, but not by a phospholipase C inhibitor. Vice versa, Ca<sup>2+</sup> current reduction via P2Y1 was pertussis toxin-insensitive and blunted by a phospholipase C inhibitor. Likewise, the closure of Kv7 channels via P2Y1 was abolished by the phospholipase C inhibitor and most probably involves depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

While <italic>N</italic><sub>FRET</sub> values derived from epifluorescence images can only be used for comparing the efficiency of fluorescence energy transfer between pairs of chosen FRET partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the DRAP method allows for approximation of distances between FRET donors and acceptors. Assuming a F&#x000f6;rster radius of 4.9&#x000a0;nm for the FRET pair used, the donor fluorescence recovery of 10&#x000a0;% found for P2Y1 and Kv7 channels would translate into a distance of roughly 7&#x000a0;nm. In contrast, the respective value obtained with P2Y12 receptors reflects at least 10&#x000a0;nm if not much more, as the calculation is based on the sixth power of the distance between the fluorophores relative to the F&#x000f6;rster distance. With Cav2.2 channels, both receptors produced <italic>N</italic><sub>FRET</sub> values comparable to those of positive controls, and the distances calculated from the TIRF-DRAP measurements were similar and amounted to 7&#x000a0;nm (P2Y1) and 6.8&#x000a0;nm (P2Y12). These differences in distance go in parallel with the finding that P2Y1 receptors mediated inhibition of both types of channel, whereas P2Y12 receptors only did so with Cav2.2.

The FRAP recovery time constants obtained with Kv7.2/7.3 channels were in good agreement with those of the closely related Kv7.1 channels whose mobility can be altered by the presence of KCNE subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In this study, coexpression of P2Y1 with either Cav2.2 or Kv7 did not lead to any significant alteration in FRAP recovery of either the channels or the receptor. Considering the FRET results, this might be surprising at first sight, since the complex of two proteins should show a reduced diffusion coefficient (<italic>D</italic>) and thus a slower recovery from bleaching. There might be several reasons to account for this apparent discrepancy. One comes from the fact that it is known that the scaling of <italic>D</italic> with size (<italic>R</italic>) is best described by an ln(1/<italic>R</italic>) relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This means that a doubling in size alone would lead to a decrease of only 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;% in <italic>D</italic>, which lies within the experimental variability and thus might not be detected. An alternative explanation would be offered by dynamic transient interactions between P2Y1 and the effector channels that could not suffice to form a co-diffusing complex.</p><p>In contrast to the results obtained with P2Y1, coexpression of P2Y12 with Cav2.2 led to pronounced changes in the FRAP recovery kinetics. The more than 50&#x000a0;% increase in recovery time constant might be attributed to the formation of large complexes. A candidate protein potentially participating in such a larger complexes would be, for instance, NHERF1, which is known to interact with P2Y12 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. NHERF2 has been shown to be present in HEK293 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], but information on the endogenous expression of NHERF1 is lacking. Other possibilities would be some kind of anchoring or partitioning into membrane microdomains with differing diffusion properties. Since anchoring would lead to a significant change in the immobile fraction of either channels or receptors, this alternative can be ruled out as the maximum of FRAP recovery was always the same. Therefore, partitioning into specialized membrane microdomains needs to be considered. Indeed, P2Y12 receptors have been shown repeatedly to be present in lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In platelets, for instance, signaling via P2Y12, but not via P2Y1, requires intact lipid rafts, as it was inhibited by methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Likewise, in non-neuronal cells, a considerable proportion of heterologously expressed Cav2.2 channels can be found within lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In contrast, Kv7 channels as well as regulating receptors may reside inside [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] as well as outside of lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Therefore, the finding that P2Y12 receptors affected the mobility of Cav2.2 channels and vice versa may be explained by a redistribution of these proteins between lipid rafts and non-raft compartments of the plasma membrane that depends on the presence of the respective other one. Along the same line, the apparent lack of physical interaction between P2Y1 receptors and Kv7 channels as observed in FRAP experiments may be due to the fact that both proteins are equally distributed within the same membrane compartments. Alternatively, weak interactions between these two may suffice to lead to juxtaposition and physiologically relevant cross talk, but escape detection as assayed by FRAP recovery. Obviously, two membrane proteins that are not juxtaposed to each other, such as P2Y12 receptors and Kv7 channels, cannot influence each other&#x02019;s mobility.</p><p>The present results regarding juxtaposition of and physical interactions between P2Y receptors and ion channels appear to be related to the interposed signaling cascades. Physical interaction was only detected between an ion channel and a GPCR which are functionally connected by the direct interaction of G protein &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits with the pore forming protein (i.e., Cav2.2 and P2Y12). Previously, juxtaposition has been reported for Kir3.1/3.2 and activating GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] which also regulate channel gating via direct G protein &#x003b2;&#x003b3; interactions. Moreover, GABAB and Kir3 channels are both known to associate with lipid rafts GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] as mentioned for P2Y12 and Cav2.2 channels above. Hence, lipid rafts may provide optimal conditions for ion channel regulation via direct &#x003b2;&#x003b3; interactions, but additional experimental evidence is required to further substantiate this notion.</p><p>In summary, the ADP receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12 control the gating of Kv7 and Cav2.2 channels in a selective manner, and the regulation of each of these neuronal ion channels is paralleled by juxtaposition of channel and P2Y receptor proteins within appropriate membrane microdomains.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The perfect technical assistance of Gabriele Gaupmann is gratefully acknowledged.
