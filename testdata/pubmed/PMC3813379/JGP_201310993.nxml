These VSDs are constituted by four putative transmembrane segments (S1 to S4) resembling those found in voltage-gated ion channels. The putative fourth segment (S4) of the VSD contains positive residues that likely function as voltage-sensing elements. To study in detail how these residues sense the plasma membrane potential, we have focused on five arginines in the S4 segment of the <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> VSP (Ci-VSP). After implementing a histidine scan, here we show that four arginine-to-histidine mutants, namely R223H to R232H, mediate voltage-dependent proton translocation across the membrane, indicating that these residues transit through the hydrophobic core of Ci-VSP as a function of the membrane potential. These observations indicate that the charges carried by these residues are sensing charges. Furthermore, our results also show that the electrical field in VSPs is focused in a narrow hydrophobic region that separates the extracellular and intracellular space and constitutes the energy barrier for charge crossing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The voltage-sensitive phosphatase (VSP) isolated from the tunicate <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> (Ci-VSP) is a membrane-embedded, voltage-controlled phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Murata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Villalba-Galea, 2012b</xref>).

Catalytic activity of Ci-VSP is controlled by the N terminus, which is thought to be folded into a bundle of four putative transmembrane segments forming a voltage-sensing domain (VSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kum&#x000e1;novics et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Murata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ratzan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sutton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Villalba-Galea, 2012a</xref>). The fourth (S4) segment contains charge residues likely conferring the character of voltage sensor to this domain. The S4 segment spans from glycine 214 to glutamine 239, containing five arginines. Four of these residues, R223, R226, R229, and R232, are arranged in a canonical every-third-residue array, which is typically found in the S4 segment of voltage-gated channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Murata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Villalba-Galea, 2012b</xref>). Thus, these residues are thought to be the main sensing charge bearers in the S4 segment of Ci-VSP.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Mutating R217 affects both voltage dependence and kinetics of charge movement.

The HP for these recordings was &#x02212;60 mV for C363S, &#x02212;90 mV for R217Q-C363S (hereafter R217Q), and &#x02212;120 mV for R217E-C363S (hereafter R217E).

However, mutating R217 to a glutamine shifts the voltage dependence of Ci-VSP toward negative potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dimitrov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kohout et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Villalba-Galea et al., 2008</xref>). This observation indicates that R217 electrically interacts with the voltage-sensing machinery of the VSD. Thus, whether the charge carried by R217 is a sensing charge remains unclear.</p><p>Toward understanding the role of the Ci-VSP&#x02019;s S4 arginines in voltage sensing, we performed a histidine scan according to the paradigm established for the voltage-gated, potassium-selective channel <italic>Shaker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Starace et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Starace and Bezanilla, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2004</xref>). In the present study, we show that the charge located in position 217 does not participate in voltage sensing. Instead, this charge seems to bias the local membrane potential modulating the voltage dependence for sensing charge movement. Also, here we show that replacing R223 with a histidine enables a proton conductance at negative potential, indicating that this residue has simultaneous access to both the extracellular and intracellular space when the VSD is in the resting state. Finally, we show that histidines replacing the remaining arginines, namely R226, R229, and R232, can be titrated from the extracellular space when the sensor is in the activated state. These combined findings indicate that the arginines R223 through R232 cross the hydrophobic core of the VSD as a function of the membrane potential, implying that these residues are the sensing charge carriers of the S4 segment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mutagenesis and expression of Ci-VSP mutants</title><p>Ci-VSP mutants were generated by standard site-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Villalba-Galea et al., 2008</xref>).

We refer to these charges as sensing charges. For this study, we were particularly focused on the five arginines found in the S4 segment of Ci-VSP. To date, three of these arginines have been regarded as a sensing charge, namely R217, R229, and R232 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Murata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dimitrov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kohout et al., 2008</xref>). However, a detailed description of the role of these residues in voltage sensing was yet to be provided.</p><p>We generated S4 segment arginine-to-histidine mutants and combined voltage pulse protocols and manipulation of the external pH (pH<sub>EXT</sub>) to probe whether these residues were able to access the extracellular milieu as a function of the membrane potential. Based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Starace et al. (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Starace and Bezanilla (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2004</xref>), the underlying assumption was that sensing charge-carrying residues (sensing residues) are exposed to the intracellular space when the VSD is in the resting state and moved toward the extracellular side when the VSD is activated. If the replacing histidine was extracellularly exposed after activation, then decreasing the pH<sub>EXT</sub> would increase the probability for it to be protonated, increasing the total charge mobilized across the membrane during deactivation.</p><p>The approach described above was taken for all of the five arginines of the S4 segment. For residue R217, however, we first produced two additional mutants that neutralized or reversed the charge at this position. These mutations were studied to further understand the effects of mutating R217 on the voltage dependence of Ci-VSP.</p><sec><title>R217 modulates the voltage dependence of Ci-VSP</title><p>Sensing currents were recorded from the mutants R217Q and R217E expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes using the cut-open voltage clamp technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Taglialatela et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stefani and Bezanilla, 1998</xref>). These mutations were introduced using the catalytically inactive mutant (C363S) as background to avoid potential changes in the dynamic of the VSD caused by alteration in the concentration of phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Villalba-Galea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kohout et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). For these recordings, the HP was set to &#x02212;60 mV for C363S, &#x02212;90 mV for R217Q, and &#x02212;120 mV for R217E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The net charge mobilized during activation (<italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>) was calculated by numerical integration of sensing currents (ON-sensing currents; <italic>I</italic><sub>ON</sub>) and plotted as a function of the membrane potential (<italic>V</italic>). The resulting plots, <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>-<italic>V</italic> curves, were fitted to a single two-state Boltzmann distribution (see Materials and methods), and the fitted parameters were used to assess voltage dependence. For the mutant R217Q, the half-maximum potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) was displaced &#x02212;73 &#x000b1; 0.9 mV with respect to the background construct, C363S; the charge-reverting mutation R217E added a further displacement of &#x02212;51 &#x000b1; 1.4 mV (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The <italic>z</italic><sub>Q</sub> values showed a reduction of nearly 30% for the mutant R217Q with respect to the C363S. This could be interpreted as a reduction in the total sensing charge. However, the R217E mutant decreased only &#x0223c;15% with respect to C363S. This observation indicated that the decrease in <italic>z</italic><sub>Q</sub> observed with the mutant R217Q may not be accounted for by the reduction in the total of sensing charges.

This type of plot uses the relative activity of the VSD as a reference, thus allowing us to compare the changes in the kinetics of activation of these mutants. The resulting &#x003c4;<sub>ON</sub>-<italic>Q</italic>/<italic>Q</italic><sub>MAX</sub> curve showed that a common feature shared by the mutants is that &#x003c4;<sub>ON</sub> sharply decreased when &#x0003e;75% of the charge was mobilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). As estimated from the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, time constants observed when mobilizing half of the maximum net sensing charge (<italic>Q</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) were 33 ms, 8 ms, and 6 ms for C363S, R217Q, and R217E, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.201310993/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 B</ext-link>). Although these observations indicate that a positive charge in position 217 contributes to an increase in the energy barrier for the transition between the resting and active state of the VSD, it does not imply that R217 is a sensing charge.</p></sec><sec><title>Modulation of the voltage dependence by titration of R217H</title><p>If R217 carries a sensing charge, neutralizing it will decrease <italic>Q</italic><sub>MAX</sub>; adding the charge back will recover the initial value of <italic>Q</italic><sub>MAX</sub>. To implement this idea, R217 was replaced with a histidine on our common background construct C363S, producing the double mutant R217H-C363S, hereafter referred to as R217H. Titrating this histidine residue by decreasing the pH<sub>EXT</sub> will introduce a positive charge at position 217, which in turn should increase <italic>Q</italic><sub>MAX</sub> only if this residue carries a sensing charge.</p><p>Sensing currents were recorded from the mutant R217H expressed in oocytes. To assess whether the histidine in this position changed its accessibility when the voltage was modified, we first verified that, by manipulating the pH<sub>EXT</sub>, we were able to change the charge of the histidine in position 217 as indicated by a modulation of the voltage dependence of sensing currents. We observed that switching from pH<sub>EXT</sub> 7.4 to 6.1 slowed down <italic>I</italic><sub>ON</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) at all potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Yet, integration of <italic>I</italic><sub>ON</sub> yielded <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>-<italic>V</italic> curves that were shifted around 24 mV toward more positive potentials at the half-maximum charge when pH<sub>EXT</sub> was changed from 7.4 to 6.1. This observation suggested that voltage dependence was shifted by the titration of the introduced histidine. To confirm that this effect was caused by the mutation, we recorded sensing currents from the background mutant C363S and found that the <italic>Q</italic>-<italic>V</italic> curves differed only in 7 &#x000b1; 2.7 mV between pH<sub>EXT</sub> 7.4 ad 6.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). These results indicated that the modulation of voltage dependence by pH<sub>EXT</sub> was the consequence of introducing the mutation R217H. Furthermore, close inspection of the <italic>Q</italic>-<italic>V</italic> curves revealed the presence of two discernible components. Fitting the <italic>Q</italic>-<italic>V</italic> curves to a sum of two two-state Boltzmann distributions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) showed that the relative contribution of the more negative component to the total charge movement was 57 &#x000b1; 3% (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and 75 &#x000b1; 11% (<italic>n</italic> = 5) at pH<sub>EXT</sub> 6.1 and 7.4 (<italic>n</italic> = 5), respectively. The above observations suggested that the introduction of a histidine at position 217 gave rise to two populations of sensors, in which the histidine in position 217 is either protonated or not. Therefore, we concluded that protonation of R217H adds a positive charge at position 217.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Mutant R217H.

The expectation of independent VSD is supported by evidence suggesting that Ci-VSP is a monomeric protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kohout et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we found that, indeed, the <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of the more negative component did not change as a function of the pH<sub>EXT</sub>. However, the more positive component shifted from 28 mV at pH<sub>EXT</sub> 7.4 to 58 mV at pH<sub>EXT</sub> 6.1. It could be claimed that this shift in voltage dependence is a consequence of changes in the charge of ionizable groups that bias the local electric field. However, our observations indicated that manipulating pH<sub>EXT</sub> does not affect voltage dependence for charge movement of the background construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>), indicating that the protonation of other residues does not affect voltage dependence. In addressing this conundrum, we rationalized that an intermediate <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> value of the more positive component at pH<sub>EXT</sub> 7.4 may arise from interactions between VSDs when Ci-VSP was expressed at high levels, as it is the case in this study. To explore this possibility, Ci-VSP constructs tagged with CFP and YFP were simultaneously expressed in oocytes. Analysis of the fluorescent emission spectra revealed that fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurred between these constructs, indicating that monomers were separated from each other by only few tenths of Angstroms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.201310993/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S3</ext-link>). Based on these results, we argue that when expressed at high density, monomers of Ci-VSP may cluster or segregate in small domains, leading to interactions between the VSD that may modulate voltage dependence, particularly at low pH<sub>EXT</sub>. Addressing this issue is beyond the scope of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>The total sensing charge was not affected by titration of R217H</title><p>To directly address whether a charged residue at position 217 contributes to the sensing of membrane potential, we quantified the maximum net charge observed as a function of pH<sub>EXT</sub>.

Inconveniently, expression of the double mutant R223H-C363S was deleterious to the health of the oocytes: oocytes died or had membranes with very low resistance shortly after injection with mRNA. Arguably, this was caused by the translocation of protons mediated by the mutant. Because charge movement in Ci-VSP is observed at positive potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), the histidine replacing R223 may have been dwelling in the hydrophobic core mediating proton translocation, which likely was deleterious for the oocytes&#x02019; well-being. Thus, we reasoned that shifting the voltage dependence of the VSD toward negative potentials would decrease the influx of proton at resting potential (about &#x02212;20 mV when expressing the R223H mutant) and thus increase the rate of oocyte survival. Therefore, to overcome this problem, we introduced the mutation R223H on the background of the double mutation R217Q-C363S. It is important to remember that we showed here that R217 does not participate in voltage sensing. Therefore, this double mutant does not change the total number of gating charges, but shifts voltage dependence to more negative potential. This latter double mutant was used as background construct for all the remaining arginine-to-histidine mutants studied here.</p><p>Recordings from oocytes expressing the triple mutant R217Q-R223H-C363S, hereafter R223H, showed an inwardly rectifying conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>) instead of sensing currents.

This suggested that charge loss may be caused by the translocation and eventual deprotonation once the histidine residue reaches the extracellular environment. As hypothesized above, the deprotonation may be caused by a change in the histidine&#x02019;s Kd after activation. One implication of this idea is that the Kd is unaltered in the resting state and only the conformational changes associated with the activation of the sensor cause the decay in affinity for proton of the histidine. To address this idea, we next tested whether changing pH<sub>EXT</sub> affects <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON,MAX</sub>. The values of <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON,MAX</sub> obtained for each oocyte were normalized by the value of <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON,MAX</sub> obtained at pH<sub>EXT</sub> 7.4 from the same oocyte. The means of normalized <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON,MAX</sub> (<italic>Q</italic><sub>ON,MAX</sub>/<italic>Q</italic><sub>ON,MAX,pH7.4</sub>) were nearly equal to 1 at pH<sub>EXT</sub> 6.5 and 9.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Therefore, changes in pH<sub>EXT</sub> do not alter the protonation status of the histidine at position 232 when the VSD is in the resting state. Furthermore, fitting the <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>-<italic>V</italic> curves to a Boltzmann distribution revealed that the voltage dependence was almost unaltered, only shifting from 0 &#x000b1; 6 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 4) at pH 6.5 to &#x02212;10 &#x000b1; 6 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 7) at pH<sub>EXT</sub> 9.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). The corresponding <italic>z</italic><sub>Q</sub> values were unchanged as well, showing values ranging between 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.2 and 1.4 &#x000b1; 0.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation R232H causes voltage sensor &#x0201c;trapping&#x0201d;</title><p>Thus far, we have found that histidine replacing four of the five native arginines was able to cross the hydrophobic plug of Ci-VSP as a function of the membrane potential. Yet, we were puzzled by the fact that deprotonation of R232H accounts for &#x0003e;55% of charge loss at pH 9.0. It was not immediately obvious why the removal of one of four charged residues sensing the membrane potential accounts for more than half of the total sensing charge. We reasoned that, in addition to the deprotonation of the histidine, the VSD may be &#x0201c;trapped&#x0201d; in a very stable state from which returning to the resting state was too slow for currents to be resolved with our recording setup.</p><p>To probe for the existence of a trapped state, we recorded sensing currents evoked by successive activating pulses. We reasoned that if activation is leading VSD into a trapped state, then successive activation will increase the number of VSDs trapped, thus decreasing the <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>. To test this hypothesis, we recorded sensing currents evoked by trains of 25 250-ms pulses to 50 mV at 4 Hz. To minimize the contribution of deprotonation to the loss of charge, these recordings were performed at pH<sub>EXT</sub> 6.5. As proposed, pulsing at 4 Hz caused the largest decrease in <italic>I</italic><sub>ON</sub> amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>), reducing <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub> &#x0003e;50% after the 20th pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>, black circles). Such reduction in <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub> was not observed with the background construct R217Q, which showed a mere 10% decay in <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub> only between the first and second pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>, gray circles) and no further decrease during subsequent pulses. These combined observations led us to conclude that most of the charge loss observed with the mutant R232H is a consequence of the histidine mutation. In addition, no change in the decay time constant of <italic>I</italic><sub>ON</sub> was observed in the recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>), which is consistent with the idea that the charge decrease was caused by a reduction of the number of nontrapped sensors. Hence, we argue that the charge loss was caused by at least two processes: one was the fast initial deprotonation of R232H, and the second was a slow transition leading the VSD to a trapped state.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Repetitive pulsing decreases <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>.

To address this idea, we performed recording at pulsing ranging from 0.1 to 2 Hz. As hypothesized, pulsing at 4 Hz caused the greatest decrease in <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>, whereas pulsing at frequencies &#x0003c;1 Hz reduced <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub> by &#x0003c;10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). To quantify the kinetics of trapping, <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub> values were normalized by the <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON,MAX</sub> and plotted with respect to the number of trials (<italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>/<italic>Q</italic><sub>ON,MAX</sub> trial plot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). Fitting <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>/<italic>Q</italic><sub>ON,MAX</sub> trial plots to a double exponential function yielded time constants for the fast initial phase that ranged from 6 &#x000b1; 2 s (<italic>n</italic> = 5) at 0.2 Hz to 0.31 &#x000b1; 0.03 s (<italic>n</italic> = 5) at 4 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 B</xref>). Recording at frequencies of 1 Hz and above showed a slower component with time constants of 8 &#x000b1; 1 s (<italic>n</italic> = 5) at 1 Hz and 1.7 &#x000b1; 0.1 s (<italic>n</italic> = 5) at 4 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 B</xref>). The relative contribution of both components to charge loss was also dependent on the pulsing frequency. At 4 Hz, the slow and fast components accounted for a fraction loss of 0.30 &#x000b1; 0.01 and 0.20 &#x000b1; 0.01 (<italic>n</italic> = 5), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 C</xref>). It is noteworthy that no contribution of the slow component was observed when pulsing at frequency under 1 Hz. These observations are consistent with the idea that two components are the result of the existence of two distinct mechanisms causing the apparent loss of sensing charges.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub> decreases as a function of frequency.

Thus, we speculate that the second component observed in the <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>,<italic>Q</italic><sub>ON,MAX</sub> trial curve of the R232H may be a relaxation-like process leading the VSD into a trapped state. Thus, the trapped state may be a stabilized form of the relaxed state of the VSD of Ci-VSP. This conjecture is currently being investigated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Individual replacement of S4 arginines by histidine allowed us to assess the role of these residues in voltage sensing. Here, we found that R223, R226, R229, and R232 are carriers of sensing charges, whereas R217 is not. However, neutralization of this latter residue by replacing it with glutamine (mutant R217Q) shifts the voltage dependence of sensing currents &#x0003e;60 mV toward negative potentials, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Villalba-Galea et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, reversing the charge with glutamate (R217E) caused an additional negative shift of &#x02212;50 mV. These observations suggest that the charge in position 217 biases the voltage across the VSD. A similar effect was observed by neutralizing the most extracellular arginines in the putative S4 segment of the VSP isolated from <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, known as Dr-VSP. In this case, the neutralizing mutation R153Q causes a negative shift of over &#x02212;80 mV for sensing charge movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hossain et al., 2008</xref>). In spite of this qualitative similarity, an intriguing outcome is that neutralization or charge reversion at R217 changed the fitted <italic>z</italic><sub>Q</sub> values of the <italic>Q</italic>-<italic>V</italic> curves by 30% for R217Q and &#x0003c;15% for R217E, whereas R153Q decreased <italic>z</italic><sub>Q</sub> by 60% for Dr-VSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hossain et al., 2008</xref>). Also, the kinetics of sensing currents recorded from the mutant R153Q were faster than those for the wild-type construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hossain et al., 2008</xref>). These combined observations may indicate that mutating R153 in Dr-VSP and R217 in Ci-VSP has a similar impact in the dynamic of the VSD, making them functionally equivalent in spite of the large difference on the effect over the <italic>z</italic><sub>Q</sub> value.</p><p>On this latter issue, we would like to emphasize that changes in the <italic>z</italic><sub>Q</sub> value are not a reliable way to measure sensing charge of a VSD. To illustrate this idea, let us consider the effect of the mutation I165R on the voltage dependence of Dr-VSP. In this case, it has been shown that increasing the number of charges in the S4 segment decreased the slope of <italic>Q</italic>-<italic>V</italic> curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hossain et al., 2008</xref>). The lack of correlation between the number of sensing charges and the <italic>z</italic><sub>Q</sub> value has also been reported for <italic>Shaker</italic>. Recently, it was shown that mutation of noncharged residues of this voltage-gated channel can modify the steepness of the <italic>Q</italic>-<italic>V</italic> curve without altering the number of gating charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lacroix et al., 2012</xref>). In that study, it was shown that the total charge is mobilized in at least two stages, which may have distinct voltage dependences. Hence, the slope of the overall <italic>Q</italic>-<italic>V</italic> curve does not reflect the total sensing (gating) charge of the VSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lacroix et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have established that the <italic>z</italic><sub>Q</sub> value may not be used to rule out R217 as a sensing charge. However, by the same token, this parameter cannot be used to establish whether a residue is a sensing charge either. Thus, to address this problem, we turned our attention to the mutation R217H, which allows us to manipulate the charge at position 217 by pH titration of the histidine residue. Contrary to other R217 mutants, <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>-<italic>V</italic> curves of the mutant R217H clearly displayed two components that we identified as two populations of VSDs that differed in the protonation status of the 217 histidine. Particularly, one population had a more positive <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> when R217H was protonated; the other population had a more negative <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> because R217H was not protonated. However, the observation to be highlighted is that the overall <italic>Q</italic>-<italic>V</italic> curve showed no change in the <italic>Q</italic><sub>MAX</sub> regardless of the pH<sub>EXT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), implying that R217 is not a sensing charge of Ci-VSP.</p><p>Regarding the residues contained in the canonical every-third-residue array, all mutants were able to translocate protons across the plasma membrane. It is to be noted that the mutation R217Q clearly improves the quality of the oocytes&#x02019; health, presumably because of a shift in voltage dependence that helps shutting down the proton conductance at resting conditions. Our results indicate that, although the charge of the residue at position 217 is not a sensing charge, it has a strong impact on voltage dependence of charge movement. We hypothesize therefore that most of these changes in voltage dependence are the result of an electrical bias that affects the effective membrane potential.</p><p>In the case of R223H, this mutant conducted protons at negative potentials, when the VSD was in the resting state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). The recorded proton currents resembled those reported in the early 2000s involving arginine-to-histidine mutations in the potassium-selective, voltage-gated channel <italic>Shaker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</xref>). As shown in that study, replacing the first sensing arginine of this channel&#x02019;s S4 segment (R362) enabled a proton-selective conductance in the resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</xref>). Given the qualitative similarity of the effects of these mutations in <italic>Shaker</italic> and Ci-VSP, we concluded that R223 is the first sensing charge in the S4 segment of Ci-VSP. Furthermore, this finding also indicates that the electrical field must be focused on a narrow hydrophobic region, similar to what has been described for <italic>Shaker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Starace and Bezanilla, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahern and Horn, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Also similar to what has been shown before for <italic>Shaker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Starace et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Starace and Bezanilla, 2001</xref>), the mutants R226H and R229H did not mediate a &#x0201c;down state&#x0201d; current. Instead, activation of the VSD evoked a small proton conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). We observed an increase in the <italic>Q</italic><sub>OFF</sub> carried during <italic>I</italic><sub>OFF</sub> for the mutant R226H when pH<sub>EXT</sub> was decreased, suggesting that R226H resembles the mutant R371H of <italic>Shaker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Starace and Bezanilla, 2001</xref>). In contrast, the mutation R229H produced tail currents likely carried by protons when the VSD was activated. Tail current amplitudes increased when the extracellular side was acidified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). All of these findings are consistent with the existence of a narrow hydrophobic plug in the core of the VSD of Ci-VSP where the electric field is focused.</p><p>R232 is the most intracellular arginine of the S4 segment. Here, we found that in the R232H mutant the <italic>Q</italic><sub>OFF</sub> was smaller than <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub> at all potentials &#x0003e;0 mV. This observation suggests that, at positive voltages, the S4 segment moves toward the extracellular space, R232H passes the hydrophobic plug, and the maximum <italic>Q</italic><sub>OFF</sub> is decreased partially because of deprotonation of the histidine. The fact that the histidine in position 232 becomes accessible to the extracellular space is a strong indication that R232 is a sensing charge.</p><p>The impact of R232H on charge movement dynamics indicates that R232 is also involved in VSD relaxation. Repetitive activation of the VSD decreases <italic>Q</italic><sub>ON</sub>. At 4 Hz, this decay occurs in two phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). The first, fast, phase accounted for &#x0223c;20% of the charge lost, whereas the second, slow, phase added up to 30% to the loss of <italic>Q</italic><sub>OFF</sub>. The first phase seemingly involved deprotonation of the histidine at position 232. In contrast, the second phase may correspond to VSD relaxation. Our data suggest that conformational changes drive the VSD into a highly stable state. As a consequence, a fraction of the <italic>I</italic><sub>OFF</sub> became too slow to be resolved in our recordings. Examples of this type of phenomenon have been described in voltage-gated channels. In particular, <italic>Shaker</italic> activation of the VSD causes an &#x0201c;immobilization&#x0201d; of gating charges related to relaxation of the VSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lacroix et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Labro et al., 2012</xref>). It is possible that in VSP, the relaxed state may be stabilized by the histidine replacing R232. After deprotonation, a fraction of VSD is trapped; thus, sensing currents are slow and cannot be resolved. Consequently, successive pulsing to positive potentials evokes smaller current. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, at negative potentials, the VSD dwells in the histidine-protonated resting state (R<sub>P</sub>). At more positive potentials, the VSD is driven to a protonated active state (A<sub>P</sub>). There the histidine releases a proton (A<sub>D</sub>). When the membrane potential is kept positive, a new transition leads to a trapped active state (A<sub>T</sub>). This transition may be driven by VSD relaxation. Polarizing the membrane to negative potentials will bring the VSD back to the R<sub>P</sub> state. The transition from an A<sub>D</sub> state to a resting deprotonated state (R<sub>D</sub>) will occur with a faster rate than the transition from the A<sub>T</sub> to the trapped resting state (R<sub>T</sub>). When the VSD is in the state A<sub>T</sub>, sensing charge movement is very slow. Thus, sensing currents are undetectable.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>Kinetic scheme to account for the charge loss in the mutant R232H. At negative potentials, the VSD dwells in the resting state (R<sub>P</sub>), where the residue R232H remains protonated (R232H-H<sup>+</sup>). Pulsing to more a positive potential promotes the transition to the active state (A<sub>P</sub>). From A<sub>P</sub>, the residue R232H can transit to a deprotonated active state (A<sub>D</sub>), becoming uncharged (R232H). If the membrane potential is returned to negative values, the fraction of VSD in the A<sub>P</sub> state can return to the R<sub>P</sub> state, whereas those in the A<sub>D</sub> state will return to deprotonated resting state (R<sub>D</sub>). If the membrane potential remains positive, a secondary transition will take place, leading the VSD to a locked active state (A<sub>T</sub>). This state is stable and transitions from it are infrequent, making this state a pseudo-absorbing state. Upon returning to negative potentials, a transition to a hypothetical locked resting state (R<sub>T</sub>) is expected. It assumed that transitions between these active states are voltage independent and so are those between resting states.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JGP_201310993_Fig10"/></fig><p>In summary, all arginine-to-histidine mutants except R217H were able to translocate protons across the membrane, suggesting that the structure of the VSD exhibits water-filled crevices penetrating the protein from both sides.
