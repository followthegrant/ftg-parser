One cause of this variation is circuit diversification, the alteration of gene regulatory relationships among members of a species. Circuit diversification is thought to be a starting point for the circuit divergence or rewiring that occurs during speciation. How widespread is circuit diversification? Here we address this question with the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, which forms biofilms rich in distinctive hyphal cells as a prelude to infection. Our understanding of the biofilm/hyphal regulatory network comes primarily from studies of one clinical isolate, strain SC5314, and its marked derivatives. We used CRISPR-based methods to create mutations of four key biofilm transcription factor genes&#x02013;<italic>BCR1</italic>, <italic>UME6</italic>, <italic>BRG1</italic>, and <italic>EFG1</italic> &#x02013;in SC5314 and four additional clinical isolates. Phenotypic analysis revealed that mutations in <italic>BCR1</italic> or <italic>UME6</italic> have variable impact across strains, while mutations in <italic>BRG1</italic> or <italic>EFG1</italic> had uniformly severe impact. Gene expression, sampled with Nanostring probes and examined comprehensively for <italic>EFG1</italic> via RNA-Seq, indicates that regulatory relationships are highly variable among isolates. Our results suggest that genotype-phenotype relationships vary in this strain panel in part because of differences in control of <italic>BRG1</italic> by <italic>BCR1</italic>, a hypothesis that is supported through engineered constitutive expression of <italic>BRG1</italic>. Overall, the data show that circuit diversification is the rule, not the exception, in this biofilm/hyphal regulatory network.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Much of what we know about microbial pathogens is derived from in-depth analysis of one or a few standard laboratory strains. This statement is especially true for the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, because most studies have centered on strain SC5314 and its genetically marked derivatives. Here we examine the functional impact of mutations of four key biofilm regulators across five different clinical isolates. We observe that functional impact of the mutations, based on biological phenotypes and gene expression effects, varies extensively among the isolates. Our results support the idea that gene function should be validated with multiple strain isolates. In addition, our results indicate that a core regulatory network, which comprises regulatory relationships common to multiple isolates, may be enriched for functionally relevant genes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21AI135178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0868-4000</contrib-id><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Aaron P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funds from NIH grant 1R21AI135178 (APM) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/">https://www.niaid.nih.gov/</ext-link>) and the Dr. Frederick A.

Although some phenotypic differences between individuals arise from single allelic differences or gene acquisitions, the vast majority represent the interplay of multiple genetic and epigenetic differences [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Natural variation has been measured through assays of biological phenotypes such as fitness, disease susceptibility, or cellular differentiation, and through molecular phenotypes such as the expression of sets of genes. The impact of natural variation is also manifested in genetic background effects on the phenotypes of defined mutations. Comparison of large scale gene knock-out or knock-down collections in pairs of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] strains has shown that genetic background effects are widespread, affecting single gene loss-of-function phenotypes for up to 20% of genes. The implication of such studies, as proposed by Gasch and colleagues, is that network relationships between genes may vary considerably among representatives of the same species [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The clearest example to date in fungi of species-level natural variation in network architecture comes from Chin et al., who studied adherence in two strains of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A MAP Kinase pathway (fMAPK) is required for adherence and expression of the adhesin gene <italic>FLO11</italic> in strain &#x003a3;1278b but not in strain S288c. Crosses between the strains indicated that the regulation of fMAPK-dependence is genetically complex, though a cloning-based rescue strategy defined one modifier locus, <italic>RPI1</italic>, that specifies a transcription factor. Rpi1 can bypass the fMAPK pathway through its ability to bind to the 5' region of <italic>FLO11</italic>, an ability enabled by the <italic>RPI1</italic> allele of S288c and abolished by the <italic>RPI1</italic> allele of &#x003a3;1278b [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, these two representatives of the same species rely upon distinct signaling pathways&#x02014;either an fMAPK-dependent pathway or an Rpi1-dependent pathway&#x02014;to control expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> and, ultimately, adherence [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Chin et al. hypothesized that the natural variation in regulatory relationships that they observed within a species, which they call "circuit diversification," is a precursor to the evolutionary rewiring and circuit divergence that is observed between species.</p><p>How prevalent is circuit diversification among members of a species? What is the extent of its impact? Here we use the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> to address these questions. We focus on two well characterized virulence traits: its ability to grow as hyphae and to produce a biofilm [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hyphae are tubular arrays of cells that can be hundreds of microns in length, and hypha-associated genes specify adhesins, hydrolases, and the toxin Candidalysin that together cause tissue damage [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Biofilms are multicellular surface-bound communities that produce an extracellular matrix and are recalcitrant to antimicrobial treatment [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Biofilms of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> are rich in hyphae, and genetic studies indicate that biofilm production depends upon hyphae in vitro and in animal infection models [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Biofilm formation is connected to virulence because biofilm on implanted medical devices is a major source of infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Our understanding of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> biofilm formation comes primarily from studies of one clinical isolate, strain SC5314, and its derivatives CAI-4, BWP17, and SN152, whose markers facilitate genetic manipulation. Among the most well characterized biofilm regulators are the transcription factors (TFs) Efg1, Bcr1, Ume6, and Brg1 ([<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). A deletion mutation affecting any one can cause a biofilm defect, depending upon the precise growth conditions. All four TFs are also required under many conditions for normal hyphal formation, expression of hypha-associated genes, and virulence in animal models. These TFs are interconnected through their control of overlapping sets of target genes and of one another's expression [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Because biofilm production and hyphal formation have been extensively characterized, this network provides a valuable starting point for an appraisal of natural variation. Uniform network architecture may prevail among <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> isolates, or circuit diversification may prevail. We test these possibilities through analysis of four different single gene deletion mutations in five different <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> clinical isolates. Our results show that the gene expression impact of regulatory network defects is highly variable among strains, and thus argue that circuit diversification is widespread.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Natural variation in biofilm production</title><p>Our studies employed five <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> clinical isolates: SC5314 (clade 1), P76067 (clade 2), P57055 (clade 3), P87 (clade 4), and P75010 (clade 11) [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Some genes that are annotated to hyphal formation, such as <italic>CHT2</italic> and <italic>SOD5</italic>, varied considerably with respect to strain background in their dependence on specific TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007787.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

Examination of individual gene expression responses shows that these genes display less dependence on Efg1 for expression in strain P76067 compared to the other strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007787.s010">S3 Table</xref>).

They were roughly split between Efg1-activated and -repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007787.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). We found only minor enrichments for GO terms among most of these gene sets, and no significant enrichment at all among the SC5314 strain-specific Efg1-responsive genes. Although these genes do not share distinguishing GO assignments, there are prospective functionally relevant genes among them. For example, the SC5314 <italic>efg1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutation leads to significantly reduced expression of <italic>SUN41</italic>, which is required for biofilm formation [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, strain-specific Efg1-responsive genes may contribute to the mutant phenotype, but they do not reveal broad pathways that respond to Efg1 in a strain-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Functional impact of circuit diversification</title><p>The <italic>BCR1-BRG1</italic> relationship provides a simple illustration of circuit diversification: <italic>BCR1</italic> is required for <italic>BRG1</italic> expression in intermediate but not strong biofilm formers (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007787.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007787.g005">5</xref>).

Although the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter is often used for overexpression, in this case it did not yield greatly elevated <italic>BRG1</italic> expression. As predicted by the hypothesis, biofilm production was also Bcr1-dependent in the <italic>BRG1/BRG1</italic> strains and Bcr1-independent in the <italic>BRG1/TDH3-BRG1</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007787.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). As a further functional test of the hypothesis, we examined planktonic hyphal formation.

One hypothesis is that the cis regulatory elements of <italic>BRG1</italic> alleles may contain SNPs that allow Bcr1-independent <italic>BRG1</italic> expression in some strains but not others. We tested this hypothesis by constructing P57055 <italic>bcr1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutant strains carrying <italic>BRG1</italic><sup>SC5314</sup> or <italic>BRG1</italic><sup>P57055</sup> alleles at the <italic>MDR1</italic> locus. These alleles contained 1642 bp of the <italic>BRG1</italic> upstream region and 712 bp of the <italic>BRG1</italic> downstream region. Ectopic expression of <italic>BRG1</italic><sup>SC5314</sup> and <italic>BRG1</italic><sup>P57055</sup> in this manner complemented the hyphal formation defect of a P57055 <italic>brg1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutant strain, demonstrating that the cis contexts captured in these regions were sufficient for <italic>BRG1</italic> expression and function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007787.s007">S7A Fig</xref>).

We approached the problem through measurement of biological phenotypes and gene expression changes that result from mutations in each of four TF genes in the biofilm/hyphal regulatory network. Two of the TF gene mutations, <italic>bcr1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; and <italic>ume6</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394;, had variable phenotypic impact among the strains. These mutations also had variable gene expression impact; an outcome that might have been predicted from phenotypic variation. The other two TF mutations, <italic>brg1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; and <italic>efg1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394;, had uniform phenotypic impact, yet still had highly variable gene expression impact. These observations argue that circuit diversification&#x02013;variation in regulator-target relationships within a species&#x02013;is prevalent for this biofilm/hyphal regulatory network.</p><p>The traits we examined, biofilm production and hyphal formation, are known to vary quantitatively among <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> isolates [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Hence it seemed reasonable that gene expression impact of key biofilm/hyphal regulators would vary as well. We were nonetheless struck by the extent of strain-specific gene expression changes we observed; only about half of the gene expression response to a mutation in any one strain was shared among the other four strains. The fact that even the mutation with the strongest and most uniform biological phenotypes, <italic>efg1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394;, caused variable gene expression impact across strains is especially noteworthy, because large scale dual-strain comparisons of loss-of-function defects have relied on biological phenotypes [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our results argue that biological phenotype measurements may underestimate the difference in impact of a mutation in two different strains.</p><p>What sorts of variation do we see in TF-target gene relationships? Regulation of <italic>SOD5</italic>, <italic>BRG1</italic>, and <italic>UME6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007787.g005">Fig 5</xref>) represents one frequent pattern: expression of each is down-regulated in a mutant, such as <italic>bcr1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394;, in some strains but not others. Analogous observations were made with expression of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae FLO11</italic> and its control by the fMAPK pathway by Chin and colleagues [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The regulation of <italic>CHT2</italic> is more complex, for example in its response to Efg1. It is up-regulated in an <italic>efg1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutant in SC5314, as shown previously [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but it is down-regulated in <italic>efg1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutants of other strains. Efg1 is known to function as an activator at some promoters and a repressor at others [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in strains derived from SC5314. However, our results raise the possibility that Efg1 may function as a repressor or an activator at a single promoter, depending upon the strain background. These examples illustrate strain-dependent differences in TF-target gene relationships that are indicative of circuit diversification.</p><p>Variation in biofilm/hyphal network architecture has clear functional impact, as illustrated by strain differences in the <italic>BCR1-BRG1</italic> relationship. A <italic>bcr1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutation had little effect on biofilm production or <italic>BRG1</italic> expression in two strong biofilm formers, and caused a severe defect in both biofilm production and <italic>BRG1</italic> expression in two intermediate biofilm formers. Because <italic>BRG1</italic> was required for biofilm production in all strains, we considered that differences in <italic>BCR1</italic>-dependence of biofilm production may arise from differences in <italic>BCR1</italic>-dependence of <italic>BRG1</italic> expression. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that constitutive <italic>BRG1</italic> expression eliminated <italic>BCR1</italic>-dependence of biofilm production in an intermediate biofilm former. Prior studies have shown that Bcr1 and Brg1 have considerable functional overlap: among 252 direct Bcr1 target genes identified by ChIP-seq, 194 are Brg1 direct targets as well [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Overlap of target genes may be the reason that <italic>BCR1</italic> is required for biofilm formation only when <italic>BRG1</italic> levels are low. We cannot find strain differences in the Bcr1 binding sites upstream of <italic>BRG1</italic>. Furthermore, cis-regulatory elements of the <italic>BRG1</italic><sup>SC5314</sup> allele were not sufficient for <italic>BRG1</italic> function in the P57055 <italic>bcr1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutant strain. We infer that variation in the <italic>BCR1-BRG1</italic> relationship arises from differences in trans-acting factors that can compensate for absence of Bcr1. This inference is consistent with the conclusion from many studies the bulk of gene expression variance between individuals arises from differences in trans-acting gene products [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Glycolytic genes provide an example of a functionally related group of genes that vary in strength of connection to biofilm regulator Efg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007787.g006">Fig 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007787.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). In most strains, the <italic>efg1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutation caused a severe reduction in glycolytic gene expression. In contrast, in strain P76067 the <italic>efg1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutation caused a mild reduction in glycolytic gene expression. Inspection of the RNA-Seq data shows that expression of <italic>GAL4</italic>, an activator of glycolytic genes [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], is strongly reduced in most <italic>efg1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutants but only mildly reduced in the P76067-derived <italic>efg1</italic>&#x00394;/&#x00394; mutant. Efg1 does not bind directly to the <italic>GAL4</italic> upstream region [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, this example of circuit diversification also seems to arise from differences in activity of trans-acting factors that, in this case, compensate for absence of Efg1.</p><p>Our data provide the first view of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> natural variation from the perspective of gene expression profiles, and several manifestations of strain variation are evident. For example, compared to SC5314, all isolates had significantly increased RNA levels for various cell wall-related genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007787.s013">S6C Table</xref>). Also, higher <italic>BCR1</italic> and <italic>BRG1</italic> RNA levels among isolates correlate with lower RNA levels for ribosome-related genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007787.s013">S6A Table</xref>). These correlations may reflect natural variation in TOR pathway activity, which is known to promote ribosome biogenesis and inhibit Bcr1-dependent adhesin expression [<xref rid="ppat.1007787.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although high resolution trait mapping is not yet feasible for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, a candidate gene-based approach could unravel the causes for these strain differences and their functional consequences.</p><p>A valuable practical application of multi-strain analysis is the distillation of a common set of genetic regulatory relationships. This outcome was suggested by our small-scale Nanostring profiling, but was most clearly documented through genome-wide analysis of Efg1-responsive genes. Specifically, the common Efg1-activated gene set was significantly enriched for biofilm-related genes, and trended toward enrichment for direct Efg1 target genes, compared to any individual strain's Efg1-activated genes. The common Efg1-repressed gene set was enriched for cell-surface related genes, an enrichment that was not found among Efg1-repressed gene sets for individual strains. These outcomes argue that multi-strain analysis of mutants is significant both for the validation of conclusions across multiple species representatives, and for its ability to narrow a panel of responsive genes to those with a strong connection to relevant biological processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Strains and media</title><p>The following <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> clinical isolate strains were obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, Strain P76067, NR-29442; <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, Strain P57055, NR-29439; <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, Strain P87, NR-29453; <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, Strain P75010, NR-29437.
