However, compared with model genetic organisms such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, characterization of the complex biology and biochemistry of algae and strain improvement has been hampered by the inefficient genetic tools. To date, many algal species are transformable only via particle bombardment, and the introduced DNA is integrated randomly into the nuclear genome. Here we describe the first nuclear episomal vector for diatoms and a plasmid delivery method via conjugation from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to the diatoms <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> and <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic>. We identify a yeast-derived sequence that enables stable episome replication in these diatoms even in the absence of antibiotic selection and show that episomes are maintained as closed circles at copy number equivalent to native chromosomes. This highly efficient genetic system facilitates high-throughput functional characterization of algal genes and accelerates molecular phytoplankton research.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

A conjugative link from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to diatoms streamlines the genetic manipulation workflow for diatoms. Plasmids can be assembled and manipulated <italic>in vitro</italic> before being introduced in <italic>E. coli</italic> for direct conjugative transfer to diatoms, thus eliminating the need for time-consuming, high-yield plasmid DNA preparations and access to expensive specific equipment and reagents (for example, gene gun). In conjugative systems, a two-plasmid system is often used where a conjugative plasmid (for example, RP4/RK2 or its derivatives such as pTA-MOB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) contains all of the genes required for establishing a conjugative bridge between the donor and recipient cell and a cargo plasmid contains the construct of interest. Inclusion of an origin of transfer (<italic>oriT</italic>) on the cargo plasmid allows it to be mobilized to the recipient by proteins encoded on the conjugative plasmid. Maintenance of the cargo plasmid as an episome in the recipient cell further requires the presence of sequences that permit replication and segregation of the DNA molecule.</p><p>In this paper we describe our approach to identify a DNA sequence that can support episomal replication in the diatoms <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> and <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic>. Although we had initially intended to isolate a <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> sequence that supported episome replication in diatoms, we identified a sequence encoded by a yeast-derived sequence on the cloning vector that performed this function. We further developed a conjugation-based method to directly transfer episomes from <italic>E. coli</italic> to diatoms. These novel tools and methods compose an efficient and high-throughput system for diatom genetic manipulation that will enable rapid and fundamental advances in diatom functional genetics.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Design of episomal vectors</title><p>To develop an extra-chromosomal replicating vector for diatoms, we first isolated a sequence that functions as a centromere or origin of replication in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.

Therefore, we implemented an experimental workflow based on iterative transformation of <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> with large, cloned fragments (24&#x02013;94&#x02009;kb) of scaffold 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), which is fully assembled between telomeres. Molecules maintained as episomes in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> could be extracted and successfully reintroduced into <italic>E. coli</italic> by electroporation (a technique we define as &#x02018;episome rescue' henceforth). Episome rescue cycles were performed by (1) growing diatom exconjugant colonies in small liquid cultures, (2) extracting diatom DNA, (3) electroporating <italic>E. coli</italic> with the diatom DNA and (4) extracting and analysing plasmids from <italic>E. coli</italic> using standard techniques (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Several diatom colonies were obtained from transformations with the scaffold 25 fragments using electroporation- and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated transformation methods to prevent shearing of the large plasmids. <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> transformation efficiency using the PEG-mediated methods was low and often yielded only one colony per transformation with an approximate efficiency of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>. Of the episomes rescued from these colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>), we chose to work with plasmids p0521o containing the <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> region 25-1, and a spontaneously minimized version, p0521o-reduced; both plasmids were rescued successfully after a second round of <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> transformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d,e</xref>). We modified plasmids p0521o and p0521o-reduced by adding a cloning site composed of the <italic>URA3</italic> gene flanked by I-CeuI and I-SceI sites (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for primer sequences) and renamed them p0521 and p0521s, respectively. The additional <italic>URA3</italic> marker provides an efficient counter selection to insert DNA sequences into the plasmids using yeast assembly methods.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Development of conjugation to diatoms</title><p>We improved the delivery of p0521 and p0521s to <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> by developing a conjugation-based method that transferred p0521s at an efficiency of 4.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> diatom cells, significantly higher than our attempts at electroporation and PEG-mediated transformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), and higher than reported electroporation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and particle bombardment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> efficiencies (4.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>). Transkingdom conjugation has been demonstrated previously for yeasts and mammalian cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, but never before in the Stramenopile lineage. To verify that conjugation was the mechanism of gene transfer, we performed two important controls. First, phleomycin-resistant <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> colonies were only obtained when <italic>E. coli</italic> contained the conjugative plasmid (RP4 variant pRL443 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>)), and second, the origin of transfer (<italic>oriT</italic>) on the mobilizable cargo plasmid (for example, p0521s) was essential to obtain phleomycin-resistant <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Physical association between <italic>E. coli</italic> and diatoms, a necessary prerequisite for conjugation, was identified by scanning electron microscope analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>We verified that rescued episomes were from <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> and not from possible leftover <italic>E. coli</italic> used during the conjugation process. Streaking <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> exconjugant cultures on LB plates and incubating at 37&#x02009;<bold>&#x000b0;</bold>C did not yield any <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies. This effectively confirmed that <italic>E. coli</italic> culture containing the plasmid donor was eliminated during selection of <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> exconjugants. After episome rescue, &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> lines yielded plasmids of the same size as the original starting plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). We identified one class of incorrectly sized plasmids as chimeras between the conjugative and the cargo plasmids (RP4 and p0521s, respectively). Chimeras resulting from multiple copies of <italic>oriT</italic> have been previously noted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, and we later eliminated them by using a variant of the RP4 conjugative plasmid lacking <italic>oriT</italic> (pTA-MOB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). A second class of incorrectly sized plasmids was occasionally recovered with minor size differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Although sequencing of several plasmids identified small deletions and a retrotransposon element insertion event (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), plasmids were stably maintained once identified as having the correct size as discussed below.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DNA sequence conferring episomal replication in diatoms</title><p>To identify the elements of p0521s allowing replication in diatoms, we engineered several variants either lacking the <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>-derived region or lacking other components of the plasmid. First, we mapped the 2.5-kb <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> sequence in p0521s to two distinct subfragments within fragment 25-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Compared with conjugation with the full-length p05201s plasmid, deletion of either of the two subfragments (R1 or R2) that make up the 2.5-kb region led to approximately half as many <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> exconjugants per mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Surprisingly, complete removal of the <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>-derived region still yielded exconjugants at high efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), although plasmid p0521s containing the region yielded &#x0223c;2.5-fold more exconjugants than the version with the <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> sequence deleted. Similar numbers of correctly sized plasmids were rescued regardless of the presence of the <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> region (7/20 or 8/20 for p0521s or p0521s-&#x00394;R1R2, respectively)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Thus, while <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> fragments increased conjugation efficiency modestly, they were not essential for this process and therefore, another sequence on the cargo plasmid was responsible for replication in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>.</p><p>To identify the non-diatom sequence responsible for replication in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>, we varied three possible regions of the p0521s plasmid: the bacterial maintenance region and plasmid backbone, the yeast maintenance region (<italic>CEN6-ARSH4-HIS3</italic>), and the <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>-derived region. We tested the influence of the bacterial maintenance region from p0521s (that is, pCC1BAC) by replacing it with the pUC19 plasmid backbone, and used this bacterial replication origin together with the <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> ShBle cassette and <italic>oriT</italic> sequence to make the four test plasmids pPtPuc1 through pPtPuc4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The yeast maintenance region was cloned in plasmids pPtPuc1 and 3, the <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>-derived region was cloned in plasmids pPtPuc1 and 2, and the final plasmid, pPtPuc4, contained only the bacterial maintenance region from pUC19 with the <italic>oriT</italic> and ShBle cassette for phleomycin resistance in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>.</p><p><italic>P. tricornutum</italic> exconjugants were obtained for all four pPtPuc plasmids; however, pPtPuc1 and pPtPuc3, both containing the yeast maintenance region, <italic>CEN6-ARSH4-HIS3</italic>, yielded over 30-fold more colonies than pPtPuc2 and pPtPuc4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Episome rescue was successful for 20/20 and 19/20 <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> pPtPuc1 and pPtPuc3 colonies, respectively. No episomes could be rescued from <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> pPtPuc2 and pPtPuc4 exconjugants; phleomycin-resistant colonies obtained with these plasmids were likely the result of chromosomal integration. This result was consistent with the 1.4-kb <italic>CEN6-ARSH4-HIS3</italic> fragment (present on plasmids pPtPuc1 and pPtPuc3) containing a sequence establishing episomal replication in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>. When rescued episomes from pPtPuc1 and pPtPuc3 were analysed by gel electrophoresis, 8/20 and 10/20, respectively, had sizes identical to the original material used to conjugate <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>. Thus, the originally isolated <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> sequence found in p0521s (that is, R1 and R2) was not essential for episomal replication in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>, and the vector-derived sequence, <italic>CEN6-ARSH4-HIS3</italic>, was sufficient to establish replicating episomes. Determining how the <italic>CEN6-ARSH4-HIS3</italic> fragment confers episomal replication is the subject of ongoing research.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characteristics of episome replication in diatoms</title><p>Once the episomes were established in the diatom cell, they were maintained with high fidelity.

We were also successful in maintaining a 49-kb heterologous sequence from the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> on the episome at the correct size (p0521-Se, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) for two months in the presence of the antibiotic zeocin.

Southern blot analysis in which DNA was extracted from <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> p0521s-containing lines also supported circular replication and absence of genomic integration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).

A plasmid identical to pPtPuc3, but with the antibiotic selection replaced with the <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> nourseothricin resistance cassette was also constructed (pTpPuc3). Plasmid p0521s has an ShBle cassette for <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> selection with phleomycin as well as the pCC1BAC backbone to support large inserts (up to several hundred kilobases) in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Cloning sequences of interest into this backbone can be performed using yeast assembly methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and inserts can be designed to replace the <italic>URA3</italic> gene with counter selection on 5-fluorooritic acid (5FOA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). When cloning genes of interest into p0521s using yeast assembly, predigestion of the plasmid with I-CeuI and I-SceI is recommended to increase the recombination efficiency. For expression of smaller sequences in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> (for example, single-gene expression cassettes), pPtPuc3 is better suited with a smaller backbone that can be amplified by PCR and assembled with sequences of interest using Gibson assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Note that the high copy number of pUC19-based plasmids may complicate cloning sequences larger than &#x0223c;10&#x02009;kb. To clone sequences into pPtPuc3, we typically insert sequences of interest immediately following the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>CEN6-ARSH4-HIS3</italic> region. Plasmid pTpPuc3 can be engineered with genes in a similar manner as described above for pPtPuc3. All three plasmids (p0521s, pPtPuc3 and pTpPuc3) are available at Addgene. Alternatively, the <italic>CEN6-ARSH4-HIS3</italic> region can simply be amplified and added to any plasmid to permit replication as an episome, provided a means of selection for transformed cells is also present on the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Further inclusion of an <italic>oriT</italic> is necessary if introduction by conjugation is also desired.</p><p>While our initial approach was to discover diatom DNA sequences that function as centromeres, the resulting finding that a yeast-derived sequence could function in a similar manner was surprising and could help elucidate native diatom centromere sequences and sequence requirements in ongoing research. Whether the yeast-derived sequence functions as a true centromere in diatoms remains to be tested. Although maintenance of the <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> episome without antibiotic selection was not as high as the &#x0223c;80&#x02013;95&#x00025; retention observed for yeast centromeric vectors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, it is higher than yeast vectors based on replication origins (ARS) in which only 1&#x00025; of cells maintain the plasmid in the absence of selection after an equivalent number of generations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Furthermore, as noted for yeast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, most of the rearrangements of the diatom episome appear to occur during plasmid introduction; once a line was verified to have the correctly sized plasmid in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>, the episome replicated without alteration over long periods of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>CEN6</italic> (13&#x00025; GC) and <italic>ARSH4</italic> (30&#x00025; GC) regions have much lower GC content relative to the average for <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> (48&#x00025; GC). Low GC regions are known key features in red algal and other protist centromeres<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and may be functioning in a similar manner in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>.</p><p>The diatom system described above is the second system (apart from yeasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) in which an episome was introduced into a eukaryotic cell by conjugation and stably maintained. Conjugative delivery of such elements results in order of magnitude gains in efficiency over widely used particle bombardment methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, both in time and materials, at the genetic manipulation and screening stages. In addition, a large DNA sequence (49&#x02009;kb) was successfully introduced and maintained in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> using this system, suggesting that an entire metabolic pathway could be introduced into the diatom, which may facilitate and accelerate biotechnological applications in these organisms. We observed great flexibility in the conditions that favour conjugation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), but presented the optimum protocols that we have developed. For <italic>P. tricornutum</italic>, we found that diatom cells grown on agar plates were transformed by conjugation at a higher rate than liquid grown cells, while <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> cells were best grown in liquid culture due to difficulties growing this diatom on plates for extended periods. In adapting the technique to other diatom species, plasmids should minimally have the <italic>CEN6-ARSH4-HIS3</italic> region, an origin of transfer (<italic>oriT</italic>) and a selectable marker functioning in the diatom of interest. Conditions during the conjugation (60&#x02013;90&#x02009;min at 30&#x02009;<bold>&#x000b0;</bold>C on &#x000bd; strength L1 agar &#x0002b;5&#x00025; LB medium) are a compromise between those optimal for <italic>E. coli</italic> (LB agar, 37&#x02009;<bold>&#x000b0;</bold>C) and those optimal for the diatom (L1 medium, 18&#x02009;<bold>&#x000b0;</bold>C) and will likely require empirical determination for other diatom species.</p><p>In addition to its biotechnological utility, bacterial conjugation to diatoms is interesting in light of the complex evolutionary history of the Stramenopile clade, which is characterized by multiple endosymbiotic events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and recent horizontal gene transfers from marine bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.

The reactions were cycled under the following conditions: 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 20&#x02009;s, 40 cycles of 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02009;s followed by 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 20&#x02009;s during which data were collected. <italic>C</italic>t values were calculated by the SDS software, plotted as a function of number of template molecules and fit to a logarithmic trend line. Curves were linear over at least four orders of magnitude. Three biological replicates (plasmids extracted from different <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> strains containing plasmid) were tested, each with two to four technical replicates at each dilution. <italic>C</italic>t values resulting from experimental samples were used to calculate the number of molecules of template molecule in the qPCR reaction.
