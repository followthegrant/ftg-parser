During this proliferation process, the cells change their shape as well as their expression profile. These changes resemble those that occur during embryogenesis, when the limb anlagen form the interzone that later develops the joint cleft. We analysed the expression profile of genes that are reportedly important for these changes during embryogenesis within the dedifferentiation process of adult articular chondrocytes. We found <italic>GDF-5</italic>, <italic>BMPR-Ib</italic> and <italic>connexin 43</italic> up-regulated, as well as a down-regulation of <italic>BMPR-Ia</italic> and <italic>noggin</italic>. C<italic>onnexin 32</italic> could not be detected in either native cartilage or in dedifferentiated cells. The newly synthesized proteins were detected by immunofluorescence. There is evidence from our results that dedifferentiated chondrocytes resemble the cells from the interzone in developing synovial joints.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chondrocytes</kwd><kwd>dedifferentiation</kwd><kwd>GDF-5</kwd><kwd>joint formation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a subfamily of the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; super family and consist of about 20 members [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They are involved in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis and govern multiple functions, such as differentiation and cell proliferation. BMPs signal through serine/threonine kinase receptors (BMPRs), composed of type I and II subtypes [<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Three type I receptors (BMPR-Ia, BMPR-Ib and ActR-Ia) and three type II receptors (BMPR-II, ActR-II and ActR-IIb) have been identified [<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ligand binding leads to the assembly of a tetrameric complex of BMPRs, consisting of two type I and two type II receptors [<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Signal transfer is obtained by Smad-1, -5 and -8, which are phosphorylated by the receptor complex. After phosphorylation, the Smad proteins associate with Smad-4. This complex is translocated in the nucleus and evokes alteration in the transcription of different genes [<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>BMP-14, also called growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF-5), is expressed in developing bones during early cartilage condensation [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It has been suggested that GDF-5 is an enhancer but not an inducer for chondrogenesis [<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. GDF-5 mutations have been identified with brachydactyly, which causes shortened tubular bones in the hands and feet, and chondrodysplasia [<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Conversely, overexpression of GDF-5 in chick limb buds increases the size of the affected elements due to an increased cell number [<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, GDF-5 is linked to a dedifferentiated state of the cells and to the formation of the embryonic joint interzone [<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The formation of the interzone and the process of cavitation require dramatic metabolic changes in protein expression [<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Developmental biology describes this process as an active one, which is not only associated with the apoptosis of several cells within the cartilage zone, so that the limb anlagen form two structures articulating with each other [<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Cells are in cytoplstic contact with each other, with a complex pattern of gap junction protein expression (connexin 43 and connexin 32) [<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. At a molecular level, joint formation is associated with the appearance of BMP family members, such as GDF-5 and GDF-6 [<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and with the down-regulation of type II collagen [<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A similar process of dedifferentiation, associated with a down-regulation of collagen type II can be observed in monolayer cultures of human articular chondrocytes [<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The mechanisms that support this <italic>in vitro</italic> dedifferentiation process have not been well characterized, to date.</p><p>GDF-5 is described as one of the pivotal factors in joint development; thus we studied the role of GDF-5, its receptors (BMPR-Ia, BMPR-Ib and BMPR-II) and its antagonist (noggin) in the course of this <italic>in vitro</italic> dedifferentiation process. Furthermore we investigated the changes in the expression pattern of connexin 43 and 32 as important representatives of the intercellular communication system.</p><p>We suggest that some molecular expression patterns that have been described for the formation of the interzone can be found in the dedifferentiation process of human articular chondrocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Isolation and monolayer culture of human articular chondrocytes</title><p>Human articular cartilage samples were collected from the hip of three patients (mean age 80 years) with no history of joint disease, who were scheduled to undergo joint replacement following femoral neck fracture (approved by the Ethics Board of the University of Vienna; code: 184/98). The isolation and cultivation of human articular chondrocytes was performed as previously described [<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Chondrocytes from three different donors were pooled after cell isolation in order to obtain a sufficient number of chondrocytes for dedifferentiation experiments. From the same cartilage used for the cell culture a fraction was pooled and used as native cartilage control. Cells isolated from the ligamentum capitis femoris were used as a fibroblast control.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and purification</title><p>Total RNA was obtained from cells that were being cultivated in monolayer culture. Cells were harvested after cell isolation, at day 1, day 2 and then every second day until day 36, by adding 1 ml of TRI REAGENT&#x02122; (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Lysis of the cells was performed directly on the culture dish. RNA isolation was performed according the standard protocol.</p><p>For total RNA extraction from native cartilage, slices of human articular cartilage were frozen in fluid nitrogen and ground using a mortar and pestle. Further steps were performed with the RNeasy&#x000ae; plant mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). The procedure for isolating total RNA was executed as described in the RNeasy&#x000ae; Mini Handbook (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>cDNA synthesis</title><p>For cDNA synthesis, 0.2&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA was diluted with nuclease-free water to a volume of 15 &#x003bc;l, and 4 &#x003bc;l iScript&#x02122; Reaction Mix, as well as 1 &#x003bc;l iScript(tm) Reverse Transkriptase, were added (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). The reaction was incubated for 5 min. at 25&#x000b0;C, at 40&#x000b0;C for 30 min. and finally, heated at 85&#x000b0;C for 5 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Primers and probes for quantitative analyses</title><p>Primers and probes were designed using the Primer3 program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi">http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi</ext-link>), which creates oligonucleotides with similar melting temperatures and minimal self complementarity. To avoid amplification of genomic DNA, the probes were placed at the junction of two exons. Gene specificity of the primers and probes and the absence of DNA polymorphism were confirmed by BLAST searches. Primers and probes were synthesized by biomers.net (Ulm, Hilden Germany). Primer concentrations were tested for each primer at concentrations of 50, 300 and 900 nM, and the combination that displayed the lowest threshold cycle value was chosen.

The thermal cycling conditions comprised the initial steps at 50&#x000b0;C for 2 min. and at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min.

After a cultivation time of 3 days half of the slides were treated with 2 &#x003bc;M monensin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 hrs. Monensin, as an inhibitor of the intracellular protein transport, leads to an accumulation of newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and enhances the detection of cytokines that are expressed at low levels. The slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin, the slides were incubated for 12 hrs using the following primary polyclonal antibodies: GDF-5 (1:50, La Jolla, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); noggin (1:50, La Jolla); monoclonal antibodies: connexin 43 (1:100, Chemicon, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and BMPR-Ib (1:50, R&#x00026;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Goat serum and the mouse IgG1 isotype were used as negative controls.

When chondrocytes are removed from their natural environment and transferred into monolayer culture, the arrest of the cell cycle is reversed and cells are stimulated to re-enter the propagation process.</p><p>Our studies indicate that one of the crucial players for the restart of propagation may be <italic>GDF-5</italic>. Within only 1 day in monolayer culture, there is a 10-fold increase in the synthesis of <italic>GDF-5</italic>. This up-regulation is maintained throughout the whole proliferation period, reaching its peak around day 22. This is also the period when the switch from <italic>type II collagen</italic> to <italic>type I collagen</italic> is completed [<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>This up-regulation of <italic>GDF-5</italic> occurs together with the up-regulation of <italic>BMPR-Ib</italic>, indicating that both genes represent a functional unit and may augment the effect of GDF-5 on its target genes in this way.</p><p>The effect of GDF-5 is mediated by its binding to a tetrameric complex, consisting of BMPR-II and BMPR-I, and especially -Ib. We could show that, in cells that are transferred to monolayer culture, the level of <italic>BMPR-Ib</italic> is increased, while the expression of <italic>BMPR-Ia</italic> is down-regulated. One may speculate that this down-regulation happens in conjunction with the up-regulation of <italic>BMPR-Ib</italic> and is somehow an antagonistic process. The level of <italic>BMPR-II</italic> expression remains unchanged until day 18. After this time-point, there is an up-regulation of <italic>BMPR-II</italic> but also a slight increase of <italic>BMPR-Ia</italic>. These data suggest a synchronization of the expression profile of these three receptors.</p><p>A diminished amount of noggin also amplifies the effect of GDF-5. Noggin has been reported as an inhibitor of BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7 and GDF-5 by binding to these proteins and preventing interaction with their receptors [<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. If noggin is expressed at a lower level, a lesser amount of GDF-5 could be inhibited, and the proliferation process might be enhanced.</p><p>With the increase in cell number, there is also increased need for cell&#x02013;cell communication. Thus, we tested to what extent cell&#x02013;cell communication in dedifferentiated cells resembled communication during cavitation formation in the embryonic joint.</p><p>Connexin 43 is a gap junctional protein, which is responsible for the increase in intercellular communication and synchronization during the formation of joint cavitation [<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the case of our dedifferentiation studies, we found that the expression of this gene is up-regulated around day 10, and again reaches its peak around day 18.</p><p>Studies suggest that expressions of <italic>GDF-5</italic> and <italic>connexin 43</italic> occur in conjunction with each other and display a similar spatiotemporal expression pattern in a variety of tissues. GDF-5 activity is one element of a mosaic of repressors and enhancers that are necessary to activate the connexin 43 promoter function. Conversely, the suppression of gap junctions inhibits the stimulatory effect of GDF-5 on chondrogenesis in micromass cultures. A functional gap junction may therefore be pivotal to ensure the action of GDF-5 [<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In the course of our studies, we also investigated connexin 32, another gap junctional protein that has been reported to be expressed together with connexin 43 during the formation of the joint embryonic interzone [<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this case, we were not able to detect any expression of this protein in the course of chondrocyte cultivation in monolayer culture.</p><p>Thus, considering our data on the expression of <italic>type I</italic> and <italic>type II collagen</italic> from previous studies [<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] together with <italic>GDF-5</italic>, <italic>noggin</italic> and <italic>connexin 43</italic> from this experiment, we assume that the dedifferentiation process of chondrocytes in monolayer culture is established after a time period of about 20 days.</p><p>Around this period, it seems that the cells try to redifferentiate, as we found an up-regulation of <italic>BMPR-Ia</italic>, <italic>BMPR-II</italic> and <italic>noggin</italic> as well as a slight up-regulation of <italic>collagen type II</italic> in earlier studies [<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We do not think that these findings are accidental, but suggest that this could be an ideal time-point for an external redifferentiation stimulus.</p><p>There is a striking morphological similarity between the cells of the interzone and dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Our molecular biological data highlight the similarity between those two events and indicate that dedifferentiation mechanisms may use, at least in part, signalling pathways and intercellular communication molecules that are similar to those used during embryonic development within the articular interzone.</p><p>The better these pathways are understood, and the more we know about events on a molecular biological basis <italic>in vivo</italic>, the better we can regulate proliferation and differentiation processes <italic>in vitro.</italic> A modulation of these signalling pathways may be an elegant way to influence the redifferentiation behaviour of cells destined for transplantation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Austrian Worker&#x02019;s
