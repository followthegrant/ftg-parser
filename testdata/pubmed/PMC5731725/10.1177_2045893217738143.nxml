We examined a single-center retrospective cohort of children with active or pharmacologically controlled PH who underwent cardiac catheterization or non-cardiac surgery during 2006&#x02013;2014. Preoperative characteristics and perioperative courses were examined to determine relationships between the severity or etiology of PH, type of procedure, and occurrence of major and minor events. We identified 77 patients who underwent 148 procedures at a median age of six months. The most common PH etiologies were bronchopulmonary dysplasia (46.7%), congenital heart disease (29.9%), and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (14.3%). Cardiac catheterizations (39.2%), and abdominal (29.1%) and central venous access (8.9%) were the most common procedures. Major events included failed planned extubation (5.6%), postoperative cardiac arrest (4.7%), induction or intraoperative cardiac arrest (2%), and postoperative death (1.4%). Major events were more frequent in patients with severe baseline PH (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006) and the incidence was associated with procedure type (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05). Preoperative inhaled nitric oxide and prostacyclin analog therapies were associated with decreased incidence of minor events (odds ratio [OR]&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.32, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.046 and OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.24, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008, respectively), but no change in the incidence of major events. PH etiology was not associated with events (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.24). Children with PH have increased risk of perioperative complications; cardiac arrest and death occur more frequently in patients with severe PH and those undergoing thoracic procedures. Risk may be modified by using preoperative pulmonary vasodilator therapy and lends itself to further prospective studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pulmonary vascular disease</kwd><kwd>outcomes</kwd><kwd>pediatric</kwd><kwd>bronchopulmonary dysplasia</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-March 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a heterogeneous and often progressive disorder that can lead to right ventricular failure and death in both adults and children. The distribution of PH etiologies in children is unlike that of the adult population and includes a wide range of developmental pathologies such as persistent PH of the newborn, pulmonary hypoplasia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), congenital heart disease (CHD), and heritable syndromic or idiopathic pulmonary vascular diseases. Children with PH have increased requirements for medical resources owing to a higher frequency of hospitalizations and escalating costs of care.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These children frequently receive general anesthesia when undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures required for management of their PH, as well as for procedures related to other co-morbidities.</p><p>Perioperative management of patients with PH remains a challenge to anesthesiologists, surgeons, and intensivists.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The presence of PH adds significant perioperative risk and adult data on perioperative outcomes in this population are much more robust than the pediatric data. Numerous adult studies highlight the fact that patients with PH have higher than normal perioperative mortality and experience more adverse perioperative events.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr7-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Because significant differences exist between adult and pediatric PH with regard to pathogenesis and natural history, extrapolating adult data to children may not be appropriate.</p><p>A limited body of literature examines the incidence of perioperative complications in children with PH who undergo non-cardiac surgery or cardiac catheterization. It is known that greater impairment in global function caused by PH is associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality and cardiac arrest.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The few pediatric studies that have evaluated perioperative outcomes found PH to be a major risk factor for adverse perioperative complications, including cardiac arrest and PH crisis. However, in these populations, the etiology of PH in most patients was idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Today, the etiology of PH is shifting, with increases in non-CHD-related PH and patients undergoing more non-cardiac procedures.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the incidence of adverse perioperative outcomes after non-cardiac surgical procedures and cardiac catheterizations in our center&#x02019;s pediatric PH population, which is unique from that of previously published studies because it includes a large number of patients with PH secondary to BPD. Additionally, we sought to assess whether any patient-specific or procedure-specific factors were predictive of adverse event risk. We hypothesized that the severity and etiology of PH would be associated with adverse perioperative outcomes.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2045893217738143"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board (NA_00051884) and obtained written informed consent from each patient&#x02019;s parent or guardian. We examined a population of children with PH who underwent non-cardiac surgical procedures, including cardiac catheterizations, in 2006&#x02013;2014. All patients included in the study were under the care of a pediatric pulmonologist at a BPD specialty clinic and/or were inpatients prescribed sildenafil. All procedures were preplanned and were performed under the care of a pediatric anesthesiologist. Bedside procedures in the intensive care units were excluded.</p><p>The study population included children aged&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18 years who had echocardiographic evidence of PH verified by the independent reading of an attending pediatric cardiologist, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) on cardiac catheterization, or PH that was pharmacologically controlled with targeted pulmonary vasodilators and no evidence of PH on echocardiogram or catheterization. The degree of PH was classified as follows: controlled&#x02009;=&#x02009;active pharmacologic therapy with no evidence of PH on echocardiogram or PVR &#x0003c;2 Wood units (WU) on catheterization; mild&#x02009;=&#x02009;right ventricular pressure (RVP) estimated &#x0003c;2/3 systemic blood pressure on echocardiogram or PVR of 2&#x02013;4&#x02009;WU on catheterization; moderate&#x02009;=&#x02009;RVP estimated 2/3 systemic to systemic on echocardiogram or PVR of 5&#x02013;8&#x02009;WU on catheterization; and severe&#x02009;=&#x02009;RVP estimated&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;systemic on echocardiogram or PVR&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;8 WU on catheterization. Any category of patient could be prescribed pulmonary vasodilator therapy. We excluded patients if a PH diagnostic procedure (echocardiogram or catheterization) was performed more than 30 days before the operative procedure in order to capture only those who had timely evaluations for preoperative planning.</p><sec id="sec2-2045893217738143"><title>Outcome definitions</title><p>Perioperative events were classified as minor or major and were evaluated up until seven days postoperatively. A minor event was defined as either the need for escalation of chronic vasodilator therapy in the postoperative period or a transient fluctuation in vital signs. If appropriately addressed intraoperatively, these changes should have no long-term effects, but if left uncorrected, they could precipitate or indicate an impending PH crisis. Minor events included hypothermia (core body temperature&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;36&#x02009;&#x02103;), hypoxia (SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;90% or&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5% less than baseline in cyanotic patients), hypercarbia (end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;45&#x02009;mmHg), and hypotension (systolic blood pressure&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5th percentile for age or&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10% from pre-procedure baseline). A major event was defined as perioperative mortality or a life-threatening deviation requiring immediate treatment, including cardiac arrest, PH crisis, failed planned postoperative extubation, or unanticipated postoperative respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Clinical data were obtained by reviewing paper and electronic medical records relating to the procedure and/or hospital admission.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2045893217738143"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was carried out with STATA 11.2 (College Station, TX, USA). For descriptive statistics, continuous variables are described as median and interquartile range (IQR) and categorical variables are expressed as number and percentage. The Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test was used to determine the relationship between PH diagnosis and PH severity. Major and minor events were compared to severity of PH, etiology of PH, type of procedure, and ASA classification using either chi-square analysis or the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis H-test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of individual and combined variables with outcomes. Significance was defined for all tests as a <italic>P</italic> value of&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05. When more than one non-cardiac procedure or cardiac catheterization was performed for an individual patient, each procedure was analyzed independently and clustered by patient to account for the non-independence of procedures.

Most patients (55.4%) were classified as having mild PH; however, during the study period, as patient conditions changed, there were 22 instances of downgrading to a less severe PH category and eight instances of upgrading to a more severe category. Etiologies of PH, as classified by the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute&#x02019;s consensus approach, included category 1 (19.5%), category 2 (3.9%), category 3 (28.6%), category 4 (46.8%), and category 10 (1.3%).<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Targeted pulmonary vasodilator monotherapy (phosphodiesterase 5 [PDE5] inhibitor&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;endothelin receptor antagonist [ETA]&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;prostacyclin analog) was prescribed in 97 (66.4%) procedures; two procedures were missing preoperative medication profiles. In 20 (13.7%) procedures, two classes of medications (PDE5 inhibitor and ETA or PDE5 inhibitor and prostacyclin analog) were prescribed and in six (4.1%) procedures, all three classes of medication were prescribed. All patients who received prostacyclin analog therapy were on chronic therapy for at least two weeks before the procedure. Patients who received inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) before the procedure required this therapy acutely or before transition to long-term vasodilator therapy.

Preoperative prostacyclin analog therapy was associated with fewer minor perioperative events in this study, suggesting that multimodal preoperative pharmacologic therapy may be beneficial. A multicenter prospective study that examines the use of perioperative prostacyclin analog therapy would help to determine generalizability of these interventions for reducing perioperative events.</p><p>Inhaled NO and prostacyclin analog therapies were associated with a decreased frequency of minor adverse events in our study. However, in the subset of patients undergoing non-catheterization procedures, we noted an increase in minor events in children receiving PDE5 inhibitors and/or nitric oxide. Most of these minor events occurred when optimization of therapy was limited because it was initiated too close to the procedural date, doses or numbers of therapies were inadequate, or the agents were used for acute rescue. Supplemental oxygen therapy decreased the risk of major events for all procedures except cardiac catheterization. Others have reported that chronic pulmonary vasodilator therapy decreased risk of perioperative complications in the general PH population.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Inclusion of these interventions in preoperative protocols for patients with PH may be a valuable consideration, but optimizing the timing of initiation for this pre-procedural intervention remains a future challenge.</p><p>In our study, 93.6% of patients received a balanced anesthetic composed of volatile anesthetics and intravenous agents. This was associated with low rates of intraoperative arrest (2%) and PH crisis (2%). However, there is currently no reported best practice anesthetic for pediatric PH.

Despite an 87% direct ICU admission rate for postoperative care, 4.7% of patients experienced a cardiac arrest within the first seven postoperative days. One arrest occurred on the general care ward on postoperative day 0, triggering patient transfer to the PICU. Failed extubation occurred in 5.6% percent of patients and 1.4% experienced postoperative respiratory failure. Adult patients with PH also experience more postoperative complications than case-matched controls, including heart failure, delayed extubation, and death.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> These data emphasize the importance of comprehensive cardiopulmonary monitoring and teamwork for planning and execution of the postoperative stage of care, including consideration of disposition to an ICU.</p><p>Limitations of our study include the small number of patients from a single center and the use of large registry studies as controls. Definitions of PH and its severity were based on qualitative echocardiographic evidence in just over half the procedures because these data were more commonly collected and quantitative echocardiographic metrics such as tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and ventriculoarterial coupling were not available in most of the patient records. Because cardiac catheterization remains the gold standard, patients without cardiac catheterization data may have been misclassified. Patients with active or pharmacologically controlled PH may have been excluded if their most recent PH diagnostics were obtained more than 30 days before the surgical procedure. Additionally, use of the Panama Functional Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension was limited here, given patient age, heterogeneity of PH etiology,<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and the fact that most patients in this study had no recent outpatient performance data for scoring.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2045893217738143" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, the small sample might have restricted associations between patient risk factors and pre-, intra-, and postoperative care as they relate to adverse events. Associations may have been more thoroughly delineated by a larger sample size. Baseline rates of major events differ at our institution from reported national trends. The absence of an association between vasodilator therapy and major events may be due to a low frequency of such events.</p><p>Heterogeneity of PH etiology was another challenge in this study, and might limit applicability of our results to some subgroups. A consistent feature that differentiates studies of pediatric PH from studies in adults is that children with IPAH are a minority. Most patients in our study had PH as a sequela of prematurity or other non-cardiac causes. The emphasis on infants with BPD-associated PH is a strength of this study and defining perioperative risk in children with PH unrelated to CHD is a pressing priority. However, one consequence of this large BPD cohort is that end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring might have underestimated intraoperative hypercarbia, given the increased dead space ventilation in these patients, and arterial blood gas analyses and serum bicarbonate levels were not available for all patients or procedures. The missing values may limit the applicability of our data on event incidence to other care settings. Further, our study of a convenience-based patient sample was underpowered to definitively discern differences in perioperative outcomes and management priorities between children with differing PH etiologies. The use of our inpatient prescribing data for sildenafil to identify non-BPD subjects did not capture patients that were not on pharmacologic therapy or those undergoing only outpatient procedures. The impact of subspecialty training in pediatric cardiac anesthesiology on PH patient outcomes was not studied here and remains an important open question. Finally, it remains unknown if the degree or type of prescribed pulmonary vasodilator therapy creates an implicit bias in providers that would cause them to be more cautious or prudent in their care.</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that children with PH are at increased risk for major perioperative complications, including cardiac arrest and death. Moreover, this risk is increased by increasing PH severity. Thoracic procedures, including congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair, diaphragm plication, and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery were associated with increased numbers of major adverse events. Scrutiny at the time of perioperative screening, dedicated multidisciplinary care that incorporates input from PH specialists, and pharmacologic optimization may enhance perioperative outcomes. Strong consideration for postoperative cardiopulmonary ICU monitoring care is warranted because most of the cardiac arrests and deaths occurred in the postoperative period. Additional studies will be necessary to elucidate ideal anesthetic techniques for this population, the role of subspecialty cardiac anesthesiologists and intensivists in their perioperative care, other modifiable risk factors, and the definition of optimal clinical pathways for perioperative care.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec13-2045893217738143"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The author(s) declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec14-2045893217738143"><title>Funding</title><p>Meghan Bernier received support from Ruth L.
