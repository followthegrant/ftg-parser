We have previously demonstrated a role for mGluR1 in mediating tumor cell growth, endothelial cell proliferation, and tumor-induced angiogenesis in TNBC. In this study, we explore a role for mGluR1 in regulating inflammation in TNBC. <italic>GRM1</italic> expression was silenced in MDA-MB-231 cells to study changes in expression of inflammatory genes regulated by mGluR1. Results were confirmed by ELISA using <italic>GRM1</italic>-silenced and overexpressed cells and mGluR1 inhibitors. A functional role for these differentially expressed genes was determined <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. 131 genes were differentially expressed in <italic>GRM1</italic>-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells, with some of these falling into four major canonical pathways associated with acute inflammation, specifically leukocyte migration/chemotaxis. Upregulation of three of these genes (<italic>CXCL1, IL6, IL8</italic>) and their corresponding protein was confirmed by qPCR analysis and ELISA in <italic>GRM1</italic>-manipulated TNBC cells. Upregulation of these cytokines enhanced endothelial adhesion and transmigration of neutrophils in co-culture assays and in 4T1 mouse tumors. Our results suggest mGluR1 may serve as a novel endogenous regulator of inflammation in TNBC.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases in the U.S. are triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype that lacks receptors for estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The only current systemic treatment options for TNBC include cytotoxic chemotherapeutics that target rapidly replicating cells and produce significant morbidity. The identification of new molecular targets to treat TNBC thus has the potential to produce new effective therapies for TNBC while reducing toxicity associated with standard chemotherapy and addressing a critical unmet need in breast cancer therapy.</p><p id="Par3">Recently, a link between the tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) and TNBC has been established, in which increased immune infiltrates positively correlated with improved pathologic complete response, decreased distance recurrence, and improved progression-free survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Determining how to stimulate the influx of these immune infiltrates could potentially reduce mortality associated with TNBC. However, the immune system can play a dual role in cancer, acting both as a suppressor or promoter of tumor growth. The system is complex and involves various factors secreted by tumor cells, surrounding stromal and invading immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In breast cancer, immune cells, including tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play a major role in determining tumor cell fate through expression of various inflammatory agents, including chemokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, polarizing the TIM in favor of an anti-tumor phenotype could potentially be effective as a treatment for TNBC.</p><p id="Par4">Previously, we identified metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 (mGluR1) as a possible therapeutic target in TNBC. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a family of G-protein coupled receptors known to mediate reflexes in the nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. mGluR1 belongs to the Group I mGluR family whose over-expression has been linked to melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

In addition, we have demonstrated <italic>GRM1</italic> and mGluR1 are expressed at significantly higher levels in human breast cancer tissue compared to patient-derived normal breast tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In this study, we observe mGluR1 as an inhibitor of both the production of inflammatory chemoattractants by TNBC cells as well as the induction of neutrophil (PMN) transmigration. These findings suggest mGluR1 may serve as a novel endogenous regulator of inflammation in TNBC by initiating signals in breast cancer cells that modulate PMN transmigration and function within the TIM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>GRM1 mediates inflammatory signaling pathways</title><p id="Par5">Microarray gene expression analysis was performed using <italic>GRM1</italic>-silenced MDA-MB-231cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Since CXCL1 and IL-8 are strong PMN chemoattractants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, a role for mGluR1 in regulating PMN transmigration was examined both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, exposure of endothelial cells to conditioned medium from sh<italic>GRM1</italic> MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in increased migration of PMNs through endothelial monolayers whereas conditioned medium from <italic>GRM1</italic> overexpressing MDA-MB-468 cells had a strong inhibitory effect. Interestingly, even though CXCL1 and IL-8 secretion levels were significantly decreased in <italic>GRM1</italic> overexpressing MDA-MB-468 cells, PMN adhesion was not significantly affected. This suggests high ectopic expression of mGluR1 may trigger release of other molecules such as TNF, IFN or TGF&#x003b2; from the TNBC cells or the endothelial cells themselves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> that are known to inhibit PMN transmigration.</p><p id="Par13"><italic>In vivo</italic>, we also observed that treating the syngeneic mouse 4T1 mammary cancer model with riluzole increased the presence of PMNs in the tumors, which coincided with decreased tumor growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

In that study, riluzole inhibited cell growth, invasion and migration in both <italic>GRM1</italic> silenced and over-expressed cells suggesting lack of <italic>GRM1</italic> involvement. In addition, a recent microarray analysis demonstrated cell cycle genes to be major pathways regulated by riluzole further suggesting alternative pathway(s) by which riluzole functions other than mGluR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Further <italic>in vivo</italic> studies utilizing more specific mGluR1 inhibitors, such as BAY36-7620, are necessary to definitively define a role for mGluR1 in mediating inflammation within the TIM.
