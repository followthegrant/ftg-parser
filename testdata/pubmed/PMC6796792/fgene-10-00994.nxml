<bold>Background and aims:</bold> Obesity is a major health problem worldwide. Given the heterogeneous obesity phenotype, an optimal obesity stratification would improve clinical management. Since obesity has a strong genetic component, we aimed to develop a polygenic risk score (PRS) to stratify obesity according to the genetic background of the individuals.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 231 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) significantly associated to body mass index (BMI) from 21 genome-wide association studies were genotyped or imputed in 881 subjects from the Quebec Family Study (QFS). The population was randomly split into discovery (80%; n = 704) and validation (20%; n = 177) samples with similar obesity (BMI &#x02265; 30) prevalence (27.8% and 28.2%, respectively). Family-based associations with obesity were tested for every SNP in the discovery sample and a weighed and continuous PRS<sub>231</sub> was constructed. Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to test the association of PRS<sub>231</sub> with obesity in the QFS discovery sample and validated in the QFS replication sample. Furthermore, the Fatty Acid Sensor (FAS) Study (n = 141; 27.7% obesity prevalence) was used as an independent sample to replicate the results.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> The linear trend test demonstrated a significant association of PRS<sub>231</sub> with obesity in the QFS discovery sample (OR<sub>trend</sub> = 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14-1.24]; P = 2.0x10<sup>-16</sup>). We also found that the obesity prevalence was significantly greater in the higher PRS<sub>231</sub> quintiles compared to the lowest quintile. Significant and consistent results were obtained in the QFS validation sample for both the linear trend test (OR<sub>trend</sub> = 1.16 [95% CI, 1.07-1.26]; P = 6.7x10<sup>-4</sup>), and obesity prevalence across quintiles. These results were partially replicated in the FAS sample (OR<sub>trend</sub> = 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.24]; P = 2.2x10<sup>-2</sup>). PRS<sub>231</sub> explained 7.5%, 3.2%, and 1.2% of BMI variance in QFS discovery, QFS validation, and FAS samples, respectively.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results revealed that genetic background in the form of a 231 BMI-associated PRS has a significant impact on obesity, but a limited potential to accurately stratify it. Further studies are encouraged on larger populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>polygenic risk score</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>genome-wide association study</kwd><kwd>body mass index</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100004411</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Canada Research Chairs<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001804</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="5286"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is a metabolic condition characterized by a large heterogeneity. Body mass index (BMI) has been widely used as a reference indicator to characterize the different degrees of obesity (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Seidell and Flegal, 1997</xref>). Although other indicators, such as body fat percentage or waist-to-hip ratio, have been also employed (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ashwell et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lean et al., 1995</xref>), BMI remains the most commonly used in clinical practice. Different approaches have been explored to stratify obesity based on BMI classification (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2011</xref>). Among others, an obesity background during childhood and a familial history of obesity remain as the lead traditional risk factors of obesity (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Loos and Janssens, 2017</xref>). In this regard, the Quebec Family Study (QFS) has focused on traditional and nontraditional risk factors of obesity, adiposity, or body fat distribution and their genetic determinants (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chaput et al., 2014</xref>), leading to a body of evidence on the genetic and familial environmental background for the development of obesity (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Robitaille et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Do et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Choquette et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Obesity is phenotypically and genetically highly complex (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh and Bouchard, 2017</xref>) and, in spite of the growing evidence linking genetics to obesity, the use of genetic information to correctly classify obesity has led to heterogeneous results. Although many genetic variants have been repeatedly associated with obesity, such as those located within <italic>FTO</italic> or <italic>MC4R</italic> genes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Frayling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Loos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Rouskas et al., 2012</xref>), their ability to stratify obesity remains insufficient, as compared to traditional risk factors or familial resemblance (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Loos and Janssens, 2017</xref>). In an effort to overcome this limitation, the use of a combination of obesity-associated SNPs has become a promising strategy. A number of studies have already tested the ability to stratify obesity based on a cumulative number of BMI-associated SNPs combined into a single parameter, commonly called polygenic risk score (PRS) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Sandholt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Speliotes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Locke et al., 2015</xref>). By using this approach, obesity stratification results from a combination of SNPs, which offers a more integrated view of the genetic basis of obesity.</p><p>To expand our knowledge on the genetic basis of obesity, the ability of a PRS constructed with all the obesity-associated SNPs currently known was tested. The QFS, a study designed to investigate the genetic and environmental factors of obesity, was used to construct and test the PRS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Population</title><p>Cross-sectional data from 881 QFS participants were used in the present study. The QFS is a study conducted from 1979 to 2002 in several phases, which focuses the genetic determinants of obesity and body fat distribution (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chaput et al., 2014</xref>). The 881 participants of the present study were from 222 French-Canadian nuclear families from Quebec City and were recruited according to their obesity status (at least one parent and one offspring with a BMI of 32 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chaput et al., 2014</xref>). The participants were randomly split into the QFS discovery (80%; 704 participants) and QFS validation (20%; 177 participants) samples.</p><p>The replication sample comprised 141 subjects from the Fatty Acid Sensor (FAS) Study, in which subjects from the Quebec City metropolitan area were originally recruited to identify determinants of the plasma triglyceride response to an n-3 fatty acid supplementation (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01343342). Trial details and participant selection criteria are extensively described in (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Rudkowska et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, participants of the FAS study were metabolically healthy subjects with a BMI between 25 and 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and not taking any medication to treat lipid disorders or fatty acid supplements for at least 6 months prior to the intervention. From a total of 254 subjects included in the study, 210 completed the intervention protocol, and those 141 exhibiting the most extreme triglyceride response after the supplementation were selected to perform a genome wide association study (GWAS).</p><p>Experimental protocols of both QFS and FAS studies were approved by the ethic committee of the Laval University and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants of both studies provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Genotyping and Imputing</title><p>A total of 231 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with BMI were selected from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog (33) by using &#x0201c;body mass index&#x0201d; as both search term and disease/trait filter on November 2015 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">

Concretely, 163 SNPs significantly associated (P &#x0003c; 5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>) with BMI and 68 SNPs showing suggestive evidence of association (P &#x0003c; 1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) were selected from 16 previous GWAS and 6 GWAS meta-analysis.

Imputation of remaining 135 SNPs was performed using MaCH software (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010b</xref>) and the CEU reference panel consisting of 120 haplotypes from HapMap Phase II data (release 22, build 36), as previously described (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Sung et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The 141 participants from the FAS study were genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmni-5-Quad Bead-Chip (Illumina, San Diego, CA), containing 4,301,331 markers, from which 153 belonged to the 231 selected BMI-associated SNPs in the present study. The mean call rate across all samples was 99.84%. None of the 141 samples analyzed were excluded due to low signal intensity or low overall call rate (&#x0003c;95%). Inclusion criteria for BMI-associated SNPs were MAF &#x0003e; 1%, call rate &#x0003e; 95%, and HWE P &#x0003e; 2.6x10<sup>-4</sup>.

The mean imputation rate was 0.93 and none of the 78 imputed SNPs were excluded due to low imputation quality (r<sup>2</sup> &#x0003e; 0.3) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010b</xref>).</p><p>Sample quality, call rate, allele frequencies, and HWE tests were assessed using PLINK 1.9 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2015</xref>).

Nevertheless, although the evidence of association observed in the QFS discovery sample between PRS<sub>231</sub> and obesity prevalence was supported by significant results in the QFS validation sample, these results were only partially replicated in the independent FAS study. According to Dudbridge, a larger training sample size would have been needed with such limited QFS and FAS target samples (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dudbridge, 2013</xref>). However, although the size of the discovery sample is more critical than that of target samples in a polygenic score analysis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dudbridge, 2013</xref>), we acknowledge that this study lacks of sufficient statistical power to address clinical questions in a confident manner and that a number of reported associations may be spurious. In order to maximize statistical power to overcome this issue (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dudbridge, 2013</xref>) and taking into account recent evidence suggesting that heritability of complex traits comes from large numbers of commons SNPs (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Khera et al., 2018</xref>), the polygenic score was constructed herein with all the 231 available obesity-associated SNPs and not only with the 31 significantly associated SNPs. In this regard, the use of larger numbers of GWAS markers, combined with adequate sample sizes, represent a promising strategy when approaching the development of genetic tools focused on disease stratification (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Wray et al., 2013</xref>). Although it would be preferable that SNP weights had been derived from independent datasets, the heterogeneity in effect size calculations among studies, together with the specific family-based data used in the present study, led us to derive our own SNP weights in the QFS discovery sample.</p><p>The QFS cohort involves participants from 222 French-Canadian families from Quebec City, making up a largely homogeneous ancestry population. Family relatedness was handled by using generalized linear mixed models, a statistical method successfully applied in the past when testing genetic associations in samples with family or cryptic relatedness among individuals (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Choquette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Plourde et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rudkowska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study comparing distributions of polygenic scores of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease within populations with different ancestries has shown that the risk level estimated for one population can considerably differ from the level in another (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Reisberg et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, another study focused on the contribution of polygenic risk to obesity reported different effects of the genetic score on BMI across different ethnics and birth cohorts (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Walter et al., 2016</xref>). Herein, the cumulative effect of 231 SNPs resulted in a difference of more than 6.5 BMI units (31.5 vs 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) between subjects in the fifth and first PRS<sub>231</sub> quintiles in the QFS discovery sample, and 4.5 BMI units (30.0 vs 25.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in the QFS discovery sample. Although main results were consistent across quintiles in the independent and more heterogenous FAS study, we acknowledge that the ethnic homogeneity of QFS may represent a limitation to the generalizability of the results, and larger studies are still required for accurately testing the clinical utility of a polygenic score to stratify obesity.</p><p>On the other hand, compared to previous GWAS results, where reported single-SNP associations with obesity explained less than 1% of BMI variance (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Frayling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Loos et al., 2008</xref>), polygenic scores are able to progressively increase the proportion of variance accounted for by using cumulative series of BMI-associated SNPs (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Speliotes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Locke et al., 2015</xref>). In this regard, PRS<sub>231</sub> is to date the polygenic score involving the largest number of BMI-associated SNPs and had a cumulative impact on BMI accounting for 7.5% and 3.2% of phenotypic variance in both QFS discovery and replication samples, respectively. Although the proportion of the phenotypic variance attributable to genetic variance is one of the largest among previous obesity polygenic scores (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Loos and Janssens, 2017</xref>), this is certainly not a large proportion of phenotypic variance if we consider that more than 90% of the variance is still unaccounted for. This issue, together with an insufficient statistical power driven by limited sample sizes, represent the main weaknesses of using polygenic scores to stratify complex phenotypes such as obesity.</p><p>A recent study in the QFS cohort, where a PRS with 97 BMI-associated SNPs was also developed, showed that eating behavior played an important role in the genetic susceptibility to obesity (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jacob et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, other studies have reported a significant impact of satiety mechanisms (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Llewellyn et al., 2014</xref>) or fat and energy intake (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Celis-Morales et al., 2017</xref>) on the genetic susceptibility to obesity assessed from genetic scores (28 and 93 BMI-associated SNPs, respectively). In agreement, previous studies suggesting a great impact of genetic background in body weight loss after bariatric surgery (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rinella et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">de Toro-Mart&#x000ed;n et al., 2018</xref>) also point to the need of focusing on the interaction between genetic background with other factors influencing weight loss outcomes. Future research in the field is expected to boost the accuracy and reliability of PRSs in anticipating the onset of metabolic diseases, such as obesity, leading to an early management of such disorders (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Khera et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether, these results highlight the relevance of accurately identifying all the factors involved in obesity development and body weight management, as well as their interaction with the genetic background, for a better disease stratification. Deepen on these factors and on their relationship with each other will help on the accurate identification of obesity-prone individuals, who may benefit more from precision nutrition or lifestyle interventions.</p><p>In conclusion, in the present study, a generalized linear mixed model was fit in order to stratify obesity prevalence by means of a polygenic score. Main results revealed that genetic background in the form of a 231 BMI-associated PRS has a cumulative impact on obesity, but a limited potential to accurately stratify it. These results should be then taken with caution, as the ability of this polygenic score in classifying obesity status is not accurate enough at the individual patient level. Further studies are encouraged on larger samples with more comprehensive genetic scores.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Experimental protocols of both QFS and FAS studies were approved by the ethic committee of Laval University and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
