We investigated whether gender differences occur in the clinical characteristics of patients selected for bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) or in the outcome when resource limits influence treatment choices made by patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Fifty-one consecutive patients were evaluated 1 month before, and 12 months after bilateral STN DBS. All patients were rated using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life (PDQL) Scale, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination and Beck Depression Inventory.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Pre-operative characteristics did not differ between the genders except for lower doses of drugs (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03), worse emotional scores in PDQL (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) and worse depression (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03) in women. There was no gender difference in the surgical outcome, except a lesser reduction of dopaminergic drugs in women. Depression and quality of life (QOL) improved equally well in women and men.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Bilateral STN DBS is equally efficacious in both genders as a treatment for motor complications of PD and for improving QOL. Women are likely to be undertreated because of more severe dyskinesia and may experience less emotional well-being, and could therefore potentially benefit from earlier surgical treatment.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Deep brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>gender differences</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of people over the age of 50 years, though unrecognized early symptoms of the disease may be present in as many as 10% of those over 60 years of age.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Gender difference exists in the incidence and prevalence of PD, being 1.5-2 times[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] higher in men than women.

These sort of gender-based differences are more likely to occur in resource-poor countries like India, where the enormous cost of surgical treatment of PD is often met by patients themselves. We undertook this study to address the gender differences in the pre-operative characteristics and post-operative outcome among 51 consecutive Indian patients who underwent STN DBS at our center.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Fifty-one consecutive patients who underwent bilateral STN DBS for advanced PD and completed 1-year follow-up participated in the study.</p><p>All subjects were assessed using UPDRS I-IV, 1 month before surgery (baseline evaluation) in the <italic>off</italic>-medication and <italic>on</italic>-medication conditions. All patients underwent bilateral stereotactic implantation of quadripolar DBS electrodes (Medtronic, MN, USA) in one session according to the standard protocol described in our earlier study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] All patients were evaluated 1 year after surgery in &#x0201c;<italic>on</italic>-stimulation, <italic>off</italic>-medication&#x0201d; state. UPDRS III was rated (except rigidity) on videos by another blinded movement disorder specialist who was not part of the surgical team.

Baseline evaluation [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] revealed no gender differences in the age at onset, duration of disease and severity of the motor symptoms of the disease assessed by Hoehn and Yahr staging. The activities of daily living (ADL) scores (UPDRS II), were similar in OFF, though there was a trend for it to be worse in women in ON (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05). No significant differences were noted in the UPDRS III motor scores, even though women showed a trend towards having worse bradykinesia (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05) and axial motor (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07) scores compared to men during ON. Women were on lesser LEDD than men (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03). The dyskinesia and fluctuations scores (UPDRS IV) were also similar between the genders.

Nevertheless, women were on lower doses of dopaminergic medications and showed a trend toward worse control of bradykinesia and poorer functioning in activities of daily living. They were more depressed compared to men. Despite these differences, motor symptoms, ADL, depression, and QOL improved equally well in women as in men following STN DBS. The only post-operative gender difference was that women achieved lesser reduction of dopaminergic medications.</p><p>Contrary to the observation by Hariz <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] we found that women undergoing STN DBS for advanced PD are selected for the procedure at similar severity and duration of motor symptoms as men, indicating that women in our study received an equal opportunity for STN DBS. The surgical cohort in that study was heterogeneous, consisting of patients undergoing not only DBS, but ablative procedures like pallidotomy and thalamotomy also. A more recent study by Accolla <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] on patients undergoing DBS found no such differences; their results were similar to our findings. Our results suggest that only financial limitations and not gender based discrimination act as constraints for women with PD to undergo DBS. In the pre-operative assessments, we did not find worse dyskinesias in our female patients, probably due to the lower dose of dopaminergic medications taken by them. This difference in dosage of dopaminergic medications prescribed to women was the result of an intentional reduction in the dosage of medications aimed at the control of troublesome dyskinesia in women. This could explain the equal severity of dyskinesias between the genders, even though women are reported to have more dyskinesia.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This dose restriction may also explain the poorer control of bradykinesia and axial signs in ON and the impairment of ADL in women. The reduction in LEDD after surgery was also lesser in women probably because women were already receiving a lower dose prior to surgery. The policy of drug reduction after STN DBS followed at our center aims only to reduce dyskinesias.</p><p>The women subjects in our cohort at baseline evaluation were more depressed and had worse emotional score for QOL. Biological factors contribute to worse depression in women, and depression is more common in women with PD,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] though this has not been a consistent observation.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The prevalence of depression in the general population is also higher in women.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The poorer functioning in activities of daily living even in ON could also have contributed to the poorer emotional state of women in QOL scores. Nevertheless, gender difference in depression disappeared at 1 year of follow-up.</p><p>We found that STN DBS resulted in excellent improvement in UPDRS motor scores, fluctuations, dyskinesias, activities of daily living and all domains of quality life irrespective of gender. Romito <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] found slightly worse lower limb akinesia and gait scores in women at 1 year follow-up, but the difference was not seen on subsequent yearly follow-up evaluations. Accolla <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found that bradykinesia responded poorly in women at baseline as in our study, though a trend for better improvement in ADL was also found after DBS. However, in the present study, the ADL improved to a similar degree in both genders.</p><p>The relatively short duration of follow-up (1 year) is a limitation of our study. Moreover, the group of patients that are ultimately candidates for DBS for PD is highly selected, and may not be the ideal one to study the gender differences and to answer the question whether women get an equal opportunity as men to undergo DBS in resource poor countries. Ideally, a prospective study on a cohort of patients with PD being referred for consideration of DBS may be required to address these issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze gender differences in patient selection and outcome of STN DBS from a resource-limited country like India. Apart from those used by earlier investigators,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] we included additional outcome measures for depression and QOL. In conclusion, we found that women with advanced PD are likely to be maintained on lower doses of dopaminergic medications compared to men with similar duration and severity of motor symptoms, probably as an adjustment for the propensity of women to have more dyskinesia. This may also contribute to more functional impairment and reduced emotional well-being in them. Women respond equally well to STN DBS, with similar improvement of ADL, QOL, and depression and would therefore benefit from early surgical interventions when dyskinesias becomes dose-limiting.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> The study was funded by an in house project (No 5040) of the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute
