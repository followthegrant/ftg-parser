The molecular bases of this correlation are not thoroughly understood. Events triggered by CXCL12 may play a part, as CXCL12 drives the migration of both CXCR4-positive cancer cells and macrophages and may promote a molecular crosstalk between them.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Samples of HER1-positive colon cancer metastases in liver, a tissue with high expression of CXCL12, were analysed by immunohistochemistry. In all of the patient biopsies, CD68-positive tumour-associated macrophages presented a mixed CXCL10 (M1)/CD163 (M2) pattern, expressed CXCR4, GM-CSF and HB-EGF, and some stained positive for CXCL12. Cancer cells stained positive for CXCR4, CXCL12, HER1, HER4 and GM-CSF. Regulatory interactions among these proteins were validated <italic>via </italic>experiments <italic>in vitro </italic>involving crosstalk between human mononuclear phagocytes and the cell lines DLD-1 (human colon adenocarcinoma) and HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), which express the above-mentioned ligand/receptor repertoire. CXCL12 induced mononuclear phagocytes to release HB-EGF, which activated HER1 and triggered anti-apoptotic and proliferative signals in cancer cells. The cancer cells then proliferated and released GM-CSF, which in turn activated mononuclear phagocytes and induced them to release more HB-EGF. Blockade of GM-CSF with neutralising antibodies or siRNA suppressed this loop.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>CXCL12-driven stimulation of cancer cells and macrophages may elicit and reinforce a GM-CSF/HB-EGF paracrine loop, whereby macrophages contribute to cancer survival and expansion. The involvement of mixed M1/M2 GM-CSF-stimulated macrophages in a tumour-promoting loop may challenge the paradigm of tumour-favouring macrophages as polarized M2 mononuclear phagocytes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Over the last few years, a great deal of attention has been paid to the clinical significance of macrophages that infiltrate cancer. A number of studies provide evidence that tumour-associated macrophages are a negative prognostic factor of survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A recent gene-profiling study demonstrates that the overexpression of a macrophage signature and an increased number of tumour-infiltrating macrophages in diagnostic lymph-nodes are associated with poor outcome in classic Hodgkin's lymphoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Other studies underline pathways leading to M2 macrophage responses that foster tumour growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the end, all these studies deal with the crosstalk between tumour cells and macrophages. For instance, a regulatory loop between breast cancer cells and macrophages has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and the cellular expression of matrix metallopeptidase 11 seems to be relevant to disease outcome at least in classic Hodgkin's lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, the grounds on which the above-mentioned prognostic significance rests are not so thoroughly appreciated, especially in terms of cell-to-cell molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Within the tangle of relations between macrophages and cancer cells, we tried to tease out the role that CXCL12 plays in both cancer cells and macrophages at the boundaries between cancer and inflammation. A tissue with high expression of CXCL12 (for example, liver or bone marrow) may represent a site that preferentially attracts both macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which co-migrate depending on their expression of the CXCL12 receptors CXCR4 and/or CXCR7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Ligand binding to these receptors, which are heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), activates matrix metallopeptidases that cleave EGF-family ligands, such as EGF or HB-EGF, from the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], leading to <italic>trans</italic>activation of HER1 on neighbouring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This transactivation mechanism is a general function of GPCR signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. HER1 expressed by epithelial cancers plays a pivotal role by transducing signals that favour tumour progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The macrophage-regulator GM-CSF, which is produced by some types of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], specifically induces HB-EGF in macrophages and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Because mononuclear phagocytes express both CXCL12 GPCRs and HB-EGF, we argued that the recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes to a site of metastasis such as liver through CXCL12 should induce a release of HB-EGF, which is expected to activate HER1 and favour tumour progression. We found that tumour-associated macrophages and metastatic HER1-positive colon cancer in liver biopsies expressed a ligand/receptor repertoire that was consistent with our hypothesis and that <italic>in vitro </italic>CXCL12 could trigger a GM-CSF/HB-EGF paracrine loop whereby mononuclear phagocytes support cancer survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical requirements</title><p>The blood and histological samples used in our study were in compliance with Institutional Review Board regulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>Highly purified human mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils were isolated from the buffy coats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] of blood samples from healthy volunteers. HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), DLD-1 (human colon adenocarcinoma) and Balb/c 3T3 (Swiss mouse embryo) cell lines (purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA) and HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, purchased from Cambrex, Walkersville, VA) were also used. Non-adherent and adherent cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium and DMEM or TC199 + 10% FCS (complete medium; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), respectively. Cells were treated with 200 ng/mL CXCL12 (Peprotech, London, UK) or 25 ng/mL GM-CSF (Genetics Institute, Boston, MA) or 25 ng/mL HB-EGF or 100 &#x003bc;g/mL anti-HB-EGF or 100 &#x003bc;g/mL anti-GM-CSF neutralising monoclonal antibody (mAb) (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or isotypic control immunoglobulins. After growing in cultures for the appropriate times in different conditions, the cells were either lysed for total RNA extraction or used for functional assays. In some experiments, the conditioned medium was replaced with fresh medium after 24 hours of stimulation and the cells were then maintained in culture for up to 48 hours. Cell-free supernatants (SN) were stored at -80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunochemistry on tissues and cells</title><p>Histological samples were obtained by hepatic lobectomy to excise metastatic nodules derived from colon cancer. After surgical excision, samples were put in buffered formalin, treated in an automated processor and embedded in paraffin. Four micrometre-thick slices were cut from paraffin blocks onto adhesive-coated slides. Cytological samples were obtained by allowing cells to grow on the slides. Antibodies (Ab) used included the following: CD163 (clone 10D6, 1/200; Novocastra, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK), CXCL10 and CXCR4 (both rabbit polyclonal, 1/500 and 1/100, respectively; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), CXCL12 (clone 7918, 1/100), GM-CSF (clone 3209, 1/100), HER1 (1/100), HER4 (1/100), and HB-EGF (clone 125923, 1/200) (all purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems). Antigen retrieval was performed for all antibodies in a hot bath for 30 minutes at pH 6 (except for GM-CSF retrieval, which was performed at pH 8). For GM-CSF and HB-EGF no H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>blocking was performed. As controls, sequential sections or cytological slides were incubated with the Ab diluent and indifferent isotypic Ab.

In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, we show the representative histology from a 76-year-old patient who had such a procedure. Serial preparations of a subglissonian metastatic nodule were stained by immunohistochemistry for CD68, CXCL10, CD163, CXCR4, CXCL12, GM-CSF, HER1, HER4 and HB-EGF. Macrophages, which were found to infiltrate the metastatic region often creating a bridge between perivascular zones and metastases, were intensely positive for CD68, CXCR4, GM-CSF and HB-EGF; some were CXCL12-positive. Of interest, macrophages stained positive for both CXCL10 (M1-marker) and CD163 (M2-marker). Though we could not perform a double staining, the distribution of the expression of CXCL10 and CD163 suggests a cellular co-expression rather than distinct populations of cells. In any case, the macrophages were not definitely polarized towards a typical M2 pattern but instead showed a mixed M1/M2 pattern. The cancer cells were positive for CXCR4, CXCL12, HER1, HER4 (a chemotactic receptor that responds to HB-EGF), and GM-CSF. The cellular distribution of ligands and receptors suggested specific interplays that were tested in the following experiments performed on the HeLa and DLD-1 cancer cell lines, which express the same pattern of molecules, and on human mononuclear phagocytes <italic>ex vivo</italic>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Ligand/receptor repertoire in metastatic colon cancer and infiltrating macrophages</bold>.

Infiltrating CD68-positive macrophages (&#x02606;), which bridge perivascular zones to gland-like structures built up by metastatic colon cancer cells, stained positive for CXCL10 (a M1-marker) and CD163 (a M2-marker) indicating a mixed M1/M2 environment. They preferentially stained positive for CXCR4, GM-CSF, HB-EGF and CXCL12. Cancer cells were positive for HER1, HER4, CXCR4 and CXCL12, and to a lesser extent, GM-CSF.

When we stimulated mononuclear phagocytes with 200 ng/mL CXCL12, the membrane density of HB-EGF was initially reduced (at 20 minutes), but was increased after 24 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). After a 2-hour stimulation, constitutive HB-EGF mRNA transcripts were up-regulated in mononuclear phagocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), and this effect increased up to 24 hours (data not shown). This induction of HB-EGF was cell type specific. For instance, we show in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> that neutrophils did not express HB-EGF transcripts either basally or after CXCL12 stimulation. A 1-hour stimulation of mononuclear phagocytes with CXCL12 determined an increase in the HB-EGF concentration in the culture supernatants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Thus, CXCL12-dependent signals induce mononuclear phagocytes to release HB-EGF from the cell membrane, increase the amounts of HB-EGF transcripts at 2 hours, and upregulate HB-EGF synthesis, leading to an increase in membrane-bound HB-EGF at 24 hours.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>CXCL12 modifies HB-EGF expression in mononuclear phagocytes</bold>.

Mononuclear phagocytes (and neutrophils as negative control) in the upper chamber were stimulated with 200 ng/mL CXCL12 and HER1-positive HeLa, DLD-1, Balb/c 3T3 cells and HUVEC were used in the lower chamber as target cells. After 20 minutes, the cells were analysed to assess HER1 phosphorylation at tyrosine 1068. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> depicts several negative controls. The direct stimulation of HeLa, DLD-1, Balb/c 3T3 cells and HUVEC with CXCL12 did not induce HER1 phosphorylation. Unstimulated mononuclear phagocytes did not induce HER1 phosphorylation in the target cells. Neutrophils, which do not express HB-EGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], were treated with CXCL12 and this treatment did not lead to phosphorylation of HER1 at tyrosine 1068 in the target cells. In contrast, as depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, treatment of mononuclear phagocytes with CXCL12 led to the strong phosphorylation of Y1068 in all of the target cells. Pre-treatment with 100 &#x003bc;g/mL of neutralising anti-HB-EGF, but not its corresponding controls, inhibited the transactivation of HER1. Finally, supernatants from CXCL12-stimulated neutrophils, which did not produce HB-EGF, were not effective (SN1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B, C</xref>). Mononuclear phagocytes-derived supernatants (SN2, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) contained factors that led to HER1 phosphorylation in, and proliferation of, HeLa and DLD-1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B, C</xref>) as well as HUVEC and Balb/c 3T3 cell proliferation (SN2, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Blockade of HB-EGF with the neutralising Ab abolished the phosphorylation and the proliferation of the cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). However, this effect did not occur when using indifferent isotypic immunoglobulins. Thus, CXCL12 induced the release of functional HB-EGF from mononuclear phagocytes, transactivation of HER1 and proliferation of cancer cells (HeLa and DLD-1), fibroblasts (Balb/c 3T3 cells) and endothelial cells (HUVEC). This occurred both in transwell co-cultures and after adding conditioned medium (from cultures of mononuclear phagocytes stimulated with CXCL12) to the target cells. Moreover, the metastatic colon cancer cells stained positive for HER4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), through which HB-EGF exerts powerful chemotactic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, HB-EGF can induce cancer cell chemotaxis and proliferation as well as microenvironment-targeted angiogenic signals. Finally, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> shows that HB-EGF conferred upon HeLa and DLD-1 cells both proliferative and anti-apoptotic signals; these latter signals clearly emerged under starvation conditions, as indicated by the statistically significant reduction in mono/oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>CXCL12-dependent transactivation of HER1 in transwell experiments</bold>.

On the other hand, we have previous evidence showing that GM-CSF is a strong inducer of HB-EGF expression in mononuclear phagocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. If HB-EGF released by mononuclear phagocytes can trigger the production of GM-CSF in cancer cells, a possible GM-CSF/HB-EGF paracrine loop may exist that is initially activated by CXCL12. Thus, we tested (i) HeLa and DLD-1 cancer cells for the production of GM-CSF upon HB-EGF stimulation and (ii) mononuclear phagocytes for the production of HB-EGF upon GM-CSF stimulation. This choice was based on the known differential receptor expression in mononuclear phagocytes, as opposed to cancer cells, which are usually negative for the GM-CSF receptor. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> depicts the experiments suggesting that a paracrine loop exists between M&#x000f8; and HeLa or DLD-1 cancer cells. When these cancer cells were stimulated with 200 ng/mL CXCL12 and/or 25 ng/mL HB-EGF, they produced and released GM-CSF (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). When mononuclear phagocytes were stimulated with CXCL12 and/or 25 ng/mL GM-CSF, they produced and released HB-EGF (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B, C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). HB-EGF mRNA transcripts and membrane protein levels were increased after 2 hours (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>) and after 24 hours of stimulation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). These results were reproduced by the addition of conditioned medium from mononuclear phagocytes to cancer cells and <italic>vice versa </italic>(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Inhibitory anti-HB-EGF and anti-GM-CSF Abs significantly reduced the production of GM-CSF by cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>) and HB-EGF by mononuclear phagocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>), respectively. Thus, a paracrine loop may exist between mononuclear phagocytes and HeLa or DLD-1 cancer cells, as exemplified in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>. CXCL12 seems to act as an additive or synergistic agent in this positive feedback loop. The expression of these molecules as found in patient biopsy samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) is in line with and corroborates our findings <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Blockade of GM-CSF in cancer cells</title><p>To further test the GM-CSF/HB-EGF loop between cancer cells and macrophages, we established a siRNA sequence targeted against GM-CSF. This siRNA efficiently blocked GM-CSF induction and release in HeLa and DLD-1 cells in response to both HB-EGF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>) and conditioned medium from mononuclear phagocytes (data not shown). Similarly, inhibitory anti-HB-EGF Abs significantly reduced the production of GM-CSF by cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Therefore, HB-EGF genuinely and specifically induced GM-CSF expression in these cells. The supernatant from silenced cancer cells lost the ability to upregulate HB-EGF in mononuclear phagocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>) and inhibitory anti-GM-CSF Abs blocked the induction of HB-EGF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>), showing that the upregulation was specifically due to GM-CSF. Finally, mononuclear phagocytes treated with supernatants from GM-CSF-silenced cancer cells lost the ability to induce GM-CSF in non-silenced cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>). Thus, GM-CSF silencing data complement the ligand-blocking experiments obtained with inhibitory Abs, and strengthen our experimental evidence supporting the existence of an activated GM-CSF/HB-EGF loop between cancer cells and mononuclear phagocytes. When available, HB-EGF specifically stimulates cancer cells to produce GM-CSF, and the reciprocal availability of the two factors activates a positive feedback loop between them (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Knockdown of GM-CSF protein levels after siRNA application in cancer cells</bold>.

To our knowledge, there are no other studies showing that human mononuclear phagocytes release and up-regulate HB-EGF, while cancer cells release and upregulate GM-CSF, when stimulated with CXCL12.</p><p>By evaluating histological samples from human colon cancer metastases in the liver, we observed that numerous HB-EGF/CXCR4-positive macrophages, which expressed both the M1 CXCL10 and the M2 CD163 markers, indicating a mixed M1/M2 microenvironment, infiltrated metastatic cancer cells. These in turn were positive for CXCR4, CXCL12, GM-CSF and HER1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We then validated the mutual interactions associated with this repertoire of molecules in standard and transwell experiments performed on human mononuclear phagocytes and HeLa and DLD-1 cancer cell lines, expressing the same molecules in the same cellular distribution as macrophages and cancer in biopsy samples.</p><p>CXCL12 and GM-CSF induced mononuclear phagocytes to synthetise and release HB-EGF. Northern blotting of RNA from kinetic experiments revealed that maximal expression of HB-EGF mRNA occurred between 2 and 24 hours after CXCL12- or GM-CSF-dependent induction, leading to an increase in membrane HB-EGF molecule density (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B, C</xref>). In transwell experiments, CXCL12-stimulated mononuclear phagocytes released HB-EGF that caused the phosphorylation of HER1 in HeLa and DLD-1 target cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Cell-free supernatants from CXCL12-treated mononuclear phagocytes induced HER1 phosphorylation followed by cellular proliferation in either HeLa or DLD-1 cells, an effect that was inhibited by anti-HB-EGF neutralising Abs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Stimulation with CXCL12, HB-EGF or both induced GM-CSF transcripts in HeLa and DLD-1 cells. At 24 hours, immunocytochemistry revealed clear-cut staining for GM-CSF in both cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Their conditioned medium contained GM-CSF that induced M&#x000f8; to produce HB-EGF (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Conversely, mononuclear phagocytes conditioned medium contained HB-EGF that induced cancer cells to produce GM-CSF (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). These effects were largely counteracted by the addition of specific neutralising Abs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) or by GM-CSF silencing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). In conclusion, CXCL12 induced HB-EGF in mononuclear phagocytes and GM-CSF in HeLa and DLD-1 cancer cells, activating or enhancing a GM-CSF/HB-EGF paracrine loop.</p><p>Thus, we have evidence for a specific pathway of activation in mononuclear phagocytes (CXCL12-stimulated M&#x000f8; release of HB-EGF) that may match the specific biological properties of some cancers (HeLa, DLD-1 and metastatic colon cancer). We have also documented a specific pathway of activation in cancer cells (CXCL12/HB-EGF-stimulated cancer cell release of GM-CSF) that may match the specific biological properties of mononuclear phagocytes. This interplay between mononuclear phagocytes and cancer cells may lead to an inflammatory environment that favours rather than inhibits tumour growth. Furthermore, both macrophages and cancer cells were activated upon CXCL12 stimulation in liver biopsies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), though we could not conclusively establish whether cancer cells produced their own CXCL12 or merely internalized CXCL12, produced by stromal cells. Other studies have demonstrated that CXCL12 transactivates HER2 in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], enhancing the expression of CXCR4 and favouring metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In our work, CXCL12 has been shown to transactivate HER1 and induce GM-CSF. The latter is a specific inducer of HB-EGF, which in turn binds to HER1. HB-EGF acts as a chemotactic, pro-growth and anti-apoptotic factor in cancer cells, and plays a role as angiogenic factor by inducing endothelial cells and fibroblasts to proliferate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). It also promotes angiogenesis by induction of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In general, HB-EGF is a powerful inducer of fibroblast activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that are involved in orchestrating inflammation and promoting tumour growth, angiogenesis and recruitment of macrophages and cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the CXCL12 receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7, should be thought of as a node that connects multiple loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], including the highly important EGF/HER loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], linking cancer (oncogenes) and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Based on our previous demonstration of the role of HER1 in the regulation of mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], as well as on some general models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], we speculate that the crosstalk between CXCL12/CXCR4 and HB-EGF/HERs may contribute to the balance between the HER1-dependent cellular responses of differentiation and self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Hypothesis</title><p>This study provides evidence that CXCL12 partecipates in the selective production of cytokines, leading to a GM-CSF/HB-EGF paracrine loop that may favour neoplastic growth. CXCL12 has chemotactic activity towards cancer and immune cells; in both cell types, it induces cytokines that retain pro-tumour activity and modulate the stromal component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], contributing to a tumour-permissive microenvironment. Therefore, CXCL12 signalling may provide a unifying basis for better understanding the complex relationships between cancer and inflammatory cells in terms of receptor crosstalk. For instance, the involvement of mixed M1/M2, GM-CSF-stimulated macrophages in a tumour-promoting loop challenges the view of tumour-permissive macrophages as polarized M2 mononuclear phagocytes and hints at contexts in which pro-inflammatory microenvironments may allow effective tumour-promoting activities through mediators such as GM-CSF and HB-EGF. These mediators, indeed, seem to play a role that favours both cancer and a shift towards a M1-polarized microenvironment. Eventually, such an understanding could contribute to the development of tools to interfere with recognised pathogenic signals [<xref ref-type="bibr"
