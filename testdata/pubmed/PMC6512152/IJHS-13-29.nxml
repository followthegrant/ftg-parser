The sensory integration theories assume that an impaired sensory reception would result in a delay in developmental milestones among children with developmental disorders. These sensory systems include proprioception from muscles and joints, balance and hearing from the vestibule-auditory system, visual stimuli from eyes, and tactile sensory stimuli from the skin and body awareness.</p><p>There are a limited number of studies published on the prevalence of infantile hemiplegia (IH) among Saudi population and globally. A most recent study on children suffering from stroke was published on 2006 by Salih <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported around 27.1/100,000 cases annually and most common was ischemic (76%) of stroke and the average age of onset at 6 months (median). Hemiplegia is a neurological condition affecting either side of the body and if it happens at an early age, its known as IH.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] IH is one of the common types of cerebral palsy and second in frequency to spastic diplegia born preterm. Infants with spastic hemiplegia show unilateral sensory deficit and motor dysfunction due to the lesion at the somatosensory cortex of the cerebral cortex. Children with IH commonly experience more functional difficulty in upper limb than in the lower limb. Affected children also experience an unprovoked seizure. Literature has shown the difference between left- and right-side hemiplegic children; left side hemiplegic children had better linguistic ability than the right-sided hemiplegic children. On the contrary left-sided hemiplegic children had more motor, attention, and perceptual problems than right-sided hemiplegic children.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] When compared for syntactical awareness left hemiplegic, children performed better than the right hemiplegic children. Impaired attention and motor skills are seen in children with IH. Researches have reported that left-sided IH exhibit more attention deficit right-sided IH.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The attention span is a mandatory requirement to gathered relevant and sufficient information for the environment. Left-sided hemiplegic children also exhibit motor deficit, but it is more apparent in right-sided hemiplegic children. Motor skills which include gross and fine motor skills and bilateral coordination are most affected in right-sided hemiplegic children.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Furthermore, clinicians have reported that sensory integration and some cognitive abilities are more affected among children with limited social participation and interaction with the peer group.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>A number of researches have shown a positive effect of sensory integration training on attention span among autism spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, and learning disabilities among children except for IH.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Therefore, the aim of this pilot study is to investigate the effect of sensory integration training on the attention span of children with left-sided IH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a quasi-experimental design with pre-test and post-test and a control group. Participants were male and female children recruited from the Rehabilitation Centre. The sample of 17 was randomly divided into a control group (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and experimental group (<italic>n</italic> = 9); the number of participants assigned to each group was calculated from the formula</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="IJHS-13-29-g001.jpg"/></p><p>Children included in this study were diagnosed with left-sided IH, being 10&#x02013;15 years old and visiting our Rehabilitation Centre for regular treatment. Children having other developmental disorders and significant health issues were excluded from the study. Parents of the children were contacted to attend a seminar on sensory integration and the importance of this study. Parents of the children provided written consent. The study commences in August 2017 after the ethical approval from the ethical and research regulator authority at the Hospital Rehabilitation Centre with an approval letter no. (MU-EC-102-21-07-2017). Children were randomly assigned to the experimental and control group. The experimental group received 10 sessions of sensory integration training, and routine treatment and the control group received only routine treatment. The treatment protocol for sensory integration was obtained from research on downs syndrome[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Physiotherapists trained in sensory integration were blinded about the assignment of children in either group. The second physiotherapist who assessed the subjects on the Arabic version of the computerized Stroop color-word test[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] was also blinded about the allotment of subjects.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sensory integration training included the following items</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJHS-13-29-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The Arabic version of the computerized Stroop color-word test consists of two phases. The first phase is the preparation phase, and the children are asked to choose any color of the circle on the monitor (red, blue, green, and yellow) and press the corresponding key on the keyboard. The scores obtained at this stage were not included in the final results. The actual test consists of 96 colorful words, divided into 48 correctly matched colorful words and 48 incorrectly matched colorful words. The sequence of each word was randomized and appeared on the computer screen for 2000 ms with 800 ms interval between two words. The children were asked to identify the word color regardless of their meanings.</p><p>All the responses were calculated by the computer such as correct answer, incorrect answer, reaction time for correctly matched colorful words as well as incorrectly matched colorful words, no answer. The Arabic version of the Stroop test has been tested on equivalence with the English version of the test. The test seems to have acceptable test-retest reliability and validity.</p><p>The experimental group participated in 10 treatment sessions (thrice a week, each session lasted for about 60 min) which included the conservative treatment and sensory integration while as the control only received the conservative treatment. The Arabic version of the Stroop color-word test was used to assess attention span in the 1<sup>st</sup> week and at the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> week. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used to analyze the data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of control and experimental groups was 12.8 and 13.7 years, respectively.</p><p>Mean and standard deviation of all the responses from the children is tabulated in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Pre- and post-test results of attention span</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJHS-13-29-g003"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample characteristics</title><p>Data obtained from the subjects are distributed normally as tested on the normality test.

The results of this pilot study have shown to affect the attention span significantly among children with left-sided IH. Similar results were also seen in children with autism[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Downs syndrome.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Children with left-sided IH have shown to significant involvement of attention span as compared to right-sided IH.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Learning is a complex process of analyzing information gained from interaction with the surroundings. Attention is the fundamental step in the learning process which is involved in gathering and processing all the required information of a situation to create a meaningful experience and memory. Such meaningful experiences and memories are essential elements to progress from one developmental milestone to the next.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Attention span and movement of children are interdependent. Attention span in growing children helps children understand and interact with the environment. Attention span plays an important role in interpreting the continues visual and auditory system inputs along with other sensory systems among children for learning.</p><p>Sensory integration is the process by which a child learns about the environment through various sensory organs. The sensory integration training program involves different activities which reinforces improvement in attention span and selective sensory perception, eye and hand coordination, body image, and awareness. The sensory integration training involves facilitation of sensory reception by providing an enriched environmental stimulus, thereby compensating a deficit sensory stimulus and encouraging the natural developmental gains among children.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>SIT improved attention span in our study significantly among children with left-sided IH. Other studies on SIT on children have also shown to improve higher mental function as well as motor function. A study by Karim and Mohammed,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] who explored the effect of SIT on motor skills of children with autism, reported statistically significant results. A study by Kuo[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] also reported an improvement in balance. A study investigated the effect of swimming exercise program[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] on the motor development levels in teenagers with intellectual disability. They reported statistically significant improvement in variables such as fine motor integration, fine motor precision, and bilateral coordination. A number of researches investigating the effect of sensory integration on fine motor skills, intellectual difficulty, and learning disability have shown to cause a significant effect.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has also been effectively used to reduce upper limb disability in children with IH. Few types of research investigating the effect of 4-week CIMT in children with IH showed statistically significant results in terms of functional use of the upper limb.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>Sensory integration training allows a child to compare various shape, size, and color of objects through tactile sensation and reduced external distractions. During SIT help children reduce defensiveness, change in arousal and alertness. The data obtained from the study supports the use of SIT even after the child has passed a certain age. As our sample included age group of children from 10 to 15 years old, attention span plays an important role in education and defines a successful carrier in the future. Therefore, special schools must identify children with attention span deficit especially in children with left-sided IH, autism, and downs&#x02019; syndrome and provide them with necessary training.</p><p>Sensory integration training in our study has shown to cause a positive effect on attention span among children with left-sided hemiplegia. Sensory integration training has shown to cause changes in the neural circuitry of the brain or neural plasticity leading to enhanced attention as well as motor skills.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations of this study; they are:</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Small sample size which largely affects its generalizability.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Amount of motor deficit on the affected side varies considerably among children.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Socioeconomic status of each child was not considered.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intelligence coefficient intelligence quotient was not determined before the study.</p></list-item></list>
