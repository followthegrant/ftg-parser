Because of wide regular QRS tachycardia observed on electrocardiography (ECG) and severe metabolic acidosis observed on an arterial blood gas (ABG) test, the patient was referred to our hospital. At that moment, ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred and the patient was intubated following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed for approximately 20 min.</p><p id="p0030">During the patient's initial assessment in our hospital, his Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score was 7 (E2V1M4); blood pressure was 90/50&#x0202f;mmHg; heart rate was 130/min and body temperature was 36.7&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C. The pupils were isocoric, and both eyes showed positive light reflexes. The physical examination findings were normal. On ECG upon arrival at our hospital, left bundle branch block was observed and QRS width was 240 ms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>a). Global hypokinesia was observed on bedside echocardiography, and ejection fraction (EF) was estimated to be 30%. The patient had severe metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap in ABG and serum lactate levels were elevated (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Moreover the urine toxicology test was positive for &#x00394;9-THC. Depending on patient's history, clinical and laboratory findings, the patient diagnosed with substance abuse-related cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>ECG images at different time points [1a.

Cardiac flow was re-established with defibrillation and CPR for 2 min. Wide QRS tachycardia was observed on the ECG, and the patient was administered amiodarone by infusion at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/min after loading dose 300 mg. VF occurred every 5&#x02013;10 min over approximately 5 h. The presence of cardiac functions was checked with echocardiography (ECHO) and ECG was recorded after resuscitation. The patient was administered with sodium bicarbonate to treat severe metabolic acidosis and possibility of Na channel blockage (1 mEq/kg, IV bolus; 3 mEq/kg/h, IV infusion). Additionally we administered positive inotropes (noradrenalin: 2 mcg/kg/min, dopamine: 20 mcg/kg/min and dobutamine: 20 mcg/kg/min; IV infusions) and lidocaine (2 mg/min, IV infusion) to treat the patient's recurrent VF and hypotension. Because of the lipophilic nature of the SCs and toluene that were suspected to be associated with this unstable condition, the patient also underwent lipid rescue therapy (1.5 mL/kg, IV bolus, 0.25 mL/kg/min) throughout resuscitation.</p><p id="p0040">Coronary angiography was performed for excluding coronary thrombosis or vasospasm. The findings revealed no pathology in the coronary vessels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). VF re-developed at 5&#x02013;10 min intervals during the follow-up, and asystole developed at the 8th hour of the follow-up. Continuous CPR was then performed for 90 min, and a temporary transvenous pacemaker was inserted during resuscitation. The patient responded to this resuscitation, and no VF was observed at subsequent follow-ups. ECGs after resuscitation and pacemaker insertion are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>b. The patient's vital signs remained stable with treatment, and ABG test results were normal. The patient was defibrillated approximately 45 times because of recurrent VF over the course of approximately 10 h. The patient was extubated at the 10th hour of admission to the coronary intensive care unit when his GCS score improved to 15 and he became clinically stable. At history, the patient reported that he used both <italic>Skunk</italic> and toluene before loss of consciousness. A control ECG at the 24th hour of follow up revealed ST elevations in D1, D2, avL, V5 and V6 derivations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>c). However, because of the absence of any pathology in his previous coronary angiogram and the absence of typical chest pain, and the absence of any regional wall motion abnormality in ECHO; the ECG was monitored and no ST elevation was observed on the subsequent control ECG. No dysrhythmia occurred at the subsequent follow-up, and clinical, laboratory and ECG findings were normal. The patient was discharged in a healthy condition following psychiatric counselling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>d).<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Patient's coronary angiography image.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0015">Fig.&#x000a0;2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0045">SCs have been reported to be associated with a number of pathological conditions, including metabolic acidosis, renal failure and multiorgan dysfunction.

There is no specific treatment for cardiotoxicity developing following hydrocarbon exposure. Potential underlying causes, such as electrolyte or acid&#x02013;base anomalies and severe metabolic acidosis (particularly following exposure to toluene), must be treated. Lidocaine, which shows a beta-adrenergic antagonist effect, should be used as a pharmacological agent against recurrent VF.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p id="p0055">Due to the low levels of evidence concerning the effectiveness of antidotal therapy in the intoxication-associated cardiac arrest algorithm, antidotes are used in limited indications during CPR.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> We think that the main reason for this case improving without sequelae despite prolonged resuscitation was the correct and high-quality application of the standard ACLS protocol throughout 10-h CPR. Sodium bicarbonate and lipid emulsion therapies based on severe QRS prolongation findings at ECG in this case of exposure to cannabinoids and toluene, toxic agents capable of Na channel blockage and having lipophilic properties, may have contributed to successful reanimation. However, it is difficult to identify which treatment was more effective in saving the patient. This is because clinical improvement in response to treatment not appearing immediately after or in the early period of treatment represents an obstacle to determining which of concurrently applied therapeutic protocols is superior.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0060">This case report is the first report of cardiac arrest occurring as a result of <italic>Skunk</italic> and toluene inhalation, which was resolved without sequelae, following prolonged resuscitation. In addition, the present case report raises awareness regarding the importance of the quality of CPR performed during witnessed arrests, particularly those with reversible causes. In such cases, good neurological outcomes are obtained despite prolonged resuscitation.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Grant</title><p id="p0065">No.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Conflict of
