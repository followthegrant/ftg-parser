It has been pointed out the importance of the ability of cells to accumulate within tumours and the association with therapeutic efficacy in clinical studies of adoptive T cell transfer. We have previously reported that alendronate liposomes (L-ALD) increase the efficacy of this therapy after localised or systemic injection of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells in mice, inoculated with ovarian, melanoma, pancreatic or experimental lung metastasis tumour models, respectively. This study aimed to examine the organ biodistribution and tumour uptake of human &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells in subcutaneous (SC), intraperitoneal (IP) or experimental metastatic lung tumours, established in NOD-SCID gamma (NSG) mice using the melanoma cell line A375P&#x003b2;6.luc. pre-injected with L-ALD. Overall, small variations in blood profiles and organ biodistribution of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells among the different tumour models were observed. Exceptionally, IP-tumour and experimental metastatic lung-tumour bearing mice pre-injected with L-ALD showed a significant decrease in liver accumulation, and highest uptake of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells in lungs and tumour-bearing lungs, respectively. Lower &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell count was found in the SC and IP tumours.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bisphosphonates</kwd><kwd>&#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells</kwd><kwd>liposomes</kwd><kwd>adoptive immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells have been shown to be effective as a cell based cancer immunotherapy <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.

Di Carlo <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that infiltration of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells was significantly higher in tumours from mice pre-treated with the N-BP, zoledronic acid (ZOL), than when injected with &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells alone <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Similarly, in a study by Santolaria <italic>et al.,</italic> immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of infiltrating &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells only within tumours of NSG mice that received both the N-BP, pamidronate and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In addition to the need for V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells to infiltrate the tumours, combining the treatment with N-BPs seems to be crucial to achieving positive therapeutic outcome in patients.</p><p>Due to the pharmacokinetic properties of N-BPs <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, their encapsulation in liposomes can increase levels of N-BPs in solid tumours <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Using an ovarian tumour model established by intraperitoneal (IP) inoculation, liposomal alendronate (L-ALD) has been shown to be more effective at slowing tumour growth than ALD when administered intravenously in combination with V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells that were injected into the peritoneal cavity of mice <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Additionally, we have recently reported that only the combinatory treatment of L-ALD and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells led to a significant reduction in tumour growth in the experimental metastatic lung melanoma model, after 3 successive intravenous injections <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p><p>Uptake of human &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells in mice has been mostly examined qualitatively in tumours and other organs such as lymph nodes and spleen by immunohistochemical analysis <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Quantitative assessments on whole body and tumour biodistribution of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells have been studied in syngeneic <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> or xenograft <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> tumour models injecting murine or human &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells, respectively. This work aims to quantitatively compare, and for the first time, the biodistribution profiles of human &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells in immune-compromised mice, implanted with human melanoma A375 P&#x003b2;6 tumours at three different locations: subcutaneous (SC), intraperitoneal (IP) or experimental metastatic lung tumours. Tumour-bearing mice were pre-injected with free form of ALD or L-ALD, followed by infusion of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells. We investigated whether the different immunogenicity and tumour microenvironment due to the site of tumour implantation will impact the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell biodistribution and localisation to tumours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>1,2-distearoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (ammonium salt) (DSPE-DTPA) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc (USA). 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (ammonium salt) (DSPE-PEG2000) were obtained from Lipoid (Germany).

Alendronic acid liposomes (L-ALD) were prepared by the thin film hydration (TFH) method as previously described <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. DSPC, cholesterol and DSPE-PEG2000 (55:40:5 molar volume) were added to a 25 ml round-bottom flask and 2 ml chloroform/ methanol (4:1 v/v) was added. A thin lipid film was formed upon removal of the solvent under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (Rotavapor&#x000ae; R-210, Buchi UK). The lipid film was flushed with nitrogen to remove any remaining traces of organic solvent. The film was then hydrated with 1 ml of 100 mM ALD in HEPES Buffered Saline (HBS; 20 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl), adjusted to pH 7.4. The liposome suspension was left for 1 h at 60 &#x000b0;C and was vortexed (Vortex genie 2, Scientific Industries Inc, USA) every 15 min <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. The resulting suspension was stored at 4&#x000b0;C. Liposome's size and polydispersity (PDI) were reduced with serial extrusion using the mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, USA) through polycarbonate membranes (Avanti Polar Lipids, USA) with pore sizes 0.8 &#x000b5;m (5x), 0.2 &#x000b5;m (5x), 0.1 &#x000b5;m (10x) and 0.08 &#x000b5;m (15x), at 60&#x000b0;C. Free ALD was separated from the liposomes by dialysis against HBS using a 10 kD dialysis bag. L-ALD were prepared at a final lipid concentration of 20 mM.</p></sec><sec><title>Physicochemical characterisation of liposomes</title><p>The hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index and zeta potential of the liposomes were measured using the NanoZS (Malvern Instrument, UK). Hydrodynamic size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential were measured in disposable square polystyrene cuvettes and disposable capillary cells, respectively (Malvern Instrument, UK). The sample (20 &#x000b5;l) was diluted to 1.5 ml with 10 mM sodium chloride. The measurements were carried out at room temperature. Three measurements were performed, and the mean and standard deviation were calculated for each sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of ALD</title><p>ALD concentrations, for determination of % EE, were determined with a copper sulphate-based UV detection method <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. A calibration curve containing 5 mM empty liposomes and between 0.1-1 mM of free ALD, referred to 'ALD spiked liposomes' samples, was prepared. L-ALD samples to be quantified (or standards) were both processed using the Folch method prior to quantification. This method disrupts the liposomes; allowing the encapsulated ALD to be released into the aqueous phase and separating any hydrophobic components (cholesterol, lipids etc.) from the hydrophilic drug. In brief, chloroform and methanol were added to a sample of liposomes at 8:4:3 (chloroform: methanol: liposomes) volume ratio. The sample was then vortexed (Vortex genie 2, Scientific Industries Inc, USA) and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 minutes (Centrifuge 5810 R, Eppendorf). Two layers were formed after centrifugation and the upper aqueous layer containing the ALD was removed and quantified. CuSO<sub>4</sub> reagent was prepared by dissolving 10 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> in deionised water. A 0.5 ml sample of the upper aqueous phase was to 0.5 ml of 10 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> reagent. After 10 minutes, the UV absorbance at 240 nm was measured with a UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Model: Lambda 35), using HBS as the reagent blank. Concentrations were calculated from the equation obtained from the 'ALD spiked liposomes' calibration curve. Encapsulation Efficiency (EE %) was calculated was calculated by comparing the ALD concentration of liposomes to the concentration before purification. The quantity of N-BP in each liposome sample was measured three times and expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and expansion of V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells</title><p>The &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells were isolated and expanded as previously described <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Blood samples of 20-30 ml were obtained from healthy volunteers in an ethically approved protocol (&#x0201c;Use of Donor Blood Samples for Pre-Clinical Development of Active and Passive Immunotherapy for Cancer&#x0201d;; Ref.09/H0804/92). The blood sample was added to 5 ml of citrate-dextrose solution to prevent clotting. The sample was then layered on top of 15 ml of Ficoll-Paque Plus and centrifuged at 1150 g for 25 min, with no acceleration or break, using a bench centrifuge (Centrifuge 5810 R, Eppendorf). The layer of cells between the Ficoll-Paque Plus and the plasma was then removed and the resulting PBMCs were washed twice with PBS and were then suspended in RPMI 1640 (containing 10% human AB serum, 1% Glutamax and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution) at a concentration of 3x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. In order to expand the V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells, the PBMCs were activated with 1 &#x000b5;g/ml ZOL and 100 U/ml IL-2. Additional medium and 100 U/ml IL-2 were added every 2-3 days for 15 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometry analysis of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells</title><p>On Day 1 and Day 15, 200 &#x000b5;l samples of the cell suspension were taken and 5 &#x000b5;l of either T Cell Receptor (TCR) Pan &#x003b3;/&#x003b4;-FITC antibody or IgG1 FITC Isotypic control antibody was added. The cells were incubated with the antibodies for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C before 1 ml PBS was added. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min in a bench centrifuge (Centrifuge 5810 R, Eppendorf). The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 500 &#x000b5;L of PBS. All flow cytometric data were acquired using a Beckman Coulter Cytometer FC 500 MPL and were analysed using CXP Analysis software (Beckmann Coulter). The lymphocyte cell population was gated and the number of cells in this gate that express the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; TCR were calculated as a percentage of the total lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Cancer cell line culture conditions</title><p>The cell line A375P&#x003b2;6 was created using the human melanoma cell line A375P (CRL-3224&#x02122;), which was infected with pBabe retroviruses encoding puromycin resistance and cDNA for human &#x003b2;6 integrin (A375P&#x003b2;6), as previously reported <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>.

Compositions are DSPC, cholesterol, DSPE-PEG2000 and DSPE-DTPA (54:40:5:1 molar volume). Liposomes were then radiolabelled with <sup>111</sup>In using protocols as described previously <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. In brief, the required volume of <sup>111</sup>In, containing 1 MBq per mouse for gamma counting studies, was added to 2 M ammonium acetate buffer (one-ninth of the reaction volume, pH 5.5). This was then added to the liposome sample (100 &#x003bc;l of 20 mM liposomes/mouse) to give a final ammonium acetate concentration of 0.2 M. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with vortexing every 10 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 0.1 M EDTA solution to the mixture (5 % v/v of the reaction mixture) to chelate free [<sup>111</sup>In]. Unbound [<sup>111</sup>In]EDTA was removed using NAP-5 desalting columns equilibrated with PBS with the liposomes collected in fractions 1-3 (~150 &#x003bc;l per injection dose).

These strips were then developed using a mobile phase of 50 mM EDTA in 0.1 M ammonium acetate. Strips were placed on a multi-purpose storage phosphor screen (Cyclone &#x000ae;, Packard, Japan) and kept in an autoradiography cassette (Kodak Biomax Cassette &#x000ae;) for 10 min. Quantitative autoradiography counting was then carried out using a cyclone phosphor detector (Packard &#x000ae;, Australia). The labelling stability was tested by incubation of the radio-conjugates in the presence or absence of foetal bovine serum (FBS). Samples were diluted in 50% FBS or PBS [1:2 (v/v)], and incubated for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The percentage of [<sup>111</sup>In] (immobile spot) still conjugated to the liposomes was evaluated by TLC, using the same protocol as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Radiolabelling of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells</title><p>The &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells were isolated and expanded as previously described <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Supplementary Information</xref>). The percentage of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells obtained from healthy volunteers were variable from batch to batch, ranging from 0.8 to 28.3 % of the total lymphocytes, assessed by flow cytometry. After isolation and expansion in culture, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell population generally increased to above 80 % on Day 15. The number of cells to be used for radiolabelling were calculated based on the percentage of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells harvested.

Many studies have proved that such mild labelling method and condition does not compromise the cell viability. For instance, Jin <italic>et al</italic>. has assessed the impact of labelling with [<sup>111</sup>In]tropolone on cell viability <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. They labelled 5 million primary isolated bone-marrow-derived stem cells with up to 18 MBq [<sup>111</sup>In]tropolone.

In another study, Tai <italic>et al</italic>. dual-labelled one million pancreatic islet cells with 20 MBq [<sup>111</sup>In]tropolone and implanted the cells in kidney in mice for SPECT imaging <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>.

Considering the relative low radioactivity doses used in this study (i.e. 1 MBq/5 million cells and 10-15 MBq/5 million cells for gamma counting and SPECT imaging, respectively) and the studied time points (up to 24 h), it can be anticipated that most of the cells were still viable before injecting to animals.</p><p>From SPECT/CT images, it can be observed that majority of the radiolabelled &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells accumulated in the lungs within 30 min post injection, before being redistributed mainly to the liver and spleen over time <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>)</bold>. In contrast, [<sup>111</sup>In]tropolone alone showed prolonged blood circulation and was measured 40.6&#x000b1;2.9 % ID in blood at 4 h post-injection by &#x003b3;-counting and remained 16.3&#x000b1;1.8 at 24 h (data not shown.

In the former study, the uptake of the indigenous mouse [<sup>111</sup>In]&#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells in the 4T1 tumours was quantified as 2.6 %ID/g tumour, 48 h post injection. In the latter study, tumour uptake of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]human &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells was measured as 1.2 %ID/g tumour 48 h post injection. In our study, IP tumours had a similar accumulation of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells to SC tumours of ~1.5 %ID/g at 24 h post injection. The differences in tumour type (breast tumours vs melanoma tumours), species origin of the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cells or the examination time after T cell transfer render direct comparison difficult.</p><p>This work represents a pioneering comparative study of the accumulation of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells among tumours in different locations. We hypothesise that there is a link between level of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell localisation to tumours and efficacy of the therapy. In many cases, tumours have metastasised and reside in different locations. By studying uptake of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell in tumours in different locations, we hope to gain further insight into what types of tumours may benefit from this treatment. Several papers have undertaken immunohistochemical staining of human &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells in tumour-bearing mice in order to look at the effect of pre-injection of N-BPs on tumour accumulation of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells. It has been shown that infiltration of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells was significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05) higher in adrenal gland tumours of mice receiving both &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells and free ZOL than when injected with &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells alone <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. A similar result was found in another study, which used &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells in combination with the N-BP pamidronate (PAM). Immunohistochemical analysis of SC prostate tumours showed the presence of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells only when mice had been treated with both PAM and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Our results showed no significant difference in the tumour levels of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells between mice pre-treated with free or liposomal ALD, compared to PBS. This is in contrast with a recent study by Man <italic>et al</italic>. which found using gamma counting, a technique used in our study, pre-injection of liposomal alendronate 4 day previously enhanced tumour uptake of [<sup>89</sup>Zr]&#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells from 1.2 % to 2.1 %ID/g tumour 48 h post the adoptive cell transfer in a xenograft breast cancer model <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. In addition to difference in the tumour model between the two studies, in our study, the pre-injection of L-ALD and gamma counting were performed at 24 h prior and 24 h post the adoptive cell transfer, respectively. It is possible that it was too early to see the increase of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells in tumours using this dosing schedule.</p><p>One may suggest that since no difference in tumour levels of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells was achieved following L-ALD injection, this therapy may not be effective in sensitising &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells. This is not the case as in our recently published work we have shown that human IFN-&#x003b3; was only detected in the serum of the mice pre-treated with L-ALD prior to &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells therapy <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. Additionally, only the combinatory treatment of L-ALD and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells led to a significant reduction in tumour growth in the experimental metastatic lung melanoma model.

Surprisingly but also interestingly, the IP model exhibited the highest &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell uptake (37.1 &#x000b1; 20.1 % ID/g lung) among the three models. Our findings indicate that physiological changes caused by the presence of metastatic lung, SC or IP tumours lead to a change in the biodistribution of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells. The pulmonary immune status in patients or preclinical animal models with peritoneal cancer was rarely discussed. Further studies are required to confirm the recruitment of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell by assessing the immune cell populations within the tumours and tumour draining lymph nodes by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry.</p><p>L-ALD concentrations in lung tumour tissues were calculated by extrapolations from gamma counting studies. Assuming that ALD does not undergo immature release from the liposomes, it is expected to reach concentrations in the range of 4.2-16.15 nmol ALD/g in lung tissues. These concentrations, despite being 10-fold lower than needed for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, seem to be sufficient to result in tumour growth delay <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. This suggests that L-ALD is not homogenously distributed throughout the lung tissues, probably with higher concentrations in tumour tissues. In the IP model, variable uptake of L-ALD in tumour nodules was observed (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D</bold>) which is expected as tumour cells spread throughout the peritoneal cavity. Since the tumour uptake is a result of passive targeting based on the enhanced permeability and retention effect, vascularisation status will be varied between small and large tumour nodules within the peritoneum thus affecting the uptake efficiency. In fact, the first liposome-based nanomedicine, Doxil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, was approved to treat advanced ovarian cancer <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> which is often well vascularised <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>.

Despite the comparable L-ALD uptake in all tumour types, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells showed highest uptake in the melanoma tumour-bearing lung model and lungs of mice implanted in the IP cavity. Lower &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell count was found in the SC and IP tumours. Dosimetry studies focusing on correlating &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells levels in <italic>in vivo</italic> tumours and therapeutic responses may help us understand better the impressively fast-growing field of T-cell based immunotherapy. Conclusions from the current study can only apply to the melanoma tumour model in NSG mice so further tests need to be carried out on other types of mice tumours.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>KAJ acknowledges funding from Worldwide Cancer Research (12-1054) and BBSRC (BB/J008656/1).

Subcutaneous (SC), intraperitoneal (IP) and pseudo-metastatic lung tumours were established by inoculating NSG mice by i.v. injection of 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> A375P&#x003b2;6 cells, i.p. injection of 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> A375P&#x003b2;6 cells and s.c. injection of 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> A375P&#x003b2;6 cells, respectively. A375P&#x003b2;6 cells were transduced with firefly luciferase and tumour growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (IVIS Lumina series III <italic>In Vivo</italic> Imaging system, Perkin-Elmer). Tumours were established for three weeks prior to use. Mice were i.v. injected with [<sup>111</sup>In]L-ALD at a dose of 2 &#x003bc;mol lipid/mouse. Blood samples (5 &#x000b5;l) were taken at 5, 10 and 30 min and 1, 4 and 24 h. Urine and faeces were collected. After 24 h the mice were sacrificed, and liposome uptake was quantified by gamma counting.
