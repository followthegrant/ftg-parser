The objective of the current study is to describe the earthquake exposure, the impact on family&#x02019;s daily life and the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their association in Nepalese mothers 20 months following the earthquakes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In a clinical trial in Bhaktapur, Nepal, 558 mothers responded to an inventory on earthquake exposure and the Impact of Event Scale &#x02013; Revised (IES-R) 20 months after the earthquakes. In multiple linear regression models, we estimated the associations between the earthquake exposure and the impact on the families&#x02019; life and the IES-R score.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Over 60% reported that the earthquakes had a great deal of negative impact on their family&#x02019;s life. In 4.7%, close family members died, and in 10.5%, family members were injured. 24% had IES-R scores indicating PTSD symptoms within clinical concern or a possible diagnosis. Lower levels of education were associated with higher scores on the total IES-R. Mothers who report that the earthquakes had a great deal of negative impact had higher total IES-R scores [9.8, 95% CI (5.9, 13.6)] compared to mothers that reported no such negative impact. Mothers with family members who were killed had higher IES-R scores [3.6, 95% CI (1.6, 5.5)] than those with no family members who died. Mothers assisting in rescue efforts had lower IES-R scores [2.8, 95% CI (0.8, 4.8)] than those not assisting.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our study demonstrates high levels of exposure to traumatic events, large negative impact on the everyday life of the families, and a high level of PTSD symptoms. There was a consistent and graded association between the exposure variables and PTSD symptoms. The large impact of the earthquakes on these Nepalese mothers underscore the importance of awareness of mental disorders following major natural catastrophes for marginalized families.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>earthquake</kwd><kwd>disaster</kwd><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>Nepal</kwd><kwd>mothers</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Thrasher Research Fund<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100005627</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>On April 25, 2015 Nepal was hit by a 7.9 Richter scale earthquake followed by another 7.4 Richter scale earthquake a few weeks later. The earthquakes resulted in about 9000 deaths, at least 23,000 injured and up to 3.5 million people displaced due to the destructions (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Basnyat et al., 2015</xref>). Recovery and rebuilding efforts after the earthquakes have been slow (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adhikari et al., 2016</xref>). Reconstructions of damaged health facilities were still lacking 1 year after the earthquakes, and mental health services were particularly affected (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sherchan et al., 2017</xref>). A blockade at the southern border shortly after the earthquakes, led to a 6-month long fuel and essential commodities crisis. This situation hampered the recovery process even further, and may have had additional negative effects on the situation of the population (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lamichhane, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Budhathoki and Gelband, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). Four months after the earthquakes, population-based studies indicate a high rate of mental disorders among direct survivors in earthquake affected districts (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Luitel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2017</xref>). The long-term psychological consequences in the Nepalese population, however, are not yet known.</p><p>Major earthquakes are known to give rise to long-term consequences on mental health. The prevalence of mental disorders reported in studies after natural disaster are, however, within a wide range (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Onder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cairo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cenat and Derivois, 2014</xref>). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis on the mental health consequences after earthquakes, presents incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from 1.2 to 82.6%, with a combined incidence of 23.7% (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2016</xref>), while a more recent meta-analysis identified prevalences ranging from 4.1 to 67.07% (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). The impact of natural disasters on mental health depend upon several pre-, peri- and post-disaster factors (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, the extent of PTSD symptoms following earthquakes are demonstrated to be higher in people from low socioeconomic situations (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kilic and Ulusoy, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Priebe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cenat and Derivois, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Carmassi et al., 2018</xref>), in individuals with low social support (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cairo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Feder et al., 2013</xref>) and in females (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kilic and Ulusoy, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Priebe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dell&#x02019;Osso et al., 2011c</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Carmassi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cenat and Derivois, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the risk of PTSD has repeatedly been shown to be associated with the severity of exposure to the disaster, with direct survivors at most risk (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dell&#x02019;Osso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Piccardi et al., 2017</xref>). And finally, there are several post-earthquake characteristics such as loss of houses and property conflicts that may augment the impact of the crisis for the ones involved (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). For those who participate in rescue efforts after earthquakes, however, the prevalence of PTSD symptoms have been shown to be lower than for other survivors (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Galea et al., 2005</xref>). The extent to which the earthquake experience leads to long-term consequences on mental health depend upon these co-occurring factors, and thus early awareness of these risk-factors is important in order to plan early treatment intervention in the aftermaths of natural disasters (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Roncone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Piccardi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Low to middle income countries are the hardest-hit regions for natural disasters, with women and children most affected (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nour, 2011</xref>). Thus, mothers who experienced the major earthquakes in Nepal, may be an especially vulnerable group for long-term mental health problems (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Khanal et al., 2015</xref>). The consequences of PTSD symptoms in this group may also have more severe consequences since maternal distress may influence the development and growth of children both during pregnancy, and after birth through impaired nurturing care (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Surkan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Britto et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, in low to middle income countries characterized by poor social security systems, large catastrophes such as major earthquakes pose a particular burden on families that are already marginalized due to low socio-economic status. Thus, understanding the impact of natural disasters on women with caregiving responsibilities in vulnerable populations in low-income countries is of importance. In an ongoing clinical trial in Bhaktapur, Nepal we have collected information on the level of exposures to the earthquakes, the impact of the exposure on the family&#x02019;s daily life across multiple life domains and maternal PTSD symptoms in 558 mothers. The objective of the current study is to describe the exposures and the impact from the earthquakes on important areas of life indirectly affected by the earthquakes, the level of PTSD symptoms as measured by the Impact of Event Scale &#x02013; Revised (IES-R) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Weiss, 2007</xref>) in 558 Nepalese mothers, and their association, 20 months following the earthquakes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study Setting and Participants</title><p>Data for this study was collected within a randomized controlled trial on infant nutrition, growth and neurodevelopment (CT <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT02272842) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Strand et al., 2017</xref>). The study targeted 600 mildly stunted infants with close follow up for 12 months and was carried out in Bhaktapur municipality and the adjoining districts close to the capital city Kathmandu. Nepal is among the world&#x02019;s least developed countries, and one-third of the population lives below the poverty line (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha et al., 2014</xref>). Bhaktapur is a relatively homogenous community where most of the families are traditionally engaged in agriculture. Ownership of land and houses are key socio-economic (SES) indicators.</p><p>In April 2015, when the study was in its early beginning, Nepal was struck by large earthquakes and the district of Bhaktapur, one of the most densely populated districts of Nepal, was severely affected. After a few weeks, the study team managed to continue the enrollment for the trial and reached the total sample size of 600 enrolled children in January 2017. At the time of the earthquakes, some of the mothers had already given birth to the study children (from newborns up to 11 months), some of the mothers were pregnant, while others were not yet pregnant with the child who would be enrolled in the main clinical trial.</p><p>In order to gain more knowledge on the influence of large natural catastrophes on the daily life of vulnerable families in low income countries, we decided to include additional questionnaires on the earthquake exposure experienced by the families in the clinical trial, as well as a widely used assessment tool for PTSD symptoms. The current study thus benefits from being in the framework of a high-quality clinical trial with attrition kept to a minimum through close follow up to the families from the study team.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Approximately 20 months after the earthquakes, from December 2016 through January 2017, a group of trained field workers visited the homes of the enrolled children and asked the mothers questions on earthquake exposures, the perceived impact of the earthquakes on the daily life, and PTSD symptoms. These questionnaires were an addition to the original study protocol, and the visits were performed independent of the original study procedures. From the baseline of the original study we had information on demographics and the socio-economic situation of the families, such as parental level of education, occupation and standard of living.</p><p>For the original study, after providing thorough information on the study procedures to the parents (usually the mother), we obtained a written informed parental consent or parental thumbprint from those who were illiterate, for the children to participate in the study. For this addition to the study, we gathered a new informed written consent from the mothers. The study was approved by the Nepal Health Research Council and the Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK S&#x000f8;r-&#x000d8;st), amendments were performed and approved particularly for this addition to the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Instruments</title><p>The earthquake exposure questionnaire was constructed for the current study to assess exposures during the earthquakes, negative experiences from the earthquakes and the impact of the earthquakes on the families&#x02019; daily life. The included traumatic exposures during the earthquakes were seeing someone who were injured or killed, whether they assisted in rescue efforts and if family members (relatives or close family) were trapped, injured, or killed. We also asked the mothers to rate the perceived threat to their own life, or the life of someone close to them during the earthquake (&#x0201c;not at all,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Some/Just a little,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;a great deal (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nordanger et al., 2013</xref>). The impact of the earthquakes on the family&#x02019;s daily life was assessed by a five-point scale: &#x0201c;Not at all&#x0201d; (0); &#x0201c;a little&#x0201d; (1); &#x0201c;some&#x0201d; (2); &#x0201c;quite a lot&#x0201d; (3); and &#x0201c;to a large extent&#x0201d; (4) on economy, food security, employment and the state of their houses. The questionnaire was based on previous traumatic exposure questionnaires (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Rubin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Nordanger et al., 2013</xref>) and on discussions in the team of investigators and field workers with experience from the study field. The instrument was piloted among 29 women in the study population.</p><p>The IES-R is a measure of symptomatic status of PTSD after specific traumatic events (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Weiss, 2007</xref>). The questionnaire measures the degree of distress related to a traumatic event in the past 7 days on a Likert scale, and provide a total score (range 0&#x02013;88), and three subscale scores; Avoidance (range 0&#x02013;32), Intrusion (range 0&#x02013;32), and Hyperarousal (range 0&#x02013;24). The scale is originally from the United States, but is widely used worldwide (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Galea et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2016</xref>). We translated the IES-R from English to Nepalese according to recommendations (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Weiss, 2007</xref>). First, we made a translation from English to Nepalese in our team of experienced psychologists and medical doctors. The back-translation was conducted by a person fluent in English and Nepalese and not otherwise affiliated with the study. The original version and the back-translated version was compared by our team of psychologists and medical doctors, and the final questionnaire was piloted on a sample of 12 women in the study population. The standardized alpha for the total scale was 0.87, and ranged from 0.50 to 0.80 in the subscales, indicating acceptable internal consistency. The IES-R scale is not a diagnostic tool of PTSD and consequently there are no recommended cut offs for a PTSD diagnosis. In the current study we use a score of 24 or more to indicate that PTSD should be a clinical concern (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Asukai et al., 2002</xref>), and above 33 to indicate a probable PTSD diagnosis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Creamer et al., 2003</xref>). These cut offs have shown good psychometric properties when validated against a diagnostic interview.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>All forms were manually checked for inconsistencies and double entered. Data are presented as numbers (N)/percentage (%) and as mean/standard deviation (SD). We used multiple linear regression models to examine the association between the independent variables (exposure and negative impact variables) and the dependent variable (total IES score), adjusting for potential predefined confounders (mother&#x02019;s age and level of education). The exposure variables were: family members died, injured or trapped; believed own life/life of someone close was in danger; assisting in rescue efforts, while the negative impact variables were: negative impact on your family&#x02019;s life; on food security; on employment; on economy; and state of the house. In linear regression models, we also examined the associations between SES factors (maternal/paternal level of education; number of rooms in the home; ownership of house; ownership of land; and living in joint vs. nuclear families) and the total IES-R score. In these models we adjusted for mothers age. For the models including maternal and paternal level of education, we used the contrast command in STATA to estimate the trend.</p><p>In the linear regression models, the total IES-R score was used on a continuous scale, while the main exposure variables were included on a three-point scale: &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d;(0 from the original questionnaire), &#x0201c;some (merged 1 and 2 from the original questionnaire) and &#x0201c;a great deal&#x0201d; (merged 3 and 4 from the original questionnaire), or in the educational categories: Illiterate or up to 5th grade (0&#x02013;5 years), Secondary complete (5&#x02013;10 years), Intermediate complete (10&#x02013;12 years), and Bachelor or above (12 years and more). The effect estimates are expressed as regression coefficients. In the figures, we display estimated marginal means of the total IES-R scores by the level of education in the mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and by the level of exposure in selected exposure variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We also conducted a correlation analysis between the exposure, negative impact and SES factor variables and the total IES-R score by Spearman&#x02019;s rho.

The mothers report a high negative impact from the earthquakes, both in terms of exposure to traumatic events and the negative impact on their everyday life. Twenty months following the earthquakes, our results demonstrate high levels of PTSD symptoms. In general, our results suggest that the more traumatic experiences and negative impact on the family&#x02019;s life the mothers described, the more symptoms of PTSD in the mothers. In addition, we find that lower levels of education in both mothers and their husbands were associated with increased symptoms of PTSD, while participating in rescue efforts after the earthquakes were associated with less PTSD symptoms.</p><sec><title>Earthquake Exposure</title><p>The mothers in the present study report of severe, widespread and long-lasting impact of the earthquakes, including loss of family members, damaged and collapsed houses forcing the family to move several times, and negative impact on their practical family life in areas such as economy, food security and employment. Our findings are consistent with other studies describing the long-lasting impacts of earthquakes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Onder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kolbe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Dell&#x02019;Osso et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Feder et al., 2013</xref>). After the earthquakes in Nepal, there are reports that the rebuilding has been slowed by a range of challenges related to technical, social, and political processes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adhikari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Meding et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, more than 80% of the mothers report that their family were involved in conflicts due to property arrangements following the earthquakes. Difficulties in living arrangements has previously been presented as an important post-earthquake predictor for poor mental health (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). These devastating and long-lasting consequences also mirror the low-income countries vulnerability in both the scope of the destruction and in the long rebuilding period that is seen after the disaster.</p></sec><sec><title>Prevalence of Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms</title><p>Approximately 24% of the mothers report PTSD symptoms that give rise to clinical concern or indicating a probable diagnosis. This is about the same level as the estimated incidence of PTSD after earthquakes in a recent meta-analysis, however, somewhat lower than the mean level among woman (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2016</xref>). A direct comparison is difficult, due to methodological differences across studies including time since the earthquake, the severity and exposure to the earthquakes and the measures of PTSD (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Galea et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the IES-R does not have established cut offs, and the prevalence may vary accordingly. While other studies have used lower cut offs (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2016</xref>) which would have increased the prevalence of PTSD in the current study, we have used 24 and 33 to indicate clinical symptoms and a probable diagnosis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Asukai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Creamer et al., 2003</xref>). This uncertainty of prevalence is accentuated by the fact that the IES-R has not been formally validated in the current population. However, with these reservations in mind, our findings do suggest high levels of PTSD symptoms. These high levels give rise to concern given the scarcity of mental health facilities in the Nepalese health care system. In spite of a mental health policy developed in 1997, the mental health services in Nepal are still limited to certain areas and groups, and were therefore unable to meet the demands after the earthquakes (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Luitel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sherchan et al., 2017</xref>). Following the earthquakes, there has been a strategic response to improve the mental health services and increase the preparedness for future disasters (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sherchan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chase et al., 2018</xref>). As demonstrated in a study of 513 Nepalese adults 4 months following the earthquakes, more measures of mental health in addition to PTSD could have yielded a broader picture of the mental health burden in the current study (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Luitel et al., 2016</xref>). In the previous study, few met the threshold for PTSD, however, more than 30% suffered from depression and anxiety and 20% from alcohol use disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Earthquake Exposure and the Negative Impact and Symptoms of Post-traumatic Stress</title><p>Exposure variables including the death of close family and the belief that own, or the life of someone close was in danger, were consistently related to higher PTSD symptoms in the present study. This is in line with the significant predictors of PTSD after earthquakes in recent meta-analyses (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). The pattern is also similar to the results from a study of young mothers after the Sichuan earthquake in China, where both the mother&#x02019;s earthquake exposure and SES was associated with the level of PTSD symptoms (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, studies from the L&#x02019;Aquila earthquake demonstrate that the degree of negative exposure in terms of the proximity to the earthquake epicenter (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dell&#x02019;Osso et al., 2013</xref>) and loss of family or friends (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dell&#x02019;Osso et al., 2011b</xref>) were related to PTSD. The present study expanded beyond the direct exposure of the earthquake to the impact of the earthquakes on other important areas of life indirectly affected by the earthquakes, such as employment and food security. Our results thus demonstrate that there is a consistent and graded association between the impact of these more distal life areas and PTSD symptoms 20 months following the earthquakes, suggesting that the impact on major life arenas increase post-traumatic stress symptoms in these women.</p><p>The previously mentioned review discuss how SES is inconsistently associated with PTSD after natural disasters (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Galea et al., 2005</xref>). This mirrors the results in the present study where illiteracy and educational level up to grade 5 in the mothers and their husband is related to more PTSD symptoms, while none of the other SES indicators such as family ownership and size of house yielded such associations. Thus, in the current setting, literacy may be more specifically related to long-term adaption following major disasters. Our findings are similar to the results from studies from other earthquake hit areas, such as in Turkey, Haiti and Italy, where low level of education is one important predictor for mental health disorders following the disaster (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kilic and Ulusoy, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Priebe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cenat and Derivois, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Participation in relief efforts is associated with less PTSD symptoms than in the mothers that did not participate in such efforts. This may be unexpected, since the 419 women who assisted in rescue work most likely had an increased exposure to traumatic events, and there are studies that indicate that personnel working in emergency situations are at higher risk of PTSD (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Carmassi et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies have found lower prevalence of PTSD symptoms among those participating in rescue efforts after earthquakes, however, (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Galea et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast to the mothers in the present study who were also direct survivors, participants in rescue efforts are often not directly exposed to the disasters. It may be that contributing to the community gives sense of meaning and perceived control which is associated with good mental health (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ikizer et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings could also be a result of a selection process, favoring those who are less likely to develop PTSD symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>IES-R is a questionnaire assessing symptomatic status of PTSD and has not been validated for a Nepalese setting. A validated diagnostic interview would have given additional diagnostic information that would have strengthened the study. Mono-informant bias may have affected the results given the reliance on self- report. Many of the women are illiterate and the questions were asked through trained field workers. Due to the sensitive nature of the questions, some may have underreported the symptoms. Another limitation is the lack of information on previous mental health and/or clinical PTSD diagnosis, and comorbid mental health issues as some conditions like bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders or alcohol and substance use disorders can favor the onset of PTSD or influence its course.</p><p>Although the IES-R specifically states that the questions are related to the earthquakes of 2015, we cannot be sure whether the PTSD-symptoms of these women are related to lifetime stressful events that occurred before and/or after the earthquakes, rather than the earthquakes themselves. Finally, a limitation to the current study is that our sample may not be representative of the total population as we targeted families with mildly stunted children which may have resulted in a sample of relative low SES families. Furthermore, the study was restricted to mothers as informants. Fathers and other members of the extended family are also important caregivers and it is a limitation that we have not included them in the present study. Future studies should include multiple time-points to measure the change in symptoms reported over time, and include other measures of mental health in addition to PTSD. The effect of the PTSD symptoms on the children of the exposed mothers as described by others (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2017</xref>), was beyond the scope of the present study and should be further explored in this population in order to understand the impact of major natural disasters on the development of children.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for Future Research and Clinical Practice</title><p>The results from the current study underscore the importance of awareness of mental health issues in the aftermath of natural catastrophes in marginalized groups in low-income countries. Given the limited access to mental health services in Nepal it is a valid concern whether those in need received relevant care. Large scale programs targeting mental health consequences on a community level could be indicative after natural disasters in low-income countries.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>IK, SR, MU, RC, MS, LS, TS, and MH conceived the research.
