Their polymer network has recognition sites complementary to a substrate in terms of size, shape and chemical functionality.

In the present article the effect of crosslinkers, functional monomers and conditions for template extraction on the long-term stability and reusability of IPs was systematically investigated. Adsorption capacity, selectivity, morphology and thermal decomposition of eleven different <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine methyl ester imprinted polymers were studied to reveal performance loss over 100 adsorption&#x02013;regeneration cycles. Furthermore, crosslinker and functional monomer specific reversible and irreversible decomposition of imprinted polymers as a result of adsorbent regeneration were investigated through adsorption studies, electron microscopy, N<sub>2</sub> adsorption and thermogravimetric analysis.

The preparation and application of molecularly imprinted polymers (IPs) have been thoroughly reviewed.<sup><xref rid="cit1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Briefly, a specific compound is present during the polymerisation process which acts as a molecular template. Building blocks are allowed to self-assemble with the template, and the functional groups are held in position <italic>via</italic> crosslinking polymerisation. Subsequent removal of the template by solvent extraction or chemical cleavage leaves binding sites that are complementary to the template in terms of both topography and chemical functionality. Numerous applications of IPs have been reported such as catalysis, drug delivery and purification, sensors, water treatment, membranes and proteomics.<sup><xref rid="cit2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Apart from the single-use analytical devices most of the chemical and engineering applications require regeneration of the IPs to improve efficiency, economics and sustainability.</p><p>The reusability of imprinted materials has a crucial role in developing applications that are reliable, economic and sustainable. Nonetheless, reusability studies in the literature are limited to about 10 adsorption cycles and there is no assessment of long-term stability and reusability of imprinted polymers. Although the monomer-template assemblies and their stability have been thoroughly studied both theoretically and experimentally,<sup><xref rid="cit8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> the sole investigation into the stability of IPs was reported by Svenson <italic>et al.</italic> for a theophylline imprinted methacrylate based copolymer.<sup><xref rid="cit13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> It was demonstrated that exposure to acids (1&#x02013;10 M HCl), bases (5&#x02013;25% NH<sub>3</sub>), autoclave treatment and elevated temperatures up to 150 &#x000b0;C over a period of 24 hours does not result in loss of affinity for the template. Despite its importance, the literature on template extraction itself is also scarce and intended to reduce template leaching.<sup><xref rid="cit14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>
</p><p>The present study systematically investigates the effect of crosslinkers, functional monomers and conditions for template extraction on the long-term stability and reusability of imprinted polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Twenty-four-hour adsorption&#x02013;regeneration cycles for more than a 100 times were carried out in duplicate, using eleven different <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine methyl ester (ME) imprinted polymers having different compositions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> shows the structures of the template, functional monomers and crosslinkers employed in the present study.

ME was chosen as the template because of its multifaceted chemical nature having hydrogen donor and acceptor sites as well as an aromatic moiety capable of &#x003c0;&#x02013;&#x003c0; interactions. Having such a versatile template in hand allowed investigating a wide range of functional monomers such as carboxylic acid, urea, amide, amine and boronic acid derivatives.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>The four main factors affecting the stability and reusability of molecularly imprinted polymers.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="c6py01853j-f1"/></fig><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>The <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine methyl ester (ME) and benzyl ester (BE) were used as template and dummy template in this study.

The crosslinker is important in controlling the morphology of the polymer matrix, serves to stabilize the imprinted binding sites, and imparts mechanical stability to the polymer matrix in order to retain its molecular recognition capability.

Selectivity factors were calculated as the ratio of adsorbed ME and BE, and the results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>. In order to investigate whether the selectivity deteriorates in accordance with the loss of adsorption capacity, the boronic acid (IP10) and the carboxylic acid (IP11) based polymers were tested for BE adsorption at every 10<sup>th</sup> adsorption&#x02013;regeneration cycle. Proving successful incorporation of the template into the polymer matrix during the polymerisation process, selectivity factors of 6.5 and 5.2 were achieved during the first cycle for IP10 and IP11, respectively.

Consequently, both selectivity and adsorption capacity of boronic and carboxylic acid based imprinted polymers can be maintained up to at least 100 adsorption&#x02013;regeneration cycles with an acidic wash at the end of the regeneration process. From a morphological point <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> shows that the surface area for IP10 and IP11 remains virtually constant over time when the extraction method E6 is used (see Table S2 in the ESI<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">&#x02020;</xref> for the absolute values). However, without the acidic wash the surface area significantly increases: up to 11% by the 50<sup>th</sup> cycle and 18% by the 100<sup>th</sup> cycle. The increase in surface area is unexpected and it is probably due to the molecular level degradation of the polymer without collapse of the polymer network.</p><p>Leaching of the template and unreacted monomers from IPs is an often observed phenomenon, which is considered as one of the main drawbacks of the technology.<sup><xref rid="cit15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> They should be exhaustively removed in order to ensure reliable results, in particular if IPs are used for quantitative analytical applications or product purification. Such clean-up is time-consuming and requires substantial amounts of the extraction solvent. Eppler <italic>et al.</italic> developed an extraction device specifically designed to facilitate the rapid and efficient clean-up of imprinted polymer matrices offering significant advantages: the ability to use solvent mixtures, temperature-controlled extraction conditions, improved kinetics, and continuous control of the extraction process.<sup><xref rid="cit16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, both reversible and irreversible degradation of the polymer network can occur under basic and acidic conditions.</p><p>EDMA and BMA crosslinked polymers can readily undergo transesterification and hydrolysis under acidic and basic conditions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10A and B</xref>). Both reactions result in losing their crosslinking function, which eventually leads to reduced stability and reusability as demonstrated <italic>via</italic> TGA, SEM, adsorption and selectivity studies. Although the resulting esters or sodium salts remain part of the polymer network, the ethylene glycol and methylenediamine leach out from the adsorbents and could have an adverse effect during the application of the imprinted polymer. Boronic acids can also undergo irreversible esterification in methanol in the presence of acids and the reaction can proceed further resulting in the elimination of trimethyl borate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10C</xref>), which again leaches out from the adsorbent. On the other hand, esterification of boronic acids is not catalysed by bases and consequently only sodium salt formation can occur, which is reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10D</xref>). Such behaviour of boronic acids is the reason why extraction methods E3 and E5 result in performance loss of IP10 with regard to adsorption capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8C and E</xref>) and selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>), whilst the method E6 incorporating a final acidic wash facilitates maintaining the adsorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8F</xref>) and selectivity performance over 100 cycles. Both the esterification and sodium salt formation of carboxylic acids are reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10E</xref>), and thus the performance of IP3 and IP11 can be maintained by methods E4 and E6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8D and F</xref>). The decomposition mechanism presented here is in line with the observations on the surface area change over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Partial degradation of the crosslinked structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10A and B</xref>) results in the collapse of the polymer network decreasing the surface area, while the surface areas for the DVB-based polymer remain virtually constant.</p><fig id="fig10" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><title>Degradation schemes of EDMA (A), BMA (B) crosslinked polymers, and esterification of acid based functional monomers <italic>via</italic> hydrolysis in methanol (C&#x02013;E).

The effect of crosslinkers, functional monomers and conditions for template extraction was systematically investigated to reveal the long-term stability and reusability of imprinted polymers. Adsorption&#x02013;regeneration cycles were carried out 100 times for <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine methyl ester imprinted polymers. Irrespective of the degree of crosslinking, divinylbenzene-based polymers demonstrated the most robust behaviour compared to methacrylate- and acrylamide-based polymers. These polymers can be reused at least 100 times without loss of affinity towards the template molecule under acidic and basic conditions, and an elevated temperature (65 &#x000b0;C). In contrast, the performance of methacrylate- and acrylamide-based polymers deteriorates over time under both acidic and basic extraction conditions. It has been demonstrated that besides the well-known template and monomer leaching, polymer degradation products can also result in contamination of samples during the application of the adsorbents. Performance loss of imprinted polymers having carboxylic acid functional moieties can be recovered by an aqueous acidic wash at the end of the regeneration cycle. However, methacrylate- and acrylamide-based polymers irreversibly degrade under both acidic and basic conditions, which results in decreased degree of crosslinking. Imprinted polymers having a boronic acid functionality should not be regenerated under acidic conditions in alcohol as it results in their irreversible degradation and elimination of trialkyl borates. Further challenges to be resolved include the regeneration of macromolecularly imprinted polymers.<sup><xref rid="cit26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>
