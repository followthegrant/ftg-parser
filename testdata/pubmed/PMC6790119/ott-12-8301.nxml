The aim of this study was to investigate whether <italic>AKAP12</italic> mRNA has an anti-cancer function by regulating onco-miRNA expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2002"><title>Methods</title><p>miRNAs targeting <italic>AKAP12</italic> were predicted by bioinformatics analysis and further confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assays and RT-qPCR. The altered expression of microRNA was validated in early-stage CRC tumor tissues by miRseq. Cell proliferation was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell invasion and migration were detected by transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. In vivo experiments were conducted to confirm the in vitro findings.</p></sec><sec id="S2003"><title>Results</title><p>Among all miRNAs, reversed correlation between <italic>AKAP12</italic> expression and miRNA-183-5p expression was most significant. Luciferase assays revealed that <italic>AKAP12</italic> directly targeted miR-183-5p. The miRseq data showed that miR-183 was also dysregulated at the early stage of tumor development and upregulated in late sub-stage II CRC patients (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Mechanistic analysis both in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that anti-miR-183-5p depressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in CRC cells while miR-183-5p overexpression resulted in opposite effects.</p></sec><sec id="S2004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings suggested that oncomiR-183-5p promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. <italic>AKAP12</italic> miRNA-binding elements (MREs) suppressed miRNA-183-5p activities. Any change in expression of <italic>AKAP12</italic> thus affected miRNA-183-5p. This may be another anti-tumor mechanism in addition to protein-mediation that regulates tumor suppressor genes.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>cell invasion</kwd><kwd><italic>AKAP12</italic> endogenous transcripts</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer cells</kwd><kwd>oncomiR-183-5p</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><ref-count count="31"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is responsible for nearly 10% of cancer cases worldwide in 2012 (of 746,000 cases in men and 614,000 cases in women, 10.0% and 9.2%, respectively, were CRC).<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The development of CRC is dependent on the progression from an adenomatous polyp to carcinoma.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Tumor suppressor genes, also known as anti-oncogenes, are genes that are related to the occurrence and development of cancer. With features such as limiting cell proliferation and controlling cellular growth, in several model systems, restoring the expression of tumor suppressor genes inhibits some features of the tumor phenotype.<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, it is important to study anti-oncogene mechanisms and develop novel gene therapies for restoring the expression of tumor suppressor genes in tumor cells.</p><p>A kinase anchor protein 12 (AKAP12), also known as Gravin<italic>/</italic>AKAP250, is a kinase anchoring protein designated as a tumor suppressor gene in CRC. It belongs to the family of kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which represent a series of functionally related molecules that have an interaction with type I or type II regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) holoenzyme. Their primary function is to maintain the signaling transduction scaffold.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Our previous studies found that loss of <italic>AKAP12</italic> mRNA expression was detected in CRC tissues, and overexpression of <italic>AKAP12</italic> in the LoVo cell line suppressed cell growth and inhibited colony formation.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This suggests that <italic>AKAP12</italic> may represent a novel potential therapeutic target for CRC tumor treatment. Despite the remarkable progress in cancer therapy in the past decades, most agents being investigated are small molecules, which are designed to target specific AKAP complexes to correct pathological signaling defects.<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Reactivating its related suppressor pathway may be another therapeutic option to prevent uncontrolled cell growth in cancer.</p><p>In recent years, studies have shown that RNAs that act as competitive endogenous regulatory factors play an important role in gene regulation. Pseudogene transcripts, long-stranded non-stranded non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and even mRNA can regulate target mRNA expression through miRNAs.<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Studies have highlighted the important role played by miRNAs in the evolution of the tumor microenvironment. Most mature miRNAs are differentially expressed across cancer types; microRNA-183 is expressed at high levels in malignant tissues from liver, brain, colon and pancreas, whereas its expression is decreased in osteosarcoma.<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> OncomiRNA exhibits its activity via inhibition of mRNAs for tumor suppressor genes, for instance, oncomiR-183 activates the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway by directly inhibiting the tumor suppressors Dkk-3 and SMAD4 in prostate cancer.<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The classical mechanisms of miRNA-mediated downregulation are to regulate the target mRNA sequence directly or indirectly before translation is triggered or after translation initiation. miRNA can dynamically and transiently regulate the homeostasis of gene networks through feedback or feedforward loops.<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In light of this, we propose that <italic>AKAP12</italic>, in particular its miRNA response elements (MREs), might interact with miRNAs to perform cancer suppression.</p><p>Here we demonstrated a potential role of <italic>AKAP12</italic> mRNA, which may be independent of its encoded function, in CRC cells. Its endogenous transcripts with a miRNA binding site physiologically changed the expression of oncomiRNA-183-5p. Upregulated <italic>AKAP12</italic> in CRC cells resulted in the silencing of miR-183-5p, which suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>CRC Cell Lines And Culture Conditions</title><p>All human CRC cell lines (SW480, SW620, HCT116, SW1116, SW620 and DLD-1 LoVo) were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).

However, a number of significant hurdles remain in restoring the expression of macromolecular proteins to a normal physiological level, so identifying its related pathogenic pathway and its upstream and downstream regulators should also be considered.

Here, we found that miR-183-5p acted as an oncomiRNA in CRC cell lines and its overexpression or repression affected CRC cell (SW480 or SW620) proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. In addition, TCGA data showed that high miR-183 expression was associated with a subset of high risk CRC stage II patients. The expression of miR-183 was upregulated in late sub-stage II CRC patients. All these findings suggested that miR-183-5p might be an initiating factor in the developmental process of colon cancer. In particular, <italic>AKAP12</italic> has binding sites for this oncomiR-183-5p and regulated its expression by functioning as a miRNA sponge. Upregulated <italic>AKAP12</italic> in CRC cells resulted in the silencing of miR-183-5p, which inhibited subcutaneous tumorigenesis in nude mice. Following the reduction of <italic>AKAP12</italic> mRNA, oncomiR-183-5p was upregulated and its overexpression directly led to CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Co-expression network analysis based on Spearman correlation revealed when miR-183 expression was disordered, and multiple genes or miRNAs were coordinated during CRC tumorigenesis.</p><p>Interestingly, although miR-183-5p targeted the <italic>AKAP12</italic> gene, it did not primarily regulate the degradation of <italic>AKAP12</italic> mRNA and had no effect on protein transcriptional repression; i.e., miR-183-5p did not affect the synthesis and expression of the classical AKAP-PKA complex, which may indicate that the major mechanism by which miRNA-mediated gene regulation affected target gene expression did not apply in this case.</p><p>According to our findings, in addition to its primary function in maintaining the signaling transduction scaffold, 3&#x002b9;-UTR sites of <italic>AKAP12</italic> mRNA had miRNA-binding elements (MREs) to miR-183-5p, and overexpression of <italic>AKAP12</italic> mRNA resulted in a significant decrease in miR-183-5p. This suggested that there was a noncanonical interaction, by which miR-183-5p was captured the specific endogenous mRNAs as miRNA sponges, just like pseudogenes and long non-coding RNAs, to modulate oncogenic properties. Once miR-183-5p is adsorbed by the MREs of <italic>AKPA12</italic>, the expression level will decrease and further affect other co-expression networks for the purposes of cancer suppression.</p><p>Although several miRNA-targeted therapeutics, such as miRNA mimics and molecules targeted at miRNAs (antimiRs), have shown promise in preclinical development oligonucleotides from degradation, the toxicity of materials still remain problems for utilization in vivo.<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Additionally, new genome engineering technology using CRISPR/Cas9 may be an alternative strategy to inhibit oncomiRNAs, but much work is still required.<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Since Poliseno L. introduce a coding-independent function of <italic>PTEN</italic> and its pseudogene <italic>PTENP1</italic> mRNAs regulate biologically active by competing for microRNA binding, this provides a new way to restore <italic>PTEN</italic> expression/activity.<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Our finding indicates that the 3&#x02032;-UTR of <italic>AKAP12</italic> can interact with its related pathways in tumor suppression, and this may be another available therapeutic option to correct disease.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We highlighted the anti-tumor effects of <italic>AKAP12</italic> that may also be caused by mRNA-regulated onco-miRNA183-5p, in addition to changes in the protein itself.
