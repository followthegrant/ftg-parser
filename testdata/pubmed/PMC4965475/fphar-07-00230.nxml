However, physico-mechanical properties and endothelialization rate of PHBV/PCL grafts are poor. We suggested that incorporation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into PHBV/PCL grafts may improve their physico-mechanical properties and enhance endothelialization. Here we compared morphology, physico-mechanical properties, and <italic>in vivo</italic> performance of electrospun small-diameter vascular grafts prepared from PHBV/PCL with and without VEGF. Structure of the graft surface and physico-mechanical properties were examined by scanning electron microscopy and universal testing machine, respectively. Grafts were implanted into rat abdominal aorta for 1, 3, and 6 months with the further histological, immunohistochemical, and immunofluorescence examination. PHBV/PCL grafts with and without VEGF were highly porous and consisted mostly of nanoscale and microscale fibers, respectively. Mean pore diameter and mean pore area were significantly lower in PHBV/PCL/VEGF compared to PHBV/PCL grafts (1.47 &#x003bc;m and 10.05 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>; 2.63 &#x003bc;m and 47.13 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Durability, elasticity, and stiffness of PHBV/PCL grafts with VEGF were more similar to internal mammary artery compared to those without, particularly 6 months postimplantation. Both qualitative examination and quantitative image analysis showed that three-fourths of PHBV/PCL grafts with VEGF were patent and had many CD31-, CD34-, and vWF-positive cells at their inner surface. However, all PHBV/PCL grafts without VEGF were occluded and had no or a few CD31-positive cells at the inner surface. Therefore, VEGF enhanced endothelialization and improved graft patency at all the time points in a rat abdominal aorta replacement model. In conclusion, PHBV/PCL grafts with VEGF have better biocompatibility and physico-mechanical properties compared to those without. Incorporation of VEGF improves graft patency and accelerates formation of endothelial cell monolayer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)</kwd><kwd>poly(&#x003b5;-caprolactone)</kwd><kwd>vascular endothelial growth factor</kwd><kwd>vascular graft</kwd><kwd>morphology</kwd><kwd>physico-mechanical properties</kwd><kwd>endothelialization</kwd><kwd>patency</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Russian Science Foundation</funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">14-25-00050</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="21"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Reconstructive surgery is a conventional treatment of coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease, and autologous saphenous vein (SV), internal mammary and radial artery grafts are commonly used (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Taggart, 2013</xref>). However, a significant proportion of the patients do not have suitable veins or arteries that could be used (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Desai et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, tissue engineering of vascular grafts is a promising approach for the replacement of small-diameter (&#x0003c;6 mm) blood vessels (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Desai et al., 2011</xref>). Small-diameter vascular grafts can be prepared from biodegradable polymers and may become a scaffold for the formation of a blood vessel <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Antonova et al., 2015a</xref>). The combination of natural and synthetic polymers was suggested as improving the properties and resorption rate of the scaffold (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Antonova et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>It was demonstrated that poly(&#x003b5;-caprolactone) (PCL) may be successfully used for the preparation of the vascular grafts (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">de Valence et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Kuwabara et al., 2012</xref>). Electrospun PCL grafts implanted into rat abdominal aorta possessed structural integrity, patency, and promoted formation of extracellular matrix 6 months postimplantation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Pektok et al., 2008</xref>). Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) is a natural polymer synthesized by bacteria as storage compound under growth limiting conditions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Quillaguam&#x000e1;n et al., 2010</xref>). One of its monomers, 3-hydroxybutanoic acid, is a natural metabolite produced in the human body (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Quillaguam&#x000e1;n et al., 2010</xref>). This ensures a high biocompatibility of PHBV (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Quillaguam&#x000e1;n et al., 2010</xref>). According to the previously published data, PHBV/PCL combination improves biocompatibility of electrospun small-diameter vascular grafts (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Del Gaudio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Antonova et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key player in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and therefore it is widely used for the stimulation of graft endothelialization (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Maes et al., 2002</xref>). VEGF induces migration, proliferation, and survival of endothelial cells, enhances nitric oxide production, and improves vascular permeability (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>). We previously demonstrated that VEGF incorporated into electrospun polymer scaffolds retains its biological activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Sevostyanova et al., 2015</xref>). Here we compared morphology, physico-mechanical properties, patency and endothelialization rate of PHBV/PCL small-diameter vascular grafts with and without VEGF after the implantation into rat abdominal aorta.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Graft Preparation</title><p>Small-diameter vascular grafts were prepared by electrospinning (Nanon-01A, MECC) from PHBV/PCL (1:2, Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich)/chloroform solution using the following parameters: 20 kV voltage, 0.3 mL/h feed rate, 2 mm rotating drum diameter, and 22G needle. VEGF (Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich) was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to 10 &#x003bc;g/mL concentration and then added to PHBV/PCL/chloroform solution (1:20) with the final concentration of 500 ng/mL. For the preparation of electrospun PHBV/PCL/VEGF grafts, we used the following parameters: 23 kV voltage, 0.3 mL/h feed rate, 2 mm rotating drum diameter, and 27G needle.</p></sec><sec><title>Morphological Assessment</title><p>PHBV/PCL and PHBV/PCL/VEGF graft samples 0.5 mm &#x000d7; 0.5 mm (<italic>n</italic> = 5 per group) were examined using scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-3400N, Hitachi) with Au-Pd sputter coating (Quorum Technologies) of 30 nm thickness. Fiber diameter, pore area, and porosity were measured using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Mean fiber diameter and mean pore area were calculated after at least 100 measurements per each sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of Physico-Mechanical Properties</title><p>Assessment of durability and elastic deformation properties was performed using universal testing machine (Zwick/Roell). Testing was performed with 1 cm working segment length, 0.01 N preload, and 10 mm/min crosshead speed. Durability, elasticity, and stiffness were evaluated by yield stress, relative elongation, and elastic modulus, respectively. We assessed six vascular grafts per group. Synthetic vascular graft made of expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE, Vascutek), human SV and internal mammary artery (IMA) (<italic>n</italic> = 6 per each) were used as the controls. SV and IMA were collected from patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and all the participants provided written informed consent after receiving a full explanation of the study.

Rats were obtained from the core facility of Research Institute for Complex Issues of Cardiovascular Diseases. The animals were allocated in polypropylene cages (five animals per cage) lined with wood chips and had access to water and food (rat chow) <italic>ad libitum.</italic> Throughout the whole time of experiment, standard conditions of temperature (24 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C), relative humidity (55 &#x000b1; 10%), and 12 h light/dark cycles were carefully maintained, and the health status of all rats was monitored daily.</p><p>After ethylene oxide sterilization, 2 mm diameter and 10 mm length PHBV/PCL and PHBV/PCL/VEGF (<italic>n</italic> = 12 per group) grafts were implanted into rat abdominal aorta after the induction of anesthesia with 3% isoflurane. During the surgery, all animals received inhalation anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane. Briefly, a midline laparotomy was performed. After the isolation of the abdominal cavity with a sterile cloth, intestinal loops were moved to the right and wrapped in a wet warm cloth. The posterior peritoneal leaflet was opened along the mesenteric root, and the aorta was mobilized from the level of renal arteries to bifurcation. Then, aorta was temporarily occluded with two microvascular bulldog clamps distally from the renal arteries and proximally from the bifurcation. The aorta and vena cava inferior were occluded in parallel. Both proximal and distal anastomoses were performed using Prolene 8-0. Graft was washed between the performances of these anastomoses. After the implantation, the anterior abdominal wall was closed layer-by-layer with a blanket suture (4-0 or 2-0 Vicryl). All procedures were performed using strict aseptic technique. In each group, one-third (<italic>n</italic> = 4) of rats was sacrificed 1, 3, and 6 months postimplantation.</p><p>After the explantation, grafts with the adjacent aortic tissue were divided into two equal parts (5 mm length each). The first part was frozen at -140&#x000b0;C for the further immunofluorescence staining. The second part was fixed in 10% (w/v) neutral phosphate buffered formalin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) during 24 h at 4&#x000b0;C for the further histological and immunohistochemical examination.</p></sec><sec><title>Histological Examination</title><p>After the explantation, formalin-fixed grafts were dehydrated in isopropanol during 30 h at 4&#x000b0;C, rinsed in distilled water, embedded in paraffin (Electron Microscopy Sciences), sectioned (5 &#x003bc;m), and finally mounted on glass microscope slides. For a deparaffinization, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were heated in dry oven at 60&#x000b0;C for 20 min, immersed in the following reagents: 3x xylene (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 10 min, 100, 95, 70, 50, 30% ethanol for 1 min each, physiological saline for 2 min, PBS for 2 min, and finally rinsed with tap water. For hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining, the sections were immersed in Harris Hematoxylin solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 1 min, rinsed with tap water, immersed in 1% aqueous Eosin Y solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 1 min, rinsed with tap water, dehydrated in ascending ethanol solutions (50, 70, 80, 2x 95%, and 2x 100%), and then cleared 2x with xylene. Coverslips were mounted onto a labeled glass slide with Permount (Electron Microscopy Sciences). After the staining, sections were evaluated by light microscopy (Axio Imager A1, Carl Zeiss) in a blinded fashion; three sections per stain were assessed from each rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For immunohistochemical assessment, we used the kit of Novocastra (Thermo Scientific) and rabbit anti-CD31 antibodies (M338, Spring Bioscience) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Briefly, samples were boiled in citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval, treated by the inhibitor of endogenous peroxidase for 10 min, and washed twice in phosphate buffer (0.01 M, pH 7.4) for 5 min. For blocking non-specific background staining, we treated the samples with Protein Block for 10 min with the further 2x washing in phosphate buffer for 5 min. Then, we stained the samples with 50 &#x003bc;L of primary anti-CD31 (PECAM-1) antibodies, incubated them in a wet chamber for 1 h, and performed the staining with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (12-348, Millipore). After the washing in phosphate buffer, we treated samples with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate and diaminobenzidine with the further assessment of the reaction which was stopped by cold distilled water. Slides were then stained with Mayer&#x02019;s Hematoxylin and finally mounted. Native blood vessels and antibody diluent were used as a positive and negative control, respectively. After the staining, sections were evaluated by light microscopy (Axio Imager A1, Carl Zeiss) in a blinded fashion; three sections per stain were assessed from each rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy</title><p>Snap-frozen tissue blocks were cut on a cryostat (Microm HM 525, Thermo Scientific), and sections (8 &#x003bc;m) were mounted on the glass microscope slides.

Then, in the case of CD31 and CD34 staining, slides were treated with secondary sheep anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated (AP300R, Millipore) and goat anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated antibodies (12-507, Millipore) with the further incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Washing was performed thrice with PBS. Autofluorescence Eliminator Reagent (Millipore) was used to reduce autofluorescence. If needed, nuclei were stained with DAPI for 30 min at room temperature (10 &#x003bc;g/mL, Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich). Slides were mounted onto a labeled glass slide with ProLong (Life Technologies). Native rat aorta was used as a positive control for anti-CD31 and anti-vWF staining whereas rat embryo was used as a positive control for anti-CD34 staining. Bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was used instead of the primary antibodies as a negative control.

These features of the polymer scaffold make it similar to extracellular matrix (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Catto et al., 2014</xref>). Thin polymer fibers increase the area for the cell-scaffold interactions that, in turn, enhances cell adhesion and further cell metabolism (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Sill and von Recum, 2008</xref>). This is of crucial significance since cell infiltration of the graft wall improves integration of the scaffold with the host tissue (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Sachlos and Czernuszka, 2003</xref>).</p><p>PHBV/PCL grafts with VEGF had a highly porous structure and, in contrast to those without, consisted mostly of nanoscale fibers and small pores. This can be explained by the presence of water phase. Therefore, the composition of PHBV/PCL/VEGF grafts was more similar to extracellular matrix compared to unmodified grafts.</p><p>Physico-mechanical properties of PHBV/PCL grafts significantly differed from those of native blood vessels; however, incorporation of VEGF made them more similar to those of IMA, and it was particularly significant 6 months postimplantation. Thus, we suggest the absence of collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans as the cause of differences in physico-mechanical properties between the polymer grafts before implantation and IMA. This also corresponds to the literature (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">L&#x02019;Heureux et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Thrombosis and thromboembolism even despite anticoagulant therapy are the main problems associated with small-diameter synthetic vascular grafts (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Tatterton et al., 2012</xref>). The reasons for this are low blood flow in small-diameter vessels and low thromboresistance of poly(ethylene terephthalate) and ePTFE, which are currently used for the preparation of synthetic vascular grafts (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Tatterton et al., 2012</xref>). Formation of the endothelial monolayer at the inner surface of the vascular grafts may improve their long-term patency (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">L&#x02019;Heureux et al., 1998</xref>). Previously, we detected an endothelial cell monolayer in only one-fourth of PHBV/PCL vascular grafts 1 year postimplantation using rat abdominal aorta replacement model as here (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Antonova et al., 2015a</xref>). In this study, all unmodified grafts were occluded or had the signs of neointima formation. In contrast, three-fourths of PHBV/PCL/VEGF vascular grafts were completely patent and had an endothelial cell monolayer even 6 months postimplantation. Moreover, incorporation of VEGF enhanced migration of CD34-positive cells to the graft. This is of particular importance since CD34 is a marker of endothelial progenitor cells, and migration of CD34-positive cells to the vascular graft was previously observed both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Boyer et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">De Visscher et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, we found that incorporation of VEGF led to an increase of the total number of cells within the graft. Therefore, we suggest that VEGF promotes endothelialization and improves patency of the vascular graft <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that incorporation of VEGF improves biofunctionalization of PHBV/PCL vascular grafts. It makes graft more similar to extracellular matrix and brings its physico-mechanical properties closer to those of IMA. Furthermore, it stimulates migration of cells to the graft, promotes formation of endothelial cell monolayer <italic>in situ</italic>, and improves graft patency.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>LA, AK, YK, OB, and LB conceived and designed the study; VS, EK, and ES fabricated the grafts; LA, VS, and TG performed morphological assessment; LA, AM, VS, and TG performed evaluation of physico-mechanical properties; AM, AS, EV, EK, and EA performed <italic>in vivo</italic> implantation; LA, VS, EK, AB, and GV performed histological examination and immunohistochemistry; LA, AK, and VS performed data analysis and wrote the manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold>.
