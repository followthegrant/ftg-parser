Significant efforts are being made to develop new nanotechnology-based therapeutic and diagnostic agents. Nanoparticles can act directly on cancer cells or as drug carriers to enhance the cancer therapeutic effect. In this study, we investigated the effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on human glioma U251 cells and its role in the combinational use with Temozolomide (TMZ), an imidazotetrazine derivative of the alkylating agent dacarbazine, against glioma cells. AgNPs were synthesized in the sodium citrate system and the mean size were 26 nm in diameter. The AgNP particles showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity on U251 cells. They also showed the ability to enhance the drug-sensitivity of TMZ on U251 cells. Our results revealed that AgNPs could have a potential application in enhancing chemotherapy for glioma.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)</kwd><kwd>glioma cells</kwd><kwd>temozolomide (TMZ)</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the most common malignant tumors in the central nervous system (CNS), remains a lethal disease with poor prognosis. The treatment of GBM is multimodality in which surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy play important roles [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among them, chemotherapy remains the gold standard for patients who can not tolerate surgical procedure or relapse after surgery. However, most glioma cancer eventually develops multidrug resistance (MDR) to current chemotherapeutic drugs that limits the effectiveness of treatment results [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>To circumvent the cancer drug resistance, strategies have been focus on developing novel therapeutic agents and enhancing cancer drug delivery efficacy. Direct delivery of drug to the tumor site had been proposed and extensively studied. In recent years, scientists were able to synthesize nanoscale, biodegradable and biocompatible drug delivery systems with the advanced nanotechnology. Such accomplishment has made it possible to deliver anticancer drugs using nanoparticles as delivery vehicles [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] .</p><p>There are many types of nanocarriers that have been developed to deliver a variety of drugs. The most common nanocarriers are polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles and liposomes [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These nanocarriers have shown excellent characteristics as drug delivery system. They reduced non-specific cellular uptake, prolonged the lifetime of drug in systemic circulation. They can control drug release, improve drug targeting ability. Nanocarriers can also be generated as, multidrug encapsulation for treatments that require multi-regimen.</p><p>In recent years, a number of chemotherapeutic drugs have been successfully encapsulated in nanoparticles for cancer treatment. The average size of these nanoparticles ranges from 50 to 150 nm. Studies have demonstrated the strength of using nanoparticle delivery system to tackle cancer drug resistance [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There are several clinical trials are in progress using nanoparticle-encapsulated anti- cancer drugs. Some of the nanoparticle encapsulated anti-cancer drugs are currently available on the market.</p><p>Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have showed the property of anti-cancers. There were studies show that AgNPs can enter cells by endocytosis [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Inside the cells, AgNPs localize in the perinuclear region and endo-lysosomal membrane compartment [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Cytotoxicity assay indicated that AgNPs has cytotoxicity whose potency is similar to that of Ag ions [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some researches showed that AgNPs can enter the mitochondria and affect cells&#x02019; respiration, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), therefore induced cell apoptosis [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Besides, AgNPs could cause DNA damage and induce p53 protein expression [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Some studies also showed that the function of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could be affected by AgNPs [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These findings confirmed that AgNPs had anti-tumor properties that could be used as an alternative for cancer treatment and for treating angiogenesis-related diseases [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Temozolomide (TMZ) is a second-generation imidazotetrazine derivative, which exerts its cytotoxic effects by methylation of specific DNA sites [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although it is effective in the treatment of glioblastoma, drug resistance limits its successful application. It was known that AgNPs have differential sensitivity to normal cells (e.g. human lung fibroblast cells), as compared to cancer cells (e.g. human glioblastoma cells) [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the present study, we investigate the cytotoxicity of AgPNs on glioma cells and explore whether AgNPs can enhance the sensitivity of TMZ against glioma. We demonstrated that the combination of AgNPs and TMZ has potent anti-glioma effect and could be explored to developing into novel chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Characteristics of AgNPs</title><p>AgNPs were prepared from the sodium citrate system by using AgNO<sub>3</sub> and NaBH<sub>4</sub>. Under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), AgNPs was found to be heterogeneous spheres with a diameter ranging from 21&#x02013;32 nm. They were uniformly distributed. The mean diameter of AgNPs was 26 nm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>TEM micrograph of AgNPs</title><p>AgNPs are heterogeneous spheres (<bold>A</bold>) with the mean sizes of 26 nm in diameters (<bold>B</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-08-7533-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Cytotoxicity of AgNPs</title><p>Our previous studies showed that AgNPs have a definite dose-dependent toxicity on cells. We usually regard 1/5 of IC50 as a suitable concentration, because of better biocompatibility and little toxic effect on normal cells. In the preliminary experiments, U251 cells were incubated with different concentrations of AgNPs. We found necrotic and apoptotic cells when AgNPs concentration was greater than 92 &#x003bc;mol/L. Most of the cells grow normally when the AgNPs concentration was less than 46 &#x003bc;mol/L, the 1/5 of IC50 of AgNPs. Therefore 46 &#x003bc;mol/L of AgNPs was used in the following experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Uptake of AgNPs by U251 cells</title><p>TEM micrographs show that AgNPs distributed inside the cells. AgNPs containing endosomes were mainly seen near the cell membrane. This result indicated that AgNPs might enter the cells through membrane endocytosis. In addition to the nanoparticles-containing endosomes, autophagic cellular vacuoles filled with structures resembling mitochondria and electron dense contents of unknown origin were also observed inside the AgNPs treated cells. A few nanoparticles were seen in the nucleus of the treated cells.

Under the treatment with AgNPs at the concentration of 46 &#x003bc;mol/L, the cells&#x02019; colony forming ability decreased to around 80% compared to cells without AgNPs treatment. Similarly, TMZ treatment repressed U251 cells&#x02019; colony forming ability. Treatment of U251 cells with the combination of TMZ and AgNPs, the number of survival colonies significantly decreased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This result indicated that AgNPs could enhance the effect of TMZ-induced cell death.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Images of colony-forming assays</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) control; (<bold>B</bold>) cells incubated with AgNPs; (<bold>C</bold>) cells incubated with TMZ; (<bold>D</bold>) cells incubated with AgNPs + TMZ; (<bold>E</bold>) Quantitative results of A, B, C, and D.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-08-7533-g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2_5"><title>AgNPs induced cell apoptosis and significantly enhanced TMZ sensitivity in inducing cell apoptosis</title><p>The above results showed that TMZ combined with AgNPs significantly decrease the cell survival rate. To understand whether the decreased cell survival was associated with apoptosis, PI and Annexin-V-FITC staining was performed and analyzed using flow cytometry. U251 cells were treated with AgNPs, TMZ or combination of both. The results showed although AgNPs or TMZ alone can increase cell apoptosis to certain degree. The apoptosis rate increased much more in cells treated by the combination of AgNPs and TMZ (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

Gliomas are sensitive to agents that cause DNA damage and oxidative stress. AgNPs have differential sensitivity to normal cells (e.g. human lung fibroblast cells), as compared to cancer cells (e.g. human glioblastoma cells) [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Studies have shown the cytotoxic effect of AgNPs on a variety of cancer cells, e.g. glioblastoma cells and breast cancer cells [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. AgNPs has been used as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of glioma [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, experiments were carried out to study the cytotoxic effect of AgNPs on human glioma cells. Factors that affect the cytotoxicity of AgNPs include the shape and size of particles, the surface charge and capping agent. We found that AgNPs with the size of diameter around 26 nm can be uptake into cells and released as silver ions, which interfered with the intracellular repair process. Our results indicated that AgNPs have high cytotoxicity against glioma cells at a very low concentration (46 &#x003bc;mol/L) that have little effect on normal cells. AgNPs induced DNA damage and apoptosis. The cytotoxic effect of AgNPs was concentration-dependent and was enforced when combined use with chemotherapeutic agent TMZ.</p><p>As one of the most common and lethal primary malignant tumors in the central nervous system, the prognosis of GBM is very poor. Current regimes for GBM include surgical resection and aggressive treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Although progress has been made, the results are still not satisfying. In recent years, significant efforts are devoted in the development of nanotechnology-based therapeutic agents. The present study provides a rational for using AgNPs to develop into therapeutic agents for GBM. In summary, our studies show that AgNPs have selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells, particularly on glioma cells at doses that are nontoxic to normal cells. It has a dose-enhancement effect in the combinational use with TMZ. These results implicated the potential use of AgNPs as a therapeutic agent for GMB therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>AgNPs synthesis</title><p>AgNPs was synthesized according to published protocol.
