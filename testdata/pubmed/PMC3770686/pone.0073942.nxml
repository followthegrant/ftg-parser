The poor prognosis may be explained by the late detection of the neoplastic process, lack of effective treatment, and limited knowledge of its biological characteristics. Hence, better understanding of the cellular/molecular properties associated with&#x000a0;this condition is urgently needed to explore novel venues of diagnostics and treatment of this dismal disease.</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests that malignant tumors are composed of a small subset of distinct cancer cells, termed "cancer stem cells" (CSCs), typically less than 5% of total cancer cells based on cell surface marker expression [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. CSCs are found in a sub-population of cells that is distinct from the main population within tumors or hematological cancers, called &#x0201c;side population&#x0201d; cells (SP cells) exhibiting stem cell-like characteristics. CSCs possess the capacity to self-renew and to generate the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise the tumor; they are therefore tumorigenic, in contrast to other non-tumorigenic cancer cells, and are essential drivers for tumor progression and metastasis. Clinically even more important, however, is the fact that CSCs also confer virulence via immune system evasion and multidrug resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy resulting in their relative enrichment during treatment and rapid relapse of disease [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The efficacy of cancer treatments is often measured by the ablation fraction of tumor mass, and conventional chemotherapies kill differentiated or differentiating cells, which form the bulk of the tumor but are unable to generate new cells. As CSCs form a rather small proportion of the tumor, they could remain un-attacked, causing a relapse of the disease. Therefore, development of specific therapies targeted at CSCs holds tremendous hope for improvement of survival and quality of life of cancer patients, especially for sufferers of metastatic disease.</p><p>CSCs have been identified in PDAC and pancreatic cancer cell lines by several laboratories [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Human pancreatic CSCs expressing high levels of CD133, CD24, CD44, ESA, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1) also have more abundant Nanog, Oct4, Notch1, MDR1 and ABCG2 than normal pancreatic tissues and primary pancreatic cancer cells [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It appears that PDAC does not only contain one homogeneous population of CSCs rather than diverse subpopulations that may have evolved during tumor progression, based on the use of combinations of surface markers that allow their isolation, propagation, and further characterization. One of these populations is called migrating CSCs and these cells are capable of evading the primary tumor and traveling to distant sites such as the liver as the preferred site of metastatic spread.</p><p>Therefore, successful treatments of cancers not only rely on identifying the source of cancer cells and anticancer therapy for the differentiated cancer cells, but also on finding potential CSC population and reaching sufficient destroying of CSCs in the tumor. Indeed, CSC-targeted approaches have demonstrated great promise in preclinical models [2-6]. These approaches include direct strategies, such as ablation by targeting molecular markers of CSCs or CSC-specific pathways, reversal of resistance mechanisms, and differentiation therapy, and indirect strategies, such as antiangiogenic therapy, immunotherapeutic approaches, and disruption of protumorigenic interactions between CSCs and their microenvironment.</p><p>The present study was conducted to achieve the following two primary goals. First, to have a comprehensive characterization of the CSC populations in human pancreatic cancer cell lines, we compared the SP cells in BxPc-3, PANC-1 and SW1990 cell lines. Second, to exploit the possibility of simultaneously targeting multiple transcription factors governing the stemness of pancreatic CSCs to disrupt CSCs thereby tumorigenesis and metastasis, we designed a decoy oligonucleotides fragment by the &#x0201c;one agent, multiple targets&#x0201d; concept and tested the efficacy of this molecule to silence the stemness of pancreatic CSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The used of all animals in this study was approved by, and all operative procedures and animal care strictly conformed to Guidelines set by, the Animal Ethics Committee of the Xinjiang Medical University and the Sun Yat-sen University.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPc-3, PANC-1, and SW1990 originally established from human primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma by ATCC were purchased from Shanghai Cell Bank (Shanghai, China) and propagated in our laboratory.

These cells can be isolated using flow cytometry protocols initially established by Goodell et al. in a study of murine bone marrow [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. H-PCCLs were detached from the culture dish with 0.25% trypsin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and suspended at 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in culture medium containing 2% FBS. The tumor cells and cell lines were incubated with Hoechst 33342 dye (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 5 &#x000b5;g/ml with or without verapamil (100 &#x000b5;M; Sigma-Aldrich) at 37&#x000b0;C for 90 min with intermittent shaking every 15 min. Verapamil was used to verify the SP phenotype, as it can reduce the side branch by blocking the multidrug transporters. After washed twice with PBS, the cells were resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing 2% FBS, passed through a 40-&#x000b5;m mesh filter to obtain single-cell suspensions, and kept on ice until flow cytometry analysis. Propidium iodide (PI; 2 &#x003bc;g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to label and exclude dead cells. Cell analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were conducted using a FACS Vantage SE equipped with the version 6.0 FACS DIVA software (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium). Hoechst 33342 dye was excited by a 350-nm ultraviolet laser, and fluorescence emission was dual-wavelength analyzed (Hoechst blue with 402-450 nm filter; Hoechst red with 650-670 nm filter).</p></sec><sec id="s2.4"><title>Cell proliferation and cell cycle assays</title><p>One thousand sorted SP and non-SP (NSP) cells were seeded into separate well of a 96-well plate in triplicate and cultured in Leibovitz&#x02019;s L-15 medium with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS for 3 days. Growth was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Briefly, 20 &#x000b5;l MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS; Sigma) was added to each well and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 h.

Agar (10 g/l; DNA grade) was melted in the microwave and 2&#x000d7; DMEM supplemented with 200 ml/l FBS was warmed to 40<sup>o</sup>C in a water bath. Equal volumes of these two solutions were then mixed to yield a new solution of 5 g/l agar + 1&#x000d7; DMEM + 100 ml/l FBS(2). Next, 1 ml of mixed solution was added to each well of a 6-well plate to form the base agar(3). Then, 7 g/l agar (DNA grade) was melted in the microwave and cooled to 40<sup>o</sup>C in a water bath, and 2&#x000d7; DMEM and 200 ml/l FBS were warmed to the same temperature(4). Freshly sorted SP and non-SP cells were passed through a 40-&#x000b5;m filter to provide a single cell suspension and were counted. Three ml DMEM, 1.5 ml 2&#x000d7; DMEM containing 200 ml/l FBS and 1.5 ml agar including 500 sorted cells were then mixed together, and a 1.5 ml cell suspension of this solution was placed into each well of a 6-well plate as the top agar(5). Finally, 100 cells were seeded into each well, and were incubated at 37<sup>o</sup>C in a humidified incubator for 2-3 wk. Colonies were either left unstained, or were stained with 5 g/l MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h, and counted under a dissecting microscope (the procedure was repeated three times)(6). After SP cells were seeded in soft agar assays, colonies containing more than 50 cells (primary colony) were removed from soft agar with sterile Pasteur pipettes, treated with trypsin and mechanically dissociated into single cells. Then, step (5) was repeated for the secondary colony.</p></sec><sec id="s2.6"><title>Sphere formation assays</title><p>Sorted SP and NSP cells from the three h-PCCLs were passed through a 40-&#x000b5;m filter to obtain a single cell suspension.

Cells were seeded in the top chamber onto the Matrigel coated Membrane (24-well insert; pore size, 8 mm; Corning Costar) at 2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> per insert in serum-free DMEM at 37<sup>o</sup>C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 48 h. Outer wells were filled with DMEM containing 5% FBS as chemo-attractant. The non-invading cells were removed by swabbing top layer of Matrigel with Q-tip. The membrane containing invading cells was stained with hematoxylin for 3 min, and then washed and mounted onto slides. The invading cells on the entire membrane were counted under a light microscope at 40&#x000d7; objective.</p></sec><sec id="s2.8"><title>Transwell migration assay</title><p>Sorted SP or NSP cells at 1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> were plated in the top chamber onto the non-coated membrane (24-well insert; pore size, 8 mm; Corning Costar) and allowed to migrate toward serum-containing medium in the lower chamber. Cells were fixed after 24 h of incubation with methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (2 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). The number of cells invading through the membrane was counted under a light microscope (40&#x000d7;, three random fields per well).</p></sec><sec id="s2.9"><title>Drug resistance analysis</title><p>Aliquots of 2&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> freshly sorted SP and NSP cells were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicate with 200 &#x000b5;l DMEM per well. After a 12-h recovery period, cells were exposed to various concentrations of gemcitabine for 72 h. The effects on cell growth were examined by the MTT assay as described above. The cell survival rate (SR) was calculated using the formula: SR = (mean absorbance of the test well / mean absorbance of the control) &#x000d7; 100%; the cell resistance rate (RR) was calculated using the formula: RR =100% -SR.</p><p>Apoptotic cells were determined by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Annexin-V methods. In brief, freshly sorted cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/well. After 12 h of recovery, the cells were exposed to varying concentrations of gemcitabine for 48 h. The cells were then stained with Annexin-V and PI using the ApoAlert&#x02122; Annexin V Apoptosis Kit (Clontech, Cosete Tech, Jinan) as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Briefly, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice with cold PBS. The pellets were resuspended in 100 &#x000b5;l 1&#x000d7; Annexin binding buffer and 5 &#x000b5;l FITC-Annexin-V. A 1-&#x000b5;l working solution of PI at 100 &#x000b5;g/ml was added to each 100 &#x000b5;l of cell suspension. The cells were incubated on ice for 1 h, washed again with cold PBS and resuspended in 300 &#x000b5;l 1&#x000d7; Annexin-binding buffer. The stained cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s2.10"><title>In vitro differentiation study</title><p>Freshly sorted SP and NSP cells were cultured at a density of 1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 6-well culture plate in Leibovitz&#x02019;s L-15 medium with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 7 days, SP- and non-SP derived cells were re-analyzed for the presence of an SP fraction using the methods described above.</p></sec><sec id="s2.11"><title>Tumorigenicity assay in vivo</title><p>Athymic 4- to 5-week-old mice (BALB/c nude mice) were supplied by Slac Laboratory Animal (Shanghai). Mice were housed and maintained in laminar flow cabinets under pathogen-free conditions. Groups of mice were orthotopically inoculated s.c. to the left dorsal flank of mice with freshly sorted SP cells at 1&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup>, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>, and 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> or NSP cells at 1&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup>, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup>, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>, and 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> (four mice per group). Tumor growth was monitored every 2 days after second week of inoculation. The mice were sacrificed at day 50 or when the tumors grow to a maximum of 1,000 mm<sup>3</sup>. Tumor volume was calculated by the formula 0.52 &#x000d7; length &#x000d7; width<sup>2</sup>. Fold difference in tumorigenicity was calculated by the following formula: NSP<sub>min</sub> / SP<sub>min</sub>, where NSP<sub>min</sub> is the minimum number of NSP cells needed to generate a tumor and SP<sub>min</sub> is the minimum number of SP cells needed to generate a tumor. Finally, tumors were also digested to make single-cell suspension for SP re-analysis by the Hoechst33342 dye efflux assay as described above.</p><p>When the h-PCCL-induced tumors reached a volume of approximately 200 mm<sup>3</sup>, one group of mice received gemcitabine (200 mg/kg body weight i.p., 1 injection every 3 days, 6 injections in total) and the other group (bearing the corresponding tumors) was injected with vehicle (0.9% NaCl; control group). Tumor diameter was measured every 3 days after the first injection. Gemcitabine was considered effective when tumor volume decreased at least 50%. Three days after the last injection, mice were euthanized and tumors analyzed to determine the proportion of SP cells as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s2.12"><title>RNA extraction and real-time PCR analysis</title><p>Sorted cells and cultured cells were treated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen China Limited, Shanghai) and mixed thoroughly with pipetting.

Following centrifugation, total RNA were obtained by isopropanol precipitation according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.</p><p>Single strand cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA using random primer under standard conditions with the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR with total cDNA was performed with SYBR Green Master Mix Real-Time Core Reagents on an ABI 7500 (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The amplifications were carried out at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 sec followed by 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 5 s, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 s. To quantify the relative expression of each gene, the Ct (threshold cycle) values were normalized for endogenous reference ( <sup>&#x00394;</sup>Ct = Ct target- Ct &#x003b2;-actin) and compared with a calibrator, using the " <sup>&#x02206;&#x02206;</sup>Ct method" ( <sup>&#x02206;&#x02206;</sup>Ct = <sup>&#x00394;</sup>Ct<sub>sample</sub> - <sup>&#x00394;</sup>Ct<sub>calibrator</sub>). Using the <sup>&#x02206;&#x02206;</sup>Ct value, relative expression was calculated (<sup>2-&#x02206;&#x02206;</sup>Ct). As the <sup>&#x00394;</sup>Ct method is only applicable when the amplification efficiencies of the target and the reference are essentially equal, we determined the efficiencies for 5 dilutions, and the delta Ct values (Ct<sub>target</sub>-Ct<sub>&#x003b2;-actin</sub>) were plotted against the dilution (log). The slope of the fitted line was then determined. All samples were tested in triplicate, and the average values were used for quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s2.13"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Membrane and cytosolic protein samples were extracted from SP and NSP cells from all three h-PCCLs.

The protein samples (membrane sample for ABCG2 and CD133; cytosolic sample for ALDH1, Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) were incubated with the primary antibodies in 1:200 at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-ABCG2 (Shanghai Ruiqi Biological Technology Co. LTD), rabbit polyclonal anti-CD133 (Shanghai XiangSheng Biotech Co.

Next day, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the membrane was rinsed with PBS before scanning using the Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). GAPDH was used as an internal control for equal input of protein samples, using anti-GAPDH antibody. Western blot bands were quantified using QuantityOne software by measuring the band intensity (Area &#x000d7; OD) for each group and normalizing to GAPDH.

The main findings in the present study include: (1) CSCs are enriched in the side proportion (SP) cells contained in the h-PCCLs, though to different extents in different PCCLs, and they possess aggressive growth, invasion, migration and drug-resistance properties and (2) a single decoy simultaneously targeting Sox2, Oct4 and c-Myc (cdODN-SOC) efficiently suppressed the CSC properties, leading to elimination of CSCs phenotypes in h-PCCLs or loss of stemness of SP cells in h-PCCLs. The findings indicate that targeting the key genes conferring the CSC identity is able to convert the CSC to non-SP (NSP) cells, and thus may be considered a new and alternative approach for cancer therapy. Specifically, the present study establishes the combination of Sox2/Oct4/c-Myc targeting as a potential anticancer agent worthy of further studies in preclinical settings.</p><p>The presence of SP fraction in PANC-1, SW1990, and BxPc-3 cells and the CSC-like properties of these SP cells have been documented by other groups [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We provided both in vitro and <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for the ability of the SP cells from h-PCCLs to regenerate a population of cells comprised of both SP and NSP, indicating the self-renewal ability to produce heterologous descendent cells by asymmetric division. When inoculated into nude mice, the SP cells were found to be more tumorigenic than NSP cells and to be able to cause liver metastases. These observations are also consistent with the findings in previous studies, underscoring the importance of CSCs in the development, as well as therapy, of PDAC.</p><p>One of the major challenges in the treatment of PDAC is the frequent failure of chemotherapy. The lack of success with existing strategies underscores the importance of continued research efforts, in the hope of developing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients diagnosed with PDAC. According to the CSC theory [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], conventional chemotherapies and radiation therapy kill differentiated or differentiating cells, and these cells form the bulk of the tumor, but cannot generate new cells. Tumor relapse may occur because CSCs remain non-attacked by drugs, suggesting the removal of CSCs is crucial for effective cancer therapy. Unlike most cells within the tumor, CSCs, including pancreatic CSCs, are resistant to chemotherapy and may contribute to tumor metastasis and tumor recurrence after treatment. Therefore, drugs that selectively target CSCs offer a greater promise for cancer therapy and/or prevention. Many pharmaceutical companies are investing heavily in developing new therapeutics to target cancer stem cells, and more efficient inhibitors of several developmental signaling pathways are currently being developed or in the early phases of testing [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A key issue needed to be worked out before embarking on clinical trials to target pancreatic cancer stem cells will be determining the best way to measure the efficacy of these new therapies. Traditionally, the effectiveness of cancer agents is measured by tumor shrinkage. Tumor response is usually defined as tumor shrinkage by at least 50%. If cancer stem cells are resistant to therapy and make up a very small percentage of cells within the tumor, the effect of therapeutics may reflect the effect on the differentiated, nontumorigenic cancer cells, rather than cancer stem cells. For clinical trials testing pancreatic cancer stem cell therapeutics, new measures of efficacy will need to be devised.</p><p>It is known that transcription factors make up 6% of the human genome, ranking second because of their abundance, and have recently been considered a new class of candidate targets for drug discovery [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The decoy technology using these transcription factors as molecular targets has been emerged as a vivid strategy for gene therapy of a broad range of human diseases [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, Gao et al. in 2006 [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] developed the &#x02018;one-drug, multiple-target&#x02019; concept and established the anticancer efficacy of the complex decoy ODN (cdODN) that targets oncoproteins NF-&#x003ba;B, E2F and Stat3. In the present study, we extended this pioneer work to containing <italic>cis</italic>-elements for pluripotency maintaining factors Sox2, Oct4 and c-Myc to target CSC-like phenotype. Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4 are transcription factors all essential to maintaining the pluripotent embryonic stem cell phenotype [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Sox2 binds specifically to a 7-bp sequence termed the HMG site and this site is often found adjacent to a binding site for Oct-3/4 (termed the POU site). Indeed, Oct-4 and Sox2 bind to the Nanog promoter in living mouse and human ESCs [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Nanog, Oct-4 and Sox2 co-occupy and regulate their own promoters together with other developmental genes with diverse functions and collaborate to form an extensive regulatory circuitry including autoregulatory and feed-forward loops [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Recent studies revealed that through a cooperative interaction, Sox2 and Oct4 have previously been described to drive pluripotent-specific expression of a number of genes including Nanog. On the other hand, it has been shown that the endothelial cells expressing Nanog also express other stemness genes including Sox2, Oct4, and c-Myc, which are not normally expressed or are expressed at very low levels in these cells [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Sox2 also regulates expression of c-Myc, Wnt1, Wnt2, and Notch1 in xenografted NOD/SCID mice [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Oct4 has been shown to mediate chemoresistance through a potential Oct4-Akt-ABCG2 pathway [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. C-Myc is essential for keeping CSC-like phenotype in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Clearly, there is a complex network constantly operating in SP cells to maintain the pluripotent embryonic stem cell phenotype and to confer the CSC-like properties such as aggressive invasion, migration and multidrug resistance. Hence, by targeting Sox2, Oct4 and c-Myc, a wide spectrum of signaling molecules crucial to tumorigenesis are also deemed to be affected directly or indirectly.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests a shared genomic fingerprint between embryonic stem cells, cancer cells, and cancer stem cells. Activation targets of Nanog, Oct-4, Sox2 and c-Myc are more frequently overexpressed in many tumors. The advantages of the cdODN approach are likely to be ascribed to simultaneous interference of expression of multiple genes controlled by the target transcription factors: in our case, sox2, Oct4, and c-Myc which critically determine the CSC identity and properties. According to Gao et al. [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the cdODN one-drug, multiple-target strategy mimics the well known drug cocktail therapy, but it is advantageous over the latter in that it is devoid of the weaknesses of the drug cocktail therapy, involving complicated treatment regimens, undesirable drug&#x02013;drug interactions, and increased side effects. Additionally, the cdODN strategy offers resourceful combinations of varying <italic>cis</italic> elements for concomitantly targeting multiple transcription factors that control expression of many distinct but interrelated genes. The cdODN-SOC tested in this study is potentially applicable to a wide spectrum of cancers, as the target transcription factors/pluripotency maintaining factors Sox2, Oct4 and c-Myc are not cell/tissue specific; they are overexpressed in SP cells of various origins [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is there plausible that our cdODN-SOC may also be applied to cancers of various origins other than PDAC. Yet this notion definitely requires future studies for verification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0073942.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
