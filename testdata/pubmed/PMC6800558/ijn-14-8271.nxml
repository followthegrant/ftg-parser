At first, 2g chitosan was weighed and added into 100mL 2% (v/v) acetic acid, and the CS solution was stirred for 20mins. Then, 36mg salvianolic acid B was dissolved in 1mL ethanol and added to chitosan solution and stirred for 2hrs. Then, Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (Ca/P=1.67) were added slowly to prepare the Sal B-CS/HA precursor solution (final mass ratio of CS/HA was 1/2). Then, the precursor solution was homogenized for 4hrs by vigorous stirring and centrifuged for 10mins to remove the air bubbles. The solution was poured into a plastic mold (4.0mm in diameter, 20mm in length) and placed at 4&#x000b0;C for 2hrs and &#x02212;10&#x000b0;C for 3hrs, then the solution was freeze-dried for 24hrs. After they were fully dried, Sal B-CS/HA scaffolds were soaked in 2% (wt/v) NaOH for 2hrs and rinsed with distilled water for several times. After that, scaffolds were freeze-dried again, then both ends of the scaffold were truncated for 2.5mm. Finally, each Sal B-CS/HA scaffold contained 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>mol salvianolic acid B. We also prepared the CS/HA scaffolds in the same method without salvianolic acid B as the control group. All scaffolds were sterilized with 20kGy <sup>60</sup>Co and stored in vacuum packages at room temperature before subsequent use.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2002"><title>Characterization Of Scaffolds</title><sec id="S0002-S2002-S3001"><title>The Microstructure And Phase Of The Scaffolds</title><p>The microstructure of Sal B-CS/HA scaffolds was examined by scanning electron microscopy and HE staining.

The porosity was measured by the method of liquid displacement as following: the volume (V<sub>0</sub>) and weight (W<sub>0</sub>) of the sample were measured. Then, the sample was immersed into ethanol for 5 mins until it was saturated by ethanol. The sample was weighted again and noted as W<sub>1</sub>.

Besides, the effect of the osteogenesis is influenced by the situation of angiogenesis.<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> So, there is an urgent to develop some alternative agents with both osteogenesis and angiogenesis to get better effect of bone formation. Salvianolic acid B is a drug that has been proven to have the bioactivities of both angiogenesis and osteogenesis.<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> So, we chose this drug in our experiment to be loaded in the bone scaffold. As our result showed the osteoblast cultured in the conditional medium with salvianolic acid B had better cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity compared with the normal medium. The HUVECs cultured in the conditional medium with salvianolic acid B also had better cell proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor activity compared with the normal medium. Our results were consistent with the previous reports and further proved the good bioactivities of angiogenesis and osteogenesis of the salvianolic acid B in vitro.</p><p>To be used as an ideal bone scaffold, the drug-loaded scaffolds for drug delivery should have good release behavior.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> They should control the drug release and maintain the local drug concentration steady and durable. The drug loading procedure should not significantly affect the characterization of the scaffold. As our result showed the release of salvianolic acid B was durable for more than 56 days in vitro. The release rate of salvianolic acid B was fast at the beginning 30 days with almost 30% drug release and then the release rate was slow down with less than 10% drug release for next 26 days. In our previous study, the CS/HA scaffold was proven to be a feasible drug-loaded system to load icariin.<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> And by the same method, this drug-loaded system was further proved to be feasible to load the salvianolic acid B.</p><p>After loading the salvianolic acid B, our result showed that salvianolic acid B got no obvious chemical change when it was loaded onto CS/HA and the microstructure of the scaffold was not significantly changed. After loading the salvianolic acid B, the porosity of scaffold was slightly decreased, and the density of the scaffolds was slightly increased. The elastic modulus was also affected after loading the drug. Although different stiffness of material has an influence on the differentiation of stem cells, this mild change of elastic modulus was acceptable and still under the range of suitable stiffness which could induce the osteogenic differentiation.<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> And, these mild changes of the scaffold after drug loading would not significantly influence their use in non-weight-bearing area as a bone repair scaffold.</p><p>Besides controlled drug release behavior, the bone scaffold should also have good biocompatibility and bioactivity.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> As our result showed the morphology of MC3T3-E1 cells on the Sa B-CS/HA scaffold was good and not obviously different from that of CS/HA scaffold. For the study of in vitro bioactivity, we used the extract of the scaffolds to get the conditional medium. And, the conditional medium extracted from the Sa B-CS/HA scaffold could promote the cell proliferation of both MC3T3-E1 and HUVECs significantly. The alkaline phosphatase activity and vascular endothelial growth factor activity were also increased in the Sa B-CS/HA group compared with the CS/HA group. The biocompatibility and bioactivity of this Sa B-CS/HA were proven to be favorable by our in vitro results.</p><p>Our in vivo experiments further demonstrated the good efficacy of Sa B-CS/HA scaffold for bone defect repairing. Both CT and histological evaluation suggested that the Sa B-CS/HA scaffold can enhance bone regeneration. The formation of new cortex was observed via inspection of Group Sa B-CS/HA (6 and 12 weeks). The formation of the new bone was increased as shown by CT and histology analysis with the time and the Group Sa B-CS/HA had better osteogenesis effect. Further analysis using the CD34 immunostaining indicated that Sa B-CS/HA scaffold also had better angiogenesis in vivo. Our results were similar to other reports about Sa B-loaded scaffold used for bone regeneration.<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> And, there evidences proved that the Sa B-loaded scaffold had the good efficacy for bone defect repairing with both angiogenesis and osteogenesis effect.</p><p>However, there are some other limitations in our study. Despite Sa B-CS/HA scaffold had significant effect on bone formation compared with that of pure CS/HA scaffold, but no blank group or autograft group was used for comparison. Actually, the 1.5cm length of radius bone defect in rabbit was the acknowledged critical defect size that could not self-repair,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> so the blank group was not used in our study. And, autograft was still the golden standard for bone defect repair, however, we just used the pure CS/HA scaffold without loading drug as the control group. In our next study, we will add autograft group as the positive group to study more details. Second, further study still needs to be tested if higher or lower concentration of Sa B incorporation had better angiogenesis and osteogenesis effect. Third, further study on larger animal such as sheep or pig is necessary to validate the findings of the present study. Lastly, the scaffold materials tested in this study did not degrade completely in week 12. The presence of residual scaffold materials might interfere with the measurement of new bone formation at week 6 and 12, and a longer study duration still needs further study. Nevertheless, our results shed light onto the loading of Sa B as effect agent to current bone scaffold with the angiogenesis and osteogenesis effect.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study showed that this Sa B-CS/HA scaffold was a promising bone scaffold which could release the salvianolic acid B durably and steadily. The properties of salvianolic acid B and CS/HA were not significantly changed in the scaffold developed during the production. The drug release from this Sa B-CS/HA scaffold could last for more than 56 days. The osteogenic and angiogenic bioactivities of the Sal B-CS/HA scaffold were proved to be effective by in vivo and in vitro tests. In summary, our results suggested that this salvianolic acid B-loaded bone scaffold has the potential to be used for bone defect repair with better osteogenic and angiogenic bioactivities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81672189).</p></ack><sec id="S0006" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Kretlow</surname>
