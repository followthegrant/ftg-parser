The oral cavity contributes to health-related quality of life at the biologic and psychosocial levels [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dental caries is one of the most common diseases of childhood [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], impacting quality of life through pain, infection, diet, and loss of sleep. Caries can also lead to time lost from school for children and time off work for parents/carers [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

The Scottish Government and National Health Service (NHS) Scotland are at the forefront of child oral health improvement and they have been funding a nation-wide supervised nursery toothbrushing program since 2001 and since 2006, the <italic>Childsmile</italic> program, which incorporated the toothbrushing program [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136211.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The overarching aim of these programmes is to reduce childhood caries and narrow health inequalities.</p><p>Our previous study has shown that the major improvement in the dental health and the reduction in dental health inequalities among five-year-old children in Scotland observed over the past decade was associated with the introduction and uptake of the nursery toothbrushing program. Child oral health has improved in the face of flat-lining trends in general child health indicators [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The Christie Commission Report is a key driver for public sector policy and budget allocation in Scotland&#x02014;with an emphasis on addressing inequalities and the focus of what it defined as a &#x0201c;preventative spend&#x0201d; approach. This approach aims to shift both action and resource into preventative action with the ultimate aim of improving health outcomes and saving resources long term [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Dental programmes in general, and oral health preventative programmes in populations in particular, rarely receive the same level of attention as medical care among policy makers with regard to the cost-effective allocation of scarce health care resources [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Policymakers may consider oral health to be less important than other health needs [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As a result, the application of economic evaluation in preventive dentistry [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and dental public health [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] remains limited.

The expected cost savings were estimated as a proxy for the opportunity cost (benefits forgone) of the freed-up dental resources and were calculated as a direct function of the averted decayed, missing and filled teeth in five-year-olds. Without information on preference-based quality of life estimates such as the quality adjusted life year for caries-related dental health states and little indication in the literature relating to the economic value of the improved dental health via reduction in dental caries, the aim of this cost analysis is to provide initial estimates of cost savings through improved dental health outcomes (decrease in the number of decayed, missing and filled teeth in 5-year-old population). It is important to note that such expected cost savings provide an estimate for dental health resources now released and re-deployed and not financial resources to be accrued on a balance sheet.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Study design</title><p>This cost analysis adopts a health service perspective and combines the total costs of the nursery toothbrushing program in each of the Scottish Health Boards in the 2011/12 financial year with the averted total costs of actual and anticipated dental treatments caused by dental caries in 5-year-old children. In this research, &#x02018;actual&#x02019; treatments are defined as the dental treatments, delivered every year (such as tooth fillings and extractions) and recorded within various dental data collection systems, whereas &#x02018;anticipated&#x02018; relate to treatments assumed to happen in the coming years taking in account possible management options for decayed teeth, i.e. they may be filled, extracted or left untreated until exfoliation. In the case of &#x02018;anticipated treatments&#x02019; the probabilities of different fates of decayed primary teeth have been incorporated into the cost analysis.</p><p>Currently there are 14 territorial Health Boards in Scotland, with the total population of each board ranging from around 21,000 to 1.2 million people, as of 2012 mid-year estimates [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In Scotland the costs for dental treatment in 0&#x02013;17 years old children/adolescences are met by the Government through NHS payments [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The total costs of actual and anticipated dental treatments were estimated by combining the data on the numbers of decayed, missing and filled teeth per child from the national multiple cross-sectional dental epidemiology inspections of 5-year-old children in Scotland between 1999/00 and 2009/10 with the unit costs of treatment for decayed, filled and missing teeth. These costs were then extrapolated to the population level, using the population estimates of 5-year-olds for each year of the analysis, in order to reflect the total budgetary impact. As there were no national dental inspections of five year old children conducted in 2000/01, 2001/02, 2004/05, 2006/07 and 2008/09, the dental treatment costs for these years were linearly interpolated based on the costs estimated for the years with the dental inspection results available. The interpolation was performed by each cost component: costs of decayed, missing and filled teeth.</p><p>Unit costs of actual and anticipated dental treatments resulting from caries in five-year-old children were calculated in 2009 British pound sterling (GBP, &#x000a3;). Where cost data were not available for the 2009/10 financial year, the available costs for more recent years were deflated using 3% per year deflation rate [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All costs were reported in the base year 2009/10. Discounting was not employed as costs and savings were estimated independently within each year and compared using a common base year to reflect the total impact on resources.</p><p>Despite the fact that this study is a partial economic evaluation, the authors followed the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/cheers/">http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/cheers/</ext-link>) for reporting economic evaluations of health interventions [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Data</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Implementation costs: nursery toothbrushing program costs</title><p>In Scotland there is funding for all children to attend nursery establishments at the ages of three and four years, and a very high proportion of children attend [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Every three- and four-year-old child attending a nursery (full- or part-time) participating in the national toothbrushing program is offered free, daily, supervised toothbrushing within the nursery establishment. A small pea-sized amount of toothpaste containing at least 1000 ppm fluoride is used. The length of brushing is at least 2 min. Toothbrushes and brushing techniques are appropriate to the age and ability of the child and children are closely supervised when brushing their teeth [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The vast majority of nurseries participate in the toothbrushing programme: by 2005/06 the average nursery participation rate had reached around 80%, further increasing to 95% in 2006/07, and staying at or above this level onwards.</p><p>Data on the total costs of implementing the nursery toothbrushing program in the 2011/12 financial year were requested from each of the 14 Scottish Health Boards and then deflated to 2009/10 at 3% per year rate. The assumption was that the annual costs of nursery toothbrushing remained constant over time, so the value for 2009/10 was applied retrospectively to all previous years. The annual implementation costs of the nursery toothbrushing program included: staff salaries, transport and travel, administration/office costs, staff training and toothbrushing resources costs (toothbrushes, toothpaste, toothbrushing packs for home use, storage units for toothbrushes, demonstration aids, and other consumables).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Dental inspection data</title><p>In order to quantify the averted costs due to reduced dental caries rates, changes in the numbers of decayed, missing and filled teeth per 5-year-old child for the duration of the study were identified, measured, valued and compared with the pre-toothbrushing <italic>status quo</italic>. We obtained the data on the numbers of decayed, missing and filled teeth per child from the national dental inspections of 5-year-olds [Scottish Health Boards&#x02019; Dental Epidemiological Program (1999/2000); National Dental Inspection Program (2002/03-2009/10)&#x02013;full reports are available online [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136211.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]]. The national dental inspections of five year old children were conducted on average every second year and covered each of the Health Boards. Data from all 14 Boards were analysed in this study. The dental data were generated as part of the national oral health monitoring system for school children and no further ethical approval was required for the analysis of these data. There is an option to opt-out of this program but opt-in consent is not applicable. Each child&#x02019;s home postcode had been assigned a Carstairs socio-economic deprivation score&#x02014;Depcat [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]&#x02013;with Depcat 1 being the most affluent, and Depcat 7 being the most deprived. The Carstairs score for each postcode sector is not a measure of the extent of material well-being or relative disadvantage experienced by individuals, but is rather a summary measure applied to populations contained within small geographic localities. The Carstairs score is the accepted socio-economic measure available in Scotland for historic analysis. A total of 62,419 anonymised child dental records were analysed with the numbers of the five-year-old children inspected, and proportions of the relevant Scottish population, ranging from 6,766 (11.0%) to 12,067 (23.2%) in various inspection years.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Time period</title><p>The time period for the cost analysis was 1999/00 to 2009/10.

<italic>The costs of dental extractions</italic> were calculated as a function of the number of teeth extracted in one session. It was assumed that for zero to five year old children tooth extractions were performed under a local anaesthetic (LA) if only one tooth was to be extracted, and general anaesthesia (GA) was used if two or more teeth were to be extracted. The data supplied on request by ISD showed that in 2009/10 the average number of teeth extracted per visit under LA for 0-5-year-old patients was 1.24 [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which supports our assumption that approximately only one tooth per child was extracted under LA. The expected cost of an extracted tooth was based on the costs of tooth extractions using both LA and GA. It was assumed that the approximate proportion of the number of extractions under LA to those performed under GA in 4-7-year-old children was 55%: 45%, based on the data on dental LA claims by single year of child age received on request from ISD [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and data on the numbers of dental GA episodes in children in 2009/10 [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] by single year of age, also received on request from ISD. The age group of 4&#x02013;7 years was chosen as the children examined in the dental inspections were on average 5.5 years old, while the range of ages across Scotland was 4&#x02013;7 years (NDIP). Moreover, a paper by Levine et al. (2002) [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] indicated that the majority of carious lesions in primary teeth presented by the age of 6 years, and carious teeth had a mean survival time in the range of 649&#x02013;766 days before being filled or extracted (unless they were left untreated until exfoliation). By applying the above weightings the weighted LA and GA costs were calculated first, and then the overall expected cost of an extracted tooth (<xref rid="pone.0136211.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which was then used in calculation of the cost of a decayed tooth (<xref rid="pone.0136211.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The cost of a tooth extracted under LA was based on Amendment No 115 of SDR [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the ISD data on dental treatment claims and costs for 2009/10 [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The cost of teeth extracted under GA was based on the 2011/12 financial year median gross cost per dental daycase by hospital taken from the ISD Scottish Health Service Costs (known as the Costs Book) data on specialty costs and activity [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which was then deflated to 2009/10 at 3% per year rate (<xref rid="pone.0136211.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0136211.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0136211.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Unit cost of a tooth extraction, 2009 GBP.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0136211.t002g" xlink:href="pone.0136211.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">

The highest expected savings were observed for the most deprived children. The results of the population standardised analysis by deprivation category showed that for the cohort of the most deprived (Depcat 7) the savings resulting from the decrease in the total cost of treatment in primary teeth from 1999/00 to 2009/00 was &#x000a3;137,348 (49.9% of the 1999/00 costs for the most deprived), whereas for the least deprived cohort (Depcat 1) the expected saving was &#x000a3;30,174 (55.3%). For the seven Depcat categories combined the reduction in total costs from 1999/00 to 2009/00 was 49.3% (&#x000a3;507,537). <xref rid="pone.0136211.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> illustrates that the costs of extracted and decayed teeth were much higher in Depcat 7 than in Depcat 1. The gradient in costs of fillings was not prominent. All three cost components analysed (costs of decayed, extracted and filled teeth) decreased over time in each Depcat. The largest decrease, both measured as a percentage of the costs in 1999/00 and in monetary terms, was seen for extracted teeth: for all seven Depcats combined the decrease was &#x000a3;297,124 (55.2%). Substantial decrease in costs was also shown for decayed teeth: &#x000a3;204,155 (43.2%). Although the costs of filled teeth decreased over time, the reduction was not as pronounced: the cumulative decrease across all Depcats was &#x000a3;6,258 (33.8%). It should be noted, that the results of this population standardised analysis by deprivation cannot be compared with the overall Scotland-wide costs / expected savings presented in this paper.

The trend of the mean d<sub>3</sub>mft prior to the start of the nursery toothbrushing programme was flat and then increased over time [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136211.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The explanation is also unlikely to be due to other sources of fluoride: fluoride supplement use in Scotland is not recommended [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and fluoride varnish programs did not commence until 2009 apart from a small pilot area [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The data on the total implementation costs of the nursery toothbrushing programme collected from the Scottish Health Boards showed great variation in terms of both total costs per Health Board and the cost per child. This can be explained by the fact that there is a considerable degree of variation in the ways the toothbrushing intervention is organised and delivered. This is due to many parameters, such as a varying degree of rurality and remoteness of the areas (e.g., urban areas with high population density, large rural areas with dispersed population or small remote islands areas [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]), population density, various geographical sizes, and slightly different ways of organising the toothbrushing training for the nursery staff, overseeing and supporting the delivery of the programme in nurseries. For example, some of the Health Boards employ oral health assistants, other&#x02014;oral health support workers, toothbrushing assistants, oral health educators, dental health support workers, or a combination of these. Some of these positions are of different job bands and Health Boards of different sizes employ different numbers of these staff members. Staff travel costs can also vary considerably depending on the size, rurality and remoteness of the Health Board.</p><p>The results of this study show that the total estimated costs of actual and anticipated dental treatments decreased over time with the costs in 2009/10 being less than half of those in 2001/02, when the nursery toothbrushing program was rolled-out across Scotland. The major components of the total dental treatments cost were the cost of extractions and the anticipated further cost of decayed teeth, as both of these costs were influenced by a high cost of dental extraction under GA. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the &#x02018;high&#x02019; and &#x02018;low&#x02019; GA cost scenarios showed most uncertainty in relation to the amount of expected savings.</p><p>The range of costs of a GA procedure used in this study (i.e. &#x000a3;653.25 in the main cost of tooth extraction calculation, and &#x000a3;393.22 and &#x000a3;1,393.89 in the sensitivity analysis) is comparable with the costs of a dental GA procedure cited in other sources. Namely, in a report by the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU), Great Britain, a child&#x02019;s inpatient stay for dental extraction cost &#x000a3;1,146 [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; a paper comparing dental GA costs per child with the costs of a dental sedation procedure cited hospital based GA costs in the range &#x000a3;195-&#x000a3;616 in 2003 GBP [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]; and in a costing report by the NHS National Institute for Health and Care Excellence the GA costs were &#x000a3;229 and &#x000a3;720 per child [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The population standardised analysis for the hypothetical cohort of 1000 children per Depcat showed that the largest decrease in modelled costs was for the most deprived cohort of children. In 2009/10 the overall cost of treatment in primary teeth in the Depcat 7 cohort was half of the cost in 1999/00 (<xref rid="pone.0136211.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). A successful reduction in the social gradient was demonstrated (in addition, a detailed analysis of improvement in child dental health by deprivation category was reported in our previous paper [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). One could hypothesise that the nursery toothbrushing programme should most affect the more deprived children due to the high baseline dental decay levels in these children, and also because prior to the intervention home toothbrushing was more likely to be carried out on a regular basis within the less deprived families [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136211.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The economic evaluations of caries prevention interventions published to date were in regard to randomised controlled trials, small to medium sized cohort studies [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] or modelling using hypothetical populations [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, in the above mentioned studies toothbrushing was usually one of the components of a complex caries preventive program, rather than a standalone intervention. The authors were not able to find any previously published papers that evaluated the costs and/or cost savings of an extensive nursery or school toothbrushing program. The only two economic analyses found, which related to the use of fluoride toothpaste, were a cost-effectiveness analysis of a postal toothpaste programme in the North West of England [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and a cost-benefit analysis of an oral health promotion project using fluoride toothpaste in Nepal [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The costs reported in these two studies, however, are not directly comparable with the costs of our study. The Davies et al. study involved 6,781 children aged 12 months at the baseline and their intervention was a postal distribution of toothpaste four times a year, hence not comparable to providing a nation-wide daily supervised toothbrushing program in nurseries. Yee et al. evaluated a broader advocacy project to increase the availability and consumption of fluoride toothpaste in the age group 6&#x02013;18 years and their study took place in a developing country, also not directly comparable with the context of this study. Moreover Yee et al. investigated projected caries levels in the permanent dentition, whereas our research analysed historical data on primary teeth caries.</p><p>Davies et al. found that the cost of the four-year postal programme per child was &#x000a3;27.93. A previous paper by the same first author [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] indicated that the children invited to participate in the trial were born in 1993&#x02013;1994. Thus we took 1995 as the cost year for the costs stated in the study. Inflated at a 3% per year rate to our toothbrushing costs data collection year of 2011 this equals &#x000a3;44.82, which means an annual cost of approximately &#x000a3;11.20 (which is &#x000a3;44.82 divided by 4 years). For comparison, the average annual cost per 3&#x02013;4 year old child in the population in our study in 2011/12 was &#x000a3;15.82 with the range by Health Board from &#x000a3;4.76 to &#x000a3;76.88. The highest costs per capita were observed for island Health Boards, such as Orkney, Shetland and Western Isles, due to remoteness, low population density, higher ratio of NHS staff delivering and overseeing the programme to the number of 3&#x02013;4 year old children in the Health Board, and NHS staff travel costs. According to Davies et al., at the end of their study period the difference between mean d<sub>3</sub>mft of children in the control (&#x02018;do nothing&#x02019;) group and that of the intervention group was 0.42 (2.57 vs. 2.15). Over the timeframe of our study, the mean d<sub>3</sub>mft in five-year-olds decreased by 1.03 (from 2.55 in 1999/00 to 1.52 in 2009/10).</p><sec id="sec025"><title>Limitations</title><p>Cost savings were calculated and used as a proxy to represent the opportunity cost associated with freed-up resources due to improved dental health in the absence of data mechanisms to track the alternative use of freed-up appointments. These cost savings and associated health gains however are an underestimate of the full benefit of the programme. Besides the dental health improvements of children receiving the toothbrushing there are additional health benefits arising from dental care received in the now freed-up appointment slots hence future studies could attempt to capture these data.</p><p>A further limitation of this study was the assumption that the cost of the nursery toothbrushing program was constant over time. In reality, the nursery toothbrushing was rolled out Scotland-wide in 2001 and by 2005/06 the average nursery participation rate reached around 80%, further increasing to 95% in 2006/07, and staying at or above this level onwards. Nonetheless, taking in account start-up costs of engaging nurseries to participate in the programme and monitoring-related work in the early years on the programme, we believe that our assumption of a constant cost is accurate. Another limitation was that in the absence of reliable historical data on the numbers of zero to five year old children that had their teeth extracted under GA, we used the numbers of missing teeth per child from the national dental inspections and the assumptions that if a child had one tooth missing it was extracted under LA, and if two or more teeth were missing it was done under GA. The authors made an attempt to investigate GA data from hospital discharge database (provided on request by ISD), however, substantial problems with data quality were discovered, especially for the earlier historical periods [<xref rid="pone.0136211.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], mainly due to under-reporting.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusions</title><p>NHS costs that were associated with actual and anticipated dental treatments for five-year-old children decreased dramatically over time. The findings, based on our assumptions, suggest that within three years the expected cost savings (freed-up resources) outweighed the costs of implementing the toothbrushing program and by eight years the expected cost savings were in excess of two and a half times these costs. These expected resource savings were associated with the national roll-out of the nursery toothbrushing program and an improvement in children&#x02019;s oral health. In economic terms the toothbrushing program therefore represents an example of a preventative spend and a &#x02018;win win&#x02019; scenario of both reduced costs and health gains in child oral health outcomes. A population standardised analysis of hypothetical cohorts of 1000 children per Depcat showed that the largest decrease in costs and associated dental health gain occurred in the cohorts of children within the highest deprivation categories. Thus, a successful reduction across social gradient was demonstrated revealing that the nursery toothbrushing programme not only reduces costs and improves dental health but also reduces health inequalities. Using any decision making criteria for optimal allocation of resources this programme appears to be highly worthwhile.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank NHS staff who conducted dental inspections, education staff, and the inspected children and their parents.
