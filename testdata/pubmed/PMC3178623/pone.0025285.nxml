While it is widely believed that the effects of EE result from the unique combination of different sensory and motor stimuli, it is not known whether and how cortico-cortical interactions are shaped by EE. Since the primary visual cortex (V1) is one of the best characterized targets of EE, we looked for direct cortico-cortical projections impinging on V1, and we identified a direct monosynaptic connection between motor cortex and V1 in the mouse brain. To measure the interactions between these areas under standard and EE rearing conditions, we used simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) in awake, freely moving animals. LFP signals were analyzed by using different methods of linear and nonlinear analysis of time series (cross-correlation, mutual information, phase synchronization). We found that EE decreases the level of coupling between the electrical activities of the two cortical regions with respect to the control group. From a functional point of view, our results indicate, for the first time, that an enhanced sensorimotor experience impacts on the brain by affecting the functional crosstalk between different cortical areas.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The integration of sensory inputs is achieved through the interaction of different cortical areas <xref rid="pone.0025285-Bavelier1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. There is now considerable evidence that primary sensory cortices do not function as independent modules, but appear to functionally interact to provide integration between various modalities. For instance, the primary visual cortex (V1) is known to receive a functional input from primary auditory cortex, as demonstrated by the direct recording of auditory responses in visual cortical neurons <xref rid="pone.0025285-Piche1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Cross modal plasticity is particularly relevant in patients who are deprived of one sensory modality. For instance, early blind people display a higher tactile perceptual ability that depends on functional takeover of cortical visual areas by somatosensory inputs <xref rid="pone.0025285-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These data imply that brain circuits can undergo plastic rearrangements in response to changes induced by experience, such as those caused by pathological deprivation of one sensory modality. Functional integration is not restricted to cortices processing different sensory modalities, but appears to involve also motor areas. Particularly clear evidence of this integration comes from studies based on the experimental protocol of environmental enrichment (EE), which provides animals with an increased motor activity and sensory stimulation <xref rid="pone.0025285-Rosenzweig1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Rosenzweig2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The animals subjected to EE are reared in numerous social groups, in large cages where a variety of objects are present (toys, tunnels, platforms, running wheels, stairs, etc.). This results in a complex sensory stimulation and the opportunity for spatial and cognitive exploration, coupled to voluntary physical activity and social interaction, all factors that are absent in standard laboratory cages <xref rid="pone.0025285-vanPraag1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Many studies have shown that EE promotes molecular, anatomical and functional changes of neural circuits <xref rid="pone.0025285-vanPraag1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Rosenzweig3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Sale1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. At the anatomical level, EE increases neurogenesis, soma size of neurons, dendritic arbor complexity and density of dendritic spines <xref rid="pone.0025285-vanPraag1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Functionally, EE results in an improvement of cognitive capabilities, accompanied by enhancement of markers of synaptic plasticity and transmission <xref rid="pone.0025285-vanPraag1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Sale1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Mainardi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In sensory cortices, EE is able to dramatically affect the development of neuronal functional properties <xref rid="pone.0025285-Sale1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>; for example, the maturation of visual performance is accelerated in the visual cortex of rodents kept in EE since birth <xref rid="pone.0025285-Cancedda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The combination of different sensory and motor stimuli is thought to be critical for the effects of EE; however, the precise way in which EE affects cortico-cortical interactions has not been investigated so far. In particular, motor activity is a very important component of EE <xref rid="pone.0025285-vanPraag1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Remarkably, EE drives the development of the visual system even if the animals are reared in complete darkness since birth <xref rid="pone.0025285-Bartoletti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>These experimental results raise the possibility that inputs from other cortical areas, in particular motor regions, can regulate the development of the primary visual cortex (V1) in the absence of visual stimuli. Therefore, we first looked for an anatomical substrate for communication between motor and visual areas. We identified a monosynaptic projection linking secondary motor cortex (M2) and V1 in the mouse brain. Then, we analyzed simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) from V1 and M2 of awake, freely-moving mice to quantify their synchronization level under standard and EE rearing conditions. To this aim, we used the cross correlation and the mutual information methods, that are typical tools for detecting coupling between complex signals <xref rid="pone.0025285-Abarbanel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Boccaletti1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Kantz1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Kreuz1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Mormann1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Pikovsky1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In addition, we also employed a new method to detect coupling between time series, called Slope Phase Coherence, that we introduce for the first time in this paper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All procedures were performed according to the guidelines of the Italian Ministry of Health for care and maintenance of laboratory animals (law 116/92), and in strict compliance with the European Communities Council Directive n. 86/609/EEC. Animal experimentation at the CNR Neuroscience Institute was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization # 129/2000&#x02212;A).

Pregnant dams were put either in standard or EE condition one week before delivery and pups were hatched at postnatal day (P) 25. The standard rearing condition consisted of a 26 X 18 X 18 cm cage housing 3 animals. The EE condition was achieved using a large cage (44 X 62 X 28 cm) containing several foodhoppers, one running wheel for voluntary physical exercise, and differently shaped objects (tunnels, shelters, stairs) that were repositioned twice a week and completely substituted with others once a week. Moreover, in the EE condition, two to three helper, non-pregnant females were added. For the EEG analyses, a total of 14 mice were used, 6 reared in environmental enrichment and 8 in the standard condition. Electrode implantation (see below) was performed at P60. Another five standard and three enriched animals were used for neuroanatomical tracings.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Neuroanatomical tracing</title><p>To identify cortical areas monosynaptically connected with the primary visual cortex (V1), we used the neuronal tracer Cholera Toxin beta subunit (CTB, Sigma, USA). Mice were mounted on a custom-made stereotaxic apparatus, then a burr hole was drilled in the skull overlying V1. Stereotaxic coordinates corresponding to V1 were 0.0 mm anteroposterior and 2.5 mm mediolateral to the lambda point. To maximize the spatial specificity of the injection, a minute amount (50 nl) of CTB solution (1&#x00025; in water) was injected at a depth of 600 &#x000b5;m. Injection was performed by using a 0.5 &#x000b5;l Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, USA) filled with mineral oil and plugged to a glass injection pipette. After allowing 3 days for transport of CTB to neuronal somata and processes, animals were transcardially perfused with 50 ml of 4&#x00025; PFA, then brains were frozen and cut using a cryostat (Leica, Germany) to obtain 50 &#x000b5;m-thick coronal sections. CTB labeling was visualized by means of immunohistochemistry. Free-floating sections were blocked in 5&#x00025; normal rabbit serum (NRS), 2.5&#x00025; bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.3&#x00025; Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 hrs at RT. Incubation with primary antibody was performed with 1&#x02236;4000 anti-CTB made in goat (Calbiochem, USA), 2&#x00025; NRS, 2.5&#x00025; BSA, 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100 in PBS, overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, sections were transferred in a solution containing 2&#x00025; NRS, 2.5&#x00025; BSA, 1&#x00025; Triton X-100 and 1&#x02236;500 anti-goat biotinilated secondary antibody in PBS, for 2 hrs at RT. This was followed by incubation for 1 h in ABC kit (Vector Labs) and final detection with DAB reaction kit (Vector Labs). Sections were finally mounted on glass slides, dehydrated and sealed with DPX mounting medium (VWR International, UK). Images were acquired using a CCD camera (Zeiss, Germany) mounted on an Axioskop microscope (Zeiss).</p><p>Countings of retrogradely labeled cells in M2 were performed using a CCD camera (MBF Bioscience, Germany) mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop (Zeiss, Germany) microscope and the StereoInvestigator software (MBF Bioscience). For each coronal section comprising M2, the area containing stained cells was outlined and its area measured. Then, the number of CTB-positive cells was counted and their density calculated (cells/mm<sup>2</sup>). The density value for each experimental case was obtained by averaging the data from at least 6 sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Local field potential recordings in freely moving mice</title><p>Local field potential (LFP) recordings were performed in awake, freely moving mice using an adaptation of the protocol described by Antonucci et al. <xref rid="pone.0025285-Antonucci1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Low-impedance recording electrodes made of nichrome wire (120 &#x000b5;m thick) were tin-soldered to a multipin socket to create an array comprising four electrodes; the fifth position of the socket received an insulated copper ground cable. Under avertin anaesthesia (0.01 ml/g) and after placement in a stereotaxic apparatus, the skull was exposed and four burr holes were drilled in the skull at given positions (see below), paying attention not to damage the underlying dural surface. The multipin socket was held by an adjustable manipulator and the electrodes were put in place, establishing an electrical contact without lesioning the dura mater. LFPs were sampled by placing the tips of a couple of electrodes in the same cortical area, spaced by 1.0 mm to achieve detection of local electrical activity confined between the two sites. A ground screw was positioned on the occipital bone and connected with the ground cable, while an additional screw was installed on the frontal bone to provide further strength to the implant. The whole device was secured in place by means of dentistry acrylic cement (Paladur, Pala, Germany). Stereotaxic coordinates were (i) between 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm lateral (L) and 0.0 mm anteroposterior (AP) to lambda for V1; (ii) 0.8 mm L and between &#x02212;0.8 mm and &#x02212;1.8 mm AP to bregma for secondary motor cortex (M2) <xref rid="pone.0025285-Paxinos1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A representation of the positioning of the recording electrodes is given schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025285-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Animals were returned to their home cage and recordings were done after allowing 3 to 5 days for recovery from surgery; the animal was habituated for 1 hr to the test cage, then a 1 hr recording session was performed, using a digital acquisition system. No differences in behavior were detected during LFP recordings between EE and control mice (see below). The hardware was composed of a custom-made buffer to eliminate movement artifact from the signal, an amplifier and an acquisition card (National Instruments, USA), plugged via USB to a personal computer. The custom-made acquisition software was based on the LabView platform (National Instruments). Cortical LFP signals were acquired with a sampling rate of 100 Hz as the differential between the two adjacent electrode sites placed in the same cortical area, 50000X amplified and 0.3&#x02013;30 Hz band-passed.

Because the method employs the amplitudes of the time series, it is extremely important that both recordings are normalized. A suitable choice, that we adopted here, is to normalize both signals to zero mean and unit standard deviation.

To assess if the observed synchronization levels came from chance, randomly shuffled surrogate data were used and the corresponding results are plotted in panel B) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025285-g006">Figure 6</xref>. The surrogate data corresponding to the LFP recording in V1 (M2) were obtained by independent random shuffling the whole time series.

Random shuffling of the data destroys all correlations in the signal and thus the corresponding power spectrum is whitened. Therefore, to preserve the power spectrum of the original signal and to make a more meaningful comparison between the values of the mean cross correlation for the EE and SC conditions, we used different surrogate data. In particular, the values of the mean cross correlation were estimated on the data obtained by shuffling all epochs of the signals, i.e. by selecting randomly the time windows of the LFP recording in V1 and M2. The corresponding results are reported in panel C of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025285-g006">figure 6</xref> and are consistent with those obtained with the random shuffling method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025285-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). With both shuffling methods the differences in the crosscorrelation level between SC and EE animals are erased; moreover, the correlation indices of shuffled data are dramatically decreased with respect to the original LFP time series. The cumulative probability distributions of the two sets <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0025285.e077.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0025285.e078.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> were also estimated and the corresponding results are reported in panel D) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025285-g006">Figure 6</xref>.

Several experiments have shown that exposure to EE has potent ef&#x000ad;fects on neural circuitry in both the developing and adult brain <xref rid="pone.0025285-vanPraag1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Major effects of EE have been found in the hippocampus and sensory cortices <xref rid="pone.0025285-Nithianantharajah1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Will1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, but subcortical structures are affected as well <xref rid="pone.0025285-Mainardi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It is widely held that the effects of EE result from the unique combination of the various stimulating factors (motor, sensory, social and cognitive) that are included in this protocol. However, no previous studies have examined how the interaction between different cortical areas is sculpted by an enriched experience during development. In particular, we focused our attention on the interaction between visual and motor areas, as it has been demonstrated that the effects of EE on the development of V1 are observed even if the animals are kept in complete darkness <xref rid="pone.0025285-Bartoletti1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These data indicate that inputs from other cortical regions, such as motor regions, can represent the substrate of the actions of EE on functional maturation of the visual cortex. In this study, we analyzed LFP recordings in V1 and M2 cortices to understand how the EE condition impacts their functional interaction. The choice of analyzing V1 and M2 cortices was prompted by our anatomical observations, indicating a direct connection between these areas. The motor area containing retrogradely labelled cells after V1 injection (named M2 in the atlas by Paxinos and Franklin <xref rid="pone.0025285-Paxinos1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>) has been identified also in rats (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025285-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> in <xref rid="pone.0025285-Guandalini1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>). Studies in rats suggest that this area may be involved in the control of orienting and exploring behaviors, in addition to the control of eye movements <xref rid="pone.0025285-Guandalini1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and may therefore serve as a hub for integrating visuo-motor activities. Thus, it was of interest to examine whether EE affects functional coupling between V1 and M2. To carry out this analysis, we used independent methods to quantify the degree of linear and nonlinear correlation between the LFPs recorded in the two regions, which was used as a measure of synchronization. It is important to point out that with the word synchronization, we refer to those dynamical states where two or more dynamical systems (in this case, V1 and M2) adjust their properties to share some common behaviour <xref rid="pone.0025285-Boccaletti1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Pikovsky1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. We chose to analyze LFPs, as they represent the collective synaptic activity of neurons in the sampled area. We did not attempt to quantify correlations in firing of individual neurons, as this was thought to be less informative, considering the great number of functionally distinct units in the cortex and their variable cortico-cortical connectivity. The results of our analysis indicate that the EE rearing condition promotes a decrease of the synchronization level between V1 and M2 cortices. In particular, we noted a reduction in the cross-correlation that was maximal over the time window of a few tens of ms, consistent with the time required for monosynaptic communication between V1 and M2. Moreover, the different shapes of the cumulative probability distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025285-g006">Figs. 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025285-g008">8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025285-g010">10C</xref>) between EE and SC mice indicate that EE determines also a decrease in the spread of the values quantifying the interaction level. This situation implies that a low correlation level represents the preferential status of the M2-V1 connection -resulting in a concentration of the values of the interaction indices in a narrow range- in enriched mice. Conversely, in SC animals the higher correlation level is accompanied by a broader range for the different coupling indices.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the relatively low sampling rate, that did not allow us to address the effects of EE in faster (i.e., gamma) frequency bands. However, a decrease of the synchronization level between V1 and M2 cortices in EE animals cannot be accounted for by a shift of the LFP signal out of the recording bandwidth; on the contrary, we found that EE consistently increased the power of the low-frequency delta band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025285-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Another potential concern is that the differences in the LFP analysis are related to a different behavior of EE and standard mice in the recording cage. However, our quantitative analysis showed that the exploratory activity during LFP recordings of enriched mice does not significantly differ from standard animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025285-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, these observations strongly suggest that the differences in LFP synchronization reflect long-lasting, EE-induced changes in cortical circuitry, rather than an acute response to the recording cage.</p><p>A decrease of cortical synchronization in EE animals is consistent with recent results reported by Poulet and Petersen <xref rid="pone.0025285-Poulet1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. State-dependent membrane potential synchrony was observed between neurons of the barrel cortex of behaving mice. In particular, high correlation values were observed during quiet whisking period and reduced values during active whisking states <xref rid="pone.0025285-Poulet1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Moreover this effect was observed in the low frequency range (&#x0003c;40 Hz, which is analogous to our LFP sampling range). These data imply that the local activity of small groups of neurons shows a high synchronization with the global brain activity (as measured with the electroencephalogram) as long as they are not engaged in their specific physiological role (e.g. receiving somatosensory signals), during which they otherwise display their own functional identity and a lower correlation with the electroen-cephalogram. In our case, the increased motor and sensory stimulation provided by EE could result in a sustained level of specific activity of the neuronal populations serving a given sensory modality or motor function, which would be responsible, in turn, for a lower degree of correlation between the local field potentials. A lower degree of correlation between V1 and M2 can also be explained by the finding that EE causes a net reduction of GABAergic inhibition in V1 <xref rid="pone.0025285-Sale1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025285-Mainardi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Indeed, under conditions of reduced inhibition, local activities in V1 and M2 could fluctuate with lower correlation level.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide for the first time evidence that an enhanced sensorimotor experience shapes the brain by affecting the functional crosstalk between different cortical areas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0025285.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
