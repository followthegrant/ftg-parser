Although microsurgical tumor resection is the treatment of choice for symptomatic meningiomas, gross total resection of meningiomas is not always possible due to various conditions such as tumor size, location, adjacent neurovascular structures, or the patient&#x02019;s medical status. Radiation therapy is used as a treatment for meningiomas when the remnant tumor is present after surgery or when surgical resection is not an option [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Radiotherapy for meningioma is accepted as a safe treatment modality. Approximately 5% to 40% of patients experience treatment-related complications [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It was reported that symptomatic brain edema occurs in 37.5% of patients with parasagittal meningiomas after gamma knife radiosurgery [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Previously, several risk factors associated with peritumoral brain edema (PTBE) after radiosurgery in meningioma were reported. These include greater radiation dose, greater tumor size or volume, tumor location, brain-tumor interface, no prior resection for meningioma, and presence of pretreatment edema [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Disruption of the tumor-brain barrier in meningioma plays a critical role in the development of PTBE [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A previous study regarding microscopic anatomy of the brain&#x02013;meningioma interface reported the presence of arachnoid trabeculae at the brain&#x02013;meningioma contact interface [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We previously demonstrated a close correlation between bone mineral density (BMD) and Hounsfield unit (HU) values [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, we suggested that systemic osteoporosis is negatively associated with the integrity of arachnoid trabeculae as both the bone and the arachnoid trabeculae are composed of type 1 collagen [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We hypothesized that osteoporotic conditions may be associated with PTBE after radiation in intracranial meningioma patients. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies describing the possible relationship between osteoporotic conditions and PTBE after radiotherapy in meningioma which have been published [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we measured HU values in the frontal bone from simulation brain computed tomography (CT) of patients who underwent linear accelerator (LINAC)-based radiation treatment for intracranial meningioma in our hospital. We evaluated other predictive risk factors for PTBE in meningioma after radiation treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study patients</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hanyang University Medical Center, Korea, and conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Owing to the retrospective nature of the study, the need for informed consent was waived. All patient records were anonymized prior to analysis.</p><p>We retrospectively extracted data for all consecutive patients who were diagnosed with intracranial meningioma and received LINAC-based radiation treatment for the first time from the database of our hospital&#x02019;s NOVALIS registry, from July 7, 2014 to July 31, 2019. The registry has been designed for prospective research since July 7, 2014. Demographic patient information, prescribed radiation dose, and fractionation data were extracted from the NOVALIS registry.</p><p>All intracranial meningiomas were diagnosed by radiologic findings or histological confirmation following resection. All radiologic findings were confirmed by experienced neuro-radiologists. We only included patients with meningioma who underwent at least one follow-up imaging (CT/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) after LINAC-based radiation treatment in order to assess the occurrence of PTBE. The last imaging follow-up period after treatment was investigated in all study patients. PTBE was defined as the radiological confirmation of newly developed PTBE or the progression of preexisting PTBE after radiation treatment with newly developed neurological deficits. All patients had no preexisting PTBE among the patients who did not underwent surgery for meningioma before radiation treatment. Two patients were excluded due to no measurable cancellous bone of the frontal skull on brain CT.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Radiation technique</title><p>All patients were treated using the NOVALIS Tx system (Varian Medical Systems, CA, USA; Brainlab, Feldkirchen, Germany) in our hospital. A noninvasive thermoplastic mask was used to perform simulation-computed tomography (CT) for radiation treatment. The Novalis ExacTrac image system and robotic couch of the NOVALIS Tx system allowed us to adjust the patients&#x02019; positions according to the information from the real-time image acquisition. Patients were treated with a 6 MV LINAC-based radiation treatment within 1 week from the day when the CT simulation was performed.</p><p>Gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the contrast-enhanced area on T1-weighted MRI images. In surgery patients, the GTV was defined as the postoperative resection cavity and the area of residual tumor in cases of subtotal resection. The clinical target volume (CTV) was identical to the GTV. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as a symmetrical 0 to 2-mm expansion from the CTV. In case the tumor was located near an organ at risk, we adjusted the PTV with no expansion in the area of the tumor that was close to the organ at risk. The iPlan (Brainlab, Feldkirchen, Germany) and Eclipse (Varian, CA, USA) that are 3D treatment/planning systems of the NOVALIS Tx, were used for radiation planning using MRI/CT-fusion images in all intracranial meningioma patients. The 3D treatment/planning system automatically calculated the GTV, CTV, and PTV in all treated patients. We attempted to achieve tight conformality of the treatment isodose to the 3D reconstructed meningioma geometry.</p><p>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was defined as a single session treatment, hypofractionated SRS (hf-SRS) as 2 to 5 fractions, hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (hFSRT) as 6 to 10 fractions, and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) as doses delivered in &#x0003e;10 sessions (1.8&#x02013;2.0&#x02009;Gy/fraction) [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The biologically equivalent dose (BED) for the tumor was calculated according to the following equation: BED = nd &#x000d7; (1 + d/3), where n is the number of fractions, d is the dose per fraction, and &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; = 3 [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Measurement of frontal skull HU</title><p>Simulation-CT images (Philips Brilliance Big Bore CT Simulators) for radiation planning were used to measure the frontal skull HU values in all study patients. A previous study reported that variations in HU values across five CT scanners were in the range of 0&#x02013;20 HU [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We previously demonstrated detailed methods for measuring HU values at each of four lines on the frontal cancellous bone.

The PACS automatically calculated the maximum, minimum, and mean HU values according to the values on the drawn line.

Older age showed a marginal independent association with PTBE occurrence after radiation. The possible low BMD group (mean skull HU &#x02264;630.6) had an approximate 7.0 to 9.0-fold increased risk of PTBE after adjusting for other predictive factors including age. To our knowledge, this study is the first to suggest that BMD is associated with PTBE after radiation treatment in patients with intracranial meningioma.</p><p>It is well accepted that the tumor-brain barrier disruption may be an essential component of PTBE formation [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Glioblastoma and metastatic tumors usually induce PTBE. However, in contrast to glioblastomas and metastases, meningiomas are encapsulated and are separated from the underlying normal cerebral cortex by the arachnoid membrane and pia mater. The arachnoid membrane is impermeable to fluids due to its&#x02019; tight intercellular junctions [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is thought that the arachnoid membrane may act as a mechanical and biochemical buffer against mediators released from a meningioma [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is probable that the arachnoid membrane blocks the spread of edema-associated proteins such as endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor and vasogenic edema fluids from meningiomas from the peritumoral brain tissue [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A previous study that examined the microscopic anatomy of the brain-meningioma interface, also reported that the degree of arachnoid disruption correlated with the presence of perifocal edema [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, a microscopic examination of the brain-meningioma interface revealed proliferation of hyperplastic arachnoid trabeculae, (below the arachnoid membrane at the brain&#x02013;meningioma interface) in the meningioma with a thin connective capsule (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226312.g001">Fig 1A</xref> of the study) [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. After the study, it was reported that the arachnoid trabeculae and granulations are composed of type 1 collagen [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The arachnoid is composed of two layers. An outer part of the arachnoid is the arachnoid barrier layer and is an actual membrane cover. An inner part is the arachnoid trabeculae maintaining the stability of the subarachnoid space and cerebrospinal fluid flow to support the arachnoid barrier layer [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Arachnoid cap cells are believed to be of meningioma cell origin [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible to postulate that meningioma from arachnoid cap cells may naturally push the arachnoid trabeculae into the pia mater [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As the tumor grows, it could also be assumed that arachnoid trabeculae may be sandwiched between the pia mater and meningioma. This may form part of the tumor-brain contact interface. Compression due to the growth of a tumor on adjacent venous structures, leptomeninges, and the cerebral cortex may lead to an increase in hydrostatic pressure [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>It is well documented that type 1 collagen is a major component of bone. Osteoporosis is a systemic disease that affects systemic bone mass and microarchitecture throughout the body. We previously reported the close association between mean frontal skull HU and BMD [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We also demonstrated that systemic osteoporosis may negatively affect the integrity of arachnoid trabeculae and granulations because bone, arachnoid trabeculae, and granulations are all composed of type 1 collagen [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Supporting our hypothesis, osteogenesis imperfecta, that is caused by mutations in type 1 procollagen genes (<italic>COL1A1/COL1A2</italic>), is associated with communicating hydrocephalus [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We believe that trabeculae, which are sandwiched between the pia mater and meningioma, may be more impaired and weakened in osteoporotic patients when compared to healthy patients.</p><p>Previous studies described that irradiation affects collagen structure and can lead to collagen changes and damage [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. When the meningioma is not treated with surgery or radiation therapy, tumor growth is the primary cause of damage to the tumor-brain contact interface including the arachnoid trabeculae. After radiation, this contact interface may be damaged by radiation activities [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Based on the above findings and assumptions, we propose the following hypothetical mechanism as an explanation for the association between possible low BMD, large tumor volume, and PTBE after radiation for intracranial meningioma. As tumor grows, the tumor may push more of the arachnoid trabeculae into the pia mater and cause damage to the tumor-brain contact interface. The larger the tumor, the greater the likelihood of damage to the tumor-brain contact interface including the arachnoid trabeculae. The damage to the arachnoid trabeculae due to compression by the tumor will be more severe in osteoporotic patients. Radiation may aggravate the damaged tumor-brain contact interface including the arachnoid trabeculae and may lead to tumor-brain barrier disruption. We hypothesized that the more damaged the arachnoid trabeculae are at the tumor-brain interface due to low BMD and large tumor volume, the higher the possibility will be of tumor-brain barrier disruption after radiation therapy. Tumor-brain barrier disruption may result in PTBE formation in meningioma patients after radiation.</p><p>Loosening of the microstructure network and the volume reduction of aging white matter may increase the possibility of PTBE. This allows direct transmission of edematous fluids into the white matter [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We believe that thorough precautions are required with older patients with osteoporosis and large tumor volume, after radiation therapy for intracranial meningioma. We also found that BED was not associated with PTBE occurrence in our study. We propose that this was because we did not use extremely high radiation doses and the narrow BED range may not have resulted in significant differences in PTBE occurrence [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We believe that the status of the brain-meningioma contact interface, including the arachnoid trabeculae, is a more important factor than the radiation dosage in predicting PTBE occurrence after radiation for meningioma. Although it falls short of significance, multi-fraction seems to be important for prevention of PTBE after radiation for meningioma.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, due to the retrospective nature of the study, the length of follow-ups and the number of follow-up images varied widely. Second, HU measurement errors may have occurred. However, all brain CT images were magnified for HU measurement to reduce errors. We excluded patients with no measurable cancellous bone of the frontal skull in the simulation brain CT. To reduce measurement errors, we estimated mean HU values in four areas of the frontal skull and averaged them. Third, although HU values are correlated with BMD, HU values may not reflect the exact BMD values. Fourth, heterogeneity in tumor location and absence of histological confirmation in many cases may affect the results of the study. Fifth, several previously reported risk factors for PTBE after radiosurgery for meningioma were not included for the study. These include adjacency to vein or sinus, tight vs smooth brain-tumor interface, plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, or a few others [<xref rid="pone.0226312.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Lastly, the small number of cases may have reduced the statistical power and validation. In addition, our single-center study may be limited in its broad applicability. A further multi-center study with a larger sample size would be required to validate our results.</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests that possible osteoporotic conditions, large tumor volume, and older age may be associated with PTBE occurrence after LINAC-based radiation treatment for intracranial meningioma. We believe that these findings may be helpful for predicting PTBE occurrence during the clinical course of meningioma after radiation. In the future, we anticipate that the findings of this study may enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of PTBE after radiation in meningioma patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226312.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Scatterplot with linear regression line showing the association between age and mean frontal skull HU values.</title><p>HU = Hounsfield unit.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226312.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226312.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses for the development of peritumoral brain edema in patients with intracranial meningioma after LINAC-based radiation treatment based on predictive variables (adjusted for age as continuous variable).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226312.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0226312.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses for the development of peritumoral brain edema in patients with intracranial meningioma after LINAC-based radiation treatment based on predictive variables (adjusted for age as continuous variable and past medical history).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0226312.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0226312.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Whittle</surname><given-names>IR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Navoo</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Collie</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>. <article-title>Meningiomas</article-title>. <source>The Lancet</source>. <year>2004</year>;<volume>363</volume>: <fpage>1535</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>1543</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16153-9</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0226312.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Pinzi</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bisogno</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Prada</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ciusani</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fariselli</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>. <article-title>Radiotherapy of meningioma: a treatment in need of radiobiological research</article-title>. <source>International Journal of Radiation Biology</source>. <year>2018</year>;<volume>94</volume>: <fpage>621</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>627</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/09553002.2018.1478157</pub-id>

They present several factors correlated to the development of peri-tumoral brain edema (PTBE) after radiation. Their study finds a significant and independent association of low frontal skull hounsfeld units (HU) to the development of PTBE in addition to well known factors such as tumor volume. The association of frontal skull HU is a novel finding and to my knowledge, not previously reported or studied in the literature.</p><p>I request the following edits and clarifications:</p><p>Title:</p><p>1) The title is generic and indistinguishable from many other articles on this topic, and if frontal skull HU is a significant finding, then I suggest making the title more specific. One possible title is "Significance of skull osteoporosis to the development of peritumoral brain edema after LINAC-based radiation treatment in patients with intracranial meningioma" - however, I leave this at the author's discretion.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>Ok. No additional comments.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>A major review of the topic of radiation induced edmea was published by Milano et al in 2018 in IJROBP (Pubmed ID 29726362). It may be helpful to cite this review and discuss the features identified in this review article that were significant for PTBE and how frontal bone HU was not previously reported as a relevant factor in this and other reviews.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Study Patients: ok</p><p>Radiation Technique:</p><p>I am not sure that the alpha/beta ratio of 10 for calculating BED for meningiomas and for estimating toxicity is accurate in this paper. For instance, it is known that meningioma, being a benign tumor, has an alpha/beta ratio of closer to 3.7 (Pubmed ID 20470198) Furthermore, this study relates to the effects of radiation on normal brain tissue since the endpoint is edema. Normal CNS tissue is thought to have an alpha/beta ratio of close to 2 (pubmed ID 3891621 among others) although using a value of 3 is also acceptable. I believe the BED estimates in this paper need to be re-calculated with these more appropriate values (select 2 or 3 for normal brain, and select 3 or 3.7 for meningioma). As an example of a paper that used alpha/beta=3, see Pubmed ID 18812954.</p><p>Measurement of frontal skull HU:</p><p>1) As the mean HU value is acquired from PACS, the PACS software name and version should be reported in the methods of the paper.</p><p>Statistics: OK</p><p>Results:</p><p>Characteristics of study patients: OK.</p><p>Mean frontal skull HU values: OK.</p><p>Determination of optimal cut off values: OK.</p><p>Cumulative hazard: OK, but see figure 3 comment below.</p><p>Independent predictive factors: Ok.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>Previously reported risk factors for PTBE have included tumor location, marginal dose, adjacency to vein or sinus, tight vs smooth brain-tumor interface, and a few others per review in Pubmed ID 29726362. Although this was not the focus of the paper, can you hypothesize why your paper identified your factors and not others as contributing to PTBE?</p><p>Tables:</p><p>Table 1: OK</p><p>Table 2: OK</p><p>Figures:</p><p>Figure 1: Ok.</p><p>Figure 2: Ok.</p><p>Figure 3: All of the cumulative hazard graphs have different ranges (roughly between 0.5 and 0.8). Please have the cumulative hazard graphs all have a scale of 0 to 1.0 for more reasonable visual comparison.</p><p>Figure 4: The cumulative hazard appears to go above 1.0 in the risk factor group. Please explain as there may be an error in the analysis that results in &#x0003e;100% of lesions in this group having an event.</p><p>Supplement figures and tables: Ok.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

Please find the revised text below:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>It was reported that symptomatic brain edema occurs in 37.5% of patients with parasagittal meningiomas after gamma knife radiosurgery [4]. Previously, several risk factors associated with peritumoral brain edema (PTBE) after radiosurgery in meningioma were reported. These include greater radiation dose, greater tumor size or volume, tumor location, brain-tumor interface, no prior resection for meningioma, and presence of pretreatment edema [5]. </p><p>We hypothesized that osteoporotic conditions may be associated with PTBE after radiation in intracranial meningioma patients. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies describing the possible relationship between osteoporotic conditions and PTBE after radiotherapy in meningioma which have been published [5].</p><p>3. Methods:</p><p>Study Patients: ok</p><p>Radiation Technique:</p><p>I am not sure that the alpha/beta ratio of 10 for calculating BED for meningiomas and for estimating toxicity is accurate in this paper.

cc to be independent predictors of PTBE after radiation treatment in patients with meningioma (hazard ratio, 8.418.38; P=0.0190.021; hazard ratio, 5.925.78; P=0.0320.034, respectively). In addition, patients who were &#x02265;65 years showed a marginally significant association with PTBE.</p><p>Methods </p><p>Radiation technique</p><p>The biologically equivalent dose (BED) for the tumor was calculated according to the following equation: BED = nd &#x000d7; (1 + d/10), where n is the number of fractions, d is the dose per fraction, and &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;=310 [12].</p><p>Results</p><p>Characteristics of study patients </p><p>The mean GTV and BED were 8.4 cc and 90.848.8 Gy, respectively.</p><p>Determination of the optimal cut-off values of predictive factors for PTBE after radiation</p><p>However, BED did not show statistical significance in the ROC analysis (P=0.9200.335), (Fig. 2D). </p><p>Independent predictive factors for PTBE after radiation in meningioma patients</p><p>The multivariate Cox regression analysis identified a mean frontal skull HU &#x02264;630.625 and GTV &#x0003e;7.194 cc as independent predictors of PTBE after LINAC-based radiation treatment in intracranial meningioma patients (HR, 8.418.38; 95% CI, 1.42&#x02013;49.831.38&#x02013;50.73; P=0.0190.021; HR, 5.925.78; 95% CI, 1.16&#x02013;30.191.14&#x02013;29.39; P=0.0320.034, respectively); (Table 3). Patients who were &#x02265;65 years showed a marginal statistically significant association with PTBE occurrence after full adjustment (HR, 5.125.20; 95% CI, 0.99&#x02013;26.651.00&#x02013;27.13; P=0.0520.050).</p><p>We further performed additional multivariate Cox regression with the adjustment for age as a continuous variable in the S1 Table. The results showed that the mean frontal skull HU &#x02264;630.625 was maintained as an independent predictor of PTBE (HR, 7.046.99; 95% CI, 1.16&#x02013;42.851.12&#x02013;43.60; P=0.0340.037). When we adjusted for the past medical history, mean frontal skull HU &#x02264;630.625 showed a strong association with PTBE in the study patients (S2 Table).</p><p>4. Measurement of frontal skull HU:</p><p>1) As the mean HU value is acquired from PACS, the PACS software name and version should be reported in the methods of the paper.</p><p>We added a relevant sentence in the Methods section as per your suggestion. The revised text is as follows:</p><p>Methods </p><p>Measurement of frontal skull HU</p><p>The HU value of the frontal cancellous bone was measured using the &#x0201c;Linear histogram graph&#x0201d; function in the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) (PiViewSTAR version 5.0, INFINITT Healthcare, Seoul, Korea).</p><p>5. Discussion:</p><p>Previously reported risk factors for PTBE have included tumor location, marginal dose, adjacency to vein or sinus, tight vs smooth brain-tumor interface, and a few others per review in Pubmed ID 29726362. Although this was not the focus of the paper, can you hypothesize why your paper identified your factors and not others as contributing to PTBE?</p><p>We appreciate your comment. We previously described the limitation regarding heterogeneity in tumor location due to small sample size in the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Fourth, heterogeneity in tumor location and absence of histological confirmation in many cases may affect the results of the study.</p><p>Although short of achieving statistical significance, Table 3 shows a tendency towards higher PTBE occurrence in the convexity meningioma as compared to meningiomas in other locations.</p><p>Table 3.</p><p>Location </p><p>Convexity 2.41 (0.74&#x02013;7.88) 0.145 1.90 (0.52&#x02013;7.02) 1.96 (0.53&#x02013;7.23) 0.333 0.310</p><p>Other regions Reference Reference </p><p>However, we agree that the hypothesis of our study requires validation in a larger cohort with consideration to tumor location. In addition, marginal radiation dose was not a risk factor for PTBE after radiation in meningioma in the study. We also previously discussed a possible reason in the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>Discussion</p><p>We also found that BED was not associated with PTBE occurrence in our study. We propose that this was because we did not use extremely high radiation doses and the narrow BED range may not have resulted in significant differences in PTBE occurrence [3]. We believe that the status of the brain-meningioma contact interface, including the arachnoid trabeculae, is a more important factor than the radiation dosage in predicting PTBE occurrence after radiation for meningioma.</p><p>Other reported risk factors were not included for the study. Therefore, we added a relevant sentence and cited a review article (Pubmed ID 29726362) in the limitations section of the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Fourth, heterogeneity in tumor location and absence of histological confirmation in many cases may affect the results of the study. Fifth, several previously reported risk factors for PTBE after radiosurgery for meningioma were not included for the study. These include adjacency to vein or sinus, tight vs smooth brain-tumor interface, plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, or a few others [5]. </p><p>6. Figures:</p><p>Figure 3: All of the cumulative hazard graphs have different ranges (roughly between 0.5 and 0.8). Please have the cumulative hazard graphs all have a scale of 0 to 1.0 for more reasonable visual comparison.</p><p>We agree with your comment. We have adjusted the scale of the y-axes to be (0.0 to 1.0) of the Figure 3 as follows:</p><p>Figure 3.</p><p>7. Figure 4: The cumulative hazard appears to go above 1.0 in the risk factor group. Please explain as there may be an error in the analysis that results in &#x0003e;100% of lesions in this group having an event.</p><p>We appreciate your comment. However, it is known that the cumulative hazard can go above 1.0 according to previous studies [1&#x02013;3].</p><p>1. Bybee KA, Lee JH, O&#x02019;Keefe JH.
