At present, the best method to measure ASL depth involves scanning confocal microscopy after staining with an aqueous-phase fluorescent dye. We describe here a simple, noninvasive imaging method to measure ASL depth by reflectance imaging of an epithelial mucosa in which the surface is illuminated at a 45-degree angle by an elongated 13-&#x000b5;m wide rectangular beam produced by a 670-nm micro-focus laser. The principle of the method is that air&#x02013;liquid, liquid&#x02013;liquid, and liquid&#x02013;cell interfaces produce distinct specular or diffuse reflections that can be imaged to give a micron-resolution replica of the mucosal surface. The method was validated using fluid layers of specified thicknesses and applied to measure ASL depth in cell cultures and ex vivo fragments of pig trachea. In addition, the method was adapted to measure transepithelial fluid transport from the dynamics of fluid layer depth. Compared with confocal imaging, ASL depth measurement by surface laser reflectance microscopy does not require dye staining or costly instrumentation, and can potentially be adapted for in vivo measurements using fiberoptics.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The airway surface liquid (ASL) is the thin layer of aqueous fluid and mucus covering the airway surface at the interface between surface epithelial cells and the air space. The properties of the ASL, including its thickness (&#x0201c;depth&#x0201d;), composition, and rheology, facilitate mucociliary clearance, bacterial killing, and epithelial cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blouquit-Laye and Chinet, 2007</xref>). Alterations in ASL depth likely contribute to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Verkman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boucher, 2007</xref>) and perhaps to asthma and other pulmonary diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boucher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Nakagami et al., 2008</xref>). Because of its importance in mucociliary clearance and consequent pathogenic bacterial colonization in CF, ASL depth has been proposed as a potential outcome measure for ion channel&#x02013;targeted CF therapies, such as correctors of mutant CFTRs and inhibitors of epithelial sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Thelin and Boucher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kreindler, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Measurement of ASL depth is technically challenging because it can be as low as 5&#x02013;15 &#x000b5;m. Various methods have been used to estimate ASL depth, including electron microscopy of fixed frozen tissues or cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Yager et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wu et al., 1996</xref>), microelectrode scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Rahmoune and Shephard, 1995</xref>), and z-scanning confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jayaraman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Tarran et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Song et al., 2009</xref>). Confocal fluorescence microscopy is at present probably the most reliable method to measure ASL depth. The ASL is stained with an aqueous-phase fluorescent dye, then generally covered with oil (to prevent evaporation), and imaged by z-scanning confocal microscopy to reconstruct ASL depth profiles. Until recently, ASL depth measurements were done exclusively on airway cell cultures in which scanning is done with an immersion objective lens through a transparent porous filter supporting the epithelial cell layer. We recently introduced a modification of the scanning confocal microscopy method in which scanning is done from the mucosal side using an upright confocal microscope and water-immersion objective lens immersed in refractive index-matched perfluorocarbon covering the fluorescently stained ASL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Song et al., 2009</xref>). In that study, we also introduced an analysis method for quantitative computation of z-depths based on the z-point spread function of the microscope objective, using information from the entire image stack. Scanning from the mucosal side also allowed ASL depth measurements to be made in ex vivo airway tissue fragments.</p><p>Technical limitations of ASL depth measurement by scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy include the need to stain the ASL by dyes and to cover the aqueous ASL with nonaqueous fluid, such as oil or perfluorocarbon. Also, the acquisition of many z-scans for image reconstruction precludes measurement of rapid changes in ASL depth. ASL depth measurement by confocal microscopy requires costly instrumentation and custom cell chambers, so that at present ASL depth measurements are made in only a few laboratories worldwide. Finally, it is not practical to adapt scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy for ASL studies in vivo.</p><p>To address these limitations, we introduce here a surface laser reflectance microscopy (SLRM) method to measure ASL depth. As diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 (A and B)</xref>, the SLRM method relies on reflections of laser light from interfaces in the unstained mucosa, including the air&#x02013;ASL interface and the ASL&#x02013;cell interface. The largely specular reflection from the air&#x02013;ASL interface and the largely diffuse reflection from the ASL&#x02013;cell interface are imaged to reconstruct a replica of the mucosal surface. The method is implemented herein, validated in test systems, and applied to measure ASL depth and transepithelial fluid transport.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Principle and instrumentation for ASL depth measurement by SLRM.

As diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, light reflection from a surface interface is specular or diffuse depending on the nature of the surface. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> shows that air&#x02013;liquid and liquid&#x02013;cell interfaces each reflect a portion of the incident light. The proportion of light that is reflected versus refracted depends on the angle of incident light and media refractive indices. Reflections from interfaces at different depths (z) are displaced with respect to each other, allowing computation of the absolute distance between interfaces.</p><p>To create appropriate reflections and measure the resultant displacements, an apparatus was assembled based on imaging of a sample that was illuminated by a narrow, line-shaped beam (13-&#x000b5;m wide and 10-mm long) produced by a 660-nm micro-focus laser diode held at a 45-degree angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). A line-shaped laser beam rather than single laser spot was used to image reflections across the length of the line, allowing visualization of multiple reflection displacement points and hence the reconstruction of a replica-like ASL profile. A line-shape beam profile is also less susceptible to noise from stray reflections or scattering within fluid layers. To measure ASL thickness in biological specimens, cell culture inserts or tissue fragments were placed in a custom-built perfusion chamber on an xyz stage, which allowed fine adjustment of laser line focus and movement of the beam across the sample. Reflected light was captured and focused using a stereozoom microscope tilted at an angle of 45 degrees and imaged using a digital camera. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref> shows an example of an image from a cover glass showing laser line reflections coming from the top and bottom of the cover glass (labeled <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>).

SLRM does not require scanning confocal microscopy, using instead a simple, inexpensive optical system consisting of a line laser source, focusing optics, and camera detector. Validation studies indicated micron-resolution accuracy for measurement of fluid layer thickness. SLRM was applied in well-differentiated bronchial epithelial cell cultures and intact ex vivo airway fragments for measurement of absolute ASL depth and changes in ASL depth in response to active fluid absorption/secretion and imposed osmotic gradients. The simplicity of the SLRM method should allow its wide use for studies of ASL regulation, as well as investigation of the utility of ASL depth measurement as a surrogate endpoint to evaluate ion channel&#x02013;targeted CF therapies.</p><p>The technical requirements for ASL depth measurement by SLRM include precise spatial localization of laser reflections and imaging of both specular and diffuse interfacial reflections. Spatial localization was afforded by the use of a micro-focus diode laser, which produced a narrow line of 13-&#x000b5;m width. The narrow beam profile and sharp edge, with 25&#x02013;75% intensity change over 300 nm, afforded submicron spatial resolution. Also, the elongated beam profile allowed imaging of ASL in the illuminated region from a single image acquired in &#x0003c;500 ms, thereby allowing detection of rapid changes in ASL and cell thicknesses. Imaging of specular and diffuse interfacial reflections was afforded by using an objective lens with broad depth of focus, as used in inexpensive dissecting microscopes.</p><p>There are several limitations of SLRM as currently configured. The micro-focus laser used here is well-suited for measurement of fluid layer thicknesses of tens of microns, as the line width remains small (13&#x02013;20 &#x000b5;m) over these distances. However, due to the focusing optics in the laser, there is a distance dependence (depth of field) of the line width that results in substantially larger line widths at distances &#x0003e;100 &#x000b5;m away from the focal plane, which limits the resolution in measuring thick (&#x0003e;50-&#x000b5;m) fluid layers. Use of alternative laser focusing methods or stage z-repositioning would allow accurate micron-resolution measurement of greater fluid layer thicknesses. Another optical issue is the meniscus effect caused by nonaqueous fluids above the ASL, such as perfluorocarbon, as sometimes used to prevent ASL evaporation and as an immersion fluid for an objective lens in confocal microscopy. The meniscus effect at the edges causes spherical aberration of the incident laser light and consequent blurring at the line edge, which, in the current optical configuration, prevents accurate fluid thickness measurements across the whole width of the cell monolayer. Last, the use of standard cell culture inserts, without additional optics such as mirrors or prisms, precludes shallow illumination angles because of the height of side walls.</p><p>In addition to the general optical limitations, there are some specific issues related to measuring ASL in cell monolayers. First, the scattering/reflective properties of turbid media such as the ASL confers diffuse laser light reflections from the air&#x02013;liquid interface, instead of the largely specular reflections in simple fluid layers such as saline or oil. Also, the scattering properties of single-cell monolayers, cultured on inserts, make it difficult to distinguish between reflections from the surface of cells and the underlying membrane. These issues are of lesser concern in measurements in tissues, such as ex vivo tracheal fragments, as the reflections arising from the mucosal surface are quite distinct and easily resolvable. The ASL boundary was also occasionally blurred due to movement of cilia. Last, although our interface detection algorithm using a simple Gaussian regression gave consistent results that were validated empirically, improved resolution might be afforded by the use of more sophisticated boundary edge detection algorithms.</p><p>SLRM was applied to measure ASL depth in well-differentiated HBE cell cultures grown at an air&#x02013;liquid interface, as studied in many prior reports. The measurements were made initially using a standard protocol for measuring ASL depth involving washing of the mucosal surface, the addition of buffer containing dye, and measuring ASL depth after multi-hour incubation to achieve a stable, steady-state ASL depth. The ASL depth measured using SLRM agreed well with that measured in parallel by confocal z-scanning microscopy. ASL depth was also measured by SLRM in the studies here without perturbation of the ASL by washing or fluid additions. In contrast to the quite homogenous ASL depth found using the standard washing equilibration protocol, the ASL depth in unperturbed cultures was heterogeneous across the surface of the cells, varying by as much as 10 &#x000b5;m. The ASL consists of two distinct layers: a mucus layer overlying a liquid periciliary or &#x0201c;sol&#x0201d; layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lucas and Douglas, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yoneda, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lillehoj and Kim, 2002</xref>). Measurements of ASL depth by SLRM or confocal microscopy do not distinguish between these two layers. This uncertainty is generally avoided in studies of ASL depth regulation by removing the mucus layer and allowing a largely liquid layer to develop on the mucosal surface. Differences in the effects of ion channel inhibitors/activators such as amiloride have been previously suggested to be due to variability in cell culture preparation and ASL staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Tarran et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Song et al., 2009</xref>). The increased ASL depth in native unperturbed ASL found here is likely due to the presence of a heterogenous mucus layer. It should be noted that the cultures of HBE cells used here were well differentiated with relatively low mucus secretion. It may be informative to measure ASL depth by SLRM in cultures more representative of the composition of the native airway mucosa that include mucus-secreting goblet cells. Interestingly, prior studies have shown important regulatory effects of the mucus on dynamics of ASL regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lillehoj and Kim, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Tarran, 2004</xref>), and, given recent data suggesting an important but as yet undefined role for CFTR in mucus production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Garcia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), this topic warrants further investigation.</p><p>In addition to experiments in cell culture, the SLRM method was used to measure ASL depth in intact ex vivo fragments of pig trachea. The SLRM method worked well in these experiments, giving easily distinguishable interface edges. SLRM allowed mapping of the surface contours of the mucosa, which allows more accurate determination of ASL depth across the whole surface area. Another advantage of SLRM over existing methods is the ability to rapidly measure dynamic changes in ASL depth, as can occur during agonist- and osmotic-driven transepithelial absorption and secretion.</p><p>The SLRM method developed here has some similarities to Brewster angle microscopy as used in materials science to investigate ultrathin films (&#x0003c;10 nm) on air&#x02013;water interfaces or on dielectric substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Winsel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">McGillivray et al., 2009</xref>). In Brewster angle microscopy, there is no reflectance for an air&#x02013;water interface or dielectric substrate for vertically linearly polarized light at the Brewster angle of incidence. Overlying thin film layers can be distinguished by small increases in reflectance caused by the change of refractive index. This method is particularly good at distinguishing lipid/surfactant layers above homogenous fluid&#x02013;solid interfaces with high resolution; however, the underlying fluid layer is invisible. The SLRM method represents an adaptation of this basic principle (albeit at much lower resolution) in which the nonpolarized reflections from layers of different refractive indices are imaged. Other methods for visualizing thin layers include interferometry with incident light of various wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ghim and Kim, 2006</xref>). Interferometry methods have nanometer resolution but are not useful in measuring micron-thick fluid layers such as the ASL, and would be overly sensitive to the airway cell surface irregularities and airway ciliary movement. A recent high-resolution method to image airways in vivo and in vitro is anatomical optical coherence tomography (aOCT). This method is able to resolve airway structure and diameter, and has been recently used to measure airway lumen narrowing in response to stimulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Noble et al., 2010</xref>). The aOCT method is based on interferometry of infrared light and therefore allows high-contrast imaging of the airway mucosal surface. However, aOCT does not resolve the airway fluid layer above the mucosal surface. aOCT may be a useful adjunct to SLRM in vivo using fiberoptics for simultaneous imaging of the airway surface and the overlying surface liquid.</p><p>Adaptations of the SLRM method introduced here should allow for: (a) 3-D imaging of the ASL and cell surface; (b) simultaneous determination of ASL thickness and composition; and (c) in vivo fiberoptic measurement of ASL thickness. Sample scanning by stage displacement in a direction perpendicular to the long axis of the laser spot gives a series of slices through the ASL, which, when assembled side by side, yields a 3-D replica of the ASL/cell surface. Simultaneous recording of the 670-nm laser reflection image with fluorescence images of one or more dyes in the ASL or cell cytoplasm should allow for simultaneous determination of ASL/cell thickness and compositional parameters such as pH, [Na<sup>+</sup>], [K<sup>+</sup>], and [Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>], each of which is measurable using ratioable fluorescent dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jayaraman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Namkung et al., 2009</xref>). Although the measurements here were done using a distinct laser source and a commercial stereozoom dissecting microscope and CCD camera, the required optics, comprising a laser spot/line source and a focused camera detector, are adaptable to fiberoptic instrumentation for endoscopic measurements in live large animals, such as pigs, as well as in human subjects.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed and validated a new method for measuring small fluid layers such as the ASL that requires minimal perturbation. SLRM should allow for more widespread investigation of the dynamics of ASL depth regulation in cell cultures and tissues, and perhaps in vivo.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants HL73856, EB00415, DK35124, EY13574, DK86125, and DK72517, and Research Development Program and Drug Discovery grants from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.</p><p>Edward N.
