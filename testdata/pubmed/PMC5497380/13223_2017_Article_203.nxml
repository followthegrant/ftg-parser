However, despite the use of long-term prophylaxis (LTP), breakthrough attacks are known to occur. We used data from the Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS) to evaluate the characteristics of breakthrough attacks and the effectiveness of icatibant as a treatment option.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Data on LTP use, attacks, and treatments were recorded. Attack characteristics, treatment characteristics, and outcomes (time to treatment, time to resolution, and duration of attack) were compared for attacks that occurred with versus without LTP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Data on 3228 icatibant-treated attacks from 448 patients with C1-INH-HAE were analyzed; 30.1% of attacks occurred while patients were using LTP. Attack rate, attack severity, and the distribution of attack sites were similar across all types of LTP used, and were comparable to the results found in patients who did not receive LTP. Attacks were successfully treated with icatibant; 82.5% of all breakthrough attacks were treated with a single icatibant injection without C1-INH rescue medication. Treatment outcomes were comparable for breakthrough attacks across all LTP types, and for attacks without LTP.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Patients who use LTP should be aware that breakthrough attacks can occur, and such attacks can be severe. Thus, patients with C1-INH-HAE using LTP should have emergency treatment readily available. Data from IOS show that icatibant is effective for the treatment of breakthrough attacks. </p><p>

In addition, patients with C1-INH-HAE may receive long-term prophylaxis (LTP) to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, despite the use of LTP, angioedema attacks, some of them severe, have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, patients receiving LTP also should carry an effective on-demand treatment for acute attacks. The characteristics of attacks occurring during LTP, referred to here as breakthrough attacks, have not been formally examined in depth. Furthermore, there are currently no reports evaluating treatments for breakthrough attacks in detail.</p><p id="Par14">Icatibant (Firazyr<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Shire, Zug, Switzerland) is a subcutaneously administered bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adults with type 1 or 2 C1-INH-HAE. The Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS; NCT01034969) is an ongoing, prospective, international, observational study monitoring the safety and effectiveness of icatibant during long-term treatment in the real-world setting. We conducted an analysis of data from IOS to evaluate the characteristics of breakthrough attacks, and compared them with attacks that did not occur during LTP. Outcomes following treatment of these attacks with icatibant also were examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and patients</title><p id="Par15">Details for the design and conduct of IOS are described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. IOS captures real-world data on treatment with icatibant. Enrollment in IOS is open to all patients who have taken at least one dose of icatibant, regardless of attack frequency and level of icatibant usage. Patients with diagnosed C1-INH-HAE were included in this analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Data on icatibant-treated attacks and LTP use were collected between July 2009 and February 2016 via physician-completed electronic forms at routine visits (recommended at 6-month intervals), and with the aid of patient diaries. Characteristics of attacks and details regarding treatment with icatibant and any concomitant medications were recorded. Data on attacks and treatments during the 12&#x000a0;months before enrollment are referred to as historical. Attack severity was classified as very mild (very mild interference with daily activities), mild (mild interference with daily activities), moderate (moderate interference with daily activities and no other countermeasures required), severe (severe interference with daily activities with or without other countermeasures), or very severe (very severe interference with daily activities and other countermeasures required).</p><p id="Par16">The type of LTP administered, as well as dose, start and end dates, and frequency of dosing were recorded. Adherence to prophylaxis treatment was not monitored. Attacks that occurred outside a start&#x02013;end interval were considered to have occurred without LTP; attacks that occurred on the day that LTP started or ended were considered to have occurred with LTP. The total duration of treatment was calculated as the sum of the maximum duration of each type of LTP administered for each patient, irrespective of the occurrence of icatibant-treated attacks. The attack frequency for each type of LTP was calculated by dividing the number of attacks by the total duration of treatment. It was noted that some LTP regimens, such as androgens, had been started years before the availability of icatibant as a treatment option. To avoid underestimating the attack frequency, the date of LTP initiation was replaced with the date of the first treated attack if LTP began before the first treated attack. LTP regimens that started and stopped before the first treated attack were excluded.</p><p id="Par17">Patients received subcutaneous injections of icatibant 30&#x000a0;mg for acute attacks. Icatibant was self-administered (after training by a health care professional), or administered by a health care professional. Many patients self-administered icatibant before the formal approval of this mode of administration in 2011.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par18">Data comparisons were made for attacks occurring with LTP versus without LTP. Attacks with complete data for all three outcomes, (1) time to treatment (defined as time from attack onset to first icatibant injection), (2) time to resolution (defined as time from first icatibant injection to complete symptom resolution of all angioedema), and (3) duration of attack (defined as time from attack onset to complete resolution of symptoms), were compared using a mixed-model analysis of repeated measures (PROC MIXED; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A generalized linear mixed-model for repeated measures (PROC GLIMMIX) was used to compare the severity of attacks (e.g., very mild/mild/moderate versus severe/very severe).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p id="Par19">Data from 3228 icatibant-treated attacks were analyzed from 448 patients with C1-INH-HAE.

These patients used LTP (danazol and C1-INH, respectively) during enrollment in the study. The results for icatibant reinjection and treatment outcomes between attacks that occurred with or without LTP were not significantly impacted when data from these outliers were excluded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">Prophylactic treatment for C1-INH-HAE has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The present analyses of real-world data from IOS support that patients receiving LTP (who usually have high disease activity) experience attacks of similar duration and frequency as patients who do not use LTP. Our findings show that icatibant, when used as on-demand medication, is similarly effective in controlling attacks in patients who are taking LTP and in those who are not.</p><p id="Par28">In our dataset, patients across all LTP groups experienced breakthrough attacks, including those that involved the larynx and those that significantly impaired physical function. Breakthrough attacks may have occurred because local C1-INH levels fell below or did not reach the normal range despite administration of LTP, resulting in inadequate regulation of the contact system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is possible that doses of LTP administered were insufficient, or the dosing was not frequent enough to completely prevent attacks. In addition, data regarding patient adherence to LTP were not available, and breakthrough attacks may have resulted from delays in dosing, or errors in the administration of prophylactic medications.</p><p id="Par29">Patients who are candidates for LTP typically have more severe disease (i.e., frequent and severe attacks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Approximately half of the attacks reported in patients taking LTP were severe/very severe, which is comparable to attacks that occurred without LTP. This further emphasizes the fact that breakthrough attacks can occur often and can be severe. Interestingly, there was a higher proportion of severe/very severe attacks in patients who were using androgens for LTP (68.9%) compared with patients who were using tranexamic acid, C1-INH, or a combination of the three treatments (45.5&#x02013;55.6%). However, we cannot make conclusions regarding efficacy from this observation as the severity of disease prior to starting LTP among the patients who used the various types of LTP is not known. Furthermore, androgens are associated with numerous side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which may compromise patient compliance and subsequently treatment effectiveness.</p><p id="Par30">Irrespective of LTP use, patients responded well to icatibant, and &#x0003e;80% of C1-INH-HAE attacks were successfully treated with only a single injection of icatibant. This is consistent with previous results reported from IOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The rate of on-demand medication use was comparable for attacks that occurred with or without LTP, and there was no difference in treatment outcomes between attacks that occurred with or without LTP. Duration of attack was longer for attacks that occurred while taking tranexamic acid, and shorter with C1-INH treatment, in accordance with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Statistically significant effects of individual types of LTP on time to treatment and duration of attack should be interpreted with caution in this analysis, however, as both the number of patients and frequency of attacks within these groups were small.</p><p id="Par31">Overall, the findings from IOS indicate that attack characteristics and outcomes with icatibant treatment were similar for patients with high disease activity (i.e., those who require LTP treatment), and for those with less severe disease. These results are consistent with our clinical experience with icatibant treatment in patients with C1-INH-HAE. Furthermore, the results support the theory that attacks in patients with high- and low-disease severity share a common pathogenic mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Specifically, this involves elevation of bradykinin levels subsequent to contact system activation in the absence of sufficient, protective C1-INH levels; icatibant counteracts this activity by inhibiting the bradykinin receptor.</p><p id="Par32">The results also revealed some surprising information concerning the use of icatibant plus add-on medications to treat attacks. Although attenuated androgens and antifibrinolytics are not recommended for the treatment of acute attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], approximately 3% of total attacks were treated with these medications following dosing with icatibant. Of the 56 attacks that were treated with icatibant plus on-demand androgens, 34 (60.7%) attacks occurred while androgens were also used for LTP, suggesting that if icatibant were determined to be insufficient for resolving an attack, patients simply resorted to readily available treatments for rescue. The remaining 22 attacks that were treated with on-demand androgens occurred without LTP; these attacks were reported by 11 patients, and may reflect a lack of knowledge on the part of the patients or physicians regarding selection of appropriate treatments for acute attacks. Androgens might also be used as a form of short-term prophylaxis to reduce the chance of occurrence of a later attack (for example prior to traveling or a dental procedure).</p><p id="Par33">Some limitations of this study should be noted. Although the data suggest that the attack rate while using C1-INH, androgens, or tranexamic acid for LTP was similar and that LTP was effective in reducing the attack rate of patients with severe disease to the same rate as patients with less severe disease, this was not a randomized trial in which patients were randomly assigned to receive LTP, and adherence to LTP treatment was not monitored. The goal of this analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of icatibant in treating breakthrough attacks, rather than to compare different LTP options. Data confirming disease severity prior to initiation of prophylactic treatment were also not available as a baseline comparison. In addition, the C1-INH treatment group was relatively small. Thus, these data cannot be used to evaluate the effectiveness of LTP or to compare the various LTP treatments. The small number of C1-INH users in the database population does reflect our clinical experience in that very few patients use C1-INH at the recommended dose of 1000&#x000a0;U every 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;days; instead, doses and regimens are often adjusted according to individual patients&#x02019; responses. Thus it is difficult to fully assess the impact of C1-INH in comparison to other LTP treatments. In addition, C1-INH is indicated for both LTP and the treatment of acute attacks, and patients who use C1-INH for LTP often use it to treat breakthrough attacks as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As this analysis only includes attacks treated with icatibant, it is possible that some attacks were treated with C1-INH or other medications instead of icatibant, thus the true number of attacks with and without LTP could potentially be higher than reported here. Information on attacks that were treated with medications other than icatibant is not included in IOS. Of the 121 breakthrough attacks that occurred while on prophylaxis with C1-INH, 20 attacks were treated with rescue medication, and C1-INH was used exclusively for all 20 attacks. This further emphasizes the high frequency of C1-INH use for both prophylaxis and acute treatment indications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par34">Icatibant was successfully used to treat both breakthrough attacks in patients with C1-INH-HAE receiving prophylaxis as well as attacks that occurred without LTP. Patients who are prescribed LTP should be aware of the potential for breakthrough attacks, including those of high severity and involving the larynx, and should be prepared by having easily accessible emergency treatment.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>C1-INH</term><def><p id="Par5">C1-inhibitor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C1-INH-HAE</term><def><p id="Par6">hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAE</term><def><p id="Par7">hereditary angioedema</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCP</term><def><p id="Par8">health care provider</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IOS</term><def><p id="Par9">Icatibant Outcome Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par10">interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LTP</term><def><p id="Par11">long-term prophylaxis</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>WA, MM, LB, AZ, TC, HJL and IA contributed to study conception and design, data acquisition, analysis and interpretation, drafting the manuscript and critical content revisions; AP contributed to analysis and interpretation of data, drafting the manuscript and critical content revisions.
