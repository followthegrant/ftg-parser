However, new therapeutic strategies are required to overcome its stagnated survival rate. Triterpene glycoside Actein (ACT), extracted from the herb black cohosh, suppresses the growth of human breast cancer cells. Our study attempted to explore the role of ACT in human bladder cancer cell growth and to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that ACT significantly impeded the bladder cancer cell proliferation via induction of G2/M cycle arrest. Additionally, ACT administration triggered autophagy and apoptosis in bladder cancer cells, proved by the autophagosome formation, LC3B-II accumulation, improved cleavage of Caspases/poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) could markedly reverse ACT-induced autophagy and apoptosis. In contrast, AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were greatly de-phosphorylated by ACT, while suppressing AKT and mTOR activity could enhance the effects of ACT on apoptosis and autophagy induction. <italic>In vivo</italic>, ACT reduced the tumor growth with little toxicity. Taken together, our findings indicated that ACT suppressed cell proliferation, induced autophagy and apoptosis through promoting ROS/JNK activation, and blunting AKT pathway in human bladder cancer, which indicated that ACT might be an effective candidate against human bladder cancer in future.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>human bladder cancer</kwd><kwd>Actein (ACT)</kwd><kwd>autophagy and apoptosis</kwd><kwd>ROS and JNK</kwd><kwd>AKT</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human bladder cancer is one of the most common genitourinary malignant cancers, leading to health issue worldwide [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Presently, the existed therapeutic strategies, including radical cystectomy and chemotherapy, are far from to be satisfied considering the metastases and recurrence of human bladder cancer [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, although advances have been made in radiotherapy, perioperative chemotherapy, and surgical technology, the 10-year survival rate remains grave after radical cystectomy [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hence, it is still urgently to find and develop new and effective strategies against bladder cancer.</p><p>The purified triterpene glycoside actein (&#x003b2;-D-xylopyranoside, ACT), isolated from black cohosh, was suggested to be effective against human breast cancer cells [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Black cohosh was applied by the Native Americans for its anti-inflammatory and attenuated menopausal symptoms [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. And it has been suggested that black cohosh may have chemo-preventive and anti-cancer potential [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The rhizomes and roots of the plant contain two major classes of secondary metabolites, triterpene glycosides and phenylpropanoids [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The triterpene glycosides actein constitutes about 6.4% of an n-butanolic fraction of black cohosh enriched for triterpene glycosides (27%) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Purified triterpene glycosides have been shown to inhibit the growth of various types of cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, including human oral squamous carcinoma cells, breast cancer cells and liver cancer cells [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Triterpene glycosides from black cohosh have been shown to induce cell-cycle arrest at G1 [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, ACT could synergize with various kinds of chemotherapy agents at low doses to suppress the growth of cancer cells [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The growth-inhibitory effects of ACT may be associated with the altered expression of genes involved in the stress response pathways, the unfolded protein response and cell cycle control genes [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The bioactivity results for ACT should be helpful to elucidate its medical value to prevent human bladder cancer. Actually, it was the first time that ACT was investigated to indicate if it could inhibit the progression of bladder cancer and to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p>The cell cycle is associated with strict events, which modulate the cell division and proliferation through alterations of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins, leading to the transition in the process of cell cycle [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. During this event, dysfunctional expression of genes arrested or delayed checkpoints prior to cell division [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, abnormal expression of CDKs or cyclins disorganized the process of cell division, contributing to the occurrence and progression of various tumors [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. And a variety of proteins, including p53, p21, and Cdc25C, play essential roles in controlling the expression of CDKs and Cyclins to regulate cell proliferation [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Autophagy is a lysosomal-dependent degradation process induced under various conditions or stresses [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Autophagy is reported as an alternative molecular mechanism by which the cell death is induced [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There is evidence that autophagy is needed for the death of cancer cells with defects in apoptosis [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, new insights of the molecular mechanisms of autophagy are major reasons for the exploration of new potential drug targets [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Induction of apoptosis presents an essential mechanism for drug-exploration against various cancers [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In general, there are two main apoptotic pathways: the intrinsic and the extrinsic [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The two pathways converge on the activation of Caspases, which contain a family of cysteine proteases and play an essential role in the completion of apoptosis [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Accordingly, previous studies have pointed out that autophagy and apoptosis are tightly connected and may be modulated by ROS and JNK [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There is intriguing evidence that excessive ROS generation overcomes the cellular anti-oxidant defenses, inducing apoptosis [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Further, most cancer cells are more sensitive to rapid generation of ROS levels than normal cells [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The phosphorylation of JNK is linked to ROS elevation [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The JNK phosphorylation activated via ROS-dependent pathway triggers the over-expression of tumor suppressors, resulting in cell apoptosis [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Recently, AKT pathway is reported to suppress the formation of autophagy, and a large number of drugs are reported to treat the development of cancers via suppressing AKT phosphorylation.</p><p>In our study, the effects of ACT on human bladder cancer <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> were investigated. And the possible molecular mechanism by which the bladder cancer was suppressed was also explored, which were dependent on ROS/JNK- and AKT-regulated apoptosis and autophagy induction.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Actein suppresses cell proliferation in human bladder carcinoma cell lines</title><p>In order to explore the anti-proliferative effects of ACT on human bladder cancer, human bladder cancer cell lines, BIU-87, T24, T739 and 5637 were cultured with various concentrations of ACT for 24 and 48 h, followed by the assessment of cell viability using MTT analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, we found that the cell viability of human bladder cancer cells was dramatically down-regulated by ACT treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, human normal bladder cell line of SV-HUC-1 and human normal liver cell line of L-02 were involved to further investigate the effects of ACT on non-cancer cell lines. From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, SV-HUC-1 cells were not sensitive to ACT treatment, only at the treatment of highest dose of 40 uM for 48 h, significant difference was observed. Furthermore, administration of ACT for 72 h, both at 20 and 40 uM, exhibited relatively apparent difference compared to the control group without any treatment. Next, the cologenic assays were performed to calculate the role of ACT in regulating colony formation. The results indicated that ACT treatment considerably reduced the number of colonies of human bladder cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The results above indicated that ACT suppressed the proliferation of human bladder cancer cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, exhibiting unconspicuous cytotoxicity to non-cancer cell lines, and that ACT might be used as a promising candidate against human bladder cancer.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Actein suppresses cell proliferation in human bladder carcinoma cell lines</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Human bladder cancer cell lines of BIU-87, T24, T739 and 5637 were treated with different concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 uM) of ACT for 24 h or 48 h, followed by MTT analysis to calculate the cell viability.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;2C</xref>, the proportion of bladder cancer cells at G1/S was significantly decreased after ACT treatment, while the percentage of cancer cells at G2/M phase was markedly increased owing to ACT treatment (0, 5, 10, and 20 uM) for 24 h. Subsequently, the cell cycle-associated molecules were evaluated using western blot analysis. The results exhibited that ACT enhanced p53, p21, p-Cdk1, Cyclin B and p-Cdc25C, while reduced 14-3-3&#x003c3; in a dose-dependent manner, which were related to the regulation of G2/M cell cycle arrest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In contrast, p-Cdk2 and Cyclin A were dose-dependently down-regulated by ACT, associated with the reduction of G1/S phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).

Enhancement of autophagic cell death from cancer cells is one of the best strategies in chemotherapy [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, we explored if or not ACT could trigger autophagy in human bladder cancer cells. At the beginning, the LysoTracker Red staining was used to mark the cellular acidic components, including autophagosomes and lysosomes. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, the bladder cancer cells treated with ACT exerted more acidic vesicular organelles around the nucleus of cytoplasm in a dose-dependent manner. Following, the GFP-LC3 puncta transfection was applied to evaluate the condition of fluorescent puncta of autophagosomes. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> indicated that intensive GFP-LC3 puncta formation was observed in ACT-treated groups of bladder cancer cell lines. Next, the electric microscopy analysis revealed that ACT treatment significantly damaged bladder cancer cells that exhibited the shrunken state with an intact membrane, aggregated chromatin and pseudopodia-like protrusions, while the normal bladder cancer cells showed well-distributed chromatin and a clear nuclear membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). When cells undergo autophagic cell death, Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-II, an autophagosomal marker, increases from the conversion of LC3-I [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Western blot analysis indicated that LC3BI and LC3BII, and Beclin 1, involved in autophagy formation, were found to be highly induced by ACT culture in a dose-dependent manner, while p62 was greatly reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). According to previous studies, autophagy could protect the cell survival and induce cell death through various pathways [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In order to calculate if ACT-induced autophagy is a pro-death way or a pro-survival way, 3-MA, as essential autophagy inhibitor, was applied to pre-incubate the bladder cancer cells, followed by ACT treatment. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref> suggested that administration with 3-MA enhanced the suppressive effect of ACT on bladder cancer cell viability. Similarly, the colony formation of human bladder cancer cells was dramatically inhibited by co-treatment with 3-MA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Taken together, the data above indicated that ACT triggered autophagy in bladder cancer cells, which might be in a pro-survival way.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Actein triggers autophagy in human bladder cancer cells</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Human bladder cancer cell lines of BIU-87 and T24 were exposed to ACT for 24 h.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, Hoechst 33258 staining and TUNEL analysis indicated that ACT significantly induced apoptosis along with nuclei fragmentation, chromatin condensation and cell shrinkage. And TUNEL-positive intensity through confocal microscope was highly enhanced by ACT administration. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis indicated that both early and late apoptosis cells were dose-dependently elevated by ACT treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).

The environmental or occupational exposures to carcinogens, particularly tobacco, are the major risk factors for promoting the bladder cancer [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Currently, despite huge advances have been made, the therapeutic strategies for human bladder cancer are still limited. Thus, it is necessary to find new and novel treatments to prevent human bladder cancer progression. Actein is a bioactive triterpene glycoside, which is isolated from Cimicifuga species, and has been revealed for its suppressive effects on the growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells and osteoblastic cells [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Considering its effective role in preventing cancer cells, as well as its long historic application in Asia, actein was used in our study to further reveal its anti-cancer ability. As we know, it was the first time that ACT was investigated in human bladder cancer. Here, we further found that ACT could inhibit cell proliferation, induce G2/M phase and reduce G1/S phase, and trigger autophagy and apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells. Of note, ACT at the same time potentiated ROS generation and JNK activation, while impeded AKT and mTOR activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, which was tightly involved in the induction of apoptosis and autophagy. In <italic>vivo</italic> experiments further confirmed that ACT greatly suppressed the tumor growth of nude mice bearing BIU-87 cells.</p><p>Dysfunction of cell cycle arrest is an essential marker for cancer progression [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Many anti-cancer agents reduce malignant growth by arresting the cell cycle at the G1/S or G2/M phases [<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. According to previous studies, cell cycle arrest, particularly G2/M phase, might be a useful therapy to prevent the proliferation of cancer cells [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The CDK1, Cyclin B and Cdc25C are essential for inducing G2/M cycle phase, which could enhance the dividing of a cell into two [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Our study indicated that ACT administration improved p-Cdk1, Cyclin B, p-Cdc25c, p53 and p21 expression, while reduced 14-3-3&#x003c3; levels, which are vital signals involved in G2/M phase arrest induction. P21 plays an important role in suppressing Cdk1, Cyclin B, Cdk2 and Cyclin A activation, which might be relied on p53 expression [<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The p-Cdc25C was occurred, which was an up-streaming signal of Cdk1/Cyclin B, resulting in G2/M phase arrest. And Cdk2/Cyclin A induced G1/S phase cycle [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Both G2/M and G1/S phase cycle arrest are hallmarks of DNA damage checkpoints [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Decreased p-Cdk2 and Cyclin A were observed in ACT-treated bladder cancer cells. Thus, ACT triggered G2/M arrest and disturbance of G1/S were possibly associated with the improvement of p-Cdk1, Cyclin B, p-Cdc25c, p53 and p21, as well as the reduction of p-Cdk2 and Cyclin A.</p><p>Autophagy plays an important role in determining the cell condition [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Autophagic flux is the complete mechanism of autophagy originating with the fusion of the autophagosome with a lysosome, resulting in degradation and recycling of the cargo [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. LC3 is necessary during proteolytic processing, yielding a 16-kDa LC3-I protein that conjugates with phosphatidyl ethanolamine to yield a 14-kDa LC3-II form, in which LC3-II is used as a marker of complete activation of autophagosome [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The p62 protein is involved in the lysosome-dependent degradation system that directly interacts with LC3-II and degradation in the process of autophagy, and suppression of autophagy results in enhanced p62 protein levels [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggested the dual effect of autophagy on cancer, contributing to cell death or protecting cell survival [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In our study, we found that ACT induced autophagy dose-dependently, which was proved by the accumulation of autophagic vesicles and improvement of LC3B-I/II and Beclin 1, as well as reduction of p62. In addition, an autophagy inhibitor of 3-MA was used in our study, and 3-MA could accelerate the suppressive effects of ACT on the bladder cancer cell viability, indicating that ACT-triggered autophagy might be pro-survival.</p><p>Apoptosis is defined as programmed cell death PCD, executed by a family of cysteinyl aspartate proteinases known as Caspases [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Caspases are included in a family of highly conserved aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, which are expressed as inactive zymogens in animal cells as well as serve as the essential executioners of apoptosis [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. When death receptors are stimulated, the extrinsic pathway, involved in the activation of Caspase-8, is initiated. The intrinsic pathway includes the activation of caspase-9, and this process is regulated by B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins, including the anti-apoptotic signals of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and the pro-apoptotic molecules of Bax, Bad and Bim [<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Once Caspases-3 is activated, it cleaves death substrates or a variety of proteins. During apoptosis, Caspase-3 cleaves PARP, decreasing its DNA repair activity and contributing to apoptotic cell death [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Our results indicated that mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly decreased for ACT exposure. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization could result in the release of cytochrome c and activate Caspase-9. We also found that Caspase-3, PARP, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 were highly cleaved due to ACT administration, accompanied with reduced Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 as well as elevated Bax, Bad and Bim expressions, suggesting that ACT-induced apoptosis was Caspases-dependent.</p><p>ROS generation has been reported to be important in regulating autophagy and apoptosis [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Consistently, in our study ROS production was highly induced by ACT, which was involved in ACT-triggered autophagy and apoptosis. Additionally, ACT-caused high expression of cleavage of Caspase-3, PARP, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 were significantly reversed by NAC, a ROS scavenger. Similarly, autophagy-related LC3BI/II and Beclin 1 expressions were abolished by NAC in ACT-treated bladder cancer cells. The findings here suggested that ACT-induced autophagy and apoptosis was dependent on ROS production. Recently, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK s), and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are closely involved in autophagy and apoptosis progression [<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. JNK, and p38, main groups of MAPKs family, modulate a large number of cellular processes, including autophagy and apoptosis. P38 and JNK activity could positively induce apoptosis and autophagy [<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In contrast, PI3K/AKT pathway was suggested to negatively modulate autophagy progression via controlling the mTOR phosphorylation [<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Further, JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is involved in the sustaining of self-renewal and tumorigenicity, which is constitutively phosphorylated in cancer cells [<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In our present study, ACT dramatically activated p38 and JNK phosphorylation, whereas inactivated AKT/mTOR and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways. Additionally, the relationship between JNK and AKT/mTOR with autophagy and apoptosis induced by ACT was further explored. The findings indicated that inhibiting the activity of JNK greatly eliminated cleaved Caspase-3, PARP, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9, as well as LC3BI/II and Beclin 1, which was induced by ACT. In contrast, inhibition of AKT and mTOR activation strengthened apoptosis- and autophagy-related signals expression. Thus, autophagy and apoptosis induced by ACT could be modulated by ROS/JNK, and AKT/mTOR pathways.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, ACT could inhibit the bladder tumor growth. And ALT, AST, BUN, and CREA showed no significant difference among various groups of mice, indicating that ACT at the concentrations used in our study, showed no hepatic and renal toxicity. And H&#x00026;E staining of liver and kidney further confirmed the safety of ACT for application. Moreover, TUNEL assays indicated that apoptosis was induced by ACT <italic>in vivo</italic>. And western blot analysis illustrated that cleavage of Caspase-3, PARP, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 were significantly induced by ACT, and LC3B-I/II and Beclin 1 were also potentiated due to ACT treatment in tumor samples.</p><p>Together, our findings exhibited that ACT inhibited the cell proliferation, induced autophagy and apoptosis that were dependent on ROS/JNK activity, and AKT inactivity in human bladder cancer cells. Inhibiting autophagy potentiated ACT-triggered cell death and apoptosis, revealing that autophagy induced by ACT was a pro-survival procedure. The working model of ACT in suppressing human bladder cancer development was exhibited in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>.

Mouse care and usage were performed following the local ethical guidelines. The mice were raised in air-conditioned pathogen-free rooms under controlled lighting (12 h light/day) and fed with water and standard laboratory food. All protocols were in accordance with the Regulations of Experimental Animal Administration issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China. The animal study was carried out in accordance with the regulations of The Fourth Military Medical University (Xian, Shanxi, China). After 1 week's acclimation, single-tumor cell suspensions (BIU-87, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) were subcutaneously injected into the left flank of each mouse to obtain bladder cancer xenografts. The mice were divided into four groups (15 mice/group) 7 days after cell implantation. Mice in the experimental groups were intraperitoneally injected with ACT at a dose of 0, 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg body weight per day. Mice in the control group received an equal volume of normal saline. The tumor volume was calculated every two days by two cross-sectional measurements, and the tumor size was measured as followings: tumor volume = width<sup>2</sup> &#x000d7; length &#x000d7; 0.4. Mice were sacrificed after 22 days, and the tumors were weighed and then fixed in 10% formalin for the following experiments. The blood of each mouse was extracted through eyeballs and the serum was separated by centrifuge at 3,000&#x000d7;g for 15 min. Then, the activities of ALT, AST, BUN and CREA in serum were evaluated following the manufacturer's protocol. At the end of the experiment, all rest of mice were sacrificed.

Mouse bladder tumors were sectioned at 3 &#x003bc;m thickness, and stained with KI-67 (Abcam, 1:200). The tumor sections were analyzed using a microscope. Images were arranged through TissueFAXs (Tissue-Gnostics) software. The percentage of KI-67-positive cells in each tumor section was quantified using the HistoQuest software. The number of KI-67-positive cells was divided by the total number of cells in each tumor section. The apoptosis of tumor tissues was evaluated using TUNEL assay with the In situ Apoptosis Detection Kit following the manufacture's protocol. After deparaffinization and hydration, tumor tissue sections were washed with PBS twice and then incubated with proteinase K (20 &#x003bc;g/ml, Abcam) for 25 min at 37&#x000b0;C, followed by washes with PBS.
