activity, yet rarely do they meet these guidelines. Means to enhance accessibility of
physical activity for pregnant women are required, and yoga has been suggested as a
possible method to enhance women&#x02019;s sense of confidence and competence with physical
activity. In this pilot study, our primary aim is to evaluate pregnant women&#x02019;s
perceptions about their lived experience of an intervention which integrates a
low-intensity form of physical activity, yoga, into prenatal care; our secondary aim is
to evaluate changes in participants&#x02019; self-efficacy for physical activity and time spent
in physical activity over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Held in an outpatient obstetrics department of an urban hospital system in the United
States, this pilot study enrolled 16 pregnant women to participate in the intervention
throughout their pregnancy. We explored participants&#x02019; lived experience of the
intervention using qualitative methods (phenomenology). Means, variances, and
covariances were calculated for the 2 measures (self-efficacy and time spent in physical
activity) over the intervention period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Qualitative findings from focus groups suggest that it is acceptable for prenatal yoga
to be integrated into group prenatal care classes and women reported increased
confidence with physical activity during pregnancy. Participants did not consider the
intervention to fit within the traditional definition of exercise. Women reported
increased amounts of time spent in physical activity from baseline to the end of
pregnancy, but there were no statistically significant changes in self-efficacy over
time.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion:</title><p>The integration of gentle physical activity into the group prenatal care model warrants

placenta previa).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, cross-sectional data from sources such as the National Health and Nutrition

</p><p>Research is warranted to evaluate methods to help pregnant women increase physical
activity, even light-intensity activity. One such method is to expose women to activities
which increase a sense of confidence and competence with activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Prenatal yoga is a form of low-intensity mindful physical activity that could be a

this pilot study was to explore women&#x02019;s perceptions about their experiences with the
integration of prenatal yoga into routine CenteringPregnancy prenatal sessions (Centering
Pregnancy Care Plus Yoga [CPC + Y]). The second aim of the study was to explore preliminary
effects of CPC + Y on time spent in physical activity over time and on women&#x02019;s self-efficacy
for physical activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-2333392819834886"><title>Methods</title><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of Virginia
Commonwealth University. Conducted in the obstetrics department of the university&#x02019;s health
system, this pilot study used an embedded mixed-methods approach. Eligible participants were
adult, English-speaking pregnant women who were participating in CPC for prenatal care with
no ACOG contraindications to physical activity. After informed consent and enrollment,
participants engaged in the CPC + Y intervention, involving a 30-minute manualized yoga
session taught by experienced prenatal yoga instructors, at the end of each CPC meeting.</p><p>For aim 1 (participants&#x02019; experiences with intervention), focus groups were held at the
6-weeks postpartum visit in the obstetrics office, using questions focused on the phenomenon
of physical activity during pregnancy. A phenomenological qualitative approach was used for
the analysis of this qualitative data, with initial analyses by 2 authors (P.K. and C.A.);
to enhance rigor, a third author (S.M.) provided an independent review and we used
participant checking to confirm themes.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="bibr19-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr20-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> For aim 2 (preliminary effects of CPC + Y), means, variances, covariances, and 95%
confidence intervals were calculated for the pre-/post-data time points and a Wilcoxon

8-question scale which contains items about self-management of physical activities and
social support regarding physical activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) was used to determine amount of

old infants in their laps. Two key themes arose from the focus group discussions: First,
participants reported uncertainty about safe exercise during pregnancy and were relieved
that prenatal yoga was offered as an activity. One participant reported that <italic>the
yoga classes started here and I could see what was okay&#x02026;and what wasn&#x02019;t okay to push the
limit with</italic>. Participants felt a sense of relief that they could engage in the
yoga classes in a <italic>safe environment</italic> and that they knew the classes were
appropriate because their clinicians were aware of their participation. Multiple
participants suggested that the yoga classes served as a motivator to engaging in other
physical activity outside of class. For example, one women expressed that the
participation in the CPC + Y classes helped provide motivation to add an additional yoga
class to her week: <italic>I started going to the yoga class on Tuesday mornings and these
classes introduced me to that and it was a great way for me to stay active and know what
was okay for me to do.</italic> Of note, participants felt that the classes were too
short and gentle to be considered true exercise. As suggested by one participant:
<italic>It was only 30 minutes and I would have liked for it to be even longer</italic>;
several participants echoed this sentiment stating that they desired more time in
class.</p><p>Second, participants found that physical activity in the form of yoga integrated with CPC
was extremely convenient. For example, one participant stated <italic>having it at the end
of our Centering session made it really convenient for those of us who were able to stay
afterwards, that made it really helpful</italic>. For this and several other
participants, the novelty of yoga as a physical activity which was easily integrated into
their prenatal care schedule was an exciting prospect when learning about the study. She
stated she was excited to sign up once she realized, <italic>there&#x02019;s a free yoga class
that&#x02019;s conveniently timed right after our prenatal appointment.</italic> Despite the
convenience of integrating yoga into the prenatal care schedule, several participants
mentioned that the schedule and timing could benefit from some adjustments in terms of
end-time or conflict with children&#x02019;s school schedules.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2333392819834886"><title>Aim 2: Explore Preliminary Effects of CPC + Y</title><p>With regard to time spent in physical activity, the mean and median number of days active

prenatal yoga into group prenatal as feasible and acceptable. Participants in this study
reported that group-based classes increased feelings of safety surrounding physical activity
during pregnancy. Historically, pregnant women were advised to abstain from physical activity,<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and despite that several organizations have promoted healthy physical activity in
pregnancy for weight management and stress relief,<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> there remains confusion about what activities are &#x0201c;safe&#x0201d; during pregnancy and many
women lack self-efficacy for physical activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Participants expressed appreciation for the integration of yoga with prenatal yoga to
address this uncertainty about safety.</p><p>The quantitative results from this study did not reveal significant changes over time, but
participants reported trending increased amounts of physical activity from early to late
pregnancy. With regard to the lack of changes over time in self-efficacy for physical
activity, there are several possible explanations for these findings. Although the women
reported enjoying the yoga sessions integrated into the CPC groups and perceived it to be
beneficial or their healthy and the health of their baby, they did not view it as a regular
form of &#x0201c;exercise&#x0201d; or physical activity, particularly given that the class was only 30
minutes. Similar results were found in a previous study reporting women viewed yoga as a
low-intensity and relaxing exercise.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2333392819834886" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Future research should include a consideration of yoga as a form of physical activity
and should evaluate the appropriateness of the measures (eg, PASES, PPAQ) in this
population.</p><p>Although this study used innovative approaches to understand an area that is under studied,
it has some limitations: the small sample size, lack of randomized control group, and
representation of 2 racial/ethnic groups (white and black/African American) presents
limitations to internal and external validity. However, this was designed to be a pilot
study with the primary goal of evaluating acceptability and determining intervention effects
to support the development of a future randomized controlled trial. We recommend that future
randomized controlled studies should include a comparison group that may control for time
and attention, recruitment of a racially/ethnically heterogeneous sample population, and an
appropriately powered sample size to account for the natural variability of physical
activity in pregnant women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section7-2333392819834886"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Prenatal yoga integrated into group prenatal care was overall well-received by the women
who participated and has the potential to be integrated on a wider scale in order to reach
more women. Although there were minimal changes in quantitative outcome measures over time,
participants in the intervention reported increased amounts of physical activity from early
to late pregnancy. Prenatal yoga as a form of gentle physical activity warrants further
attention for the possibility of integrating into group prenatal care and for its potential
benefits with regard to maternal physical and mental wellness. Future research is required
to evaluate whether and how yoga completed in a group may also contribute to positive
physical activity experiences and contribute to physical activity self-efficacy and enhance
motivation for future physical activity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2333392819834886"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> This study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02873481.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Prachi Desai, Kirsten Olsen, and Tamala Gondwe for
