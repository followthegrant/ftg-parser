The CCK8 assay was performed to detect the inhibition of the cell growth rate. The cells were stained by Hoechst 33258 to detect apoptotic cell morphology. Annexin V/PI double staining was used to detect the cell apoptosis rate using flow cytometry. The protein expression levels of E2F1, P21, and Bim in the K562 cell line were detected using western blotting.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression level of miR-20a in K562 cells transfected with miR-20a ASODNs was lower than those in the normal control, SODN and blank transfection groups (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). miR-20a ASODNs significantly inhibited the growth of K562 cells as compared to the controls (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The Hoechst staining results showed morphological changes, suggesting apoptosis. The cell apoptosis rates in the ASODN group was (13.9 &#x000b1; 1.5)%, which was significantly higher than that in the normal control group (1.84 &#x000b1; 0.21)%, blank transfection group (3.21 &#x000b1; 0.32)%, and SODN group (3.72 &#x000b1; 0.44)% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The protein expression of E2F1 and P21 in K562 cells transfected with miR-20a ASODNs were higher, while the level of Bim protein was significantly lower than that in the control groups. When miR-20a ASODNs were combined with imatinib, the growth of K562 cells was significantly inhibited as compared to the ASODN treatment alone, imatinib alone, and SODN+imatinib groups (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> miR-20a ASODNs could induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells.

Accumulative literature data suggest that the abnormal expression and regulation of miRNA are involved in the development and progression of many types of tumors (Croce, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In addition, Analysis of miRNA expression profiles in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients and healthy controls showed that the abnormal expression of some miRNAs was closely associated with the abnormal proliferation of CML cells (Venturini et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Zhu et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Therefore, miRNAs are new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of cancers, and open new avenues for cancer therapy.</p><p>The miR-17-92 cluster genes are located in the third intron of the C13orf25 gene on 13q31 and include miR-17-5p, miR-17-3p, miR-18, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a, and miR-92-1 isoforms. They are closely associated with tumor development and are highly expressed in solid tumors and malignant hematologic disease (He et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Fassina et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Jin et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Scherr et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). It has been shown that the expression of miR-17-92 cluster genes are increased in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in the early chronic phase of CML through the <italic>BCR-ABL-c-MYC</italic>-miR-17-92 pathway (Venturini et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). miR-20a belongs to the miR-17-92 family and is abnormally expressed in various tumors, such as lung cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Fuziwara and Kimura, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; da Silva Oliveira et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The high miR-20a expression can attenuate the expression of PTEN to promote tumor development (Fuziwara and Kimura, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). miR-20a is closely associated with the growth, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells (Huang et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Qiang et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Zhao et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The study by Zhang et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) showed that the expression of miR-20a increased in colorectal cancer and was closely associated with the lymph node and distant metastases. In addition, high miR-20a expression could induce tumor cell resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs through different target genes (Chai et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Zhu et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Therefore, downregulation of miR-20a may increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.</p><p>Imatinib is a drug that specifically inhibits tyrosine kinase activity in the CML fusion gene, BCR/ABL1. However, studies have increasingly shown that drug insensitivity or drug resistance occurs during treatment of CML using imatinib. It is not clear whether downregulation of miR-20a expression can enhance the inhibitory effect of imatinib on K562 cell proliferation. Therefore, this study aimed to study the effects of miR-20a downregulation on K562 cell proliferation and apoptosis and changes in the expression of its related target proteins. In addition, the effects of the combination of miR-20a and imatinib on K562 cell proliferation were further investigated to provide new insight for targeted treatment of CML.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>The miRNA-20a antisense oligonucleotide (ASODN): 5&#x02032;GUACCUGCACUAUAAGCACUUUA-3&#x02032; and the scrambled sequence: 5&#x02032;CAGUACUUUUGUGUAGUACAA-3&#x02032; were synthesized by Shanghai GeneChem Co., Ltd., (China).

The absorbance (A450) at the wavelength of 450 nm were measured in a microplate reader. The A450 value reflected the number of surviving cells. After miR-20a ASODN transfection, cells were treated with combined 0.6 &#x003bc;mol/L imatinib and cultured in an incubator for 48 and 72 h. The A450 values of the cells in each group were measured, and the proliferation inhibition rates of the cells were estimated by the equation: The cell proliferation inhibition rate (%) = (1&#x02013;A450 in the experimental group/A450 in the control group) &#x000d7; 100%.

The miR-17-92 cluster genes are abnormally amplified in a variety of tumors and have carcinogenesis in tumor cells (Hayashita et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Fontana et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Inomata et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Venturini et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) showed that compared to normal CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in the early chronic phase of CML had significantly higher expression levels of the miR-17-92 cluster genes. They also showed that <italic>c-Myc</italic> could regulate the expression of the miRNA-17-92 cluster genes, while <italic>c-Myc</italic> could be activated by the product of the <italic>BCR-ABL</italic> genes. In addition, they compared the expression of 210 miRNAs in K562 cells using the miRNA microarray method. The results showed that the expression of the mature miR-17-92 cluster genes decreased followed by the BCR-ABL kinase activity being suppressed by imatinib or the BCR-ABL expression being downregulated by RNAi. In addition, the inhibition of K562 cell proliferation and survival by downregulation of Myc by RNAi could be partially blocked by lentivirus-mediated overexpression of miR-17-19b-1, the other member of the miR-17-92 cluster family. Therefore, the miR-17-92 cluster family may be closely associated with CML. The results in this study showed that miR-20a, an isoform of miR-17-92 cluster genes was highly expressed in K562 cells.</p><p>In this study, after K562 cells were transfected with miR-20a ASODNs, the expression level of miR-20a significantly decreased, and K562 cell proliferation was significantly inhibited. In addition, the effects appeared to be time-dependent. Therefore, our results indicated that miR-20a ASODNs could specifically inhibit K562 cell proliferation. The Hoechst staining results showed that after K562 cells were transfected with miR-20a ASODNs, the cells exhibited morphological changes of apoptosis, such as decreased cell volume, nuclear condensation, and nuclear fragmentation. In addition, the apoptosis rate of K562 cells significantly increased after miR-20a ASODN transfection. Therefore, these results indicated that miR-20a ASODNs could promote K562 cell apoptosis, leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation. Matsubara et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) used ASODN to inhibit miR-17-5p and miR-20a, which caused apoptosis in lung cancer cells that expressed high levels of miR-17-92. The study of Dereani et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) also showed that ASODN targeting miR-17, the other member of the miR-17-92 cluster, could inhibit the growth of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our study results were consistent with the results reported in the above literature.</p><p>To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of K562 cell proliferation by miR-20a ASODNs, we further monitored the expression of the miR-17-92 target proteins <italic>E2F1</italic> (O'Donnell et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), <italic>P21</italic> (Inomata et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Wong et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and <italic>Bim</italic> (Mavrakis et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) using western blotting after the miR-20a in K562 cells was down-regulated by ASODNs. <italic>E2F1</italic> regulates the transition of cells from the early G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase to the S phase and can promote cell apoptosis; therefore, it is an important cell cycle regulator. O'Donnell et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) showed that <italic>c-Myc</italic> regulated proliferation signals through the activation of <italic>E2F1</italic> transcription and regulation of its translation. <italic>c-Myc</italic> is a well-known transcription factor closely associated with the oncogenic function of the miRNA-17-92 family. Our results showed that after transfection with miR-20a ASODNs, the expression level of E2F1 protein in K562 cells significantly increased, suggesting that miR-20a in K562 cells may target <italic>E2F1</italic> gene expression regulation to promote cell proliferation.</p><p>As a negative regulator of the cell cycle, P21 is closely associated with the cell cycle, differentiation, aging, and apoptosis and mediates the activity of transcription factors. In an MLL leukemia animal model, the miR-17-92 cluster regulated the pathogenic ability of leukemia stem cells through regulating the expression of the cell cycle factor P21 (Wong et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). miR-17 and miR-20a, which have conserve high gene hemology in the miR-17-92 cluster, could promote the proliferation of CML cells and B cell lymphoma cells through targeted regulation of P21 expression (Inomata et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The results in this study showed that the expression level of P21 protein in K562 cells in the ASODN significantly increased after miR-20 ASODN transfection, suggesting that miR-20a ASODNs induced K562 cell apoptosis. The inhibition of cell proliferation may be associated with the targeted regulation of P21 protein by miR-20a.</p><p>The <italic>Bim</italic> (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death) gene is a tumor suppressor (Bouillet et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Yan et al. showed that inhibition of miR-17-5p expression upregulated the protein expression level of its target gene, <italic>Bim</italic>, to increase the sensitivity of pancreatic cells to gemcitabine (Yan et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This study showed that the expression level of Bim protein in K562 cells transfected with miRNA-20a ASODNs significantly decreased, which was not consistent with the expected results. This result suggested that <italic>Bim</italic> in K562 cells may not be directly regulated by miR-20a; further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanism.</p><p>This study further investigated the effect of miR-20a ASODNs combined with imatinib on K562 cell proliferation. The CCK8 detection results showed that miR-20a ASODNs combined with imatinib significantly inhibited K562 cell growth as compared to the growth of the miR-20a ASODN alone, imatinib alone, and SODN+imatinib groups. Therefore, miR-20a ASODNs along with imatinib could increase the inhibitory effects on K562 cell proliferation. Lopotov&#x000e1; et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) noted that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib could inhibit <italic>bcr-abl</italic> expression to increase miR-451 expression. The destruction of the regulatory loop between <italic>bcr-abl</italic> and miR-451 may help to increase the treatment efficacy in CML patients. Liu et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) showed that after CML cells were transfected with miR-144/451, the apoptosis-inducing effect of imatinib was promoted to overcome drug resistance to imatinib. The above literature reports together with our findings demonstrated that miRNA expression changes were closely associated with the sensitivity of CML cells to imatinib.</p><p>Collectively, we concluded that miR-20a ASODNs can induce K562 cell apoptosis and inhibit K562 cell proliferation. In addition, miR-20a ASODN, in combination with imatinib, results in an enhanced inhibiting effect on the proliferation of K562 than miR-20a ASODN or imatinib alone. The function of miR-20a ASODNs in the inhibition of K562 cell proliferation may be associated with the up-regulation of the target proteins E2F1 and P21, which are regulated by miR-20a.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>SC and DH contributions to the design of the work.
