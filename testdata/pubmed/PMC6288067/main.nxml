We chose this endpoint because recurrent childhood wheezing is an important cause of paediatric morbidity <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Additionally, RCTs with recurrent childhood wheezing as a primary endpoint will likely be more favourable than other childhood respiratory outcomes for several reasons. First, an outcome that could be assessed at a younger age is advantageous, because longer trials have higher rates of losses to follow-up and are more costly. Second, recurrent wheezing at 3&#x0202f;years is expected to have a higher prevalence than asthma at 5&#x0202f;years <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, increasing the statistical power for a given sample size. Third, if some portion of asthma at 5&#x0202f;years is caused by early infant RSV exposure, it is plausible that recurrent wheezing at 3&#x0202f;years mediates this relationship. Fourth, atopy and environmental risk factors are more likely to be found in children with asthma than in children with recurrent wheeze <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, indicating that early RSV illness may contribute a larger attributable fraction to recurrent childhood wheezing at 3&#x0202f;years than to asthma at 5&#x0202f;years.</p><p id="p0050">We based our approach on an earlier study that estimated the detectable risks in observational studies of potential foetal benefits of maternal influenza vaccination <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The approach is described in the following illustrative example. Suppose that 1000 mother-infant pairs were randomized to each arm of a placebo-controlled RCT of a maternal RSV vaccine. If the baseline risk of vaccine-preventable early infant RSV illness in the population is <italic>r</italic>, then approximately 1000&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;<italic>r</italic> infants born to women in the placebo arm will acquire RSV illness during the vaccine-preventable period. In the vaccine arm, prevention of infant RSV illness is proportional to the vaccine efficacy (%), <italic>VE</italic>, implying that 1000&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;<italic>r</italic> &#x000d7; (1&#x0202f;&#x02212;&#x0202f;<italic>VE</italic>) infants born to women immunized against RSV will acquire an RSV illness. Supposing an attack rate of 20% (<italic>r</italic>) and vaccine efficacy of 50% (<italic>VE</italic>), we would expect 200 cases (= 1000&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;0.2) of RSV illness among infants in the placebo arm and 100 cases (=1000&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;0.2&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;0.5) of RSV illness among infants in the vaccine arm.</p><p id="p0055">We considered infant RSV illness within the first months to be a mediator on the causal pathway of maternal RSV vaccine protection against recurrent childhood wheezing since these early RSV illnesses occur within the vaccine-preventable time frame and are associated with the highest acute morbidity (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). That is, the ability of RSV vaccination during pregnancy to prevent later recurrent childhood wheezing would operate through the reduction in early RSV illness during the first months of life. If the baseline risk of recurrent wheezing at 3&#x0202f;years, <italic>w</italic>, is 5% among infants who do not experience an early RSV illness, and 20% among those who do, this would imply a 4-fold relative increase in the risk resulting in a risk ratio <italic>RR<sub>RW</sub></italic> of 4. (The subscript RW is used to denote the risk ratio of <underline>R</underline>SV illness associated with <underline>w</underline>heezing illness). In the placebo arm, applying these risks to the 200 and 800 infants with and without RSV illness, respectively, results in 80 total cases of recurrent wheezing among infants in the placebo arm ((200&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;0.20 + (800&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;0.05)). Among infants born to RSV-vaccinated mothers, 900 will have a 5% risk of developing the recurrent wheezing, and 100 will have a 20% risk, for a total of 65 cases ((900&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;0.05) + (100&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;0.2)). In this hypothetical scenario, maternal RSV immunization reduced the risk of childhood wheezing from 80 per 1000 (placebo arm) to 65 per 1000 (vaccine arm), for a risk ratio associated with vaccination (<italic>RR<sub>VW</sub></italic>) of 0.81 (= 65 per 1000&#x0202f;&#x000f7;&#x0202f;80 per 1000) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). (The subscript VW is used to denote the risk ratio of <underline>v</underline>accine associated with <underline>w</underline>heezing illness, or the vaccine effect size). We used estimates from the literature supplemented by expert opinion to inform the following parameter inputs for our model: (1) baseline attack rate of severe early RSV, <italic>r</italic>; (2) vaccine efficacy, <italic>VE</italic>; (3) risk of recurrent wheezing during childhood, <italic>w</italic>; and (4) risk ratio for recurrent wheezing according to early RSV illness, <italic>RR<sub>RW</sub></italic> (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We also considered two allocation schemes, 1:1 and 2:1.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Theoretical causal diagram for the relationships between maternal RSV vaccination, severe early infant RSV- lower respiratory infections, and later recurrent childhood wheezing.

The sign labelling each arrow indicates the direction of association as positive (+) or negative (&#x02212;) between the connecting nodes.

There are 100 rows of 10 dots, to represent 1000 mother-infant pairs randomized each to placebo and vaccination. Following the in-text example, 20% of placebo (200 mother-infant pairs; purple dots) acquire early and severe infant RSV vs. 10% in the immunized arm (100 mother infant pairs; purple dots), for a vaccine efficacy of 50%. If early RSV illness increases the later development of recurrent childhood wheezing, then the proportion of children who develop recurrent wheezing will be higher among those with early RSV. This is shown by the higher density of recurrent wheezing cases (black outline) among those with RSV illness (purple dots) vs. those without (blue dots). Summing the wheezing cases, there are 60 cases among the 300 infants who acquired RSV (for a 20% risk) vs. 85 wheezing cases among the 1700 infants who did not acquire RSV (for a 5% risk) giving rise to four-fold increased risk of wheezing in children exposed vs. unexposed to early and severe infant RSV.

Furthermore, these estimates do not account for early RSV exposure status, even though we require estimates among children unexposed to early severe RSV illness. These overall estimates will approximate the estimate among the unexposed when the exposed population is small (i.e., for small baseline attack rates of severe early RSV) or when RR<sub>RW</sub> is low. Otherwise, they would be overestimates. We therefore chose a wide range of recurrent wheezing prevalence estimates to reflect these opposing measurement uncertainties.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.5</label><title>Risk ratio of recurrent wheezing according to RSV status</title><p id="p0085">If RSV vaccination during pregnancy leads to reduction in later recurrent childhood wheezing, we assume the effect occurs by preventing early severe RSV illness among infants.

Our sample size calculations indicate the improbability of RCTs conducted for licensure of RSV vaccines for use by pregnant women in general populations to prevent recurrent childhood wheezing. Trials with asthma endpoints would likely need to be even larger.</p><p id="p0135">While our goal was to inform public health about the potential impact of RSV vaccines during pregnancy, our findings may be generalized to trials of anti-RSV monoclonal antibodies or paediatric RSV vaccination. Two RSV monoclonal antibody RCTs designed to demonstrate prevention of RSV illness in infants were extended to monitor participants for medically-attended wheezing at 3&#x0202f;years <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> or asthma at 6&#x0202f;years <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Both trials were powered to detect RSV prevention on a reduction in wheezing days within the first year of life, and not later childhood respiratory outcomes. In a RCT conducted among 2127 Native American infants in the United States, 14.9% of children in the treated group and 14.0% in the placebo group experienced serious early childhood wheezing between 1 and 3&#x0202f;years, of which only 3% in either arm had 3 or more medically-attended wheezing episodes <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In the RCT conducted in the Netherlands, of 429 children who were followed to age 6, 10.3% in the RSV prevention arm had physician-diagnosed asthma at 6&#x0202f;years vs. 9.9% in the placebo arm. No difference in mean forced expiratory volume was detected <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our results indicate that these studies were substantially smaller than what would be necessary to demonstrate a significant effect on RSV-caused respiratory outcomes. Furthermore, the small differences in respiratory outcomes across treatment arms suggest that even larger sample sizes would be required if the true RR<sub>RW</sub> is lower than 1.6, the lower bound of the parameter included in this study.</p><p id="p0140">Whether early RSV illness causes later recurrent wheezing is still unclear. Even assuming a moderate to strong risk ratio of RSV illness associated with wheezing illness (RR<sub>RW</sub> between 1.6 and 4.0), our calculations indicate that the magnitude of vaccine effect on recurrent wheezing is likely small. However, the global burden of asthma as a lifelong chronic disease is sufficiently large that even a small reduction in asthma incidence would have major public health implications. Alternative study designs can overcome the sample size constraints of RCTs, and have been used to estimate the causal effect of maternal vaccination on a spectrum of childhood outcomes. However, caution should be taken in the design and interpretation of observational vaccine effectiveness studies. For example, confounding by health status led to unrealistic effect estimates of influenza vaccination on pneumonia among the elderly <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and such studies still influence current global vaccine policy recommendations <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. More objective measures of wheezing and asthma outcomes, such as physician&#x02019;s diagnosis and lung function studies, can minimize differential measurement bias that can occur with parental reporting <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Planning in advance by engaging clinical experts, vaccinologists, and observational research methodologists is crucial to increase the quality and reliability of studies to best inform public health decisions.</p><p id="p0145">Our investigation has its limitations. This analysis did not account for loss to follow-up, which is likely to occur for multiyear studies. For the purposes of our analyses, we assumed a causal link between infant RSV exposure and childhood recurrent wheezing, and the parameter choices represented a range of published estimates. Although we used estimates from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and ISAAC surveys to obtain parameter inputs for our model, each of these is subject to its own weaknesses. While most stable estimates of severe RSV incidence were only available for infants younger than 6&#x0202f;months of age, passive protection from maternal antibodies wanes with time and may only last up to 2&#x0202f;months of age <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Data from the ongoing phase III clinical trial of RSV vaccination in pregnant women will provide valuable information on severe, early RSV attack rate and on vaccine efficacy which may refine our estimates once they are published <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. To evaluate the risk of recurrent wheezing, we used prevalence estimates for symptoms of severe asthma (which includes recurrent wheezing) for 6&#x02013;7&#x0202f;year-olds, which likely underestimate the prevalence among 3&#x0202f;year-olds. However, we calculated sample sizes for a wide range of inputs for recurrent wheezing to underscore its uncertainty and worldwide variation. Practically speaking, an even earlier recurrent wheezing endpoint (i.e., at 12&#x02013;24&#x0202f;months of age) may be desired to keep trial costs and participant attrition low. However, diagnosis of wheezing is subjective and variable at these ages, and we were unable to find suitable disease rate estimates to investigate these earlier endpoints. If studies are planned to consider recurrent wheeze outcomes in children 2&#x02013;3&#x0202f;years of age, and baseline rates are known, our tables may still provide guidance about whether sample size is sufficient so long as the expected parameter values are close to those we investigated.</p><p id="p0150">A safe maternal RSV vaccine that prevents acute RSV illness in early infancy would be a major public health accomplishment due to the high burden of RSV illness in young children globally. Based on our analysis, RCTs for candidate maternal RSV vaccines undertaken for licensure are unlikely to demonstrate an effect on recurrent wheezing illness due to the large sample sizes needed to demonstrate a significant effect. Further efforts are needed to plan for post-licensure studies to inform public health expectations regarding the impact of RSV vaccines given during pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><label>5</label><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0155">JRO conceived of the study.
