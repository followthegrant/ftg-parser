</p><p>To reduce the risk of developing BCIS, it is recommended to replace the intravascular fluid gap by while maintaining contact with the surgeon for the type of prosthesis, be diligent in high-risk situations and invasively monitor vital parameters.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Avoiding intravascular volume, depletion may reduce the extent of the hemodynamic changes in BCIS.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] BCIS is a syndrome that may develop during cementation progressing with loss of consciousness along with hypoxia, hypotension or both, and also while removing the joint, implanting the prosthesis or in surgical patients for whom cement was used while opening the tourniquet. While BCIS frequently develops during hip replacement surgeries, it was also reported during knee prosthesis surgery[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and vertebroplasty procedures.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>There are several mechanisms suggested playing a role in the development of BCIS.

After obtaining the ethical approval (no: 99950669/1023 no. 25; October 4, 2013) and patient consent, a total of 109 patients between 60 and 65 years of age, who were scheduled to undergo knee replacement surgery and had the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical classes I and II, were enrolled.</p><p>Participants were randomized into three groups, each Group I included 34, Group II 34, and Group III 41 patients, through sealed envelope method. The exclusion criteria were as follows: Adults who did not provide consent for participation in the study. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, patients with active and severe renal, hepatic, respiratory or cardiac failure, a history of seizures, a neurological or neuromuscular disorder, chronic pain or analgesic medication use, patients with a platelet count of lower than 100,000 mm<sup>3</sup>, anatomic malformations and those with a cutaneous infection at injection site were excluded from this study.

Group III was infused 8 mL/kg/h sodium chloride during the anesthesia management. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures (SAP, DAP, MAP), heart rate (HR), respiration number, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded at 5-min intervals during the entire operation. Patients were classified in terms of cement implantation syndrome. Hemodynamic parameters were compared between the groups at the 5 min 1 cementation (T7), at the time of cement implantation (T8), 1 min after cement implantation (T9), 2 min after cement implantation (T10), 3 min after cement implantation (TII), 5 min after cement implantation (T12), 10 min after cement implantation (T13), and 15 min after cement implantation (T14), at the time of tourniquet was deflated (T15). 6 mg ephedrine i. v. bolus (Efedrin 50 mg/1 mL Osel &#x00130;la&#x000e7; San. ve Tic.

The descriptive statistics were presented as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation for normally distributed variables, as the median (min-max) for nonnormally distributed variables, and as the number of cases and (%) for nominal variables. Pearson's Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used in the analysis of categorical variables. The significance of any difference between the mean values of the groups was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Normal distribution of the variables was tested using visual (histogram and probability graphics) and analytic methods (Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov/Shapiro-Wilk tests). One-way ANOVA was used to determine any difference between three independent groups in terms of normally distributed variables for which variances were assumed to be homogeneous. Two-way ANOVA (two-way-mixed) was used to detect the differences between the groups for mixed patterns in repeated measures and the change over time in repeated measures. In case there was a significant difference between the groups, <italic>post hoc</italic> tests were performed to identify the source of difference. For nonnormally distributed variables, Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis H test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference between three distributions by comparing the measurements for a dependent (repeated measures) variable in three independent groups (samples). In case there was a significant difference between the groups, binary comparisons between two groups were performed by Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test to identify the source of difference.

Grade 1 BCIS was developed in patients in the control group that was infused crystalloids at a significantly higher frequency compared to the groups that received preload or coload colloid.</p><p>As a second result, compared to the time points before cementation, the crystalloid group had a hemodynamically more unstable course than the two other groups in this study. Compared to the time point of 5 min before cement implantation, diastolic and mean arterial pressures were significantly higher in both groups, particularly in the coloading group than crystalloid group after the tourniquet was opened. In terms of the change in systolic pressure, the measurements obtained on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> min were significantly higher in the coloading group compared to the control group. Moreover, the coloading group had significantly higher diastolic pressures compared to the control group on the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, and 15<sup>th</sup> min after cementation. Independent of the time, mean arterial pressure was also significantly higher in the coloading group at the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 10<sup>th</sup> min and at the time of tourniquet opening, compared to the other two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In this study, there were some limitations that it could not be compared the patients' atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels and we could not measure the also Anti-inflammatory effects of the HES.</p><p>During BCIS, the patients are considered to experience drop in mean arterial pressure as well as a reduction in stroke volume and CO, particularly due to peripheral vasodilatation, the decreased venous return and increased pulmonary vascular resistance.</p><p>Particularly in elderly patients, hypotension results in inadequate organ perfusion and may ultimately end with the loss of consciousness and cardiovascular collapse; the true goal of hemodynamic management during anesthesia is to maintain tissue perfusion. In elderly patients, who receive spinal administration, optimizing cardiac preload may be fundamental to prevent spinal hypotension and organ dysfunction.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Colloid increases intravascular volume and stays in the vascular space longer due to the larger molecular weight compared with crystalloid.</p><p>ANP is secreted on stretching of the atrial muscles. This eventually results in hypotension and diuresis.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Previous studies indicated that, for prevention of spinal-induced hypotension, preloading causes a lower increase in ANP levels,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but the levels still elevate 30 min after. Thus, coloading was suggested to be a preferable option as it is not associated with atrial stretching due to spinal-induced vasodilatation. In the present study, since coloading delayed the time of ANP secretion, its effects on hypotension and diuresis did not coincide with the time of cementation. We believe that this is the reason why the hemodynamic parameters remained significantly higher during coloading. A previous study in the literature compared loading before spinal anesthesia and coloading in elective C-section operations. While coloading was performed with 1000 cc crystalloid, preloading with 500 cc colloid was found to have a similar impact on hemodynamic parameters.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Another study argued that preloading with HES solution was not significantly different from the use of normal saline solution.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, in line with our findings, Talakoub <italic>et al</italic>. previously demonstrated that colloid therapy better preserved systolic blood pressure and heartbeat rate compared to crystalloid group.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>HES 130/0.4 reduced pro-inflammatory responses and increased anti-inflammatory responses to a greater degree than 4% modified gelatin solution GEL and ISOlyte s ISO. The use of ISO, compared to HES and GEL, resulted in more of a fall in the CD4+: CD8+ ratio, suggesting increased immunosuppression.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Due to the anti-inflammatory effects of the HES can be protective against the BCIS.</p><p>Findings of another study reported that HES 130/0.4 significantly reduced neutrophil&#x02013;platelet aggregates, neutrophil extracellular traps formation, chemokine-induced arrest, and transmigration of neutrophils under inflammatory conditions.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Results of this study may be explained that HES could be prevent the patients underwent procedures with cement, from the embolic events.</p><p>Studies demonstrating that HES induces the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanisms suggest that it may also have a favorable effect on the cement reaction.
