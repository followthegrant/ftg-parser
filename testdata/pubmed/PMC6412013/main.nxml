SET and cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) are intrinsic protein-interacting inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and frequently overexpressed in cancers, whereas reactivating PP2A activity has been postulated as an anti-cancer strategy.

Ectopic SET or CIP2A increased cell viability, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells. Notably ERK inhibition increased PP2A activity. ERK activation is known crucial for Elk-1 activity, a transcriptional factor regulating CIP2A expression, we hypothesized an oncogenic feedforward loop consisting of pERK/pElk-1/CIP2A/PP2A. This loop was validated by knockdown of PP2A and ectopic expression of Elk-1, showing reciprocal changes in loop members. In addition, ectopic expression of SET increased pAkt, pERK, pElk-1 and CIP2A expressions, suggesting a positive linkage between SET and CIP2A signaling. Moreover, TD19 disrupted this CIP2A-feedforward loop by restoring PP2A activity, demonstrating <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-cancer activity.

PP2A has been implicated as an important tumor suppressor and its loss of function has been identified in several solid cancers including breast cancer [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Accordingly, PP2A controls the cell cycle as well as cell apoptosis [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although loss of PP2A activity is crucial for tumor growth, mutations in PP2A subunits are very rare in breast cancers [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The trimeric form of PP2A consists of catalytic (PP2Ac), scaffold (PP2AA) and regulatory (PP2AB) subunits. Alterations in the A subunit that impair integration of the C and/or B subunits have only been observed in breast cancers at a low frequency [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], suggesting that other mechanisms can affect PP2A activity. Indeed, some cellular PP2A-interacting proteins, such as SET (I2PP2A, inhibitor 2 of PP2A) and cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), inhibit PP2A activity through direct interaction with PP2A [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">Both SET and CIP2A have been shown to be up-regulated in a variety of cancers and their expression generally correlates with poor prognosis [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>]. In breast cancer, SET and CIP2A have been shown frequently overexpressed. Knockdown of SET and CIP2A decreases tumorigenesis [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In particular, CIP2A levels were elevated in TNBC compared with non-TNBC and associated with high histological grade and lymph node metastasis [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. CIP2A has been shown to interact directly with c-MYC and impair its degradation by inhibiting PP2A activity [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Previous studies have indicated CIP2A also suppresses PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of pAkt (Ser473) [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>], and plays a determinant role in drug-induced apoptosis of several known and investigational anticancer agents, such as bortezomib, tamoxifen, erlotinib derivatives, natural compounds, and small molecules [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>], comprehensively reviewed by De et al. [<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Soofiyani et al. [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, CIP2A expression can be controlled by the transcription factor Elk-1 in TNBC cells [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p id="p0035">In contrast, SET inhibits PP2A activity <italic>via</italic> binding to both N-terminus and C-terminus regions of PP2A [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that SET activates the transcription factor AP-1, downregulates Akt signaling, inhibits the DNase activity of NM23-H1 tumor-suppressor, or negatively regulates p53 acetylation result in its suppression [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>]. Given the importance of PP2A inhibition in maintaining the activation c-Myc- and Akt-driven oncogenic survival signals, CIP2A and SET are attractive and potential therapeutic targets for cancer therapy. Collectively, restoring PP2A activity, such as by PP2A-activating drugs (for example a peptide drug OP449, and a sphingolipid analogue FTY720), has been implicated as a potential anti-cancer strategy [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>].</p><p id="p0040">In the present study, we found SET and CIP2A were upregulated in TNBC patients and the gene expression level of SET was positively correlated with that of CIP2A. SET- or CIP2A- overexpressing TNBC cells demonstrated increased cell viability, migration, and invasion. Moreover, we noted that ERK inhibition increased PP2A activity. Since that PP2A is known for dephosphorylating (inactivating) ERK [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], whereas ERK phosphorylation is also crucial for Elk-1 activation (phosphorylation) and nuclear translocation [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>], therefore we hypothesized an oncogenic feedforward loop consisting of pERK/pElk-1/CIP2A/PP2A. We validated the loop by knockdown of PP2A and ectopic expression of Elk-1. In addition, ectopic expression of SET increased pAkt, pERK, pElk-1 and CIP2A expressions. We then used TD19, a novel SET/PP2A protein-protein interaction inhibitor that has been reported to induce cancer cell apoptosis by increasing PP2A activity [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>], to decipher the potential relevance of SET and CIP2A in TNBC. We found that this SET antagonist TD19 exerted anti-tumor effects through inhibiting SET-PP2A interaction and CIP2A/PP2A/pAkt-mediated pathway. We concluded that a novel oncogenic CIP2A-feedforward loop contributes to TNBC progression and targeting SET to disrupt this oncogenic CIP2A loop showed therapeutic potential in TNBC.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0030"><label>2.1</label><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p id="p0045">SET antagonist TD19 (EMQA), a derivative of erlotinib with chemical name of N<sup>4</sup>-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-N<sup>2</sup>-(4-phenoxyphenyl) quinazoline-2,4-diamine), was kindly provided from Dr. Chung-Wai Shiau's lab.

CIP2A gene alterations, including copy number variation and mRNA dysregulation, were linked to poor disease-free survival (DFS) but not overall survival (OS). SET gene alterations showed a trend toward poor OS (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Upregulation of mRNA is the highest alteration frequency of CIP2A and SET gene (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Moreover, samples with CIP2A or SET gene amplification or mRNA upregulation also harbored higher corresponding transcripts level compared with those without (Supplementary Fig. 1c). However, CIP2A or SET mRNA upregulations were not significantly associated with lower OS and DFS in TNBC patients (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c).

We hypothesized the presence of ERK/Elk-1/CIP2A/PP2A oncogenic loop (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a). To validate this hypothesis, we analyzed the molecular events within TD19 treatment. TD19 suppressed pERK, pElk-1, CIP2A and pAkt as well as induced cell apoptosis which were restored by PP2Ac knockdown, Elk-1 and SET expression in MDA-MB-468 cells (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>b-d and Supplementary Fig. 5a-c). SET knockdown downregulated pERK, pElk-1, CIP2A and pAkt while did not increase apoptotic cells. Furthermore, TD19 could still induce apoptosis in the background of SET knockdown, albeit slightly reduced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 5d). These data indicated that TD19, at least in part, exerted its anti-TNBC activity through disrupting SET and CIP2A/PP2A/ERK/Elk-1 loop and thus downstream pAkt.

We discovered that a positive feedforward loop of CIP2A composed of CIP2A, PP2A, pERK and pElk-1 contributed to CIP2A expression. Furthermore, this CIP2A feedforward loop can be disrupted by a SET protein-protein interaction inhibitor, TD19. SET inhibitor TD19 induced cell apoptosis <italic>via</italic> ERK/Elk-1/CIP2A axis which elicited PP2A activity and inactivation of Akt (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>g).</p><p id="p0180">SET protein, first characterized in acute undifferentiated leukemia in 1994 [<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], is later found to be an intrinsic cellular inhibitor of PP2A [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. SET has been known as an oncoprotein that is overexpressed in various cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia [<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], lymphoid malignancies [<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], head and neck cancers [<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], NSCLC [<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Retrospectively, CIP2A level is elevated in TNBC and serves as prognostic marker of TNBC [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Here, we showed the clinical significance of SET in TNBC. Our results exhibited both of SET and CIP2A were upregulated in TNBC tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and linked with poor overall survival (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Overexpression of SET or CIP2A promoted cell viability, migration and invasion of TNBC cells (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Although SET may promote cancer aggressiveness though other interacting partners, such as inhibition of the tumor suppressor NM23-H1 [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and p53 [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], or forming fusion proteins [<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], the interaction of SET with PP2A has drawn a major attention in the development of anti-cancer strategies [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Recently, Hung has nicely reviewed the biological role, clinical relevance and potential therapeutic implication of SET protein in cancers [<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p id="p0185">Notably, currently there have been several available drugs/compounds aiming to interfere with the interaction of SET and PP2A, such as a sphingosine analogue fingolimod (FTY720) [<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], an apolipoprotein E [<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], peptide mimetic OP449 (also named COG449) [<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and TD19 [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. FTY720 is an approved drug for multiple sclerosis, a devastating neurological disease characterized by chronic neuronal inflammatory demyelination of the central nervous system. The mechanism of action claimed for multiple sclerosis therapy is that FTY720 acts as a modulator of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1P-R) on the surface of lymphocytes, prevents egress of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs, and thus ameliorates CNS infiltration of these lymphocytes [<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Although FTY720 has been demonstrated as a SET/PP2A protein-protein interaction inhibitor, this &#x0201c;off-target&#x0201d; mechanism of action remains in preclinical model and FTY720 has not yet been tested in clinical trials as an anti-cancer drug. In contrast, OP449 was designated as a SET/PP2A protein-protein interaction inhibitor [<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and its anti-cancer efficacy has been tested in several preclinical cancer models [<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], including breast cancer [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="p0190">ERK inhibitor suppressed CIP2A and induced PP2A activity in TNBC cells (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). High protein level of ERK in patients with TNBC is associated with short overall survival [<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Mounting evidence mentions that targeting Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy for TNBC [<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Antagonizing inhibitors of PP2A is considered as a therapeutic strategy of TNBC. TD19 disrupted the interaction between SET and PP2A, enhanced PP2A activity and inactivated ERK and Elk-1. In addition, TD19 dephosphorylated Akt as well as induced cell apoptosis (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Recently, a phase II trial demonstrates that adding an Akt inhibitor ipatasertib to paclitaxel enhances efficacy in patients with metastatic TNBC; patients receiving ipatasertib plus paclitaxel has longer progression-free survival than patients who received paclitaxel alone [<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These findings indicate the need for further investigations of the efficacy of Akt-inhibiting agents in TNBC [<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. TD19 elevated PP2A activity which dephosphorylating ERK and Akt. Therefore, that TD19 indirectly inactivated ERK and Akt may also impair TNBC progression.</p><p id="p0195">Despite that it is not our aim to compare the efficacies of these PP2A-activity modulators (TD19, ERK inhibitor, and forskolin), we used these agents with different mechanisms to demonstrate the existence of a novel CIP2A/PP2A/pERK/pElk-1 feedforward loop, and that interfering SET could perturb this loop. In terms of mechanisms of action, forskolin has been known as a cAMP inducer and reduces phosphorylation of PP2Ac at Tyr307 on the C-terminal tail of PP2A C-subunit, thereby activating PP2A [<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The finding that ERK inhibitor (SCH772984) increased PP2A activity is novel and has led us to discover the CIP2A/PP2A/pERK/Elk-1 feedforward loop. In contrast, TD19, of which chemical structure was derived from erlotinib with distinct different drug effect, has been shown increasing PP2A activity by interfering SET/PP2A protein-protein interaction [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Interestingly, forskolin has been shown induce apoptosis though its cAMP-induction, ERK inhibitor (SCH772984) can induce apoptosis through ERK inhibition [<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In contrast, TD19 induced apoptosis, at least in part, through disrupting SET and CIP2A/PP2A/pERK/pElk-1 loop and thus downstream pAkt. Collectively, the magnitude of PP2A activity increment <italic>in vitro</italic> might not necessarily well-correlated with apoptosis induction.</p><p id="p0200">Our data suggested the presence of pERK/pElk-1/CIP2A/PP2A oncogenic loop, and TD19 could interfere with this regulation (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The potential of inhibitors which targeting both of CIP2A and SET simultaneously is valuable evaluated for cancer treatment [<xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Previous studies also mention that the existence of a positive CIP2A/c-Myc/E2F1 positive feedback loop in chronic myeloid leukemia. SET has been reported inhibiting c-Myc degradation and stabilizing E2F1 through PP2A inhibition. Therefore, SET might participate in the regulation of CIP2A/c-Myc/E2F1 axis [<xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p id="p0205">Several studies revealed that SET/PP2A signaling participated in the regulation of drug resistance. SET-suppressed NDRG1 mediates cisplatin resistance in human lung cancer cells [<xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Knockdown of SET promotes cisplatin sensitivity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [<xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. PP2A inhibition determines poor outcome and doxorubicin resistance in early breast cancer and its activation shows promising therapeutic effects [<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Our data showed that combination of TD19 and cisplatin exhibited a synergistic effect in TNBC cells (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Similarly, TD19 also enhances the chemosensitivity of NSCLC cells to paclitaxel [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our finding that TD19 enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) has particularly clinical relevance. Recently a large randomized phase III trial &#x02018;the Triple Negative Breast Cancer Trial&#x02019; compared first-line treatment of either carboplatin or docetaxel in 376 patients with metastatic TNBC, and found that in subjects with germline-BRCA mutation, carboplatin had double the overall response rate of docetaxel (68% <italic>versus</italic> 33%, respectively; biomarker, treatment interaction <italic>P</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;.01) [<xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A retrospective study of Chinese population showed that platinum-based chemotherapy, in particular cisplatin-based regimens using at the first line may improve ORR and progression-free survival (PFS), but not overall survival. These clinical results suggest the clinical benefit of platinums (including cisplatin) in metastatic TNBC but also indicate a room for improving therapeutic benefit of platinums. Both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells have been reported to harbor BRCA allelic loss but without BRCA mutations [<xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. According to Lehmann [<xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], MDA-MB-468 belongs to basal-like subtype (by Lehmann's classification) and more sensitive to cisplatin, whereas MDA-MB-231 is mesenchymal like subtype, and less sensitive to cisplatin (comparing to MDA-MB-468). In line with Lehmann, our data showed that either in cisplatin-sensitive MDA-MB-468 or less sensitive MDA-MB-231 cells, targeting SET to disrupt CIP2A/PP2A/pAkt signaling is a feasible strategy to enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity, suggesting the possibility to test such combination strategy in future studies.</p><p id="p0210">Our current study exerts some limitation, first the detail mechanisms of action of the SET/PP2Ac interaction inhibitor TD19 remains to be fully illustrated, such as whether TD19 influences the binding of other PP2A interactors. Moreover, our data show that TD19 induces apoptosis partly <italic>via</italic> SET and CIP2A/PP2A/pERK/pElk-1 axis, other unidentified pathways may also contribute to the anti-cancer activity of TD19. There are still unsolved questions and future studies are needed to fully decipher the relevant networks in SET, CIP2A and PP2A.</p><p id="p0215">In summary, we discover a novel oncogenic CIP2A-feedforward loop in TNBC and targeting SET to disrupt oncogenic CIP2A feedforward loop shows therapeutic potential in TNBC.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
