In this study, we investigated the photosensitized intramolecular cycloaddition of partially-protected thymidylyl-(3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032;)-<italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-acetyl-2&#x02032;-deoxy-5-methylcytidine, to clarify the effect of the base modification on the cycloaddition reaction. The reaction resulted in the stereoselective formation of the <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPD, followed by hydrolysis of the acetylamino group. The same result was obtained for the photocycloaddition of thymidylyl-(3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032;)-<italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-acetyl-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine, whereas both the <italic>cis-syn</italic> and <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPDs were formed from thymidylyl-(3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032;)-thymidine. Kinetic analyses revealed that the activation energy of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis is comparable to that reported for the thymine-cytosine CPD. These findings provided a new strategy for the synthesis of oligonucleotides containing the <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPD. Using the synthesized oligonucleotide, translesion synthesis by human DNA polymerase &#x003b7; was analyzed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the field of organic synthesis, cycloaddition reactions are versatile and well-studied methods to form carbon&#x02013;carbon covalent bonds. They include the [2&#x02009;+&#x02009;2] cycloaddition by light irradiation, the Diels&#x02013;Alder reaction by heating, and the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition using metal catalysts. Among such reactions, the [2&#x02009;+&#x02009;2] cycloaddition, in which 4&#x003c0; electrons of two double bonds participate in the formation of a four-membered ring, is widely used for the construction of the core four-membered ring in natural products and for the introduction of functional groups by rearrangement via the heterolytic opening of the strained four-membered ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>).</p><p>DNA is an organic molecule that undergoes the [2&#x02009;+&#x02009;2] cycloaddition reaction as well as other chemical reactions. The major reaction occurs between the C5&#x02013;C6 double bonds of adjacent pyrimidine bases when they are exposed to environmental ultraviolet light, which results in the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), a major type of UV-induced lesions. The structure of the CPD can be categorized into four types, namely <italic>cis-syn</italic>, <italic>trans-syn</italic>, <italic>cis-anti</italic> and <italic>trans-anti</italic>, depending on the spatial alignment of the two bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Among these four structures, the <italic>cis-syn</italic> CPD is predominantly formed in double-stranded DNA, due to geometric constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPD, which is formed by UVB and UVC at partially distorted regions within DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>), is the second major stereoisomer of this photoproduct. This type of CPD is reportedly recognized by proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). The <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPD is a substrate for DNA repair enzymes, such as DNA photolyase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and T4 endonuclease V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), although the repair efficiency was much lower than that for the <italic>cis-syn</italic> CPD. UvrA and XPE, which are the prokaryotic and human proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair, respectively, bound to this CPD with an affinity comparable to that for other UV lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Other types of CPD structures are reportedly formed between non-adjacent bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). UV irradiation of a single-stranded oligonucleotide in an acidic solution and the telomeric G-quadruplex structure yielded the <italic>cis-anti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and <italic>trans-anti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) CPDs, respectively, with the latter formed in the loop region. These findings imply that the other types of CPD structures are biologically significant, in addition to the <italic>cis-syn</italic> CPD that has been exclusively studied.

UV irradiation of thymidylyl-(3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032;)-thymidine (TpT) reportedly yielded a mixture of the <italic>cis-syn</italic> and <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPDs in an 8:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), while UV irradiation of thymidylyl-(3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032;)-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine (TpdC) yielded a complicated mixture of three stereoisomers, i.e. <italic>cis-syn</italic> with the ANTI-ANTI conformation around the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bonds of the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-components, respectively, <italic>trans-syn</italic> with the SYN-ANTI conformation, and <italic>trans-syn</italic> with the ANTI-SYN conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), in a 4:3:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In the case of TpdC, it is well known that the exocyclic amino group at the C4 position of the cytosine base is subjected to rapid hydrolysis after the CPD formation, and the cytosine-containing CPD is converted to a uracil-containing one under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), which causes a C&#x02192;T transition mutation as a result of its reversal by UV or by the incorporation of dA by human DNA polymerase &#x003b7; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The rate constants of the deamination reaction are reportedly 2.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 6.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for the <italic>cis-syn</italic> and <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPDs of TpdC, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), which are similar to the values obtained for dCpT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In contrast, the attachment of a methyl group to the C5 position of the cytosine base (<italic>R</italic><sup>1</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;CH<sub>3</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) reduces the deamination rate of the cytosine-containing CPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and thus the methylcytosine-containing CPD was utilized to analyze the biochemical properties of yeast DNA polymerase &#x003b7; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, the CPD formation by a cytosine base modified at the amino group has not been reported. A modification at this position can influence the rate of hydrolytic deamination, because the basicity of the leaving group (R<sup>2</sup>NH<sub>2</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) as well as the electron density of the carbon atom that is attacked by a water molecule should be changed. Moreover, it is worthwhile to investigate whether the modification at this position affects the stereoselectivity of CPD formation. Here, we report the effect of the base modification on the cycloaddition reaction, by using thymidylyl-(3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032;)-2&#x02032;-deoxy-<italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-acetyl-5-methylcytidine. We found that UV irradiation of this compound in the presence of a photosensitizer exclusively afforded the cyclobutane thymine dimer (TT-CPD) with the <italic>trans-syn</italic> structure. The intermediate that putatively contained the acetylamino group after the cycloaddition reaction was more stable in neutral solutions than under acidic conditions, which indicated that the acetyl group facilitated the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>General methods</title><p>Reagents for the DNA synthesizer were purchased from Applied Biosystems Japan (Tokyo, Japan) and Glen Research (Sterling, VA, USA).

Since 5-methylcytosine is converted to thymine by hydrolytic deamination, 2&#x02032;-deoxy-5-methylcytidine was employed in this study, instead of 2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine, to facilitate the determination of the stereochemistry of the resultant CPD, which has the same structure as that derived from two thymine bases, by HPLC and NMR analyses. We chose the acetyl group for the modification of the exocyclic amino function of 5-methylcytosine, because this group is relatively small and lacks aromatic rings, which absorb the light energy and disturb the photoreaction. Since the acetyl group is an electron-withdrawing functional group, it was expected that the hydrolysis of the amino group in this type of CPD would occur more rapidly than that of the unmodified amino group.

The starting material (<bold>5</bold>, Rt 9.7&#x02009;min, peak i) was converted to new products that gave a pair of peaks with longer retention times of 15.5&#x02009;min and 21.7&#x02009;min (peaks ii-a and ii-b, respectively).

After deprotection, a single peak was detected at a retention time of 8&#x02009;min, and the product from the compound yielding peak iii-a was identical to that from peak iii-b.

We found that the photosensitized cycloaddition of TpdmC<sup>ac</sup> (<bold>5</bold>) resulted in the stereoselective formation of the <italic>trans-syn</italic> TT-CPD with the SYN-ANTI conformation. The conversion from 5-methylcytosine to thymine was caused by the hydrolysis of saturated <italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-acetyl-5-methylcytosine after the CPD formation. The kinetic analysis of this hydrolysis reaction demonstrated that the reaction depends on both pH and temperature, as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The intermediate with the acetylamino group was found to be more stable in a neutral solution than in an acidic solution. This result implies that protonation of the N3 imino function of the 5-methylcytosine derivative triggers the hydrolysis, followed by rapid dissociation of acetamide. An analysis of the temperature dependence revealed that the activation energy of the hydrolysis reaction at pH 5.9 was 29.5&#x02009;kJ&#x02009;mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which was comparable to that reported for a dinucleoside monophosphate of the <italic>trans-syn</italic> TC-CPD (69.7&#x02009;kJ&#x02009;mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Since an increase in the ionic strength of the solution reportedly accelerates the hydrolytic deamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), these activation energy values cannot be compared to each other. Nonetheless, the lower activation energy obtained in this study indicates that the hydrolysis of the intermediate is accelerated by the acetyl group, even in the presence of the C5 methyl group that stabilizes the amino function against hydrolysis.</p><p>The cycloaddition of the <italic>N</italic>-acetylated compounds <bold>5</bold> and <bold>8</bold>, with and without the C5 methyl group, respectively, occurred in a highly stereoselective manner to yield the common CPD structure, namely <italic>trans-syn</italic> with the SYN-ANTI conformation. An essential question is how the acetyl group regulates the stereoselectivity in the CPD formation. Since the obtained CPD structure is determined by the alignment of the two bases when the reaction occurs, a possible explanation is that the stereoselective formation of the TT- and TU-CPDs in the presence of the <italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-acetyl modification is caused by steric hindrance by the acetyl group. It may be unfavorable for the two bases to adopt the <italic>cis</italic> structure when one of them bears the acetyl group (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH4">Scheme 4</xref>). In contrast, when the two bases are present in the <italic>trans</italic> structure, the acetyl group does not hinder the two C5&#x02013;C6 double bonds from approaching each other to form the cyclobutane ring. This relative positioning of the two bases for the cycloaddition probably allows the stereoselective formation of the <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPD.
<fig id="SCH4" position="float"><label>Scheme 4.</label><caption><p>A possible mechanism for the stereoselective formation of the <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPD.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkq855s4"/></fig></p><p>In contrast to the abundant physicochemical and biochemical studies on the CPD, the stereo-controlled formation of the CPD has not been investigated. In the preparation of a phosphoramidite building block for the conventional solid-phase synthesis of CPD-containing oligonucleotides, it has been pointed out that the photosensitized cyclobutane formation in a properly-protected dinucleoside monophosphate usually yields a mixture of more than four diastereomers, due to the presence of two or three CPD structures and the chirality of the internucleoside phosphotriester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), and laborious manipulation to separate these products is required at this step. Taylor and co-workers addressed this problem by using a diastereomerically pure phosphoramidite at the coupling step, which could exclude the formation of diastereomers caused by the phosphorus chirality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), or by separating the <italic>cis-syn</italic> and <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPDs after deprotection of the oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Carell and co-workers used a CPD-like lesion in which the internucleoside phosphate was replaced with a formacetal linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) or a compound without a linkage between the sugar moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Both of these approaches sought to resolve the problem by removing the chiral phosphorus atom. On the other hand, regulation of the stereochemistry in the cyclobutane ring formation is straightforward but challenging, and the present study supports the possibility of a new strategy. In this study, the <italic>trans-syn</italic> TT- and TU-CPDs were obtained by the cycloaddition of dinucleoside monophosphates containing <italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-acetyl-5-methylcytosine and <italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-acetylcytosine, respectively. It should be noted that the <italic>trans-syn</italic> TU-CPD was not obtained in our previous study on the synthesis of oligonucleotides containing the <italic>cis-syn</italic> TU-CPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Although the starting materials and the products in the cycloaddition reaction are the diastereomers caused by the internucleoside phosphotriester, this reaction is still advantageous, because the separation of these diastereomers is not essential for the oligonucleotide synthesis. The chiral phosphotriester is finally converted to a non-chiral phosphodiester by deprotection.</p><p>One of the oligonucleotides containing the <italic>trans-syn</italic> TT-CPD synthesized in this study was used for the analysis of the TLS by hPol &#x003b7;, which is encoded by the <italic>XPV</italic> (xeroderma pigmentosum variant) gene and is responsible for the error-free replication past the <italic>cis-syn</italic> TT-CPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). We found that hPol &#x003b7; was almost stalled after incorporation of dAMP opposite the 3&#x02032;-component of the <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPD. Since the base orientation of the 5&#x02032;-component is fixed in the SYN conformation, there may be a steric hindrance when this lesion enters the active site of the enzyme, and the 5&#x02032;-component cannot make a base pair with the incoming nucleotide even if it can fit the active site. This is an example showing that the stereochemistry of a biomolecule affects its biological property.</p><p>In conclusion, we investigated the cycloaddition reaction between thymine and <italic>N</italic>-acetylated 5-methylcytosine, and found that the reaction proceeded in a diastereoselective manner to yield the <italic>trans-syn</italic> CPD with the SYN-ANTI conformation. In addition, the acetylamino group was hydrolyzed more rapidly than the unmodified amino group. These findings provided an efficient method for the synthesis of oligonucleotides containing this type of UV lesion. Further studies, including experiments using other types of modifications, are required to elucidate the mechanism that generates this stereoselectivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq855/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p>
