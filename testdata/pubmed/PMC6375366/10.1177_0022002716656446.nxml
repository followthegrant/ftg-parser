The decision of whether to promote competition or equality is often debated in societies and organizations. With heterogeneous endowments, we let subjects collectively choose between a public good that most benefits the less endowed and a lottery contest in which only one individual in a group receives a prize. Unlike standard theoretical predictions, the majority of subjects, including a substantial number of subjects who believe that their expected payoffs are better in the contest, vote for the public good. Our data suggest that people&#x02019;s collective institutional choices may be driven by inequality-averse concerns. It also suggests that the collective decision to select the option for the public good depends on voting rules.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>experiment</kwd><kwd>cooperation</kwd><kwd>competition</kwd><kwd>public goods</kwd><kwd>inequality</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The prevalence of heterogeneous resources is one of the most fundamental features of our organizations and societies today (e.g., <xref rid="bibr36-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Stiglitz 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Piketty 2014</xref>). For example, there are wide income gaps within societies. The Gini coefficient of household disposable incomes is on average 0.31 even in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries (<xref rid="bibr30-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2013</xref>). Moreover, inequality across regions in many countries is increasing over time (see, e.g., <xref rid="bibr5-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin and Wyplosz 2015</xref> for regional disparity in the United Kingdom). It is also often the case that the distribution of resources is skewed to the right. While the heterogeneity of resources has some positive aspects such as the potential to increase material gains for some people, it nonetheless has negative aspects. For instance, inequality in society or regions often leads to serious intragroup conflicts. We therefore face a difficult collective decision: as a society or a country, should we promote competition by which ex post inequality may be enhanced? Or should we enhance equality by offering some mechanism that assists the less endowed?</p><p>People&#x02019;s collective choices on policies have important consequences for resulting norms, people&#x02019;s behaviors, and the degree of intragroup conflicts in a society. For example, inequality can be enhanced by policies and as a result may increase antisocial behavior, such as violent crime in metropolitan counties in the United States (e.g., <xref rid="bibr24-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Kelly 2000</xref>). The government could enrich education programs for the poor or introduce social welfare programs, such as unemployment benefits, in order to alleviate poverty, while reducing programs that promote competition, such as subsidies to firms. This kind of policy change could help reduce the income gap and may create a fairer society. However, it may displease more well-off individuals who would not benefit from such a scheme. The negative consequences of inequality are also serious in less developed countries. For instance, if existing regional inequalities were magnified by official policies, it may result in political conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., <xref rid="bibr29-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">&#x000d8;stby, Nord&#x000e5;s, and R&#x000f8;d 2009</xref>). Also, some firms offer incentive schemes such as tournaments, which may contribute to increasing the productivity of workers. Such competition-oriented policies may, however, lead to more uncooperative behaviors among workers (e.g., <xref rid="bibr1-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Akerlof and Yellen 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Trevor, Reilly, and Gerhart 2012</xref>).</p><p>In modern democratic societies, people have the right to choose their preferred policies either directly or indirectly through votes. Given the fact that very wealthy people account for a small percentage of the population, one might expect that most countries or organizations would employ strong redistributive or cooperative policies. In reality, however, a large degree of redistribution is rarely observed. For instance, there has been an overall trend to reduce tax rates for high-income groups over the last several decades in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom (e.g., <xref rid="bibr32-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Piketty and Saez 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr3-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr2-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Alvaredo et al. 2013</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022002716656446">1</xref></sup> Field observations such as this may not reflect the population&#x02019;s collective distributional preferences. For example, the literature on political economy explains that moderate redistributive policies could result from political processes such as low voter turnout rates among low-income people, party loyalty, and electoral competition in representative democracy (<xref rid="bibr20-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Harms and Zink 2003</xref> for a survey). It is also possible that the less endowed may in fact prefer light redistributive policies for various reasons. For instance, they may tolerate inequality if they have a prospect of upward mobility (<xref rid="bibr20-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Harms and Zink 2003</xref>, 657-65). In recent decades, scholars have actively studied people&#x02019;s collective institutional choices using laboratory experiments. However, little attention has yet been paid to people&#x02019;s collective preferences for implementing either competitive or cooperative institutions within a heterogeneously endowed group, and this question remains to be empirically answered.</p><p>Exploring the behavioral principles behind people&#x02019;s collective choices on this topic is not straightforward, however. First, previous extensive experiments have found that some individuals have other regarding preferences such as inequality aversion (see <xref rid="bibr17-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Fehr and Schmidt 2006</xref> for a survey). For example, some people may enjoy higher non-material gains if the payoffs are similar to each other. Therefore, we cannot infer people&#x02019;s institutional choices only from material incentives. Second, recent experiments have shown that egalitarian subjects&#x02014;those who prefer fair distribution of payoffs&#x02014;are more likely to avoid competitive environments when self-selecting environments in real-effort experiments (e.g., <xref rid="bibr6-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Bartling et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr4-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Balafoutas, Kerschbamer, and Sutter 2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022002716656446">2</xref></sup> The more egalitarian preferences they have, the less likely they may be to support competitive institutions in the context of this study. The voting decisions of egalitarian individuals may nonetheless depend on the degree of material incentives offered under a competitive regime. Even a person strongly averse to inequality might support a competitive institution if the potential benefits from competition were sufficiently high. In addition, people&#x02019;s voting decisions may depend on the size of their endowments because material and non-material incentives differ according to endowment size. Third, other regarding preferences in risky situations constitute a new research area that remains to be explored. The selection of a competitive institution involves a risk whereby people receive lower returns if they lose the competition. People&#x02019;s decisions might be based on ex ante payoffs (i.e., opportunities), ex post payoffs, or a mix of the two (e.g., <xref rid="bibr8-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Brock, Lange, and Ozbay 2013</xref>). Fourth, a wealth of literature shows that in situations where subjects&#x02019; resources are unbalanced, the amounts of resources and subjects&#x02019; levels of cooperativeness are negatively correlated (e.g., <xref rid="bibr10-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Maurice, Rouaix, and Willinger 2013</xref>). This tension between highly endowed and less endowed members may be sufficiently severe to inspire the collective preference for a more competitive environment.</p><p>We conducted an experiment in order to study people&#x02019;s collective institutional choices between a competitive scheme versus a public good scheme that helps the less endowed more when endowments are unequally distributed. A novel feature of our design is to let subjects collectively select one of two fundamentally different institutions within each of which the same endowments are used. Subjects are randomly assigned endowments, with the distribution being unbalanced within their groups. Each group then has to collectively choose a regime designed to serve the public good or a lottery contest regime by voting. If a group implements the public good, each member decides how much to contribute for their group. The total contributions are doubled and are then redistributed, so that subjects with smaller endowments receive more from the public account. By contrast, if a group selects the contest option, then the members compete for a prize. Under this regime, each member decides how many points they want to allocate to their lottery account. The more points a subject assigns to the account, the more likely he or she is to win the competition and receive the prize. Only one member wins the competition. Thus, subjects would experience greater ex post inequality if this regime is selected. The policy implementation and subjects&#x02019; interaction under collectively selected regimes are one-shot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022002716656446">3</xref></sup>
</p><p>Our data show that the majority of subjects prefer to serve the public good, contrary to the standard theoretical prediction. This study also reveals that a substantial number of subjects who believe that the material incentives under the contest are higher actually vote for the public good. A comparison of the distributions of payoffs suggests that subjects&#x02019; votes may be driven by inequality-averse motives. The average Gini coefficients of realized payoffs within groups are significantly smaller with the public good than with the contest scenario. Moreover, subjects on average believe that payoffs are more equally distributed among members if a public good is created. Two clear results were found regarding groups&#x02019; collective vote outcomes. First, the majority of groups selected the public good even when there was a higher level of efficiency under the contest regime than under the public good regime. Second, however, the likelihood of the public good being adopted largely depends on which voting rule is used. This study found that the public good is less likely to be selected if highly endowed subjects have higher voting power.</p><sec id="section1-0022002716656446"><title>Experimental Design</title><p>The experiment consisted of two phases.

Our study consists of three main treatments, which will be referred to as &#x0201c;choice treatments&#x0201d; in the article. We also conducted one control treatment, whereby a public good was exogenously imposed in phase 2 in order to check whether the democratic decision-making process influences subjects&#x02019; behaviors in the allocation stage (<xref rid="table1-0022002716656446" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1-0022002716656446" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of Treatments.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022002716656446-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" colspan="1">Treatment</th><th rowspan="3" colspan="1">Prize size in a lottery contest</th><th rowspan="3" colspan="1">Number of sessions</th><th rowspan="3" colspan="1">Number of groups (subjects)</th><th colspan="5" rowspan="1">Standard theoretical predictions under the risk-neutral preference</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1">Allocation amounts</th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1">Payoff</th><th rowspan="2" colspan="1">Voting</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Public good</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lottery contest</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Public good</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lottery contest</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="9" rowspan="1">Choice treatments</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" colspan="1">&#x02003;L</td><td rowspan="3" colspan="1">50 Points</td><td rowspan="3" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="3" colspan="1">15 (75)</td><td align="center" rowspan="3" colspan="1">

In each group, one subject received fifty points, two subjects each received twenty points, and the remaining two were given ten points each. The assignment of endowments was random: the probabilities with which they received fifty, twenty, and ten points were 1/5, 2/5, and 2/5, respectively. We refer to the set of subjects who were given fifty, twenty, and ten points as sets <italic>H</italic>, <italic>M</italic>, and <italic>L</italic>, respectively. Note that the endowments of set <italic>M</italic> and set <italic>L</italic> subjects were less than the average in their groups, which was 22 ([= 50 + 20 &#x000d7; 2 + 10 &#x000d7; 2]/5).</p><p>In the three choice treatments, the Low, High, and Very High treatments&#x02014;dubbed L, H, and VH&#x02014;phase 2 began with subjects deciding whether to create a public good or to implement a lottery contest. Subjects subsequently stated their beliefs regarding the other four members&#x02019; votes. In order to avoid a hedging problem, the belief elicitation task was not incentivized. Either the public good or the contest was then collectively implemented in accordance with the result of the voting, and each subject also made an allocation decision under the selected regime. (In the control treatment, which is called the &#x0201c;Exogenous public good treatment,&#x0201d; subjects did not vote on the two regimes; they only decided how much to contribute to their group&#x02019;s public goods.) Once all of the subjects had decided on the allocation amounts, they submitted beliefs regarding the other four members&#x02019; allocation amounts before being informed of the outcomes of the allocation stage. As in the first belief elicitation task, this elicitation task was not incentivized. However, at the end of the experiment, just before they were informed of the outcome of the allocation stage, subjects were asked to answer incentivized questions concerning risk attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022002716656446">4</xref></sup>

Examples include government support for education for the poor and voluntary mentoring programs for employees in corporations. Redistributive programs, such as social welfare provisions in countries and poverty alleviation programs in international organizations, may also have this property if the poor utilize received sources to improve their education and/or health and accordingly productivity among the poor rises. If a public good is created, each group member simultaneously decides how much to allocate to their private account and to the public account. The contribution amounts must be integers between 0 and their assigned endowments (50, 20, or 10). A subject receives one point for each point that she allocates to her private account. The allocation to the public account, by contrast, is doubled and redistributed among group members: 25 percent of the amounts are given to each of the two set <italic>L</italic> subjects, 20 percent of them are given to each of the two set <italic>M</italic> subjects, and 10 percent of them are given to the set <italic>H</italic> subject (note that 25 percent &#x000d7; 2 + 20 percent &#x000d7; 2 + 10 percent = 100 percent). In other words, the less endowment a member has, the more the member receives from the public account. This kind of redistribution rule is found, for example, in education programs and public welfare assistance to help the poor. In firms, voluntary &#x0201c;buddies&#x0201d; programs tend to help less-skilled workers more than highly skilled workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022002716656446">5</xref></sup>

The Gini coefficient of the equilibrium expected payoffs with the standard theoretical assumption is .327 under the public good regime (five members&#x02019; payoffs are 50, 20, 20, 10, 10), .300 under the contest regime with a prize of 50 (five members&#x02019; payoffs are 52, 22, 22, 12, 12), .292 under the contest regime with a prize of 110 (five members&#x02019; payoffs are 57.5, 27.2, 27.2, 13.6, 13.6), and .327 under the contest regime with a prize of 220 (five members&#x02019; payoffs are 100, 40, 40, 20, 20). Therefore, in a situation in which all subjects behave selfishly, the public good regime has more unequal ex ante expected payoff distribution than the contest regime in the L and H treatments. This implies that if ex ante equality is more important to subjects than ex post equality, they will not vote for the public good in these two treatments unless Prediction 2a holds.

In particular, the contest regime in the H or VH treatment generates a higher expected return, but subjects may perceive it as being more risky, as they believe that larger amounts must be invested to win the competition.

We could expect that the presence of the endogenous process may make subjects vote for the public good, assuming that some subjects have non-standard preferences. These endogenous effects alone do not explain subjects&#x02019; collective institutional choices, however. The average contribution amounts to the public good were, in fact, slightly lower in the three choice treatments than in the Exogenous public good treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022002716656446">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that the democratic process is not the most important factor that drives subjects&#x02019; institutional choices in this environment. This result, along with Results 1 and 5 to 9, suggests that it is more reasonable for us to interpret the voting decisions made by some subjects&#x02014;especially set <italic>M</italic> subjects and some set <italic>H</italic> subjects&#x02014;as their dislike for an unequal distribution of payoffs among members.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section13-0022002716656446"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This article provides the first experimental evidence concerning people&#x02019;s collective choices between a policy that helps the less endowed to a greater degree&#x02014;a public good regime&#x02014;and a policy that promotes competition&#x02014;a lottery contest regime&#x02014;in a situation where the resources of individuals are unequally distributed. In the experiment, around 70 percent of the subjects voted for the public good. Subjects with medium-sized and high endowments believed that their expected payoffs would be higher if they selected the contest in which the size of the prize was large. Nevertheless, a substantial number of subjects in the two categories supported the public good. As a result, the public good was selected in most groups, even when the prize size in the contest was high and accordingly the efficiency was in fact higher with the contest than that with the public good.</p><p>A closer look at our data reveals that the voting behavior of some of the subjects&#x02014;especially those with medium-sized or high endowments&#x02014;can be explained by inequality-averse concerns. The distributions of payoffs within groups&#x02014;not only for ex post payoffs but also for ex ante expected payoffs based on subjects&#x02019; beliefs&#x02014;were more equal with the public good than with the contest. It was also found that subjects&#x02019; believed Gini coefficients in the public good regime were negative predictors regarding their support for the public good.</p><p>Our article has two implications regarding people&#x02019;s collective institutional choices. First, the results suggest that people&#x02019;s inequality-averse motives may be strong enough to drive their collective institutional choices away from competitive rules. This implies that a competition scheme may not be collectively implemented in a society or an organization even though it may generate a materially better outcome than an alternative with a public good aspect. Second, recent papers, including <xref rid="bibr13-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Ertan, Page, and Putterman (2009)</xref>, <xref rid="bibr33-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Putterman, Tyran, and Kamei (2011)</xref>, and <xref rid="bibr23-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Kamei, Putterman, and Tyran (2015)</xref>, have shown that institutions which may materially benefit all members equally in social dilemmas while not sacrificing equality are more likely to be collectively selected when an equal voting rule is used because the majority of assenting votes outperform the minority of dissenting votes by antisocial individuals who favor the right to free ride. Our results suggest that competitive policies, even those that offer material benefits to people, may be <italic>less likely</italic> to be selected with an equal voting rule (compared with a weighted voting rule), when there is an alternative offering a public good aspect if the population&#x02019;s inequality-averse preferences are sufficiently strong and the competitive policies generate a greater inequality among people.</p><p>The second implication extends to the context of conflict resolution and postconflict peace building. In a postconflict country, if the leaders attempt to rebuild the country without addressing inequality among people, it may generate grievances resulting from people&#x02019;s strong preferences for equality as evidenced in the present study, which could lead to another conflict. Moreover, it is known that policies with public good aspects can mitigate conflicts in different situations. For instance, social welfare policies that reduce inequalities may contribute significantly to conflict resolution, including terrorism (e.g., <xref rid="bibr9-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Burgoon 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022002716656446">27</xref></sup> Our findings imply that strengthening democratic norms in the decision-making process could help resolve international and domestic conflicts, as policies with public good aspects are more likely to be collectively selected with a more democratic voting rule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022002716656446">28</xref></sup>
</p><p>We acknowledge that our result appears to contradict light or moderate redistributive policies currently observed in some societies or organizations. The reason for this discrepancy could be because the moderate redistributive policies seen in reality are the consequences of some political processes. Our experiment indeed shows that when the prize in a contest is high, the contest regime will be more easily selected when the rich group has more voting power. We could therefore conjecture that as the majority of people prefer cooperative policies over competitive policies when resources are heterogeneously distributed, policies may be pulled in a more redistributive direction in the long term if there is a trend of employing more democratic decision-making systems. Further experimental or empirical investigations, examining not only people&#x02019;s collective preferences but also the effects of political processes in relation to policy choices, are desirable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary

<xref rid="bibr26-0022002716656446" ref-type="bibr">Li (2005</xref>) shows that democratic participation, defined as voter turnout, is a negative predictor for a number of transnational terrorist incidents. He also shows the proportional representation system, compared with the majoritarian or mixed representative system, helps reduce such incidents. Part of the reason why democracy may reduce terrorist incidents may be that policies aimed at mitigating conflicts are more likely to be implemented with more democratic norms present as in our article.</p></fn></fn-group></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0022002716656446"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
