Some tetranoids (grouse spp.) species are particularly vulnerable to tall anthropogenic structures because they evolved in ecosystems void of vertical structures. In western North America, electric power transmission and distribution lines (power lines) occur in sagebrush (<italic>Artemisia</italic> spp.) landscapes within the range of the greater sage-grouse (<italic>Centrocercus urophasianus</italic>; sage-grouse). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommended using buffer zones near leks to mitigate the potential impacts of power lines on sage-grouse. However, recommended buffer distances are inconsistent across state and federal agencies because data are lacking. To address this, we evaluated the effects of power lines on sage-grouse breeding ecology within Utah, portions of southeastern Idaho, and southwestern Wyoming from 1998&#x02013;2013. Overall, power lines negatively affected lek trends up to a distance of 2.7 and 2.8 km, respectively. Power lines died not affect lek persistence. Female sage-grouse avoided transmission lines during the nesting and brooding seasons at distances up to 1.1 and 0.8 km, respectively. Nest and brood success were negatively affected by transmission lines up to distances of 2.6 and 1.1 km, respectively. Distribution lines did not appear to affect sage-grouse habitat selection or reproductive fitness. Our analyses demonstrated the value of sagebrush cover in mitigating potential power line impacts. Managers can minimize the effects of new transmission power lines by placing them in existing anthropogenic corridors and/or incorporating buffers at least 2.8 km from active leks. Given the uncertainty we observed in our analyses regarding sage-grouse response to distribution lines coupled with their role in providing electric power service directly to individual consumers, we recommend that buffers for these power lines be considered on a case-by-case basis. Micrositing to avoid important habitats and habitat reclamation may reduce the potential impacts of new power line construction.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Rocky Mountain Power/PacificCorp</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Utah Public Lands Policy Coordinating Office</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Jack H.

The infrastructure (e.g., roads, electrical lines) required to support this human population growth can negatively impact wildlife [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Anthropogenic structures constructed in previously unfragmented landscapes [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], can have direct and indirect effects on local wildlife populations [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, tall anthropogenic structures such as power lines and wind turbines can cause direct mortality due to wildlife collisions [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Anthropogenic development may also indirectly affect wildlife populations by causing changes in animal behavior (e.g., displacement [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]), increased predation risk [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], or by creating impediments to seasonal migration [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The magnitude and consequences of these behavioral changes are often difficult to measure due to the absence of immediate population level effects [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As such, identifying and quantifying both the direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic structures on wildlife as well as effective measures to minimize negative impacts are essential for conserving affected wildlife populations [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The greater sage-grouse (<italic>Centrocercus urophasianus</italic>; sage-grouse) is a sagebrush (<italic>Artemisia</italic> spp.) obligate species that requires large, intact sagebrush systems [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Populations have declined nearly 50% in portions of their historic range [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Some of the observed declines have been attributed to the construction, operation, and maintenance of anthropogenic infrastructure such as tall structures and associated linear features (i.e., energy developments, roads and power lines) [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Some tetranoids, including sage-grouse, may be particularly vulnerable to tall anthropogenic structures because they evolved in landscapes void of such structures [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The potential incompatibility between tetranoids and anthropogenic structures led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to identify the placement, operation, and maintenance of tall structures and associated linear features (i.e., roads and power lines) related to energy development and transmission in sagebrush habitats as a conservation threat for sage-grouse in their 2010 decision to designate the species as a candidate for protection under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. They concluded the placement of electric power lines in seasonal sage-grouse breeding habitats could impact local populations through increased predation of adults, juveniles, and nests or abandonment of suitable habitats.</p><p>The USFWS conclusion was based on research suggesting that oil and gas development can negatively influence sage-grouse lek counts, activity, survival, and habitat selection [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, despite these and other studies (see UWIN [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]), it has been difficult to separate the combined influence of anthropogenic structures (e.g., well sites, roads) and their associated human activities from the presence of tall linear structures such as power lines [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, using studies of various types of energy development (i.e., oil/gas, wind) may not be comparable to power lines because of differing project footprints (polygons vs. linear) and amounts of human activity [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For example, workers may be routinely present throughout oil fields or wind developments, yet power lines may only be visited infrequently for inspections or repairs. Power line inspection cycles vary depending on the line voltage, agency requirements, and location, but may occur as often as twice/year or as infrequent as once over five to ten years. Because power lines often occur on landscapes with other human activity, it is difficult to distinguish between potential impacts of the tall structures versus impacts related to other human activity, such as disturbance or habitat loss. In addition, isolating the effects of tall structures from other development activities on sage-grouse populations is particularly problematic if an a-priori status assessment was not completed before the structures were placed [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, in the absence of experimental data, retrospective analysis of the potential effects of anthropogenic activities and their related structures on sage-grouse breeding distributions may provide new insights to prevent, minimize, or mitigate conservation threats [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Given that, our current knowledge regarding the influence of power lines on sage-grouse is limited and equivocal. Historically, researchers relied on untested causal mechanisms to infer the negative effects of power lines on sage-grouse [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For example, Knick et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] used reported foraging distances of golden eagles (<italic>Aquila chrysaetos</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and common ravens (<italic>Corvus corax</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to estimate that electric power transmission lines had a negative impact on 50% of all sagebrush within the range of sage-grouse [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. More recently, intense field studies have documented a reduction in sage-grouse habitat use [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and vital rates [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] in areas adjacent to power lines. Together, this has led to suggestions that power lines have been a potential factor in the extirpation of sage-grouse from historical ranges [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is still unclear, however, under what conditions power lines negatively affect sage-grouse. For example, sage-grouse may not avoid power lines in years of low raven abundance [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There may also be site-specific conditions that counteract the negative influence of power lines on sage-grouse. This was demonstrated by Westover et al.

These temporally dependent and site-specific conditions may explain why Johnson et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] did not detect a consistent relationship between distance to power lines and leks trends across the specie&#x02019;s range.</p><p>This conflicting information has created a dilemma for wildlife and land managers who are attempting to develop best management practices (BMP) for power lines in sagebrush habitats. The USFWS and Avian Power Line Interaction Committee (APLIC) have recommended seasonal and spatial buffers as BMPs for power lines placed near leks in sage-grouse breeding habitats to minimize the potential for negative impacts [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, UWIN [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Messmer et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and Manier et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] concluded the BMP buffer zones vary widely (e.g., 0.3 to 8.0 km) because of challenges associated with interpreting the area influenced by power lines. In addition, differences between transmission and distribution lines, which serve different purposes and therefore can occur in different landscapes, and are constructed at differing heights, have not been previously assessed. Together, this lack of information, combined with the potential site-specific variation in sage-grouse response detailed above demonstrates the need for a landscape-scale evaluation of power line effects on sage-grouse.</p><p>Given this knowledge gap, the overarching purpose for our study was to provide an empirical evaluation of the effects of transmission and distribution power lines on sage-grouse breeding ecology and to identify appropriate buffer distances. Specifically, our objectives were to identify the relative effects of both transmission and distribution power lines on sage-grouse leks, seasonal habitat-use, and reproductive success. To achieve this, we analyzed Utah sage-grouse lek persistence rates, male lek counts, and radio-marked female sage-grouse breeding site selection, nest and brood success recorded from 1998&#x02013;2013 in Utah, portions of southeastern Idaho, and southwestern Wyoming. These study populations represented the majority of sage-grouse populations in the study area including representation from all 13 Sage-Grouse Management Areas in Utah (&#x0003e; 30,164 km<sup>2</sup>). To our knowledge, this is the first landscape-level comparison for an entire jurisdictional entity (i.e., a US sate) examining the relationship between power line classification and known sage-grouse nest and brood locations. For comparison, other large-scale field studies that have evaluated the influence of power line on sage-grouse were ~ 3,400 km<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and 7,000 km<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Within this context, we hypothesized that transmission lines would have a larger effect on sage-grouse breeding ecology than distribution lines due to their increased structure height, which may provide increased perching and nesting habitat for avian predators, and larger right-of-way (ROW) corridors [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Similarly, distribution lines may not affect sage-grouse to the same extent as transmission lines because they are more homogenously distributed across the landscape, thus mitigating avoidance behaviors, and because they often occur in previously disturbed areas. This information will assist state and federal conservation planners to refine conservation BMP buffer zone recommendations for new power line construction to avoid and minimize the potential effects on sage-grouse and their breeding habitats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area</title><p>Our study area encompassed known sage-grouse breeding habitats and distributions in Utah, portions of southeastern Idaho, and southwestern Wyoming [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

These data were provided through confidentiality agreements specifically for this study. Each line in the power line database contained attributes indicating its status as a distribution line (&#x0003c;46 kV) or as a transmission line (&#x0003e; = 46 kV); in total the data represent 16,493 km of transmission lines and 20,061 km of distribution lines throughout Utah, southern Idaho, and southwestern Wyoming.</p><p>Transmission lines, which deliver electric power from the source of generation to substations, are supported by taller structures (height: 18&#x02013;40 m). These lines included linear structures that were located at lower elevations and often bisected sage-grouse habitat. In contrast, distribution lines are supported by shorter structures (height: ~ 10 m) that deliver electric power to customers (e.g., homes, businesses). Distribution lines were interspersed throughout sage-grouse habitat [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

metric.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Next we tested for a threshold effect of distance to power lines on the response metric of interests (e.g., lek trend). Within this context, we hypothesized that if distance from a power line affected sage-grouse, the effects would be magnified for sage-grouse that were located closer to power lines [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, to explicitly evaluate the distance at which sage-grouse response to power lines changed, we tested for a response threshold by comparing the aforementioned model combinations (<xref rid="pone.0209968.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) to models with a threshold effect specified by two piecewise linear splines. Piecewise splines consist of a continuous covariate (e.g., distance to power line) defined over specified segments (e.g., &#x0003e; and &#x0003c; 2.0 km) and a response variable (e.g., lek trend) that is a continuous function of the covariate over all segments but with different slopes in each of the segments. To determine the presence and placement of thresholds, we performed a grid search of candidate models that included the sequential placement of a threshold every 0.1 km from 0.1&#x02013;9.9 km. To minimize outlier effects that may bias threshold locations, we limited the threshold location such that it fell within the 5% and 95% quantiles of data for each analysis. This resulted in between 85 and 92 grid search candidate models depending on the analysis.</p><p>We tested for the additive (percent sagebrush cover, elevation, and distance to roads) and interactive effects (power lines x percent sagebrush cover) on each response metric of interest as described above. This produced 12 additional model sets which we evaluated (<xref rid="pone.0209968.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Due to convergence issues, we were not able to assess the importance of additional covariates (i.e., percent sagebrush cover, distance to roads, elevation) for lek persistence and lek trends. Across all model sets (n = 24; <xref rid="pone.0209968.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we selected the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc; [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]) score as our best fitting model. However, if a threshold model demonstrated equal support (&#x00394;AICc &#x02264; 2.0) as being the best-fit model to either a null or linear model, we also highlighted this information in our results because this directly addressed our primary interest in identifying any response thresholds relative to power lines.</p><p>If a threshold model was identified as the best-fitting model, we then identified uncertainty (i.e., 95% confidence intervals) around the placement of each threshold. For general linear models (GLM), we used the &#x02018;confint.segemented&#x02019; command within the segmented library in R. This approach was used for the lek trend and lek persistence analyses. Because the segmented library did not accommodate the use of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), we identified uncertainty around a threshold GLMM as any threshold model that fell within &#x00394;AICc of 2.0 of the best-fit threshold model [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This uncertainty approach was applied to the nest selection, brood selection, nest success, brood success analyses.</p><p>Although piecewise linear splines are useful for identifying thresholds, the segmenting of data leads to reduced sample sizes for a given spline. This contributes to a lack of statistical significance due to the reliance of p-values on sample size [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. As such, we ignored arbitrary significance thresholds (e.g., p-value &#x02264; 0.05) in our interpretation of power line effects [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and rather, focused our interpretation on the marginal response of sage-grouse to power lines (i.e., slope of the relationship). As such, we do not provide measures of significance (i.e., p-values) in our model outputs, but rather present only information on confidence intervals for each model coefficient.</p><sec id="sec012"><title>Preponderance of evidence approach</title><p>Many of our analyses consisted of small sample sizes, which when combined with likely population differences in habitat selection and vital rates across study sites, likely contributed to increased model uncertainty regarding the influence of power lines on our response variables of interest. Thus, we evaluated each response metric individually within the results section, and then used a proponderance of evidence approach [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] to assess whether our landscape scale analyses was suggestive of a power line effect. More specifically, we evaluated the relationship between distance to power lines and our response metric for each analyses using the best-fit model. Then, in our weight of evidence approach, we examined additional models sets that had equal support as the best-fit model (&#x02264; &#x00394;AICc of 2.0) to assess whether a threshold effect may exist. For example, if a linear model was the best-fit model (&#x00394;AICc of 0.0) but a piecewise spline model was within &#x00394;AICc of 2.0, we interpreted the result as having potential support for a threshold effect, and then examined whether or not that potential support existed across analyses. This interpretation was based on the marginal response coefficients for the spline prior and after the threshold for the best-fitting nonlinear model. If a model coefficient was positive prior to the threshold, we interpreted that as support for a negative power line effect at distances close to the power line.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Lek trends</title><p>We employed a 2-stage analytic approach to assess the impact of distance to power lines on sage-grouse lek trend. In the first stage we estimated the overall count trend for each lek. In the second stage we treated the estimated trends as our response variable and modeled them as a function of distance to the nearest power line using both a continuous linear effect as well as piece-wise linear trends to determine if the magnitude or direction of the effect changed at some distance.</p><p>Statewide, 379 leks were monitored in &#x02265; 1 year between 1998 and 2013. However, to obtain reliable lek trend estimates we only analyzed data from leks that were monitored in &#x02265; 12 years, thereby reducing the total number of leks retained for analysis to 172 leks. The temporal trend for each lek was estimated using a Negative Binomial generalized additive model (GAM) to model the annual maximum number of males counted for lek <italic>i</italic> in year <italic>t</italic> as a linear function of year while accounting for population cycles [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] by fitting a smoothed effect of the total number of males counted statewide in each year. To be comparable through time, the annual total number of males was calculated using only those leks that were monitored in all 16 years of the study period. A negative binomial distribution was used because many leks had an excess number of zero males counted, thereby violating the mean-variance relationship of the Poisson distribution. Despite having reduced the dataset to only include those leks that were monitored in &#x02265; 12 of the 16 years, the trend analysis for some leks produced warning messages suggesting that the models did not converge and parameter estimates were not reliable. Concomitantly, we further reduced the resulting vector of estimated lek trend estimates by retaining only those estimates that were within 1 standard deviation of the average trend estimate. This resulted in a sample size of 125 lek trend estimates being carried forward to the second stage of our analysis.</p><p>To examine the role of power lines on lek trends, we constructed a General Linear Model with a Gaussian distribution as implemented in the base R (Version 3.3.3; [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). To evaluate the potential for a response threshold, we used the aforementioned grid search approach to compare the linear and nonlinear model fits. The small number of leks for which we had trend estimates and were within 10 km of either transmission or distribution lines (n = 70) required that we analyze lek trends as function of distance to combined power line types. Distance to power lines (km) was included as the sole explanatory variable because the small number of leks precluded the evaluation of other habitat variables (e.g., percent sagebrush cover, roads) due to convergence issues.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Lek persistence</title><p>We defined persistence as leks where at least 2 strutting males were observed in 2 years of each of the 5-year periods 1996&#x02013;2000 and 2009&#x02013;2013 [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. To examine the role of power lines on lek persistence, we constructed a GLM with a binomial distribution (persist vs. not persist) and logit-link function as implemented in the base R package. We employed the grid search of potential response thresholds similar to the lek trend analysis to compare the linear and nonlinear model fits. Due to the small number of leks within 10 km of either transmission or distribution lines (n = 56), we analyzed lek persistence as the function of distance to combined power line types. Distance to power lines (km) was included as the sole explanatory variable because the small number of leks precluded the evaluation of other habitat variables (e.g., percent sagebrush cover, roads) due to convergence issues.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Nest and brood site selection</title><p>We used a resource selection function (RSF) approach within a use-available study design [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] evaluated at the population level [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] to determine the relative influence of distance to power lines and sagebrush cover on sage-grouse nest or brood-site selection. We included sagebrush cover because it has previously been reported as a factor that influences sage-grouse distributions [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>We used our database of known sage-grouse nest and brood locations and randomized potential locations with our study area to conduct the RSF. For the nest RSF, we generated 15 potential sage-grouse use locations as random points for every nest location. Our placement of potential sage-grouse locations was constrained to sagebrush vegetation types mapped by the inter-agency LANDFIRE project. Given that, random nest points were constrained such that they were located within 10 km of either a transmission or distribution line, and within the convex hull drawn around nest locations for each study population [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This established a distribution of availability that corresponded to any nesting habitat within a given study area that was also located within 10k of a power line. Using this information, we constructed our RSF using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a binomial distribution (presence vs. random) and a logit-link function implemented in the lme4 package of R. We included distance to either transmission or distribution lines as either a linear or piecewise spline covariate. Power line types were analyzed separately (i.e., two separate RSF models) to accurately measure whether a threshold response occurred to either or both power line types. Because nest site selection is also a function of percent sagebrush [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we also tested for the additive and interactive effects of percent sagebrush cover. Lastly, we included additive effects of elevation and distance to roads as covariates to both linear and piecewise spline models (<xref rid="pone.0209968.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Study area was included as a random factor.</p><p>We repeated this process for our brood site RSF, except that an additional constraint was placed on random locations. Random brood locations were constrained such that they were located: 1) within 10 km of either a transmission or distribution, 2) within the convex hull drawn around brood locations for each study population, and 3) within 10 km of each individual brood location. This established a distribution of availability that was individual specific such that random locations were in close proximity to a given brood while also meeting the prior constraints. Using this information, we constructed our RSF using a GLMM with a binomial distribution (presence vs. random) and a logit-link function implemented in the lme4 package of R.

Although it has been suggested sage-grouse may move up in elevation as the brooding season progresses [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], we did not evaluate this in our models because it appeared to occur only in specific sites within our study area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209968.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>).

For example, lek trends were negatively affected by power lines up until a distance of 1.2 (95% CI = 0.1&#x02013;2.3) km. When we were able to separate sage-grouse responses according to power line type, transmission lines appeared to have greater impacts to sage-grouse than distribution lines. Thus, our analyses yielded a data-driven 2.3-km BMP buffer zone around leks for the construction of new transmission power lines in occupied sage-grouse habitats. However, sage-grouse nest and brood locations where still documented within this BMP buffer zone. Because distribution lines had less of an impact on sage-grouse demographics than transmission lines, we recommend site specific planning as appropriate for distribution lines, which may include buffers, micrositing, habitat reclamation, other BMPs, or a combination of these practices.</p><p>Based on our analysis, sage-grouse avoided nesting within 1.1 km of transmission lines and nest success was most negatively affected at distances up until 2.4 km (<xref rid="pone.0209968.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We did not detect an effect of distance to distribution lines on sage-grouse nest-site selection. Similarly, brooding female sage-grouse tended to avoid the immediate proximity of transmission lines up to a distance of 1.2 km, whereas they did not avoid distribution lines. Similar to our site-selection analyses, transmission lines had a negative effect on sage-grouse nest success up to a distance of 2.4 km, whereas, sage-grouse nests located closer to distribution lines were more successful. Transmission lines also had a negative effect on brood success up to a distance of 1.3 km, whereas distribution lines had no effect.</p><p>These preponderance of evidence suggests that sage-grouse may be more impacted by transmission lines than to distribution lines. It remains unclear, however, whether this was driven by habitat characteristics. In our study area, transmission lines were located at lower elevations on the landscape and farther from developed areas. In contrast, distribution lines were located in areas with greater anthropogenic development and habitat fragmentation than transmission lines, as they directly provide electrical power to homes, communities, businesses, and industry [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Thus, habitat availability alone may help explain increased avoidance of transmission lines but not distribution lines (i.e., sage-grouse could not avoid distribution lines without encountering other anthropogenic structures, whereas sage-grouse could have ranged in larger areas surrounding transmission lines in otherwise intact habitat). This is likely in our study areas because sage-grouse seasonal movements in Utah reflect habitat availability [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It may also be possible that the interspersed, and thus, more homogenous spatial arrangement of distribution lines on the landscape may have facilitated habituation by sage-grouse [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The high density and proximity of secondary roads adjacent to power lines may also explain sage-grouse avoidance of power lines [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In our study area, we observed both selection for (brood-site selection-distribution; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209968.s004">S4 Appendix</xref>, nest-success: transmission; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209968.s005">S5 Appendix</xref>) and avoidance of roads (brood-site selection-transmission; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209968.s004">S4 Appendix</xref>). This inconclusive effect of roads may be in part due to the correlation of power lines and roads. In areas where transmission lines and distribution lines had been constructed, 54% and 69% of sage-grouse locations, respectively, were within 100 m of a road (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209968.s007">S7 Appendix</xref>). These roads have established linear corridors that may exceed 300 m or more and may include unimproved power line access roads, county roads, and/or state/interstate highways [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, sagebrush habitats located &#x0003c; 1 km of the power lines may have been degraded by historic road and power line construction that contributed to sage-grouse habitat loss and therefore site avoidance. Similar to other studies, [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we were unable to separate these effects (anthropogenic development from and tall structures) due to small sample size. Moreover, Johnson et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Wisdom et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] cautioned that retrospective studies may be biased in that many of the factors affecting sage-grouse ecology were in place prior to their studies [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite this, our study does represent the first comprehensive examination of the direct and indirect effects of power lines on sage-grouse at a landscape scale. This is important because published research on the effects of these structures on the reproductive fitness of any grouse species is lacking [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, it has been hypothesized that the avoidance of transmission lines is due to direct predation facilitated by increased predator visibility and increased raptor and corvid nesting substrates [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Scientific evidence is still lacking as to whether sage-grouse instinctively avoid power lines specifically to avoid predators [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but given that transmission lines were 8&#x02013;30 meters taller than distribution lines in our study area, this may be a potential mechanism to explain sage-grouse avoidance. It is also important to note that Lammers and Collopy [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and Prather and Messmer [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] both documented high use of electric power distribution lines as perch sites for raptors and corvids in or near our study areas which suggest that predation risk may be higher closer to power lines. Our results that demonstrated increased avoidance of transmission lines and lower survival in areas near them corroborates this. However, our study did document sage-grouse movements beneath power lines suggesting predation may not be as influential as sometimes stated. As such, this debate remains unresolved because of the difficulty in connecting predation risks to various combinations or types of power lines and avian predator species [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Although we were unable to identify the mechanism responsible for sage-grouse avoidance of power lines, we were able to provide the first landscape-scale empirical evaluation of the effects of power lines on sage-grouse during the breeding season. Our evaluation supports the broad-scale analysis by Wisdom et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Gibson, Blomberg (30) that distance to transmission lines had a potential negative influence on lek persistence. However, our analyses extended beyond Wisdom et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in that we identified a BMP buffer zone of 2.3 km from active leks for power lines that could avoid and minimize the potential effects of new power line construction on sage-grouse ecology.</p><p>For comparison, a 3.0 km minimum BMP buffer zone has been previously recommended to mitigate the effects of tall structures on seasonal sage-grouse habitat [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This BMP buffer zone was recommended because available range wide nesting data suggested most sage-grouse nest within 3.2 km of known leks [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In our study areas, nest success increased as females selected nesting sites farther from transmission lines. This effect was greatest up to a distance of 2.4 km. However, long-term sage-grouse nest location data collected in Utah and other states suggested that some female sage-grouse may nest up to 5.0 km or more from known leks [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This may explain why nesting success increased, but at a slower rate, beyond the 2.4 km threshold (<xref rid="pone.0209968.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The BLM National Technical Team (NTT) reviewed data regarding distances from nest locations to the nearest leks where female sage-grouse were captured [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Based on these data, the BMP buffer zone would need to exceed a 6.0 km radius around leks to protect most of the nesting female sage-grouse. However, the NTT acknowledged a 6.0 km buffer would not be practical because of oil and gas leasing requirements and that within priority habitats existing lek-based BMP buffers may overlap precluding development [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. As such, our results lend support to Connelly et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the Wyoming Sage-grouse Executive Order [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and APLIC [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] recommendations of placing new electric transmission lines within existing corridors. If this is unfeasible, we suggest a 2.3 km buffer for the construction of transmission lines be applied around active leks to avoid and minimize impacts to nesting habitat in Utah. It is unclear from our data whether an active lek buffer associated with distribution lines is required around nesting habitat, thus, we would recommend that new distribution lines be co-located with existing disturbance if possible.</p><p>Beck et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] estimated that 29,821 km<sup>2</sup> (13.6%) of Utah provided sage-grouse habitat. Connelly et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and Knick et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] suggested that electric power transmission lines could have an impact on 40&#x02013;50% (11,928&#x02013;14,911 km<sup>2</sup>) of all sagebrush within designated sage-grouse management areas. However, we found that only 10% of transmission lines and 7% of distribution lines within our study areas were within 10 km of occupied sage-grouse habitat suggesting that power lines may be less influential to overall sage-grouse habitat than previously thought in Utah. Moreover, if we applied a 2.3 km buffer zone around all known electric power transmission (1,698 km) and distribution (1,496 km) lines, our analysis suggests that power lines may only have an ecological effect on 22.6% (6,817km<sup>2</sup>) of available sage-grouse breeding habitat in our study areas.</p><p>Our results highlighted the importance of maintaining suitable sagebrush cover in areas where power lines occur on the landscape, as percent sagebrush cover increased grouse selection of sites for nesting and brooding increased despite the presence of power lines. In our study areas, percent sagebrush cover improved as distance to transmission lines increased (&#x003b2; = 3.28, <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.01). This may explain why nest and brood success continued to increase as sage-grouse females moved farther from transmission lines. Our results validate the value of reclaiming sagebrush habitats in areas in close proximity to power lines.</p><p>Female sage-grouse demonstrated high selection preferences for sites within ~ 1.1 km of transmission lines during the nesting and brooding period, which suggests these sites provide additional benefits which we did not account for in our models. In such cases, management strategies that increased the availability of useable sagebrush habitat space (i.e., removal of conifer encroachment and vegetation management to encourage low growing species) in areas where power lines occur could enhance population stability [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and potentially counteract the negative impacts of power lines. However, it is possible that habitat improvement strategies could lead to population sink dynamics if sage-grouse are attracted to power lines and subsequently experience negative population growth due to factors such as increased predation [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, managers should evaluate this practice on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Currently 87% of the sage-grouse range is grazed by livestock [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Dahlgren et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209968.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] reported increased sage-grouse production on working landscapes grazed by domestic livestock using rotational grazing practices. Utility ROW vegetation management practices may serve a similar function to livestock grazing, as both reduce tall growing species and encourage growth of grassland and shrub species. Sandford et al. [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] reported increased sage-grouse nest survival and brood success in sagebrush landscapes where conifer encroachment was reduced. Messmer [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] suggested implementation and evaluation of these landscape-level management practices should be considered as part of the integrated toolkit to mitigate the potential effects anthropogenic activities have on sage-grouse and their habitats.</p><p>Our study represents the first landscape-level comparison within a state&#x02019;s jurisdictional boundary that examined the relationship between power line classification and known sage-grouse nest and brood locations. Despite our comprehensive approach, we were still unable to resolve a number of concerns that may influence sage-grouse responses to power lines due in a large part to our limited samples sizes. Specifically, our sample size limited our ability to evaluate how structure height and design may differentially influence sage-grouse response beyond our general classifications (e.g., distribution vs transmission). Similarly, it is unclear whether structure design may play a role in sage-grouse response given the variation in available perching and nesting substrates that power lines provide to avian predators [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We were also unable to evaluate the extent to which placement of new power lines within anthropogenic corridors (e.g., power lines, transportation) reduces the overall negative influence of sage-grouse (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0209968.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]), and whether those benefits to sage-grouse are capped at some development threshold (e.g., 2 vs. 4 power lines in a corridor). Due to the propensity of roads in proximity to power lines throughout our study area, we were also unable to distinguish between potential independent impacts from roads versus power lines. Lastly, we documented increased use of elevation during the brood period, however we were unable to explicitly evaluate how seasonal movement behaviors may interact with sage-grouse response to power lines (distance to power lines x elevation interaction), as birds may move away from power lines in response to other unrelated habitat factors. Given these limitations, we encourage future research that addresses these challenges. The increasing use of GPS technology in wildlife studies, including sage-grouse, and the larger sample sizes they provide, may provide new opportunities to evaluate these unanswered questions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our research is the first to quantify appropriate BMP buffer distances based on known sage-grouse seasonal habitat-use data for the construction of new electric power transmission and distribution lines in sage-grouse habitats. Our research also demonstrated that interactions between percent sagebrush cover and type of power line affect sage-grouse responses. Based on our results, we recommend a hierarchical approach for avoiding and minimizing the potential impacts of power lines on sage-grouse. New transmission power lines should be placed in existing utility or transportation corridors where feasible. If co-location is not feasible, lek buffers of 2.3 km for new transmission lines should be used to mitigate the potential impacts to sage-grouse. It is questionable from our results, however, that this buffer would also apply to distribution lines given the uncertainty we observed regarding sage-grouse response to distribution lines in our habitat selection and reproductive success analyses. In addition, other regulatory or resource conflicts (i.e., electric utilities are required by law to provide service to requesting customers and to minimize impacts to other resources&#x02013;such as wetlands, cultural or paleontological resources, etc.) can result in new construction within a sage-grouse buffer in some circumstances. Thus, we recommend managers continue to incorporate habitat protection and reclamation as conservation strategies for new power line construction, and population monitoring (i.e., lek counts) as feedback mechanisms to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies. The use of applicable BMPs, such as the sage-grouse BMPs for electric utilities developed by APLIC, should be considered and implemented on a project-by-project basis. It is important that wildlife resource agencies, land management agencies, electric utilities, and private landowners work together to address site-specific aspects of new power line locations and sage-grouse habitats. More broadly, the methodological process employed here can be used widely to evaluate the influence of anthropogenic structures on grouse species globally. With this information, land managers will be better suited to minimize impacts from ongoing human infrastructure construction on wildlife.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209968.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209968.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209968.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209968.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209968.s003"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209968.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209968.s004"><label>S4 Appendix</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209968.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209968.s005"><label>S5 Appendix</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209968.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209968.s006"><label>S6 Appendix</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209968.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0209968.s007"><label>S7 Appendix</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0209968.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank J.
