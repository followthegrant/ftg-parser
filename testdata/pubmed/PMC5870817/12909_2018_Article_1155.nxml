Person-job fit theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] postulates that personality traits are an important factor determining how an individual will adapt to a specific job or organization. Personality refers to individuals&#x02019; affective, experiential and motivational characteristics that reflect their values, attitudes and coping strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A large volume of empirical studies provides convincing evidence of the importance of personality in predicting the person-job fit of physicians-in-training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Previous studies examining the association between personality traits and medical careers have focused on medical students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and a few specialties, mainly surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and psychiatry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], with partly inconsistent findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Medical students preferring surgery over other specialties have shown higher extraversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and lower agreeableness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] but inconsistent differences in neuroticism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] as well as no differences in any distinctive characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] compared with other specialties. Students specializing in psychiatry have shown lower conscientiousness compared with surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and higher openness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], neuroticism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and agreeableness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] compared with other specialties.</p><p id="Par13">However, the contribution of personality traits to performance and success in medicine is suggested to be greater in the practice of medicine than in medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Deciding to become a physician is an educational choice whereas selecting a specialty is seen as an occupational choice that reflects how personality types will interact with medical specialty work environments and how specialists will modify their practice of medicine within the specialty to better fit their personality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, little is known about how personality traits influence and modify medical specialization and the career choices of physicians-in-practice <italic>after</italic> graduating from medical school when actually practicing and experiencing various medical specialties that differ in terms of requirements, work settings, routines, rewards and vocational interests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In addition, present research and future directions in the associations between personality traits and medical career selection suggest that the expression of trait-relevant behaviour as well as the predictive validity of personality traits for person-job fit in medicine is context dependent, having both costs and benefits which become evident in later careers and particularly in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This means that personality traits conventionally perceived as &#x0201c;good&#x0201d;, such as conscientiousness, also have a &#x0201c;dark-side&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; traits, such as neuroticism, have a &#x0201c;bright-side&#x0201d;, in terms of physicians&#x02019; clinical practice and well-being at work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For example, conscientiousness, which is found to be the most significant predictor of person-job fit in medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], may be a valid predictor in clinical contexts where higher conscientiousness is expressible (e.g., a surgical operation) but less valid in contexts where it is not as expressible (e.g., patient interaction or clinical practice that demands flexibility) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similarly, too little neuroticism together with anxiety may hinder the acquisition of medical knowledge and skills and therefore also slow professional development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These may have implications for a physician&#x02019;s perceptions of person-job fit within the current specialty and further influence his/her career decision-making process and choices in terms of employment sector, amount and type of clinical patient work and potential change of specialty, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Yet researchers and professionals in medical education have emphasized the importance of exploring the differential prediction of personality traits across the medical career and how personality traits influence specialists&#x02019; career choices and modifications in the long run when practicing a certain specialty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Studies examining specialty residents in clinical practice have used small non-representative samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] or have focused only on certain specialties such as surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Moreover, whether personality traits contribute to important career choices such as working in the private or public sector, with or without clinical patient contact as well as change of specialty remains largely unexplored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. What is known at the general level is that work-related factors and practical scenarios associated with public versus private sectors have been found to be associated with the type and amount of clinical patient work that, in turn, might be found appealing by different personality types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As far as we know, only one study has examined change of specialty choices and even then only among recently graduated students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Junior doctors who had chosen psychiatry were found to be more likely to change their specialty than those who had chosen general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The stability of their choice was not, however, related to personality and confidence or satisfaction with medicine in general, but instead to enjoyment and the lifestyle factors associated with the specialty. To sum up, then, an important gap exists in our understanding of the role of personality in medical specialists&#x02019; career choices in the long term for developing medical career counseling and interventions, and more explicitly, to help students and medical professionals choose medical careers that best fit their personality and individual preferences.</p><p id="Par16">In a nationally representative sample of Finnish physicians (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2837) we examined how personality traits are associated with medical career choices <italic>after</italic> graduating from medical school, in terms of employment sector, patient contact, medical specialty and change of specialty.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par17">A retrospective cross-sectional cohort study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Population and data collection</title><p id="Par18">The data are from the ongoing longitudinal Finnish Health Care Professionals&#x02019; Study (HPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

Personality traits by gender interactions for specialty choices were considered in each personality trait separately.

The characteristics of the study sample are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Most of the medical specialists worked in the public sector (73%), and had clinical patient contact at least half or more (72%) of their weekly working time. General practice (19.8%) and other internal medicine specialties (15.3%) (e.g., Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Dermatology and Allergology) formed the largest groups of specialists. Women represented the majority of respondents in all other specialties except surgery, where men were the most predominant (65.1%). Women specialists were also younger and more likely worked in the public employment sector than in the private sector compared with men specialists.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Basic characteristics of 2837 Finnish physicians, by gender and specialty</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="2">Women (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1838)</th><th colspan="2">Men (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;999)</th><th/><th colspan="2">Total (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2837)</th></tr><tr><th>Characteristics</th><th>Number</th><th>Percent</th><th>Number</th><th>Percent</th><th>

Higher openness was associated with working in the private sector, not having clinical patient contact, specializing in psychiatry and having a tendency to change specialty. Lower openness, in turn, was associated with a high or average amount of clinical patient contact and specializing in general practice as well as in ophthalmology and otorhinolaryngology.</p><p id="Par35">Of the other personality traits, higher conscientiousness was associated with a higher amount of clinical patient contact and specializing in surgery and in other internal medicine specialties whereas lower conscientiousness was associated with specializing in psychiatry and in hospital service specialties. Higher agreeableness was associated with working in the private sector and specializing in general practice as well as occupational health service whereas lower agreeableness was associated with specializing in surgery. Higher neuroticism was associated with an average amount of clinical patient contact whereas lower neuroticism was associated with specializing in surgery. Women scored higher in extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism but lower in openness compared with men. Specialists with no clinical patient contact showed lower extraversion whereas higher extraversion was associated with specializing in pediatrics and psychiatry and a change of specialty.</p><p id="Par36">The association of higher openness with working in the private sector and changing specialties is understandable, as openness facilitates acceptance, flexibility and adequate adjustment to situational changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Openness has been linked to academic ability and divergent thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and is seen as becoming more beneficial particularly in clinical education and in the applied settings of medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] than in academic achievement during medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Researchers use the expression &#x0201c;getting along&#x0201d; as a reflection of the &#x0201c;Openness to experience&#x0201d; personality trait, which seems to facilitate the optimal interpersonal interaction between a physician and a patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Obviously, these kinds of attributes may also be beneficial when working in the private sector in close, intense and permanent patient relationships and/or needing to change either employment sector or specialty during a medical career. Psychiatrists&#x02019; greater openness in the present study is also consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Psychiatrists may benefit in their work from being more open, as this characteristic also reflects general attentiveness to inner feelings, intellectual curiosity and independence of judgment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Specialists with no clinical patient contact showed higher openness, which may refer to hospital-based or procedure-oriented specialists and/or basic applied laboratory researchers with minimal patient contact. Compared with other specialties, the job description of medical researchers, for example, may also allow and make it generally easier to show intellectual curiosity and divergent thinking, thus reflecting higher openness to experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Lower openness was associated with a high or average amount of clinical patient contact and specializing in general practice as well as in ophthalmology and otorhinolaryngology. The results may refer to physicians being greatly responsible for patients in general. General and family practitioners have been characterized as strict followers of clinical guidelines and principles compared to surgeons, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Family practitioners have been found to be mixed in openness compared with other specialists, and, in any case, score lower on openness compared with psychiatrists and surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Also, ophthalmologists and otorhinolaryngologists have been categorized as specialists having a more controlled lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reflecting lower openness. The job description in general practice as well as in ophthalmology and otorhinolaryngology is based on relatively traditional rules and regular operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, physicians representing these specialties may benefit from their lower openness. As well, stability of choice of specialty has been found to be significantly higher among general practitioners compared to psychiatrists, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Higher conscientiousness was associated with high amounts of clinical patient contact and specializing in surgery and in other internal medicine specialties whereas lower conscientiousness was associated with specializing in psychiatry and in hospital service specialties. Conscientiousness has been found to be the best predictor of academic success in both preclinical and clinical phases of medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In a recent study among Swedish doctors, psychiatrists scored lower on conscientiousness particularly when compared with surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Surgeons&#x02019; higher tendency to be organized, careful and persistent is perceived as the most supportive characteristic considering the requisite skills of the surgical specialty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Internists (including many subspecialties of internal medicine), in turn, have been suggested to score higher on conscientiousness because of their high self-reliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, hospital service physicians showed lower conscientiousness compared with surgeons in the above-mentioned Swedish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Higher neuroticism was associated with an average amount of clinical patient contact whereas lower neuroticism was associated with specializing in surgery. The results are completely new not previously demonstrated. Neuroticism has been found to be predictive of jobs and working environments where employees work in groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Individuals with higher neuroticism have been shown to experience life events more negatively than other individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] partly because they choose to place themselves in situations that foster negative effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Taking into account that medicine is an emotionally demanding field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], this trait might have repercussions on physicians&#x02019; well-being indicators such as perceived stress and job satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. However, neuroticism has been shown to be rarely apparent among medical specialists in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Distinctive differences in neuroticism have been found only in a small cross-sectional study where surgeons scored at the highest level in neuroticism compared with other specialists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a study by Hoffman and colleagues, surgeons scored lower in neuroticism compared with the general population but not when compared with medical students or with other medical specialists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our results, however, suggest that the challenging, risk-taking and meticulous nature of surgical specialization may attract and favour physicians who do not have a general tendency to experience negative emotions in response to stressful duties and situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Higher agreeableness was associated with working in the private sector and specializing in general practice as well as in occupational health whereas lower agreeableness was associated with specializing in surgery. Agreeableness has been found to be predictive of clinical competence in medical students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], suggesting that it may facilitate physician-patient relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Previously, general practice (including family medicine) and occupational health have been classified as person-oriented specialties whose physicians show sympathetic, trusting and cooperative behaviour, reflecting higher Agreeableness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Surgeons&#x02019; higher tendency to be demanding, dominant and tough-minded, referring to their lower agreeableness, is consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Specialists who did not have clinical patient contact showed lower extraversion whereas higher extraversion was associated with specializing in pediatrics and change of specialty. The job description of medical researchers with no clinical patient contact, for example, may allow and make it easier to show withdrawal and deliberate behaviour in general. Higher extraversion, in turn, reflects approaching behaviour and general sociability with a cheerful disposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], which can be seen as favourable characteristics of physicians working with children and encountering new working environments. Although psychiatrists also scored slightly higher on extraversion compared with other specialists, they may vary within the specialty concerning this trait with respect to trait-related single facets such as being sociable and outgoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Doctors choosing psychiatry have been found to be more likely to change their specialty than those choosing general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Choice stability has not, however, been previously related to personality and confidence, or to satisfaction with medicine in general, but instead to the job satisfaction and lifestyle factors associated with the specialty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Women specialists scored significantly higher in extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism but lower in openness compared to men physicians. Gender differences in agreeableness or gender by specialty interactions, in any personality trait, were not observed. Women physicians have previously been found to score higher also in agreeableness whereas gender differences with regard to neuroticism have not been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Gender-related individual-level factors such as personality might be a considerable variable to take into account in career counseling and specialty guidance during medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] in order to enhance person-job fit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] among physicians.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par43">The greatest strength of this study is the relatively large and representative population-based sample of actively working licensed Finnish physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], an important advantage compared with previous research on the topic. Second, as far as we know, the present study is the first to demonstrate the significant role of physicians&#x02019; personality traits regarding medical career including chosen specialty, employment sector, involvement in clinical patient work and change of specialty <italic>after</italic> medical education when actually practicing different specialties that differ in requisite skills, job duties, work settings and vocational interests. Third, the associations of physicians&#x02019; personality traits with the amount of clinical patient contact and change of specialty are new findings. Similarly, the findings regarding surgeons&#x02019; lower neuroticism and occupational health specialists&#x02019; higher agreeableness are novel. The findings concerning openness and agreeableness, in particular, might have practical relevance in physician-patient interpersonal relationships. These new findings of the current study may be useful when developing medical career counseling and interventions during and after medical education to help students choose medical careers that best suit their individual personalities.</p><p id="Par44">The present study has limitations as well. The possibility of reverse causality cannot be ruled out. Although personality traits are moderately heritable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and relatively stable over the life course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], major life-events have been found to affect personality development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Thus, it is also possible that a physician&#x02019;s personality would be affected as a result of medical education and/or chosen career [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As well, the missing data more than 10% of the participants may have introduced potential bias in parameter estimation, thus weakening the generalizability of the results. The physicians&#x02019; personality traits were measured only in 2015 at one follow-up point of the study. Longer-term follow-ups would be necessary to gain a larger and more reliable picture of how a physician&#x02019;s personality contributes to career choices, and to shed light on questions of causality.</p><p id="Par45">Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding. Other factors (e.g., job satisfaction and experiences during and/or after medical education) may explain the link between physician personality and career choice. Although carried out with the permission of the FMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], the study was based on voluntary participation. Therefore, the self-selection of physicians participating in the study may explain some of the results.</p><p id="Par46">To assess personality, we used the well-known shortened version of the S-BFI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] that has been found to have adequate reliability and convergent validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] also among medical students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Despite the obvious advantages of short personality measures found for research purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], shortened scales might not completely cover all the delicate facets of the FFM. Although only satisfactory in agreeableness, the reliability coefficients of the scales were consistent with previous research conducted with the S-BFI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">The results showed distinctive personality traits to be associated with physicians&#x02019; career and specialty choices <italic>after</italic> medical school independent of known confounding work-related factors. Openness was the most consistent personality trait associated with physicians&#x02019; career choices in terms of employment sector, amount of clinical patient contact, specialty choice and change of specialty. The findings concerning openness and agreeableness, in particular, might have practical relevance in the interpersonal physician-patient relationship. Our results also suggest that gender-related personality might be a considerable individual-level factor to take into account in career counseling and specialty guidance during and after medical education in order to enhance the person-job fit of physicians. Whether and how a physician&#x02019;s personality is related to job satisfaction and general well-being within the chosen specialty, including employment sector, clinical patient work and change of specialty, is an unexamined and important topic for future research.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p id="Par5">Analysis of Covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFM</term><def><p id="Par6">Five Factor Model of Personality</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FMA</term><def><p id="Par7">Finnish Medical Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPS</term><def><p id="Par8">Health Professionals Study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>S-BFI</term><def><p id="Par9">Shortened version of Big Five Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p id="Par10">Parental Socioeconomic Status</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the participants for their open participation and contribution to this work.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par48">This research &#x02013; including the design of the study; the collection, analysis and interpretation of the data; and the writing of the manuscript &#x02013; was supported by the Academy of Finland under grants number 1297520 for SM, and number 265977 for ME, and a KONE Foundation grant for SM.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par49">The datasets generated and analysed during the study are not publicly available because they have been retrieved from a representative sample of an occupational cohort group having confidential personal data with identification risks, but are available upon reasonable request from Professor Marko Elovainio (marko.elovainio@helsinki.fi).</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ME designed the study, carried out the data collection, interpreted the results, and drafted and revised the manuscript.
