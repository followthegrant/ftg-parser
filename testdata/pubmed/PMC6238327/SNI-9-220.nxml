Creation and maintenance of a safe corridor into the tumor is critical, as well as the ability to visualize the tumor and surrounding structures during the operation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] These lesions have been resected using visualization by microscopy with brain spatulas for decades. Since the introduction of the first self-retaining retractor by Greenberg in 1981, many retractor systems have been used in clinical fields. Surgeons have attempted to resect deep-seated lesions using these novel modalities with either or both the microscope and endoscope.</p><p>Recently, the ViewSite Brain Access System (Vycor Medical, Inc., Boca Raton, FL, USA) has been used for resection of deep-seated lesions. The usefulness of this tubular retractor system for brain tumors has been documented in adult[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and pediatric series.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The ViewSite tubular retractor is a transparent plastic tubular retractor system that consists of an introducer inside of a working channel port and is available in three lengths (3, 5, and 7 cm) and four widths (12, 17, 21, and 28 mm). This retractor is designed as a tapered forward edge to minimize disruption of the brain during insertion [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>]. Recinos <italic>et al</italic>. reported postoperative imaging following use of the ViewSite tubular retractor. They showed minimal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) changes along the surgical path.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This result indicates minimal tissue damage and ischemia. In contrast, because of the tapered shape of this retractor, the width of the forward edge is smaller than that of the reverse edge, and it leads to limitation in the working space [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>]. Moreover, in many deep-seated lesions, the interface between normal tissue and the lesion is not always clear, and lesions frequently have an irregular border.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Moving the ViewSite tubular retractor then becomes necessary to observe the border between the lesion and surrounding normal brain tissue. Whether moving the ViewSite tubular retractor causes excessive brain retraction pressure and leads to morbidity is unclear.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The ViewSite brain retractor.

Medical charts were reviewed for age at presentation, sex, clinical presentation, radiographic imaging, operation record, pathological findings, treatment, and outcome. This study (no. 1703-011) was approved by the ethical committee of the Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Surgical techniques</title><p>Preoperatively, for the neuronavigation system, computed tomography (CT) imaging and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. When the lesion was adjacent to the eloquent area, functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were also achieved. Using these images, either Curve&#x02122; Image Guided Surgery (BrainLab, Munich, Germany), StealthStation S7 (Medtronic Inc., Louisville, CO, USA), or StealthStation Treon (Medtronic Inc.) was registered, and the surgical trajectory was planned to avoid the eloquent area and critical vasculature. After corticotomy was performed over a non-eloquent gyrus, the ViewSite tubular retractor was gently inserted along the previously planned surgical tract. As mentioned above, there are several sizes of the ViewSite tubular retractor. Therefore, the distance from the entry point of parenchyma to the lesion was measured on images to decide which retractor was suitable. We usually selected 17- and 21-mm-wide retractors in the 7 cm lengths. After setting the ViewSite tubular retractor in the proper position, the retractor was fixed with a self-retaining Leyla arm (Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany), and the introducer was removed. We then resected lesions through the ViewSite tubular retractor under a surgical microscope (OPMI Pentero or NC4; Carl Zeiss Co., Oberkochen, Germany) and/or an endoscope (Karl Storz Endoscopy, Tuttlingen, Germany) [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">b</xref>]. The majority of lesions were resected. The ViewSite tubular retractor was then removed, and we used a malleable brain spatula (Fujita Medical Instruments Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to observe the interface between normal tissue and lesions and to remove residual lesions [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">d</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Illustration depicting surgical approaches to deep-seated lesions with the ViewSite tubular retractor or brain spatulas.

Postoperative radiographic MRI was imported into BrainLab software for volumetric analysis.

The extent of resection (EOR) was also calculated.

Histologically, five patients were diagnosed with central neurocytoma in which all of the tumors were located in the lateral ventricle, two patients had a metastatic brain tumor, one patient had glioblastoma multiforme, and one patient had cavernous angioma in the third ventricle. There were four total radiographically confirmed resections (44.4%). STR and PR were achieved in four (44.4%) patients and in one (11.1%) patient with central neurocytoma, respectively, because these tumors were strongly adherent to the choroid plexus and ependymal veins. Postoperatively, there was no morbidity, including cerebrospinal fluid leakage, worsened neurological symptoms, and postoperative hematoma for this procedure. There was no perioperative death. Only one case of metastatic tumor relapsed after 6 months after the patient's first surgery (case 5). This patient had a second surgery and CyberKnife treatment. Postoperative DWI was taken in five patients.

Subsequently, we switched the ViewSite tubular retractor into brain spatulas to identify and sacrifice the feeding artery, which was present in the interface between the normal brain and lesion. We sacrificed the feeding artery and removed the residual tumor under a microscope.

To solve these problems, many brain retraction systems combined with a microscope or endoscope have been introduced. First, the self-retaining retraction system by Greenberg was introduced in 1981.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, the danger of brain infarction and brain damage due to excessive brain retraction pressure has been debated. Rosenorn <italic>et al</italic>. reported a reduction in regional cerebral blood flow in the brain cortex lying under the retractor with 20 mmHg of brain retractor pressure using rat models.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In the human brain, the threshold for ischemia and contusion are estimated to be less than 30mmHg.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Additionally, systemic intraoperative factors, such as blood loss, acidosis, hypotension, and metabolic abnormalities, can increase the risk of cerebral ischemia resulting from a brain retractor.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Since these studies, many neurosurgeons have suggested the advantage of a tubular retractor system. This system can distribute the forces of retraction evenly and reduce brain retraction pressure to normal surrounding tissue compared with traditional retractors.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Ogura <italic>et al</italic>. invented a cylinder with a 0.1-mm transparent polyester film to create a cylindrical surgical route.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Of particular importance, they evaluated brain retractor pressure on surrounding tissue, and it was less than 10 mmHg, which is lower than the critical threshold for cerebral ischemia suggested by Rosenorn.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The ViewSite tubular retractor is a specially tailored tubular retractor for neurosurgery and applied for removal of intraparenchymal or intraventricular tumors, hemorrhage, and foreign bodies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The ViewSite tubular retractor is not only used for the transcortical approach but also for the interhemispheric transcallosal approach for the third ventricle,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or middle fossa approach for intracanalicular tumors.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This retractor has many advantages. First, the ViewSite tubular retractor may decrease damage to normal brain tissue. As mentioned above, Recinos <italic>et al</italic>. reported postoperative imaging following use of the ViewSite tubular retractor and showed minimal T2/FLAIR changes along the surgical path.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Additionally, this retractor is composed of plastic and has a tapered end, which prevents electrical transmission and allows adjacent tissue to be visualized. Additionally, the ViewSite tubular retractor can be secured onto a self-retracting arm, such as the Greenberg or Leyla bar systems, to prevent shifting of the operation field.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, there are two disadvantages of the ViewSite tubular retractor. First, the area of the forward edge is significantly smaller than that of the reverse edge because of its unique tapered shape[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>]. This leads to limitation in working space [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">b</xref>]. In cases, where surgeries are completely performed with the ViewSite tubular retractor, an endoscope, and modified microsurgical instruments for endoscopic surgery, this disadvantage of the limitation in working space may be overcome. However, for deep-seated hypervascular tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme, binocular, and 3D vision provided by a microscope provides more information and leads to safer resections than with an endoscope.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In these cases, a small working space restricts the use of microsurgical instruments. Second, in many deep-seated lesions, the interface between normal tissue and the lesion is not always clear, and lesions frequently have an irregular border.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Therefore, the border of the lesion should be carefully observed to achieve gross total resection. Recinos <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the ViewSite tubular retractor can easily be moved and repositioned for approaching irregular lesions.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, we speculate whether this retractor can cause excessive brain pressure because its shape cannot be changed freely. In contrast, brain spatulas are familiar instruments for neurosurgeons and suitable for overcoming these disadvantages. When brain spatulas are used after making a corridor by the ViewSite tubular retractor, normal brain tissue does not need to be retracted with excessive pressure because a path to the lesion has already been made and retained. Additionally, brain spatulas enable retraction of the normal brain locally. Therefore, brain spatulas can provide larger operative fields than the ViewSite brain retractor and adequate operative fields for observing the interface between lesions and normal tissue. Brain spatulas can also prevent brain injury from excessive brain pressure derived from repositioning of the ViewSite tubular retractor. In this study, we evaluated restricted diffusion on DWI as a marker for brain cytotoxic edema and ischemic or cell damage. To the best our knowledge, only one study quantitatively evaluated brain damage resulting from a retractor using postoperative MRI.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In this previous study, the authors used the METRx tubular retractor system for deep intraparenchymal lesions. They reported that postoperative DWI volume (8.35 &#x000b1; 3.05 cm<sup>3</sup>) tended to be lower than that of the traditional retractor (16.51 &#x000b1; 8.9 cm<sup>3</sup>). In our series, postoperative DWI volume was lower than previously reported.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Therefore, the combination of the ViewSite tubular retractor and brain spatulas may provide less damage to normal brain tissue.</p><p>The concept of tubular retractor was proposed more than 30 years ago, and their efficacy and safety have been reported numerously compared with traditional blade retractors that may cause asymmetric tension on brain tissue. By contrast, we also feel the disadvantages of tubular retractor, which are the limitation of working space and observing irregular border of deep-seated lesions. The brain spatulas compensate these disadvantages, and we can provide minimally invasive surgery by using the combination of the ViewSite tubular retractor and brain spatulas technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, we first introduced the combination of the ViewSite tubular retractor and brain spatulas to overcome the disadvantage of the ViewSite tubular retractor, including the limitation in the area and view of the operative field.
