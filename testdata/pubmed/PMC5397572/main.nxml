In the present study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of and related risk factors for pulmonary metastasis from this tumor. Forty-six patients with lung metastasis were analyzed. In total, 60.9% of the primary tumors were located around the knee joint. The Campanacci stage of all tumors was stage 3. Surgery of the primary tumor included curettage in 37 patients, resection in 8, and amputation in 1. Local recurrence after the primary surgery occurred in 34 patients. The recurrence rate, Campanacci stage, and surgical method were significant risk factors for lung metastasis. The median postoperative metastasis times in the lower limbs, upper limbs, and axial skeleton were 20.1, 7.9, and 1.4 months, respectively (p=0.010). The median metastasis times in patients with and without recurrence were 13.7 and 43.2 months, respectively (p=0.018). Eighteen patients had unilateral metastasis and 28 had bilateral metastasis. Most lesions (n=38) were located in the peripheral lung. Nineteen patients received treatment, and 12 of them underwent tumor resection. The 5-year overall survival rate was 94.4%. This study showed that local recurrence, a high Campanacci stage, and curettage were possible high-risk factors for pulmonary metastasis. The primary lesion site and local recurrence may be related to the metastasis time. The survival rate of patients with pulmonary metastasis was high.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is an invasive benign bone tumor consisting of proliferative mononuclear cells and osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells. It has the tendency to relapse. GCTB accounts for 4&#x02013;5% of primary bone tumors. The incidence of lung metastasis in patients with GCTB is about 1&#x02013;9% <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Viswanathan et al. <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> reported that two mechanisms are related to lung metastasis: a self-limiting process of transformation and vascular transfer. Because both lung tissue and GCTB tissue have a rich blood supply, the tumor cells may invade the interstitium and destroy the vessel walls, facilitating hematogenous metastasis to the lung.</p><p>Studies and reports of lung metastasis of GCTB are rare because of the low incidence of lung metastasis. The biological behavior and clinical features of GCTB are difficult to predict <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Some researchers have attempted to analyze related clinical factors of lung metastasis, such as age, sex, primary tumor site, tumor stage, primary tumor treatment, and recurrence. However, the numbers of patients were small, and different results were reported among the studies. High-level evidence from large-sample data is lacking. Therefore, the present study focused on a large number of patients with lung metastasis in a single center. The purpose was to elucidate the clinical characteristics and risk factors for pulmonary metastasis of GCTB.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>General characteristics</title><p>This study was a retrospective clinical case analysis.

The inclusion criteria were a pathological diagnosis of benign GCTB, lung metastasis as confirmed by pathology or computed tomography (CT) (lesion diameter of &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;cm and dynamically increasing), and no evidence of any other tumor. According to the above conditions, 46 patients were enrolled in this study from January 1983 to February 2014 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The following possible risk variables were analyzed: sex and age of patient, tumor location, Campanacci stage, treatment of the primary tumor <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and number of local recurrences.

Campanacci et al. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> reported 280 cases of GCTB in 1987, and the lung metastasis rate among these cases was 2.1%. Dominkus et al. <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> reported 649 cases of GCTB, and 2.1% of them had lung metastasis. In 2010, Errani et al. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> reported 349 cases of GCTB, and the lung metastasis rate was 4.0%. In our center, Sung et al. <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> reported that 6 of 111 patients with GCTB had pulmonary metastasis in 1982, and Niu et al. <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> reported that the rate of lung metastasis was 3.4% among 621 cases of GCTB in 2012.</p><p>The clinical characteristics of lung metastatic lesions were analyzed in the present study. Most lesions were multiple and located in the bilateral lungs, and they were mainly distributed in the peripheral lung. These characteristics are similar to those of metastases of other malignant tumors. However, the biological behavior of pulmonary metastasis of GCTB differs from that of other tumors. In general, the vast majority of GCTB metastases progress slowly. The doubling time of GCTB lung metastasis is significantly longer than that of other tumors <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The male: female sex ratio was 1.4:1.0 in the present study, which is the same as that in our database <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This indicates no sex-related tendency of lung metastasis. There was also no significant difference in the age distribution between the present study and our database. A previous study <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> also suggested that the patient's age and sex as well as the characteristics of the primary lesion (such as the presence of a pathological fracture, the range of bone involvement, and the distance from the joint) were not significantly related to lung metastasis.</p><p>In terms of location, 81.4% of the primary tumors in this study were located in the lower limbs and 18.6% were in the upper limbs. No significant difference was present between these results and those in our database. The proportions of tumors around the knee joint were also similar. The proximal extremities (femur and humerus) accounted for 23.2% of the tumor sites in the present study, which is 5.2% higher than that in our large-sample report. However, a significant difference was not shown. Therefore, our analysis does not indicate a correlation between lung metastasis and the distribution of the primary lesion. Errani et al. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> reported a higher rate of lung metastasis in patients with primary tumors located in the proximal femur and distal radius. The small number of cases involving tumors in the proximal femur and humerus in our study may have accounted for the lack of a significant difference.</p><p>We also analyzed the factors related to the metastasis time and found some positive results. The metastasis time was shortest for primary tumors located in the axial skeleton, second shortest for the upper limbs, and longest for the lower limbs. Donthineni et al. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> reported that spinal GCTB had a high metastasis rate at 13.7%. In 2015, Chan et al. <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> also reported that a primary tumor located in the axial skeleton was a risk factor for lung metastasis. However, most of the literature does not support that the primary tumor site is associated with lung metastasis.</p><p>In this study, all tumors were Campanacci stage 3, which is a significantly higher proportion than in our database <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Such a high stage usually suggests that a tumor is highly aggressive and may be a high-risk factor for lung metastasis. Previous reports have also suggested that the stage of a GCTB may be related to lung metastasis. Chan et al. <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> reported that all patients with lung metastasis had stage 3 tumors, and Dominkus et al. <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> reported that most patients with lung metastasis had stage 3 tumors. Faisham et al. <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> reported that the metastasis rate of Campanacci stage 3 GCTB was as high as 30%.</p><p>The recurrence rate in our database <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> was 12.4%, and that in the present study was 73.9%. This significant difference suggests that local recurrence is correlated with pulmonary metastasis. Niu et al. <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> reported that the metastasis rate was 8.6% in patients with recurrence and only 2.4% in those without recurrence. Rock <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> reported that the metastatic risk in patients with recurrence was six times higher than that in patients without recurrence. Many other reports <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> have also supported that the recurrence is a high-risk factor. A study at the Rizzoli Institute <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> revealed a 71% recurrence rate among patients with metastasis and only a 29% recurrence rate among those without metastasis. Therefore, monitoring of the pulmonary condition is very important for patients with postoperative recurrence.</p><p>Some authors <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> have suggested that pulmonary metastases are related to the type of surgery performed for the primary tumor. The surgery itself, not the invasiveness of the tumor, might lead to vascular differentiation because surgical manipulation enables implantation of tumor cells in the lung. Most pulmonary metastases occur postoperatively, but this does not occur for several years or even &#x0003e;10 years postoperatively in some patients. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to prove the relationship between surgery and metastasis. Kay et al. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> suggested that the surgical method was a risk factor. All six patients with pulmonary metastasis had undergone curettage of the primary tumor, but not resection. The present study showed similar results in that the patients who underwent resection of the primary lesion had a lower metastasis rate. This should be related to the lower rate of local recurrence among patients who underwent resection. In our previous study <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, the local recurrence rate in the resection group (1.6%) was significantly lower than that in the curettage group (8.6%). A low local recurrence rate is related to a low lung metastasis rate. Curettage is currently the most common and effective method for the treatment of GCTB. We applied extended curettage for GCTB and achieved satisfactory local control. Therefore, even if an association between surgery and pulmonary metastasis exists, the benefits (good local control and retention of the articular surface) are obvious.</p><p>With respect to the relationship between vascular invasion and lung metastasis, Sladden <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> reported five patients with tumor invasion of blood vessels, but no metastasis was found. Other studies <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> have shown that the presence of an intravascular tumor thrombus did not increase the risk of pulmonary metastasis.</p><p>Our study had some limitations. First, it was a retrospective study covering a long span of time period, and the incidence of lung metastasis was very low. Second, only 11 patients had pathologic evidence of lung metastasis. Both biopsy and resection are traumatic operations with risks and complications. Many patients in our study had multiple metastases that could not be completely removed by surgery or benefit from surgery; there was no effective treatment method even if the lesions were confirmed by pathological examination. Therefore, these patients did not undergo surgery based on ethical considerations and the wishes of the patients. Growth of the lesions was confirmed on serial images in all patients, and other possible diseases such as tuberculosis, infection, or fibrous tissue hyperplasia were excluded.</p><p>In conclusion, local recurrence, a high Campanacci stage, and curettage of the primary lesion are possible high-risk factors for pulmonary metastasis. The primary lesion site and local recurrence may be related to the time of metastasis. The survival rate of patients with pulmonary metastasis in this study was high.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>Each author certifies that he or she has no commercial associations (eg, consultancies, stock ownership, equity interest, patent/licensing arrangements, etc.) that might pose a conflict of interest in connection with the submitted article.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Ethical review committee statement</title><p>Each author certifies that his or her institution approved the reporting of this case report and that all investigations were conducted in conformity with ethical principles of research.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Source of funding</title><p><funding-source id="gs1">Beijing Talents Fund</funding-source> 2015000021469G181.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Campanacci</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldini</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Boriani</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sudanese</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Giant-cell tumor of bone</article-title><source>J.
