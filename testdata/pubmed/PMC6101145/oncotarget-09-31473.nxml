It accounts for 2.4% of all pediatric malignancies worldwide. The estimated average survival rate of patients with OS following diagnosis at metastatic stage (15 to 30%) is four to five years [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This is likely due to the high propensity of OS to haematologically metastasize early and progress rapidly given its primary sites with rich blood supply e.g. metaphysis of distal femur, proximal tibia and humerus. Current gold standard treatment involves use of high-dose neoadjuvant chemotherapies followed by <italic>en bloc</italic> resection of the cancer, which may include amputation in some cases. The overall survival rates in OS patients have not improved despite recent developments and advances in treatment strategies, prompting rigorous study of possible means of treating OS. Treatments for OS now include gene, targeted, and immunotherapy with progress in molecular biology [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The physiological states in cancer have resulted in complex regulatory mechanisms of cellular metabolism [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cancer cells co-opt this normal regulation to fuel inappropriate cell proliferation and support survival in abnormal tissue contexts, leading to differed metabolism of tumor tissues from that of normal tissues from which cancer arises [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cancer cells depend mainly on glucose metabolism for their energy production and macromolecular synthesis. The shift to aerobic glycolysis from mitochondrial respiration in rapidly proliferating tumor cells is a characteristic hallmark - a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The high biomass requirements of rapid proliferating cancer cells are fulfilled by aerobic glycolysis, although it is inefficient from an energetic aspect [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The distinct metabolism of tumor cells makes targeting of metabolic pathways a promising approach for therapeutic interventions. Several metabolic modulators that alter essential malignant cell survival pathways have been developed with some success in recent years [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the success of metabolic modulating agents in cancer depends on a better understanding of their mechanism and identification of the ideal tumor type to target. It is also important to study these modulators as both single agents and in combination with other agents. The adequacy of treatment demographics i.e. dosing and schedule, tumor type and treatment response evaluation remain uncertain although these drugs have been tested in clinics. Glucose analogue 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) used in renal cell carcinomas resulted in dose-limiting toxicities such as fatigue, sweating, and prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval in electrocardiography (EKG) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>To a large extent, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in OS has resulted in limb-salvage surgery replacing conventional amputation. Having said that, there is no consensus on whether neo-adjuvant chemotherapy improves the long-term prognosis of patients. Only 60% of OS patients respond to chemotherapy. The efficacy of these routinely used single chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of OS (based on histological type) had plateaued. Resistance to chemotherapy could also be due to intrinsic chemotherapeutic resistance developing prior to chemotherapy as well as acquired resistance occurring after several cycles of treatment, which led to the introduction of double chemotherapy agents in the treatment of OS. The current treatment protocol in OS includes a cocktail of chemotherapeutic agents e.g. Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Ifosfomide and an addition of high-dose Methotrexate. This first-line therapy is indicated in primary or metastatic disease states, and also as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies. Neoadjuvantly, the regular dose for Cisplatin given continuously as an infusion via intravenous route for 24 hours is 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, in addition to boluses of Doxorubicin for three days [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An essential aspect of OS management includes considering the toxicities from these chemotherapy agents and their side effects such as ototoxicity and/or hearing loss, myelosupression and risk of neutropenic sepsis or hemorrhage, ammenorhea, infertility, nephro- and cardiotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy and second malignant neoplasms (carcinogenesis). Reducing the chemotherapy dose concentrations and their complications in OS treatment is an important goal that will require the development of other treatment options and improved antidotes for the active anti-OS drugs. A novel strategy that efficiently inhibits growth and metastasis of OS is highly warranted.</p><p>Electroporation (EP) is a physical method of electrical application that allows permeabilization of cell membranes. This allows and facilitates the uptake of ions and compounds into cells across the cell membranes. A benefit to this approach is that a lower concentration of compounds can be used to achieve a similar if not better effect on cells or tumor. Clinically available metabolic modulators such as Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) are negatively charged molecules, whilst Metformin and 2DG are neutral. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has been shown to be an effective technique for ablating human metastatic OS [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There is no data to show the delivery of metabolic modulators using reversible EP in the treatment of cancers, particularly OS.</p><p>The combined treatment comprising of metabolic modulators and chemotherapy could be an intriguing approach for the treatment of patients with OS. Understanding the potential benefits of combining these two treatment modalities could be important in developing optimal treatment strategies for patients with advanced OS. Currently, no prospective data on this combination treatment is available. In this study, we examined the morphologies, cell cycles and effects on recovery and proliferation, and survival of OS cells treated with different metabolic modulators (delivered using reversible EP) in combination with low-dose Cisplatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Morphology of osteosarcoma cells post EP optimization</title><p>The murine K7M2 cell line and the human Saos2 cell line were maintained at their active growth phase and their morphological changes evaluated post EP at different field intensities.

After EP, cells were cytospun and stained to study its cellular morphology at 24 hours.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> presents the ultrastructural morphological changes of K7M2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and Saos2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) OS cell lines at 24 hours post EP, at different field intensities (represented by voltage) (range of 0 to 1.25 kV/cm). No significant morphological changes were observed in the untreated groups in both cell lines. Both untreated groups showed well-rounded, smooth and regular-surfaced cells. As higher voltages were applied, more intracytoplasmic vacuoles (arrow) were observed alongside increase in size of the swollen cells. Blebbing of cellular membranes (right-angle arrow) of cells in both groups also were observed at higher voltages. Voltages of above 1.0 kV/cm for K7M2 and 0.75 kV/cm for Saos2 showed leakage of cytoplasmic material (red triangle) as a result of irreversible EP causing rupture of cellular membranes. There were more &#x02018;ghost-like&#x02019; (black triangle) appearances of dead cells seen in field intensities higher than 0.75 kV/cm for K7M2 and 0.5 kV/cm for Saos2. Red boxes indicate the optimal voltages of reversible EP for each cell line. These voltages were derived from the combination of morphological changes, viability and PI uptake of cells post EP.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Morphology, PI uptake and viability of K7M2 and Saos2 cell lines post EP optimization</title><p>Both cell lines were electroporated with eight 99 us pulses with a voltage-to-distance ratio ranging from 0.25 to 1.25 kV/cm.

The efficiency of EP was evaluated by the penetration of PI, and uptake across the cell membrane using flow cytometry. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> present flow cytometry dot plots of K7M2 &#x00026; Saos2 cells respectively that were electroporated in the presence of PI at ascending voltages. The red populations (dots) represent non-viable cells, whilst the black populations (dots) are viable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, 1D</xref>). It is evident that both OS cell lines take up more PI at higher EP voltages. However, there was a slight decrease in PI uptake of viable K7M2 cells at 1.25 kV/cm compared to 1 kV/cm, but a higher count of non-viable cells at this voltage. Both cell lines showed a direct proportional increment of PI uptake with increased EP voltages, with the highest uptake at 1 kV/cm for K7M2 and 1.25 kV/cm for Saos2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p><p>There were a higher number of dead cells observed at 1 kV/cm based on morphology of K7M2 cells (black triangle, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and decreased viability over 96 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Increased cell death at this voltage was due to IRE caused by high voltages from EP. Morphologically, there were fewer dead K7M2 cells at 0.75 kV/cm compared to 1.25 kV/cm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Viability of K7M2 cells at 0.75 kV/cm was over 90% at 48 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Therefore, we concluded the optimum voltage/field intensity was 0.75 kV/cm for K7M2 (red box Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>) based on a combination of morphological changes, viability of cells and PI uptake. 0.75 kV/cm was the voltage used for all subsequent experiments involving K7M2 cells.</p><p>Saos2 cells also showed a direct proportional increment of PI uptake as higher EP voltage were applied, with the highest uptake at 1.25 kV/cm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). However, there were fewer viable Saos2 cells observed morphologically above 0.5 kV/cm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), therefore making it the optimum voltage (red box Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>) for reversible EP, allowing PI to enter the cells and yet maintaining their viability at 90% over 96 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). 0.5 kV/cm was the voltage used for all subsequent experiments involving Saos2 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Effects of metabolic modulators delivered using EP relative to modulators alone</title><p>The optimum concentrations of the candidate metabolic modulators were obtained by a series of dose responses on OS cells, treated actively (with EP) and passively (without EP). There were notably higher numbers of dead K7M2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and Saos2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) cells seen morphologically in groups treated with actively delivered metabolic modulators for 24 hours (optimized concentration). Dead cells were defined morphologically as cells that had lost their plasma membrane integrity leading to the loss of cell&#x02019;s identity, cell fragmentation, or engulfment by adjacent cells [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In these two figures, the black arrows show intracytoplasmic vacuoles as a result of EP, and black triangles show dead cells. In the EP-delivered treatment groups for both cell lines, there was a slight increase of total dead cells. The ability of K7M2 and Saos2 cells to recover and proliferate after a 24-hour treatment with metabolic modulators delivered actively was significantly reduced compared to the groups treated with modulators alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, 2D</xref>), assessed by colony formation assay. Active delivery of DCA was most effective in inhibiting the recovery in both cell lines. Data was statistically significant with values of <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 throughout all treatment groups. These findings suggest an increased uptake of metabolic modulators when delivered actively by EP, allowing them to exert their potency on OS cells more effectively i.e. halting their cell cycle allowing for reduced rate of proliferation. We conclude that delivering metabolic modulators using EP negatively affects the ability of OS cells to recover and proliferate over a period of time.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Morphology and recovery of K7M2 and Saos2 cell lines treated with metabolic modulators delivered using EP relative to modulators alone</title><p>Morphologies of (<bold>A</bold>) K7M2 and (<bold>B</bold>) Saos2 cell lines at 24 hours post EP in the presence or absence of different metabolic modulators at their optimized concentration.

However, at 24 hours EP-delivered DCA showed a pronounced inhibition of K7M2 cells at G0/G1 phase and increased G2/M phase compared to the groups that were passively treated [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A(ii)</xref>]. There was also an increment in the S phase of K7M2 cells in the EP DCA group [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A(ii)</xref>], suggesting failure of progression of these cells from the S to G2/M phases in their cell cycle.

The G2/M phase of this cell line were halted at higher concentrations of DCA [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B(ii)</xref>]. K7M2 cells treated with 2DG using EP also showed stalling of their cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase at higher doses, causing a lesser degree of replication of these fast-growing cells due failure of progression to G2/M phase.

On the whole, a greater effect of these metabolic modulators delivered using EP was seen in the K7M2 compared to Saos2 cells.

Reduced ATP levels potentiate sensitivity of cancer cells to, and enhance the effects of low-dose chemotherapeutics [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We assessed this theory in OS cells by looking at their recovery and colony formation post combined treatment. It is evident that OS cells treated with the combination approach negatively affects the ability of these cells to recover and proliferate, compared to the other treatment groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G, 4H</xref>). The optimum combination treatment was EP-delivered DCA combined with Cisplatin for both cell lines (dashed red box in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G, 4H</xref>). This was statistically significant (<italic>p &#x0003c;</italic> 0.05) across all combined treatment groups compared to others. The sensitivity assay was set up to determine the efficacy of low-dose Cisplatin in OS cells that were initially treated actively with metabolic modulators. The ability of OS cells to form colonies in Cisplatin-treated media over a period of time reduced in the combination treatment groups in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A, 1B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we used Osteosarcoma cells to evaluate the combination effect of metabolic modulators delivered using reversible EP, followed by the addition of low-dose chemotherapy 24 hours later. To our knowledge we are the first to report the delivery of metabolic modulators using reversible EP. The optimum EP delivery parameters for these cell lines were determined. Morphologically, there were fewer cells when treated with metabolic modulators actively compared to the passive groups. This was consistent with their decreased recovery and survival (colony formation) over a period of time for both cell lines. In our data, we have shown that when combined with reversible EP, DCA, 2DG and Metformin, were able to significantly halt murine and human OS cell cycles at different phases of cell cycle. There was also a decrease in viability when EP-delivered metabolic modulators were combined with low-dose Cisplatin, consistent morphologically with the increased number of dead cells in the combined treatment groups. We also observed fewer cells in the combined treatment groups suggesting an increase in sensitivity of OS cells to low-dose chemotherapy, indicating an increase in synergy between these two drug classes. Finally, the OS cells&#x02019; ability to recover and proliferate was significantly reduced when treated using the combined method thus reducing their survival.</p><p>As mentioned previously, the gold-standard therapy for OS consists of multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Survival outcomes of patients with OS have not improved despite attempts to refine therapy efficacy e.g. via combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy especially in inoperable cases, and chemotherapy dose escalations [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Cell cycle alterations are excessively implicated in tumorigenesis, genomic instability and drug resistance [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Recent efforts to expand opportunities for treatment of OS through rigorous preclinical drug development, comprehensive genomic analyses, and the implementation of a histology-exclusive clinical trial model for the investigation of new agents are now beginning to generate a number of therapeutic strategies to be implemented in upcoming studies. This combination therapy of metabolic modulators and low-dose chemotherapy is not only effective in battling the survival of OS, but also less invasive as the metabolic modulators can be delivered using reversible EP intra-tumorally and followed by systemic administration of low-dose chemotherapy. We are optimistic that this new preclinical investigation on combination therapy in OS will identify a niche that can be moved forward to new trials in treatment regimes, with the goal of improving long-stagnant survival outcomes.</p><p>EP facilitates the intracellular uptake of substances that are otherwise difficult to enter cells, making it a popular technique for cell loading. This results in a higher intracellular concentration of compounds. In the treatment of cancer, EP technology has advanced tremendously leading to development of electrochemotherapy (ECT) and its increased anti-tumor effects [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Today, EP is used in many clinical and biotechnological applications. A clinical trial on soft tissue tumor is ongoing at the Sarcoma and Melanoma Unit of Padova. This trial extends ECT indications to patients with advanced and deep-seated cancers, where longer electrodes and bespoke insertions are used in this trial to generate an electric field tailored to the tumor mass and its margins. This is aimed at obtaining a higher local response and tumor control even on a large or deep tumor with a single treatment. Drug delivery using EP is found to be less painful [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and may represent a favorable minimally invasive alternative to wide surgical resection, at least in a subgroup of sarcoma patients. On the basis of high efficacy of ECT [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], clinicians and researches are developing strategies to extend the use of EP-delivered therapy to deep seated and visceral tumors. The development of EndoVe System led to the clinical trial of endoscopic treatment of inoperable colorectal cancer in Ireland. Results from the ESOPE trial demonstrated an 85% objective response rate in solid cutaneous and subcutaneous tumor of varying histologies [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. EP combined with Methotrexate has been employed with success in tumor-bearing mice with implanted OS cells [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The NanoKnife, an IRE device, was used to treat metastatic OS lung lesions [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. IRE was also shown to be more effective in ablating the tumor than conventional treatment in OS-bearing mice [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To date, there is no published data on the usage of reversible EP drug delivery in OS.</p><p>One common feature of cancer cells is their ability to use glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation to produce energy, despite its disease heterogeneity with diverse alterations [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. At first, a &#x02018;faulty&#x02019; respiratory chain was thought to be the cause of these differences leading to the increase in glycolysis by tumor cells as a compensatory mechanism to this defect. But, if cancer cells (relative to normal cells) increase glucose metabolism &#x02013; to form pyruvate and NADPH as a compensatory mechanism in response to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) formed as byproducts of oxidative energy metabolism &#x02013; then inhibition of glucose metabolism would be expected to sensitize cancer cells to agents that increase the levels of hydroperoxidases (i.e., chemotherapy agents such platinum-based therapeutics e.g. Cisplatin and quinones, known to redox cycle and produce ROS [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The increase in synergy between metabolic modulation and chemotherapy has been validated in colon carcinoma and lymphoma in <italic>in vivo</italic> studies [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Resistance to chemotherapeutics is promoted by an increase in tumor cells&#x02019; glycolytic rate. Accumulating data also indicate that intracellular ATP is a critical determinant of chemoresistance [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We demonstrated this finding in our study. OS cells showed enhanced sensitivity and synergy to induce cell death, and reduced recovery and proliferation when combined with low-dose Cisplatin, suggesting the enhanced therapeutic benefit of combined therapy of metabolic modulators delivered using reversible EP with chemotherapy <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Hair and hearing loss, gonadal and cardiac dysfunction, and infections associated with myositis, myelosuppression and impaired renal function are the most frequent complications associated with chemotherapy. As a result, long-term follow-up is required not only to monitor the remission status but also in order to screen for and manage late effects occurring following completion of the chemotherapy regime [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These adverse effects of chemotherapy can be minimized with the use of lower dose chemotherapies, given the increased synergy when combined with metabolic modulators delivered using reversible EP, as shown in our data. We propose this combination therapy as a novel addition to the armamentarium of treatments in OS.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell culturing</title><p>Two cell lines were used in the experiments, the established human OS cell line Saos2 [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and the murine OS cell line K7M2 [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].
