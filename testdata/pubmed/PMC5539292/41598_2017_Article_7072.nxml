It is not yet understood how the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to human SCGN (hSCGN) promotes secretion. Here we have addressed this question, using mass spectrometry combined with a disulfide searching algorithm DBond. We found that the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to hSCGN promotes the dimerization of hSCGN via the formation of a Cys193-Cys193 disulfide bond. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and molecular dynamics studies revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the EF-hands of hSCGN induces significant structural changes that affect the solvent exposure of N-terminal region, and hence the redox sensitivity of the Cys193 residue. These redox sensitivity changes were confirmed using biotinylated methyl-3-nitro-4-(piperidin-1-ylsulfonyl) benzoate (NPSB-B), a chemical probe that specifically labels reactive cysteine sulfhydryls. Furthermore, we found that wild type hSCGN overexpression promotes insulin secretion in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells, while C193S-hSCGN inhibits it. These findings suggest that insulin secretion in pancreatic cells is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ROS signaling through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced structural changes promoting dimerization of hSCGN.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Secretagogin (SCGN) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor protein that possesses six EF-hand helix-loop-helix calcium binding motifs. <italic>Scgn</italic>, originally cloned from pancreatic &#x003b2; cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, is expressed selectively in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells and neuroendocrine cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, as well as at distinct neurosecretory loci in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

To determine whether structural changes occur in hSCGN in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and thus potentially regulate hSCGN function, we conducted HDX-MS analysis of apo and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound SCGN. Because the crystal structure of calcium-bound hSCGN could not be obtained due to failure of crystal formation, we mapped hSCGN sequence onto the structure deduced from x-ray crystallographic and biophysical studies of <italic>Danio rerio</italic> SCGN in its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free apo-state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and used this structure to display the results of the HDX-MS studies. These studies revealed clear differences between apo and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound hSCGN with respect to the deuterium incorporation rates in particular regions of the protein (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). There were significant conformational changes in domains I and III of hSCGN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). In Domain III, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding reduced the deuterium incorporation of EF5 and EF6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>), and increased it at the Cys193 residue. The most dramatic HDX changes were found in N-terminal residues in EF1 and EF2 (18&#x02013;28 a.a.) of Domain I; upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, there was a substantial increase in deuterium uptake of these hydrophobic residues (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). This indicates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding causes significant conformational changes within the N-terminal region which could impact Cys193 and increase the dimerization of hSCGN. Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced exposure of a hydrophobic patch seems to be a common feature of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins.

The N-terminal region of SCGN is presumed to have a distinct role in cellular processes, based on its structure and isoforms. Regulatory EF-hand proteins are believed to undergo conformational changes upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, which affect various cellular functions. However, the details of the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.

We performed equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of hSCGN with and without six Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). The six calciums were modeled in accordance with the sequence preference of the EF-hand loop (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

Both structures changed significantly during the first 5&#x02009;ns. However, the changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound form reached the equilibrated trajectories more quickly, corresponding to an RMSD of slightly higher than 3&#x02009;&#x000c5;. In contrast, RMSDs of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free form surged up to ~4&#x02009;&#x000c5; and then decreased to ~2.8&#x02009;&#x000c5; in 25&#x02009;ns. The sudden increase of RMSDs at 40&#x02009;ns originated from flexibility of ten N-terminal residues in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> together with motion of Domain I, consistent with the results of the HDX studies. In the presence of 2&#x02009;mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the interface between EF1 and EF2 was exposed, again as shown in the HDX experiments. MD simulations also showed that the conformational change at the interface was negligible in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but was significant in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to EF1 and EF2 affected the short &#x003b2;-strands in the latter part of each loop, which form a small &#x003b2;-sheet. As a result, the interface gradually became more solvent-accessible, as shown in the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) plot (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). MD simulations also showed that the distance between two sulfur atoms of Cys253 and Cys269 became equilibrated after 15&#x02009;ns with an average distance of ~3.7&#x02009;&#x000c5; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>) in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound form. Since Cys253 and Cys269 are present on EF6, the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in EF6 appears to stabilize the region around these residues. Together with the increasing positive potential generated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the environment seems appropriate to form a disulfide bond between these two residues. However, the average distance between the sulfur atoms of Cys253 and Cys269 in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free form showed intermittent fluctuations even at the equilibrated state due to dynamic motion of EF6. This could make the formation of the disulfide bond between Cys253 and Cys269 difficult in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free form, in agreement with the results from MS analysis. Based on disulfide analysis by MS (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), the tendency for Cys253-Cys269 intra-disulfide bond formation in the monomer was enhanced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding at band 2 and 6, and NPSB-B labeling and stable dimer formation of Cys253 or Cys269 mutants was increased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Thus the Cys253-Cys269 intramolecular disulfide bond is not essential for dimerization of SCGN, although it might facilitate the stable dimerization of hSCGN by solidifying C-terminal structure via Cys253-Cys269 linkage.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Dynamics of apo and six Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound hSCGN in molecular dynamics simulation.

It is evident that the two N-terminal EF1 and EF2 have lower calcium affinity compared with other four EFs.

Our experiments showed that EF1 and EF2 bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup> at high calcium concentration due to their low calcium affinity. And our studies on MD simulation with six instead of four Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are in agreement with the above. Since there is no other calcium ion binding site in the N-terminal domain, the only plausible explanation of the conformational change around EF1 and EF2 was the binding of calcium ions in these EF motifs.

</p><p id="Par28">Since glucose stimulation promotes intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and ROS generation, we investigated whether SCGN dimerization contributes to glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. NIT-1 cells transiently transfected with control vector, hSCGN WT and C193S mutant were starved for 2 h, followed by stimulation with glucose for 30 min and assay of secreted insulin. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> shows that GSIS was augmented in hSCGN WT transfected cells compared to control. hSCGN WT has a positive effect on insulin secretion, while the C193S mutant, unable to form dimers, partially inhibited it. To further explain this inhibitory effect of the C193S mutant on insulin secretion, we examined the effect of the C193S mutant on the dimerization of hSCGN WT using recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>, dimerization of hSCGN was reduced by addition of the C193S mutant, indicating that C193S interrupts hSCGN WT dimer formation. These results suggest that Cys193-dependent dimerization of SCGN is an essential step for regulating insulin secretion and that C193S mutant may act as a dominant negative mutant by disturbing the dimerization of endogenous SCGN in NIT-1 cells. Although the overexpression of hSCGN was modest because of the high endogenous SCGN expression in NIT-1 cells, the differences in insulin secretion between cells overexpressing hSCGN WT and C193S mutants vs. the controls were statistically significant.</p><p id="Par29">We previously reported that hSCGN regulates insulin secretion through interaction with the actin cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. hSCGN interacts with actin and this interaction was increased by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and glucose stimulation, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ROS signaling regulate the interaction between SCGN and actin. To determine whether C193S hSCGN interferes with actin binding, we performed immunoprecipitation with hSCGN WT and C193S mutant. Since NIT-1 cells are not suitable for immunoprecipitation with ectopic hSCGN because of their high endogenous expression of SCGN, we used MDA-MB-231 cells, which express only trace amounts of hSCGN. We found that the C193S mutant did not interact with the actin cytoskeleton, whereas hSCGN WT did (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). These results suggest that SCGN dimerization plays a role in regulating insulin secretion through interaction with actin cytoskeleton.</p><p id="Par30">We previously reported that SCGN regulates GSIS via ROS signaling and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment enhanced the co-localization with actin cytoskeleton in plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The dimerization of SCGN has a modulatory role in insulin secretion and further oligomerization of SCGN occurs only inside cells in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ionomycin (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,D</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). We examined whether dimerization and oligomerization are crucial for localization to membrane fraction, we performed fractionation of ectopic WT and Cys mutants of SCGN in HeLa cells. Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> shows SCGN monomer and dimer localized to cytosol, nuclear, and membrane fractions, while SCGN oligomer localized in only nuclear and membrane fractions. C193S failed to form the dimer, therefore, dimeric and oligomeric C193S SCGN did not localized to nuclear and membrane fractions, indicating that dimerization is prerequisite for oligomerization. It is possible that SCGN dimers form hetero-oligomers with vesicle secretory machinery in NIT-1 cells in response to glucose stimulation, or that other special cellular conditions are required for oligomerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. It is also possible that glucose stimulation increases the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and acutely dimerizes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound SCGN by ROS generation, with the dimerized SCGN forming oligomers that bind with the actin cytoskeleton to enhance insulin secretion. However, cellular function of oligomers remains to be further elucidated.</p><p id="Par31">In summary, this study identifies a novel regulatory mechanism in the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells by SCGN that involves stepwise structural changes brought on by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, followed by SCGN dimerization by cysteine oxidation in response to ROS. Moreover, these changes appear to be important for GSIS. The elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in glucose-stimulated pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells is hypothesized to cause conformational changes in inactive apo-SCGN via Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding by inducing N-terminal flexibility. This is followed by allosteric regulation of Cys193 reactivity and stabilization of C-terminal disulfide bonds between C253 and C269 that prevents non-specific dimerization and induces an N-terminal conformation change to form Cys193-linked dimers more efficiently. This study identifies the molecular crosstalk between Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and oxidation in the formation of functionally-important disulfide dimers, crucial for the biological function of SCGN in insulin secretion in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
