Elevation of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 is a key feature of it. The expression of the specific molecular chaperone of core1&#x000df;1, 3galactosyl transferase (<italic>Cosmc</italic>) is known to be reduced in IgAN. We aimed to investigate whether the methylation of CpG islands of <italic>Cosmc</italic> gene promoter region could act as a possible mechanism responsible for down-regulation of <italic>Cosmc</italic> and related higher secretion of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1in lymphocytes from children with IgA nephropathy. Three groups were included: IgAN children (n = 26), other renal diseases (n = 11) and healthy children (n = 13). B-lymphocytes were isolated and cultured, treated or not with IL-4 or 5-Aza-2&#x02019;-deoxycytidine (AZA). The levels of DNA methylation of <italic>Cosmc</italic> promotor region were not significantly different between the lymphocytes of the three children populations (<italic>P</italic> = 0.113), but there were significant differences between IgAN lymphocytes and lymphocytes of the other two children populations after IL-4 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) or AZA (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression was low in IgAN lymphocytes compared to the other two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). The level of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 was markedly higher in IgAN group compared to the other groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). After treatment with IL-4, the levels of <italic>Cosmc</italic> DNA methylation and aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 in IgAN lymphocytes were remarkably higher than the other two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) with more markedly decreased Cosmc mRNA content (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). After treatment with AZA, the levels in IgAN lymphocytes were decreased, but was still remarkably higher than the other two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001), while Cosmc mRNA content in IgAN lymphocytes were more markedly increased than the other two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). The alteration of DNA methylation by IL-4 or AZA specifically correlates in IgAN lymphocytes with alterations in <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression and with the level of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 (r = &#x02212;0.948, r = 0. 707). Our results suggested that hypermethylation of <italic>Cosmc</italic> promoter region could be a key mechanism for the reduction of <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression in IgAN lymphocytes with associated increase in aberrantly glycosylated IgA1.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.81070565).

<italic>Cosmc</italic> is the specific molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum for T-synthase, a Golgi &#x000df;1, 3-galactosyltransferase that generates the core 1 O-glycan, Gal&#x000df;1,3GalNAc&#x00251;-Ser/Thr, in glycoproteins. Dysfunctional <italic>Cosmc</italic> leads to the formation of inactive T-synthase and consequent expression of the Tn antigen, which is associated with Tn syndrome and IgAN. It is reported that the <italic>Cosmc</italic> promoter in B cells from a patient with Tn antigen-positive leukocytes is methylated and AZA treatment restores <italic>Cosmc</italic> transcription and normal O-glycans [<xref rid="pone.0112305.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this work, we investigated whether the methylation of CpG islands of <italic>Cosmc</italic> gene promoter could act as a possible mechanism responsible for the down regulation of <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA and related higher secretion of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 in lymphocytes from children with IgAN.</p><p>As expected (consistent with IgAN pathology), the level of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 was markedly higher in supernatants of lymphocytes from IgAN children compared to the other groups. The levels of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 were increased by IL-4 and reduced by AZA for the three lymphocytes groups; interestingly, reduction with AZA was more important in the IgAN group.</p><p>As expected (consistent with IgAN pathology), <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression was low in IgAN lymphocytes compared to the two other groups. IL-4 treatment enhanced the difference between the IgAN group and the others by more markedly decreasing <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA content in IgAN lymphocytes. Conversely, <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA content was regained after AZA treatment, markedly for IgAN lymphocytes and moderately for healthy lymphocytes, so that the differences in mRNA levels were markedly reduced between the three populations after AZA treatment.</p><p>In this study, <italic>in vitro</italic> IL-4 treatment revealed differences between the three lymphocytes populations; it very significantly increased <italic>Cosmc</italic> promoter methylation in IgAN lymphocytes whereas the increase was moderate in control healthy lymphocytes and no significant for lymphocytes of patients with other renal diseases. These results are consistent with conclusion of Yamada K et al. [<xref rid="pone.0112305.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which showed that IL-4 reduced the expression of C1GALT1 in IgA1-positive human B-cell line. Since C1&#x000df;3Gal-T (gene: C1GALT1) plays a role with its specific molecular chaperone&#x02014;<italic>Cosmc</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0112305.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we suppose the reduced expression of <italic>Cosmc</italic> to be the cause of the reduced the expression of C1&#x000df;3Gal-T. Further experiments are still needed to confirm it.</p><p>He et al [<xref rid="pone.0112305.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that the IL-4/STAT6 signaling pathway was highly activated in all tonsil tissues of IgAN patients. It showed that activation of the IL-4/STAT6 signaling pathway may have a crucial role in secretion of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1. Also, we noticed that in clinic, some onset of IgAN in children patients were induced by infections. Inflammation could produce cytokines (e.g.IL-4) [<xref rid="pone.0112305.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], so the decreased levels of <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA with the increased levels of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 and the methylation of <italic>Cosmc</italic> promoter region caused by IL-4 may be one of the mechanisms of why the disease could be induced by infections.</p><p>Conversely, the results showed that AZA treatment reduced DNA methylation in lymphocytes of the three populations; reduced the levels of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 and increased <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA markedly for IgAN lymphocytes.</p><p>As DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibitor [<xref rid="pone.0112305.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0112305.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], AZA can inhibit DNA methylation. Our results showed that <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA content was regained and the levels of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 were reduced after AZA treatment. We concluded that AZA inhibited the DNA methylation of <italic>Cosmc</italic> promoter region and partially restored the activation and function of inhibited <italic>Cosmc</italic> gene(C1GALT1C1). Interestingly, reduction or the increase with AZA was more important in the IgAN group. This suggests there are higher levels of <italic>Cosmc</italic> DNA methylation in IgAN lymphocytes than the other two groups.</p><p>We presume DNA methylation of <italic>Cosmc</italic> gene (C1GALT1C1) could act as a possible mechanism responsible for the down regulation of <italic>Cosmc</italic> and related higher secretion of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 in lymphocytes from children with IgAN. Also, the results of the correlation analysis support it. The correlation between <italic>Cosmc</italic> DNA methylation and <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression was specifically very strongly negative for the IgAN lymphocytes. This suggests that <italic>Cosmc</italic> DNA methylation could be a major determinant of <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression especially in the IgAN group, but not in the other diseases group. For the other diseases lymphocytes, the correlation between <italic>Cosmc</italic> DNA methylation and <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression was very poor, suggesting that factors different from <italic>Cosmc</italic> DNA methylation may regulate <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression in the other diseases. Moreover, in the IgAN group only, concomitant aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 positively correlated with DNA methylation and negatively correlated with <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA. For the lymphocytes of patients with other renal diseases, the correlation between aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 levels and <italic>Cosm</italic>c DNA methylation was poor.</p><p>However, unexpected, the mean levels of DNA methylation of <italic>Cosmc</italic> promotor region, evaluated after 48 hours <italic>in vitro</italic> culturing with plain medium, were not significantly different between the lymphocytes of the three children populations. This finding seems to be not consistent with the hypothesis that increased <italic>Cosmc</italic> DNA methylation could cause reduced <italic>Cosmc</italic> expression in IgAN. The reason may lies in the following three points. First, the sample may be not large enough. In this study, we only include 50 voluntary participants. The three groups may be not representative of the entire populations. What&#x02019;s more, this experimental study was performed <italic>in vitro</italic> on cultured B lymphocytes from children with IgAN, other renal disease and healthy children. Maybe an existing native hypermethylation (potentially present <italic>in vivo</italic>) be reversed by the 48 hours lymphocytes culturing in plain medium. Further <italic>in viv</italic>o evaluations on large populations are needed. At last, the potential key factors that influencing <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression through DNA methylation might be not the levels but the alteration of the status of <italic>Cosmc</italic> gene methylation. Hypermethylation at some key site of CpG islands of <italic>Cosmc</italic> gene promoter region might play a decisive role in altering the status of <italic>Cosmc</italic> gene DNA, which consequently altering the mRNA expression of <italic>Cosmc</italic>. In the present study, we tested DNA methylation levels at every site of CpG islands in <italic>Cosmc</italic> gene promoter and analyzed the total incidence of DNA methylation. Furthermore, we are going to focus on each site of CpG islands to analyze the status of methylation.</p><p>We noticed that in this study, with AZA treatment, the reduction of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 and the increase of <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression were more marked in IgAN lymphocytes. While, the reduction of DNA methylation being less marked in IgAN lymphocytes, so that the level of <italic>Cosmc</italic> DNA methylation after AZA remained higher in IgAN lymphocytes than the other two groups. We consider the cause may lies in the following two points. Firstly, the level of Cosmc DNA hypermethylation in IgAN might be stable and not as easily being reversed as in the other two groups. Secondly, since AZA is a nonspecific DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, there is the possibility that not only <italic>Cosmc</italic> (gene: C1GALT1C1), but also other genes, for example, C1GALT1, whose methylation levels were influenced by methyltransferase inhibitor, and accordingly led to the alteration of mRNA expression of <italic>Cosmc</italic>. Till now, no researches on the evaluation of the DNA methylation of C1GALT1 or other genes potentially involved in aberrant glycosylation of IgA1 have been reported. Further studies may be needed.</p><p>Limitations of the study: Besides the relatively small size and lack of Researches <italic>in vivo</italic>, correlations in this work suggest a functional relationship between <italic>Cosmc</italic> DNA methylation, <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA and the secretion of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1, specifically in lymphocytes of patients with IgAN. However, associations are not demonstrations of causality. Also, since it&#x02019;s largely univariate analysis, there might be other co-factors influencing <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA and aberrant glycosylation of IgA1. Recently, it is reported that the expression of miR-148b also has a positive correlation with aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 but has no correlation with Cosmc [<xref rid="pone.0112305.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We will have further studies.</p><p>In general, this study showed that experimental modifications of DNA methylation revealed a specific behavior of the lymphocytes from IgAN children, compared to lymphocytes of the patients with other diseases or healthy control, concerning methylation of <italic>Cosmc</italic> promoter and associated <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression. IL-4 induced higher hypermethylation of the <italic>Cosmc</italic> promoter region whereas the demethylating agent AZA was less efficient on <italic>Cosmc</italic> methylation in the IgAN lymphocytes than in the other two groups. By the same time, IL-4 further reduced <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA and increased aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 levels in IgAN lymphocytes; AZA restored <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA to a level even slightly higher than in cells of healthy control, and leaded to the related lower secretion of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 in lymphocytes from children with IgAN.</p><p>The results suggest that hypermethylation of <italic>Cosmc</italic> gene promoter could be a key mechanism for the reduction of <italic>Cosmc</italic> mRNA expression in lymphocytes of patients with IgAN and associated to the increased level of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1. Further <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with larger samples are still needed in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec005"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112305.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0112305.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112305.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0112305.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge all of the doctors, nurses and patients participating in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0112305.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
