However, the large size of the few available contrast agents in this spectral range impedes their pharmacokinetics and decreases their thermal stability, leading to unreliable photoacoustic imaging. Here, we synthesize miniaturized gold nanorods absorbing in NIR II that are 5&#x02013;11 times smaller than regular-sized gold nanorods with a similar aspect ratio. Under nanosecond pulsed laser illumination, small nanorods are about three times more thermally stable and generate 3.5 times stronger photoacoustic signal than absorption-matched large counterparts. These unexpected findings are confirmed using theoretical and numerical analysis, showing that photoacoustic signal is not only proportional to the optical absorption of the nanoparticle solution but also to the surface-to-volume ratio of the nanoparticles. In living tumor bearing mice, these small targeted nanorods display a 30% improvement in efficiency of agent delivery to tumors and generate 4.5 times greater photoacoustic contrast.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Photoacoustic imaging</kwd><kwd>contrast agents</kwd><kwd>molecular agents</kwd><kwd>gold nanorods</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">In biological tissue, there is relatively little optical absorption within two distinct spectral ranges: 650&#x02013;900 nm and 1000&#x02013;1200 nm, called the 1<sup>st</sup> (NIR I) and 2<sup>nd</sup> near-infrared (NIR II) windows respectively.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Within NIR II, 1050&#x02013;1150 nm range is where blood-laden tissue generates the lowest photoacoustic background noise, produced from the optical absorption of deoxygenated hemoglobin.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Imaging in NIR II can significantly improve molecular photoacoustic imaging. However, one significant hurdle to date is the limited choices of contrast agents in this spectral range.</p><p id="P5">Common photoacoustic contrast agents include small chromophores, fluorescent proteins, and nanoparticles made from carbon, semiconductor, and plasmonic materials.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Among these contrast agents, none of the fluorescent proteins can absorb in NIR II, and the small-molecule dyes, carbon nanotubes, and semiconductor nanoparticles in this window are largely uncharacterized for their cytotoxicity.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Plasmonic nanoparticles, such as gold nanorods (AuNRs), nanoplates, and nanoshells, have been widely used in NIR I for photoacoustic imaging and other biological and medical applications.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Some of them also show strong optical absorption in NIR II. However, most of the plasmonic nanoparticles in NIR II have either high aspect ratios or large dimensions with extremely thin shells,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> resulting in poor thermal stability, short blood circulation half-life, difficulty in extravasation, and low tissue penetration rate.</p><sec id="S1"><title>A seedless approach for miniature rods in near infrared II</title><p id="P6">AuNRs absorbing in NIR II usually have a relatively high aspect ratio of ~6, commonly grown with a seed-mediated approach (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>),<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> resulting in 80&#x02013;150 nm (length) by 12&#x02013;25 nm (width). To reduce the dimensions further, the size and number of gold seeds become the limiting factors. Alternatively, seedless approaches have shown to produce AuNRs with reduced sizes in NIR I,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and these relatively smaller AuNRs have shown improved pharmacokinetics and lower cytotoxicity compared to larger AuNRs.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, the existing methods can only produce AuNRs with aspect ratios of up to five. As the aspect ratio increases, a complicated purification process is required to remove the increased amount of side products (nanospheres). By using hydroquinone as the reducing agent, one seedless method has recently produced high aspect ratio AuNRs, but with a relatively large size (13&#x000d7;87 nm).<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> For <italic>in-vivo</italic> applications, a critical size limit for nanoparticles is ~100 nm, beyond which the penetration of nanoparticles into tumors is limited.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The hydrodynamic length of the nanorods produced with the existing methods would approach or exceed 100 nm after conjugating molecular-specific ligands such as antibodies.</p><p id="P7">To reduce the size of AuNRs while maintaining the aspect ratio, several factors must be taken into account simultaneously. These factors include the concentration and type of the surfactant, the pH value of the growth solution, and the concentration of the reducing agent. NaBH<sub>4(aq)</sub> is a typical strong reducing agent that creates the nuclei by LaMer burst nucleation followed by fast random attachment and intraparticle ripening.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> While using NaBH<sub>4(aq)</sub> at higher concentrations will create greater quantities of smaller AuNRs, the random nature of the nucleation process can result in a wide range of size distribution (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Besides the number of nuclei, the pH value is a critical parameter in controlling the AuNR growth. The common ascorbic acid has a pK<sub>a</sub> at 4.1. Decreasing the pH value below 4 significantly decreases its reduction potential, and thus slows down the growth rate, while on the other hand, improving the anisotropy.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Compared to ascorbic acid, the reduction potential of hydroquinone also decreases with the pH value but at a higher rate (57 mV for each pH 1.0-value reduction), and therefore less acid is required to produce high aspect ratio rods. In fact, we observed that AuNRs stop growing when the pH value is lower than 2 in the hydroquinone growth solution. We intricately adjusted the concentration of NaBH<sub>4(aq)</sub> and the pH value of the growth medium, using the hydroquinone seedless method to reduce the size of long-aspect-ratio AuNRs while maintaining their mono-dispersity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>, Synthesis of Gold Nanorods). Our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>) shows that the smallest AuNRs obtained with this method are 8 &#x000b1; 2 nm by 49 &#x000b1; 8 nm.</p><p id="P8">As a reference for comparing the photoacoustic performance and thermal stability of AuNRs, we also synthesized regular-sized AuNRs (called large AuNRs from here on) with the seed-mediated method by using hydroquinone as the reducing agent.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> TEM and SEM images show that the average size of these large AuNRs is approximately 18 &#x000b1; 4 nm by 120 &#x000b1; 17 nm (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e&#x02013;f</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Improved photo-thermal stability</title><p id="P9">AuNRs can be photo-damaged under high intensity pulsed laser irradiation, causing optical absorption change and decay of photoacoustic signals.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Therefore, it is critical to measure the photo-damage threshold of AuNRs before comparing their photoacoustic performance. To test this threshold, we illuminated OD-matched AuNR solutions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>) at various fluences with 200 pulses and recorded the relative photoacoustic response at each fluence (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>, Photoacoustic Signal Characterization and Phantom Imaging).</p><p id="P10">At fluences below 6.1 mJ cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), both small and large AuNRs show no obvious photoacoustic signal change; the signal fluctuation is mainly attributed to the intensity fluctuation of the laser system itself. At 8.7 mJ cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), small AuNRs show no measurable change in the photoacoustic signal, while the large AuNRs show an obvious 20% signal decline after the first 15 pulses and an overall 30% decline after 200 pulses. When we further increased the laser fluence to 18.2 mJ cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, the large AuNR signal dropped by 42%, whereas the small AuNR signal decreased only by less than 10% after 200 pulses (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). This result is particularly interesting because typically small anisotropic nanoparticles are considered less thermodynamically stable due to a large portion of surface atoms compared to their large counterparts.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Different from the prior studies, we found that small AuNRs are more photothermally stable than large AuNRs under nanosecond irradiation. Our SEM images (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 c&#x02013;f</xref>) confirmed that most of the small AuNRs still maintain their shapes while more than 65% of the large AuNRs deform at 20 mJ cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.</p><p id="P11">To test the limit of thermal stability, we illuminated both solutions with 1,000 pulses at 25 mJ cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. In this extreme case, we observed that more than 50% of the small AuNRs still maintain their original shape, while the large AuNRs completely transform into spheres (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Pulsed laser irradiation photo-damages AuNRs through several possible mechanisms including vaporization, fragmentation, melting, and shape transition, depending on the laser intensity.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> As shown in the SEM images (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c&#x02013;f</xref>), melting and shape transition could be the main mechanisms responsible for the photo-damage. Prior studies have shown that the melting temperature of gold nanoparticles decreases when their size reduces.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Although melting can result in shape changes, the temperature at which AuNRs start undergoing morphological changes is not exactly at their melting temperature, but at a temperature called the shape-transition temperature.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The shape-transition temperatures are size-dependent and generally lower than the melting temperatures. For AuNRs containing less than 2,000 gold atoms, the shape-transition temperature is much lower than the melting temperature, but it increases at a faster rate than the melting temperature with respect to the increment of the AuNR volume. If a gold nanorod contains more than 8,000 gold atoms, both the melting and shape-transition temperatures gradually plateau. Theoretical calculations have shown that the shape-transition temperature of AuNRs (&#x0003e;10<sup>4</sup> gold atoms) approaches 1,000 K and its melting temperature is about 1,250 K.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The small and large AuNRs used in our experiments contain 1.4&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> and 1.6&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> atoms, respectively, which are well beyond the size where the shape-transition temperatures are highly size-dependent. Therefore, the difference in the shape-transition temperatures of both AuNRs should be negligible. One hypothesis of the enhanced thermal stability of the small AuNRs is their relatively lower peak temperature than the large AuNRs under the same laser illumination.</p><p id="P13">We numerically calculated the temperature profiles at the AuNR surface under the nanosecond laser heating (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>, Numerical Simulations, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). We used a laser fluence of 8.7 mJ cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> in the simulation, which will only damage the large AuNRs but not the small AuNRs as observed in our experiments. Additionally, we assumed that both small and large nanorods have the same interfacial thermal conductance of 150 MW m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> K<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, because these nanorods are within the size regime, in which with nanosecond laser illumination the small difference in their interfacial thermal conductance is negligible.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Our calculation shows that the peak temperature of the large AuNRs can reach almost 2,000 K which is significantly higher than the melting temperature of the large AuNRs. In contrast, the peak temperature of the small AuNRs reaches only ~800 K, which is lower than the shape-transition temperature, and likely an explanation for the insignificant photothermal damage observed. We also calculated the peak temperatures of the small AuNRs (8 nm in width) irradiated by higher laser fluences ranging from 10 to 25 mJ cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. We found that the peak temperature increases linearly with the laser fluence at a slope of 60 K mJ<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>); it requires 15 mJ cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> to heat the 8-nm AuNR to 1,250 K, slightly lower than the laser damage threshold (20 mJ cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) observed in our experiments. This discrepancy could be mainly attributed to two factors: (i) a plane-wave was used in our theoretical model, but the experiments were conducted using a laser beam with a Gaussian spatial distribution where Gaussian beam could introduce errors in estimating the actual laser fluence; and (ii) there was polydispersity of the AuNRs in the experiment, while in the simulations we assumed monodispersed nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Efficient photons-to-phonons converters</title><p id="P14">We first compared the photoacoustic signals from small and large AuNRs using a tube phantom (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>, left image). The 1<sup>st</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> tubes (from left to right) contained small AuNR solutions, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> tube contained an OD-matched large AuNR solution. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> tubes were relatively close to the centre of the transducer, and the 1<sup>st</sup> tube was near the edge of the transducer to exclude possible spatial variance of the laser fluence. In addition, large AuNRs scatter more light than small AuNRs while the photoacoustic intensity is dependent on optical absorption. To rule out the contribution to extinction caused by increased scattering from the large AuNRs, we compensated for the scattering effect with a higher OD of large AuNR solution in the 4<sup>th</sup> tube (1.5&#x000d7;OD at 1064 nm) to represent the worst-case scenario (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>, Photoacoustic Signal Characterization and Phantom Imaging, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref> shows that the small AuNRs produced ~3.5 times higher photoacoustic signal than the OD-matched large AuNRs, and at least two times higher signal than the absorption-over-compensated large AuNRs (1.5&#x000d7;OD). The stronger photoacoustic signal from the small AuNRs seems contrary to the theory that photoacoustic intensity is only related to optical absorption when the Gr&#x000fc;neisen parameter and laser fluence at the samples are the same.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p id="P15">In conventional photoacoustic theory, the photoacoustic signal amplitude is the product of the Gr&#x000fc;neisen coefficient, the absorption coefficient, and the local optical fluence.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> However, this relationship is only true under the assumption that the laser pulse is short enough such that heat and stress cannot escape from the area of an optical absorber.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In a nanoparticle solution, light is mainly absorbed by the nanoparticles and not by solvent. Furthermore, due to the high thermal conductivity of gold and their nanometer volume, both heat and stress leak out of the nanoparticle during the irradiation of a nanosecond pulse.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Due to the time-dependent thermal leakage, the photoacoustic signal is determined by the heat transfer rate from gold to water.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In our photoacoustic experiments, the only difference between the AuNR solutions was the overall surface to volume ratio of the AuNRs in the solution, which increases as the size of the AuNRs decreases. We thus hypothesize that the photoacoustic enhancement originates from the increased surface-to-volume ratio of the small AuNRs, which promotes heat transfer.</p><p id="P16">To test our hypothesis, we theoretically studied the photoacoustic signal generation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Information</xref>, Numerical Simulations). We first calculated the temperature profile of a AuNR (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>) and then used it to solve the time-dependent secondary differential photoacoustic wave equation to obtain the photoacoustic signal, which displays a familiar N-shape temporal profile (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Photoacoustic generation is an energy conversion process similar to fluorescence where light is converted to light, and photovoltaics where light is converted to electricity.

As a result of the quadratic relation between amplitude and energy, when the optical absorption is matched across AuNR samples with different nanorod sizes, photoacoustic signal amplitude is quadratically proportional to the surface-to-volume ratio of the AuNR (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>). Our numerical calculation indicates that when the optical absorption of the AuNR solutions is matched, small AuNRs (8 nm in width) can generate more than 3.5 times higher photoacoustic signal than the large AuNRs (18 nm in width), matching well with what we observed in the <italic>in-vitro</italic> experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Efficient agent-delivery to tumors with molecular targeting</title><p id="P21">To characterize the targeting specificity of the small AuNRs, we functionalized both large and small AuNRs with GRPR-targeting peptides and Cy5 dyes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>),<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and confirmed each surface functionalization step by measuring the zeta potentials (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> GRPR is one of the G-coupled protein receptors that control cell functions including proliferation, motility, etc. GRPR has been found to be overexpressed in many cancers including breast, colon, lung, and prostate cancers, and is thus of great interest for <italic>in-vivo</italic> molecular photoacoustic imaging.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p id="P22">We tested the targeting specificity with PC-3 (GRPR+) and DU-145 (GRPR-) cell lines using fluorescent imaging of Cy5 dye (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b&#x02013;j</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The results demonstrate the targeting specificity of our GRPR-targeting AuNRs.</p><p id="P23">To validate our small AuNRs as photoacoustic molecular imaging agents, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> photoacoustic imaging using a murine model of prostate cancer. Five groups of mice were used in our study with each group containing three six-weeks-old male nu/nu mice. We allowed the subcutaneous tumors to grow to ~1 cm in diameter. In groups 1 to 4, we tail-vein injected one of the four types of AuNR solutions with matched OD. The four solutions were large non-targeted (PEG) AuNRs (group 1), small non-targeted (PEG) AuNRs (group 2), large GRPR-targeted AuNRs (group 3), and small GRPR-targeted AuNRs (group 4). Twenty-four hours after injection, we randomly chose one mouse from each group for photoacoustic imaging and labelled the mice from group 1 to group 4 as m1 to m4, respectively. We used a pulsed laser irradiation at 1064 nm with a fluence of 25 mJ cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and scanned each animal from tail to head (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). The laser fluence used here was slightly higher than the damage threshold of the small AuNRs to compensate for the decay and diffusion of light inside the skin. With the non-targeted AuNRs, we observed slightly higher signal from the large AuNRs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>) than that from the small AuNRs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>), which could be attributed to tumor heterogeneity although our statistical analysis shows that the difference is insignificant (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5g</xref>). Distinctively, in the case of the GRPR-targeted AuNRs, the small AuNRs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>) show statistically significant higher photoacoustic signal than the OD-matched large AuNRs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>), confirming small AuNRs have enhanced photoacoustic-signal-generation efficiency, higher tumor-penetration efficiency, and higher binding specificity compared to their large counterparts. Interestingly, we also observed a decay of the photoacoustic signal from the targeted large AuNRs close to the end of the scan (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>), which is possibly due to the thermal instability of the large AuNRs, as observed in the <italic>in-vitro</italic> study (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Due to the enhanced thermal stability, there was no signal decay seen in the targeted small AuNRs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>) over the entire scan. We used the fifth group of mice for blocking test that further confirmed the GRPR-targeting specificity of our targeted AuNRs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Another 24 hours after the <italic>in-vivo</italic> imaging, we sacrificed all the mice in groups 1 to 4 and collected their main organs and tumors for more quantitative analysis. Fluorescent imaging of the major organs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>, showing m4 as an example) indicates that nanoparticles were mainly accumulated in the tumor and the liver. Fluorescent imaging of the tumors shows the highest signal from group 4 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f, g</xref>) and confirms the favorable pharmacokinetics and highest targeting specificity of the targeted small AuNRs, which manifest almost twice amount of signal than the targeted large AuNRs and non-targeted AuNRs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P25">A stable photoacoustic signal is critical for achieving quantitative photoacoustic imaging, because one of the most important assumptions is the constant optical absorption of the molecular imaging agent. An unstable photoacoustic signal will result in ambiguous evaluation of molecular imaging agent concentrations, potentially misleading the diagnosis and leading to suboptimal therapy. In this study, we have developed a protocol to synthesize the smallest AuNRs absorbing at 1064 nm, a wavelength within the NIR II window, which ensures low background noise from endogenous absorbers in tissue. We found that our small AuNRs are 3 times more thermally stable than the large AuNRs under nanosecond laser irradiation. More importantly, we have also discovered that by simply reducing the size without altering the optical absorption of nanoparticles, we can significantly increase the photoacoustic quantum yield of nanoparticles by ~200% which leads to high photoacoustic signal enhancement by more than 3.5 fold. <italic>In vivo</italic>, these targeted miniature AuNRs display significant improvement in overall tumor photoacoustic signal as compared to their large counterparts due to enhanced delivery, targeting, thermal stability, and their surface-to-volume ratio. These findings provide an additional strategy for the design of future photoacoustic molecular contrast agents and will possibly motivate more photoacoustic molecular imaging applications in the second NIR window.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS1519712-supplement-1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e841" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS1519712-supplement-2.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e845" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S6"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p id="P26">This work was supported in part by grants from Breast Cancer Research Foundation under grant BCRF-16&#x02013;043 and National Institutes of Health under grants CA158598 and CA149740 (to S.E.); and from NCI CCNE-T U54 CA199075, The Canary Foundation, and The Sir Peter Michael Foundation (to S.S.G.).
