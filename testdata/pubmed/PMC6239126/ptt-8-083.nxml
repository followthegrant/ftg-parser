Several highly specific treatments have been developed over the years, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; inhibitors, a nonselective IL-23 inhibitor (ustekinumab), and most recently IL-17 inhibitors. Risankizumab is a monoclonal antibody which targets IL-23p19 without binding IL-12. This novel therapeutic approach is expected to have advantages over the recently approved anti-IL-17 agents, such as the avoidance of <italic>Candida</italic> infections and neutropenia. In addition, unlike ustekinumab, the selective inhibition of IL-23 may preserve IL-12-dependent functions such as protection against infections and tumor immune surveillance. Risankizumab showed an excellent efficacy when compared to placebo and ustekinumab, with higher Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 rates, along with a convenient every 12-week maintenance dosing regimen. Overall, risankizumab was well tolerated and the most common adverse event was upper respiratory tract infection. In the near future, further data will be available not only in psoriasis but also in Crohn&#x02019;s disease and psoriatic arthritis fields. Head-to-head trials comparing risankizumab with other IL-23 inhibitors and with IL-17 inhibitors will be crucial to reveal the role of risankizumab in the treatment of psoriasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>psoriasis</kwd><kwd>IL-23</kwd><kwd>risankizumab</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Psoriasis is a common chronic immune-mediated skin disease, with systemic involvement and significant impact in patients&#x02019; quality of life,<xref rid="b1-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> with a prevalence ranging between 1.5% and 5.0% in most developed countries.<xref rid="b2-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Similar to several immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, psoriasis treatment has evolved immensely. Although conventional treatment is still useful, and sometimes enough for some patients, a great proportion of patients will need other treatment options, with expected better efficacy and, ultimately, an improvement in the quality of life. Over the past decades, our understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis has significantly expanded, allowing the development of highly specific agents, the so-called biologics.<xref rid="b3-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) inhibitors were probably the first major advance in this regard, as significantly higher clinical responses were achieved.<xref rid="b5-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, some patients did not respond to such agents, motivating further investigation of additional and possibly more crucial targets. Later, ustekinumab, an IL-12/23 inhibitor that selectively targets the common p40 subunit of these cytokines, was developed and not only showed promising clinical responses<xref rid="b7-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> but also proved to be more effective than TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors.<xref rid="b9-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Subsequently, as IL-17 was increasingly becoming a recognized key mediator in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, new drugs were developed targeting both IL-17 and its receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ptt-8-083">Figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="b10-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> These agents have been approved to treat moderate to severe psoriasis<xref rid="b11-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and have been shown to have better clinical responses than TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors<xref rid="b14-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and ustekinumab.<xref rid="b12-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b16-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In fact, these agents introduced a paradigm shift in the management of psoriasis, where completely or almost completely clear skin has become the new therapeutic goal.<xref rid="b18-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, there are some class safety concerns. IL-17 inhibitors are associated with higher risk of mucocutaneous candidiasis and neutropenia, reflecting the role of IL-17 in mucocutaneous protection against extracellular organisms such as <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and in the granulopoiesis, survival, and activation of neutrophils. Nevertheless, these adverse events (AEs) tend to be easily manageable and usually do not restrict the maintenance of therapy.<xref rid="b19-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Most recently, a new class of highly specific drugs is being studied for the treatment of psoriasis &#x02013; IL-23 inhibitors. Risankizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody which selectively targets the unique p19 subunit of human IL-23.<xref rid="b21-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Indeed, this agent seems to have a similar or higher efficacy than IL-17 inhibitors, without the safety concerns mentioned above.</p><p>This article aims to review the current knowledge on risankizumab for the treatment of psoriasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Advantages of selective IL-23 inhibition</title><p>Nowadays, it is widely accepted that IL-23/IL-17 axis has a crucial role in psoriasis, as in several other immune-mediated diseases.<xref rid="b23-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In fact, IL-23 is an essential cytokine for the differentiation, maintenance, and activity of several immune cells, such as T-helper 17 (Th17) and Th22 cells, and is able to induce a self-amplificatory loop by promoting the expression of additional IL-23 receptors.<xref rid="b24-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b27-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The first compound designed to modulate IL-23/IL-17 axis was ustekinumab &#x02013; an inhibitor of p40 subunit which is shared by two cytokines, IL-23 and IL-12.<xref rid="b30-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Although it proved to be effective,<xref rid="b7-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> evidence has suggested a more prominent role of IL-23, when comparing to IL-12.

At week 12, PASI 75 was achieved in 87%, PASI 90 in 58%, and PASI 100 in 16% of the patients, whereas none of the patients in the placebo group reached any of these clinical responses. At week 24, PASI 75 was achieved in 71%, PASI 90 in 48%, and PASI 100 in 29% of the patients, compared to 13% for PASI 75 and 0% for both PASI 90 and 100 in the placebo group. Additionally, for doses of 0.25 mg/kg or greater given intravenously or subcutaneously, PASI 75 was achieved in 84%, PASI 90 in 60%, and PASI 100 in 36%, while among patients receiving risankizumab subcutaneously, the corresponding PASI responses were 100%, 85%, and 54%, respectively. Interestingly, PASI improvements were observed as early as week 2. Regarding the Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) evaluation, results were consistent with PASI scores, as all patients getting risankizumab subcutaneously became &#x0201c;clear&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;almost clear&#x0201d; at weeks 12 and 24, compared to none of patients receiving placebo.<xref rid="b21-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Phase II studies</title><p>A Phase II, dose-ranging, multicenter, randomized trial by Papp et al included 166 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and compared risankizumab with ustekinumab. Patients were randomized to receive risankizumab subcutaneously (18-mg single dose or 90- or 180-mg doses at weeks 0, 4, and 16) or ustekinumab (45 or 90 mg, according to body weight, at weeks 0, 4, and 16). The primary endpoint was a PASI 90 or greater response at week 12. Risankizumab was superior to ustekinumab, as 77% of the patients (90 and 180 mg pooled) achieved the primary endpoint, compared to 40% in ustekinumab-treated patients. Additionally, at week 12, 63%, 98%, and 88% of the patients achieved PASI 75 with 18-, 90-, and 180-mg doses of risankizumab, respectively, compared to 72% in ustekinumab-treated patients. With regard to PASI 100, responses of 14%, 41%, and 48% were observed in the 18-, 90-, and 180-mg risankizumab groups, respectively, compared to 18% in the ustekinumab group. sPGA scores of 0 or 1 were observed in 58%, 90%, and 88% of patients in the 18-, 90-, and 180-mg risankizumab groups, respectively, compared to 62% in the ustekinumab group. Furthermore, at week 24, the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 response was 53%, 90%, and 88% for 18-, 90-, and 180-mg dosing regimens of risankizumab, respectively, compared with 70% in the ustekinumab group. Additionally, at week 24, PASI 90 responses were also assessed, with 28%, 63%, and 81% of risankizumab-treated patients (18, 90, and 180 mg, respectively), compared to 55% in the ustekinumab group. Interestingly, improvements in PASI score were observed as early as week 2. Clinical responses were generally maintained for up to 20 weeks after the final dose of risankizumab (week 36), in contrast to reduction in clinical responses observed in ustekinumab-treated patients from week 24. Also, complete clearing was maintained in 29% and 26% (90 and 180 mg, respectively) for up to 32 weeks after the final administration of risankizumab, whereas no patients had complete clearing at 48 weeks in the ustekinumab group. At week 12, 72% of patients treated with 90 or 180 mg of risankizumab achieved a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of 0 or 1, compared to 53% in the ustekinumab group. Moreover, the percentages of patients with DLQI score of 0 or 1 were correlated with decreases in PASI and sPGA scores (<xref rid="t1-ptt-8-083" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<xref rid="b22-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>In this study, investigators also assessed scalp, fingernail, and palmoplantar disease.

Although fingernail responses were slower, a mean reduction in the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) score of 40% was observed at week 12 (for both 90- and 180-mg risankizumab groups), increasing to 61% and 73% for 90- and 180-mg groups, respectively, at week 48, compared to 18% decrease in NAPSI score in the ustekinumab group.<xref rid="b22-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Finally, skin biopsy samples were obtained from 60 patients.

Also, PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses were significantly higher in patients receiving risankizumab starting at week 8 compared with adalimumab. Finally, among adalimumab-treated patients achieving PASI 50 to &#x0003c; PASI 90 at week 16, PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses were significantly higher in patients switching to risankizumab, starting at week 20, compared with patients continuing on adalimumab.<xref rid="b40-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>Interestingly, a recently presented integrated analysis from Phase III studies UltIMMa-1, UltIMMa-2, and IMMhance revealed that the treatment with risankizumab was associated with superior efficacy compared with placebo regardless of psoriasis treatment history, including prior biologic failure.<xref rid="b41-ptt-8-083" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability</title><p>The Phase I study by Krueger et al reported similar rates (65%) of side effects in both treatment and placebo groups.

the IL-23/T17 pathway, avoiding effects on the IL-12/Th1 axis; IL-17A inhibitors, such as secukinumab and ixekizumab, also target the IL-23/IL-17 axis, although through downstream blockade of this
