However, little has been done in the field of intravenous hemostatic agents. Here, we propose a new procedure to fabricate biocompatible protein nanocontainers (NCs) for intravenous injection allowing magneto-controllable delivery and short-term release of the hemostatic agent &#x003b5;-aminocaproic acid (EACA).</p></sec><sec id="S2002"><title>Methods</title><p>The nanocontainers were synthesized by the desolvation method from bovine serum albumin (BSA) using methanol without any further crosslinking. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used both as a stabilization agent and for size control. Characterization of nanocontainers was performed by the transmission and scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, and FTIR spectroscopy. Cytotoxicity was estimated using MTT assay. The dopant release from nanocontainers was measured spectrophotometrically using rhodamine B as a model molecule. The specific hemostatic activity was assessed by analyzing clot lysis and formation curve (CloFAL). Moreover, the ability for magneto targeting was estimated using the original flow setup made of a syringe pump and silicon contours.</p></sec><sec id="S2003"><title>Results</title><p>Fabricated nanocontainers had an average size of 186&#x000b1;24&#x000a0;nm and were constructed from building blocks&#x02013;nanoparticles with average size ranged from 10 to 20&#x000a0;nm. PEG shell was also observed around nanocontainers with thickness 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;nm. NCs were proved to be completely non-cytotoxic even at concentrations up to 8&#x000a0;mg BSA/mL. Uptake capacity was near 36% while release within the first day was 17%. The analysis of the CloFAL curve showed the ability of NCs to inhibit the clot lysis successfully, and the ability of magneto targeting was confirmed under flow conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S2004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The ability of synthesized NCs to deliver and release the therapeutic drug, as well as to accumulate at the desired site under the action of the magnetic field was proved experimentally.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="video"><title>Video abstract</title><p><fig id="UF0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><graphic content-type="print-only" xlink:href="NSA-12-11-g0001"/></fig></p><p>Point your SmartPhone at the code above.

Glutaraldehyde is usually used as a crosslinker, although there are other types of chemical agents with similar action, for example, 3,3&#x000b4;-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) or bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS).<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> They mainly differ by the formation of less stable bonds between protein molecules allowing particles to easily decay under the action of enzymes. However, in most reports, glutaraldehyde is still used, even though it possesses cytotoxicity and particles obtained are characterized by broad polydispersity.<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Ethanol commonly acts as a desolvating agent, yet this result in rather large nanoparticles with typical sizes around 200&#x02013;400&#x000a0;nm.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Such nanoparticles cannot be employed as an intravenous delivery platform because of filtering capabilities of the spleen and well-known protein corona effect.<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Other desolvating agents, in combination with the varying of the ionic strength in a solution, makes it possible to obtain smaller nanoparticles.<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In some studies, protein nanoparticles are used as a platform for delivering large molecules, such as hormones or proteins.<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Still, the stage of desolvation extremely negatively affects the specific activity of enzymes even to the point of the full activity loss. To avoid this, some works were devoted to the creation of protein nanocontainers (NCs) without desolvation procedure, in which the microemulsions method was applied, when a water-insoluble drug is loaded into a protein shell.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, these syntheses are mainly complex and time-consuming.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a relatively simple approach that combines separate discoveries in the synthesis of protein nanoparticles. With it, we have achieved the fabrication of magnetically-controlled nanocontainers stable for several hours and providing prolonged drug release. To prove the ability of local drug delivery, we take a hemostatic agent &#x003b5;-aminocaproic acid, which is commonly used during a surgical operation to cease the bleeding. The problem of blood loss reduction during surgical operations is still one of the main problems in surgical practice.<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The main difficulties in the development of new drugs intended for bleed ceasing are connected with the possibility for local application of hemostatic agents, low toxicity for surrounding tissues, and the absence of the side effects. Work on the creation of local hemostatic agents has been going on for quite some time, and now several medicinal substances are used as local hemostatic drugs.<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> They include Spongostan and Surgicel, which work on the principle of sponges, absorbing blood and providing additional activation of platelets in a wound.<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Here, it should be noted that there are at least two types of hemostatic drugs, which are fundamentally different in their action. The first group can be attributed to such a substance as thrombin, which immediately converts fibrinogen to fibrin, forming a thrombus at the site of application.<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The second group consists of substances that prevent the dissolution of a formed blood clot, so-called antifibrinolytics. These substances include &#x003b5;-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid.<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> These acids are synthetic analogs of the amino acid lysine, and their primary mechanism of action is connected with the binding to the lysine sites of plasminogen and plasmin, which leads to the inhibition of both the conversion process of plasminogen into plasmin and plasmin binding to fibrin.<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These acids are used in the form of intravenous infusions, but there is also a topical way of application.<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Among the most severe side effects of these drugs, when administered intravenously, is a significantly increased chance of thrombosis. Thus, their use is limited to such severe conditions as the hemorrhagic syndrome, complicated abortion, surgery on vascular-rich organs.<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In this article, for the first time, we propose an approach for creating a nanoformulated form of &#x003b5;-aminocaproic acid with the possibility of its local control with a magnetic field based on protein nanocontainers with incorporated magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) suitable for intravenous administration. In contrast with previously reported magnetite nanocontainers, this approach allows achieving a prolonged action based on the slow degradation of nanocontainers at a specific place without affecting other organs.<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The efficacy of EACA-loaded BSA NCs was assessed on fibrin clots, and magneto targeting was estimated in the flow system.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Bovine serum albumin (cat.

The solution was allowed to incubate for 10&#x000a0;min following by addition of 1&#x000a0;mL MNPs solution. The mixture was incubated for 10&#x000a0;min. Subsequently, 163&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of 4&#x000a0;M NaCl and 167&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of 6.76&#x000a0;M imidazole was added to the solution and left for 10&#x000a0;min.

Desolvation was performed by drop-by-drop addition of 3&#x000a0;mL of 100% methanol using a syringe pump at a constant rate of 40&#x000a0;mL/hour. Formation of BSA nanoparticles was observed by increased turbidity of the solution. The mixture was allowed to incubate for 4&#x000a0;h at constant stirring. Centrifugation was performed at 2000&#x000a0;g for 5&#x000a0;min two times, and the last centrifugation was performed for 10&#x000a0;min. NCs were redispersed in water in the initial volume and stored at 4&#x000b0;C. For release measurement, BSA was dissolved in Rhodamine B water solution (0.005&#x000a0;wt%). BSA NCs without MNPs for the hemostatic experiment were synthesized using 1&#x000a0;mL of distilled water instead of 1&#x000a0;mL of MNPs solution.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2004"><title>Characterization methods</title><p>Nanoparticles size was measured using the dynamic light scattering method (DLS) on Photocor Compact Z with the following parameters: angle 90&#x000b0;, laser power 12&#x000a0;mV.

The circularity of NCs was calculated based on SEM images as a mean value of width to length ratio of each nanocontainer. The size of NCs based on SEM images was calculated manually using VegaTC software. The structure and microstructure of NCs were examined by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) on JEM-2010 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200&#x000a0;kV and point-to-point resolution of 0.14&#x000a0;nm. The crystalline phase and crystallinity of samples were determined by the X-ray diffraction on Rigaku SmartLab 3 diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with CuK&#x003b2; filter, 30&#x000a0;kV, 30&#x000a0;mA and a scan speed of 5&#x000a0;deg/min.

Synthesis of nanoparticles is schematically shown in <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. The principal idea was to create nanocontainers with only biocompatible components which can act as a local depot for slow drug release. For preliminary experiments, we choose BSA as a close analog to human serum albumin. BSA NCs were prepared by the procedure involving the desolvation method with significant adjustments, which enabled to reduce the particle size. Common desolvation process allows obtaining quite big (typically, 200&#x02013;400&#x000a0;nm) and polydisperse nanoparticles which are highly stable in biological media due to crosslinking step during synthesis.<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This can be beneficial for a long-term release of drug agents but for the drawbacks connected with big sizes and glutaraldehyde crosslinker in composition. We have used a different desolvating agent &#x02013; methanol &#x02013; which makes it possible to produce smaller nanoparticles.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The addition of imidazole during the synthesis also contributes to the reduction of particle sizes.<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> One of the crucial parameters affecting the particle&#x02019;s size is the ionic strength of the solution, which was adjusted by NaCl to a final concentration of 300&#x000a0;mM. To allow magnetic control of the protein nanoparticles, we used magnetite nanoparticles previously successfully implemented to the synthesis of magneto-targeted thrombolytics.<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> After desolvation, protein nanoparticles are usually stabilized by the glutaraldehyde crosslinking. This method leads to the aggregation of particles into larger complexes. They are not suitable for the intravenous delivery method, since the filtering capabilities of the spleen strongly limit the size of nanoparticles, and more important &#x02013; the crosslinking process is irreversible.<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Glutaraldehyde also exhibits toxicity to cells in low concentrations. Irreversible crosslinking is undesirable for our purposes as EACA should release from NCs, so it was decided to make less stable nanoparticles. According to our assumption, such structures should slowly degrade at the target site under the influence of proteases and mechanical influence, but also have the ability to circulate in the bloodstream. Different surfactants and polyelectrolytes are well known for their ability to affect the growth speed, shape, and stability of nanoparticles. Among many of them, we chose PEG as a common agent for preparing highly biocompatible nanostructures.<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Pegylation of nanoparticles is a well-known procedure that allows to obtain stable colloids, as well as to increase the circulation time of nanoparticles in the body.<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> To ensure the maximum efficacy of coating, we took PEG with molecular weight 8000&#x000a0;Da since it has the highest affinity to albumin.<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> During the formation of protein NCs, magnetite nanoparticles in solution are captured inside larger particles which provide magnetically controlled protein NCs. This synthesis approach allows achieving a moderate balance between size, stability, and easiness of NCs synthesis. Full synthesis procedure takes around 6&#x000a0;hrs, including 3 cycles of centrifugation and filtration, and the most time-consuming part is simple incubation. Centrifugation is needed to discard all traces of methanol, but filtration is an optional step which helps to obtain a narrower distribution of NCs, although causing a severe loss (around 20&#x02013;30%) of NCs (see Size distribution and structural study section).<fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Scheme of the EACA-loaded BSA NCs synthesis.</p><p><bold>Notes:</bold> On the first step, BSA is dissolved in a water solution of EACA.

The size distribution of NCs was measured by the dynamic light scattering and presented in <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. Such a narrow distribution with an average hydrodynamic diameter of NCs 186&#x000b1;24&#x000a0;nm was achieved after filtration through a 0.45&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m MCE filter.

As mentioned above, freshly NCs have a moderate polydispersity (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> inset). Both scanning and transmission electron microscopy observations were performed to observe the structure of synthesized NCs. <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> presents the SEM image of unfiltered freshly prepared NCs. We observed a moderate aggregation of NCs and about 20% of NCs bigger than 200&#x000a0;nm in diameter (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> inset). The shape of NCs is close to an ellipsoid with the circularity of 1.12. However, it is impossible to observe the inner structure of NCs via SEM. For this purpose, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations were performed. <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and D show individual BSA NCs with internal structure.

In the HRTEM images, the shape of NCs is even more close to ellipsoid. A narrow shell around NCs was observed, which we suggest can be a PEG layer (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, inset (brightness of the image on the inset was adjusted to enhance visibility)). PEG shell was further detected around small nanoparticles (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, pointed by the arrow) with the average size of shell 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;nm, which is in perfect agreement with literature data about the size of 8&#x000a0;kDa PEG molecules.<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> MNPs nanoparticles were observed inside BSA NCs, and the crystalline lattice pattern typical for magnetite structure is presented in <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>.

Rhodamine B was added to the BSA solution before the initiation of nucleation. Upon desolvation step and further formation of NCs, rhodamine B molecules are captured both inside structural blocks and in pores between them. We suggest that such a double-type incorporation provides a two-phase release: fast from pores, after decomposition of NCs, and slow from structural building blocks. The overall uptake capacity was estimated as 36.4% from an initial concentration of rhodamine B. The release kinetics can be seen in <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. Within the first hour in Ringer&#x02019;s solution, we observed the release of the 5% of the initial load of rhodamine B. During the next 24&#x000a0;hrs, about 15% of the initial load was released. After 48&#x000a0;hrs, about 17% of the rhodamine B released from the NCs. Comparing the data obtained by DLS and release study, the rest of rhodamine B seems to be entrapped inside small BSA nanoparticles and need more time for release. However, we expect that inside the body BSA nanoparticles are likely to undergo dissolution caused by various proteases which will increase release considerably.<fig id="F0003" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The release profile of rhodamine B from BSA NCs.

We observed a steady accumulation of NCs with MNPs around the clot already after 3&#x000a0;min (<xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), and after 5&#x000a0;min clot was entirely covered with NCs (<xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Treated and control untreated clots were removed from NCs solution, placed on a cover glass, and 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;L of urokinase solution was poured on them. In <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">H</xref> it is clearly seen, that the untreated clot rapidly destroyed by activated plasmin while the treated one undergoes some minor contraction but almost remains intact. The dynamics of the clots dissolution is presented in <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>. After 60&#x000a0;min of incubation, the untreated clot is almost entirely destroyed (surface decreased by 96%). The size of clots treated with NCs without MNPs statistically insignificant differs from control clots, while the treated one reduces by 60% after one hour. We suggest that MNPs plays not only a targeted modality role but also have a crucial impact on the uptake capacity of EACA. EACA has amino and carboxyl group which can bind to the surface of magnetite. Further accumulation of MNPs in NCs leads to increased loading efficacy.<fig id="F0006" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) Accumulation of EACA-loaded BSA NCs on the clot under the magnetic field.

The ability for magneto control of NCs was assessed under flow condition via the simple setup presented in <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>. Two contour system was implemented to reduce the pressure in the system after the formation of a clot. Center glass part of the first contour was placed on a microscope table, a fibrin clot was placed inside and fixed by a polyurethane filter (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Neodymium magnet was placed slightly behind the clot, on the top of the glass tube. Freshly prepared NCs were diluted 25 times in Ringer&#x02019;s solution and pumped through the system at a rate of 300&#x000a0;mL/hour. The results obtained are presented in <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">D</xref>. We observed fast accumulation (within 5&#x000a0;min) of NCs in the area approximately 0.4&#x000a0;mm in front of the magnet (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). After 15&#x000a0;min noticeable darkening of the whole clot with a characteristic brown color was detected, which proves the accumulation of NCs around or even inside the clot (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Despite the fact that magnet has a diameter and height of only 10&#x000a0;mm (magnetic flux density was around 0.15T), it was shown that BSA NCs are highly susceptible to the magnetic field. Mostly this is due to the fact that original magnetite nanoparticles have high magnetization values up to 80&#x000a0;e.m.u./g (<xref rid="SF0004">Figure S4</xref>). Upon the formation of BSA NCs, magnetization values decreasing by 8&#x02013;10 times; however, it is still enough to target NCs inside flow system. Easiness of magneto targeting can also be explained by the fact that single BSA NC combined hundreds of MNPs thus overall magnetic susceptibility of BSA NC must be much higher in comparison with pure single MNP. The important note needs to be given here considering magneto targeting of NCs inside the human body. Currently, there are no approved medical devices for magneto targeting of nanoparticles at the desired site. However, we suggest that such a device is not really necessary. When addressing the issue of targeting some drug at the desired place, it is already profitable to increase the concentration of a therapeutic substance in the vicinity of the required site. We believe that powerful permanent magnets can be used for this purpose on initial stages of magnetically-guided drugs therapy.<fig id="F0007" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the flow setup.

The approach utilized is easy to reproduce and has a number of advantages over single protein nanoparticles or just magnetite nanoparticles. The synthesis procedure is rather different from the commonly used desolvation method but allows to obtain narrower distributed nanoparticles with smaller sizes. Moreover, all components of NCs are biocompatible, and BSA can be further replaced with other proteins to achieve enhanced compatibility or specificity. Aggregation stability of nanocontainers in aqueous media is very high due to PEG coating, but overall structural integrity remains no longer than 2&#x000a0;days, which is good for short-term release. We have shown that NCs could be easily accumulated at the desired site via the magnetic field within 15&#x000a0;min after administration. Analyzing CloFAL curves, we have estimated that NCs possess the ability to inhibit clot lysis, thereby proving its potential as a hemostatic agent. Such a delivery system can be further utilized to provide a targeted approach for other small molecule substances.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The work of Prilepskii A and Schekina A on the synthesis of BSA NCs was supported by Russian Science Foundation Grant 18-73-00119, the work of Vinogradov V on thrombolysis experiments was supported by Russian Science Foundation Grant 16-13-00041.

<xref rid="SF0003">Figure S3</xref> shows FTIR spectra of BSA NCs with MNPs (black), without MNPs (red), and pure MNPs (green) in the region between 400 and 4000&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. For FTIR analysis NCs samples with and without MNPs was dried at 40&#x000b0;C to prevent thermal denaturation of the protein. On the IR spectra of magnetite nanoparticles, a broad peak is observed in the region of 400&#x02013;700&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which is a characteristic peak of metal oxides. The IR spectra of the nanocontainer samples without MNPs reveal characteristic peaks of polypeptide absorbance. Two main absorption bands of amide I (1650&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and amide II (1510&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) are observed, due to stretching C=O bonds (amide I) and stretching of the C-N bond (amide II) respectively. A clear peak at 1230&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> appears due to mixed C-N stretching and N-H bending vibrations of amino acids. There is also a clear peak at about 3300&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, due to stretching vibrations of the N&#x02013;H bond. In the case of IR spectra of the nanocontainer samples with MNPs, the position of the peaks, characteristic of polypeptides, is preserved and no significant changes in band positions were observed due to the conjugation of NCs. These facts evidence that MNPs assembled to proteins due to the physical sorption without the formation of new chemical bonds. A peak, corresponded to magnetite in the sample, was observed at a maximum of 560 nm, as for initial (pure) magnetite.
