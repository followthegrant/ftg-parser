Theory-driven tools help practitioners to identify the causes for poor adherence and develop effective interventions. This study examined the Expanded Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) Model by adding the concept of Sense of Coherence (SOC) to predict parental adherence to preschooler&#x02019;s preventive dental visits.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Data regarding socio-economic demographics were collected from parents of children aged 2&#x02013;6 years. Constructs of TPB including parental attitudes, subjective norms (SN), Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC), and intention to attend preventive dental visits for their preschoolers were collected by questionnaire, alongside parents&#x02019; sense of coherence (SOC). Dental attendance was measured by asking if the child had a regular dental visit during the last year. Structural Equation Modeling Analysis (SEMA) was carried out to identify significant direct and indirect (mediated) pathways in the extended TPB model.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Three hundred and seventy-eight mothers (mean age = 34.41 years, range 22&#x02013;48) participated in the study. The mean age of children was 3.92 years, range: 2&#x02013;6), and 75.9% had dental insurance. Results of the final model showed that predisposing factors (child&#x02019;s birthplace and mother&#x02019;s birthplace) significantly predicted enabling resources (family monthly income and child&#x02019;s dental insurance status); both predicted the TPB components (PBC, SN, and attitude). TPB components, in turn, predicted behavioural intention. However, contrary to expectation, intention did not significantly predict dental attendance in the past 12 months. Parent&#x02019;s SOC significantly predicted TPB components and dental attendance. Overall, 56% of the variance in dental attendance was explained by the expanded TPB model.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The expanded TPB model explained a great deal of variance in preschooler&#x02019;s dental attendance. These findings suggest that the expanded model could be used as the framework for designing interventions or strategies to enhance dental attendance among preschoolers; in particular, such strategies should focus specifically on enhancing parental SOC including empowerment.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000033</institution-id><institution>Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRN: 126751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2249-5465</contrib-id><name><surname>Amin</surname><given-names>Maryam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>University of Alberta, Fund for Dentistry</institution></funding-source><award-id>2015-3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4926-2290</contrib-id><name><surname>Elyasi</surname><given-names>Maryam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Alpha Omega Foundation of Canada</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4926-2290</contrib-id><name><surname>Elyasi</surname><given-names>Maryam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>ME &#x00026; MA received the following sources of funding for this study: 1.

However, more than 40% of children have tooth decay by the time they reach preschool [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Canadian Dental Association reported an estimated 2.26 million school-days missed annually in Canada due to dental diseases that account for about one-third of day surgeries for preschoolers aged 1&#x02013;5 nationwide [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the prevention of dental caries at younger ages, similar to any other chronic health conditions, could reduce many serious dental problems that would compromise children&#x02019;s general health and well-being and their quality of life over the lifespan [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Adherence to a healthy diet (consuming unsweetened foods and beverages) and good oral hygiene practices (tooth brushing twice a day with fluoride) are examples of professional recommendations for preventing dental caries in children [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These daily home preventive measures are complemented by attending regular dental visits, which not only allow for early detection and management of oral diseases but also enhance parental awareness of the cause and prevention of the disease [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) recommends that children have dental examinations every six months, starting six months after the eruption of the first tooth but no later than their first birthday [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Although most studies seldom differentiate children&#x02019;s dental attendance between preventive and restorative visits, adherence to either type of visits have been found to be unsatisfactory [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nearly half of US children do not receive preventive dental visits (as recommended by the AAPD/Bright Futures report), and those younger than six years are the least likely to receive it [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. With the importance of preventive dental visits for children established, more attention has been paid to adherence to their preventive measures concerning oral hygiene and dietary habits than dental attendance [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Few studies have examined parental adherence to these recommendations, and when they did they show inconsistent and conflicting results [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Adherence to professional recommendations in chronic health conditions has been recognized as a challenge among health care providers [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Parents, especially mothers, have a prominent influence on children&#x02019;s oral health behaviours as professional recommendations include regular dental visits; actions that children cannot independently adhere [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Health behaviour theories, therefore, have been used to better understand the determinants of adherence behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Specifically, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is a popular explanatory model for preventive health behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. According to this theory, behaviour is a function of their intention moderated by Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC). Their intention, in turn, is influenced by their attitudes toward their behaviour, subjective norms, and PBC [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Like attitudes and subjective norms, PBC has an impact on intention. In addition, PBC can also affect their behaviour directly, to the extent that the perception of control accurately reflects actual control [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In sum, PBC and intention can be used together to predict behavior.</p><p>TPB has been applied in many oral health studies [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and reported as the most frequently used theoretical framework to design theory-based studies in oral health domain [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, its application in children&#x02019;s oral health research is relatively new [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the study by Van den Branden et al. in 2013, the predictive validity of the TPB was examined in relation to oral health behaviours of parents regarding their preschooler&#x02019;s; it was found that the TPB components accounted for 41% to 46% of the variance in predicting annual dental visits and tooth brushing twice a day among 5-year-old children in Belgium [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One advantage of the TPB is that it can accommodate the inclusion of additional constructs contributing to the elicitation of a particular behaviour and its predictive properties could, therefore, be enhanced by other variables known to be important in adherence [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>It is well-known that parental adherence to preventive measures for their children is determined by their ability to cope with daily stressors and to identifying and mobilizing resources to adhere to healthy practices [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although the TPB has elucidated how patients conceptualize health-threatening conditions and evaluate possible facilitators and barriers towards adherence, it does not address behavioural coping skills very well [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The ability to deal with life stressors has been examined previously in relation to health through the concept of Sense of Coherence (SOC) [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Studies have shown the influence of parents&#x02019; SOC on children&#x02019;s oral health behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Mothers with higher SOC were more likely to have positive attitudes and behaviours towards their children&#x02019;s oral health than those with lower SOC [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mothers&#x02019; SOC has also been found to be significantly associated with their children&#x02019;s dental attendance pattern even after adjusting for socioeconomic variables [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although studies showed that the TPB model accounts for predicting parental intention well, the effects of daily stressors on their intention and its transition to behavior are not clear; therefore, SOC is used as a proxy for life stressors in this study to see how this construct can contribute to our TPB model.</p><p>Following this path of research, this study aimed to investigate the inclusion of SOC as an expanded TPB model to predict parental adherence to preventive dental visits for their children. We hypothesized that the development of an expanded TPB model would enhance the predictive power of the TPB model in predicting dental attendance behaviour in preschoolers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study setting and participants</title><p>This multi-center cross-sectional study was granted ethics approval from the University of Alberta Research Ethics Board (Protocol No. 00047287) and Alberta Health Services.

Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to analyze the data. Two-stage SEM is currently the best method for testing prior theoretical models [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the first stage, the measurement model, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine whether the indicators (items) chosen to measure the four latent (underlying) constructs were acceptable. The indicators that have been used are the ones that allow for a best-fitting model. The four latent factors were; predisposing factors (indicators: child&#x02019;s birthplace, mother&#x02019;s birthplace), enabling factors (indicators: family monthly income, child&#x02019;s dental insurance status), SOC (indicators: comprehensibility, manageability, meaningfulness domains), and dental attendance (indicators: attendance frequency, attendance pattern).</p><p>CFA provides information on how indicator items (e.g. child&#x02019;s birthplace) measure underlying (latent) constructs (e.g. predisposing factors). The initial step of the analysis was to test a first-order CFA with predisposing factors, enabling factors, SOC, and dental attendance as the four latent constructs. Scale items (indicators) representing each of the four latent constructs are detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227233.g001">Fig 1</xref>.

In accordance with the TPB and with SOC as an additional factor, 27 direct pathways were hypothesized; predisposing factors would predict enabling factors, and both of these would predict the three TPB components (perceived attitude, behavioural control, and subjective norms). The three TPB components would predict perceived behavioural intention, and all would, in turn, predict dental attendance. Predisposing and enabling factors would also predict dental attendance, toothbrushing and sugar intake frequency. Concerning SOC, we hypothesized that it would predict the TPB components, behavioural intention, dental attendance, toothbrushing and sugar intake frequency.</p><p>AMOS estimates the total effects, which are made up of both direct effects (a path directly from one variable to another, e.g. predisposing to enabling factors) and indirect effects (a path mediated through other variables, e.g. predisposing &#x02192; dental attendance via enabling resources). The model was estimated using bootstrapping wherein multiple samples (n = 900+) are randomly drawn from the original sample. The CFA model is then estimated in each dataset, and the results averaged. The ML bootstrap estimates and standard errors [together with bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] are then compared with the results from the original sample to examine the stability of parameters and test statistics [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

factor was linked to more enabling resources; greater predisposing and enabling resources were linked to higher perceived attitude, subjective norms and PBC scores, to greater dental attendance, and a higher frequency of tooth brushing; A greater SOC was linked to higher perceived attitude, subjective norms and PBC scores, greater dental attendance and less frequent sugar intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227233.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The three TPB components were all linked to a greater behavioural intention but were not, as hypothesized, linked to dental attendance. In addition, surprisingly, the behavioural intention was not associated with greater dental attendance.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Indirect effects</title><p>There were a number of significant indirect effects between latent and observed variables within the model (<xref rid="pone.0227233.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Predisposing factors were linked indirectly to the TPB components, dental attendance and toothbrushing via enabling factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227233.g003">Fig 3</xref>). It seems that the relationship between the predisposing factor (i.e. child and mother born in Canada) and higher scores on perceived attitude, subjective norms, and perceived control, more frequent toothbrushing as well as a greater dental attendance, may be mediated by a higher family income and having dental insurance. In addition, both enabling factors and SOC were linked indirectly to behavioural intention via the three TPB components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227233.g003">Fig 3</xref>). It would seem that the effect of the enabling factor (greater family income and dental insurance) on parent&#x02019;s behavioural intention is, as would be hypothesized by the TPB model, indirectly associated with parent&#x02019;s perceived attitude, subjective norms and PBC towards dental attendance. Similarly, parents&#x02019; behavioural intention is indirectly affected by their SOC via their perceived attitude, subjective norms and behavioural control towards dental attendance.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we extended the TPB model to account for parent&#x02019;s SOC. Using an advanced statistical technique&#x02014;SEM&#x02014;revealed that predisposing factors (mother and child&#x02019;s birthplace) significantly predicted enabling resources (family income and child&#x02019;s dental insurance); both factors predicted the TPB components (PBC, SN, and attitude). TPB components predicted behavioural intention; however, contrary to expectation, intention did not significantly predict dental attendance. SOC significantly predicted TPB components and dental attendance. Overall, this model explained a great deal&#x02014;56%&#x02014;of the variance in dental attendance in preschoolers.</p><p>Although both predisposing and enabling factors were linked to the frequency of tooth brushing; they were not significantly associated with sugar intake frequency. Mothers&#x02019; SOC was the only component linked to sugary intake frequency, but it was not associated with tooth brushing behaviour. This inconsistency may imply the existence of specific contributing factors for each behaviour of interest while studying the predictors or developing interventions. Another reason for this discrepancy might be the fact that preschoolers&#x02019; oral hygiene practices require additional technical support and skills from parents in addition to their SOC comparing with sugary intake frequency [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>As for dental attendance, both predisposing and enabling factors were linked to the behaviour directly and indirectly. The significant direct link showed the independent/direct contribution of these two factors to the extended TPB model in predicting dental attendance among children. Although 74.8% of children had dental insurance and some free preventive dental services are available for children in Canada [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], less than half of the children (42%) had a preventive dental visit during the last year. This indicated the underutilization of available dental services that might be partly attributable to low parental awareness or some other barriers such as parents&#x02019; time constraints or some psychosocial factors such as SOC [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>SOC, an important psychosocial determinant in the oral health domain, has been applied to study the use of oral health services in a few studies [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Holde et al., for example, tested modified Andersen&#x02019;s behavioural model, by adding SOC construct, and found that a stronger SOC was related to more use of dental services in Norwegian adults when the association was mediated through enabling resources [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Among children, those whose mothers had stronger SOC scores were more likely to use dental services [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] even in families with low socioeconomic status [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In our study, a greater SOC was directly linked to higher TPB components (perceived attitude, subjective norms and PBC) scores, and greater dental attendance; SOC was also indirectly related to behavioural intention through the TPB components. Therefore, it could be concluded that incorporating the concept of SOC into the TPB model has improved the predictability of the model by linking to the TPB components and directly to the behavior.</p><p>All TPB components in this study are linked to behavioural intention; however, the behavioural intention failed to translate into dental attendance behavior. Therefore, the TPB model itself was able to predict parents&#x02019; intention to take their children for preventive dental visits and not the actual performance of the behaviour. These findings are in line with previous studies outside of oral health domain [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. There are three concerns regarding this observation in our study. First, measurement of intention was limited to only one question/indicator measured parental intention; therefore, low variation in the items measuring intention might result in the lack of association [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Second, we measured mothers&#x02019; self-reported past behaviours in this study, not the consecutive behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; and third, intentions and behaviours were both measured simultaneously and no time frame existed between both measurements [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, longitudinal observation of performing the succeeding behaviour is required to assess the causality relationships between TPB constructs and draw more accurate conclusions [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In this model, 34% and 56% of the variance was accounted for behavioural intention and dental attendance variables respectively. Among the predictors of intention within TPB model in our study, PBC was the strongest predictor accounted for 31% of variance to predict it followed by attitude and subjective norms with values of 24% and 16% respectively. Generally, TPB explains 20%&#x02013;40% of the variance of numerous behaviours in the health domain [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227233.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the oral health domain, there are a few previous studies that have applied the TPB and its extended modifications to predict Oral Health Behaviours (OHB). In the study done by Buunk et al., the components of the TPB model and oral health knowledge explained 32.3% of the variance of oral hygiene behaviours including tooth brushing, flossing, and tongue cleaning among Dutch adults [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; PBC was also the best predictor of OHB, which was in accordance with the results of a meta-analysis reporting PBC as the strongest predictor of health behaviour in the TPB model [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Among adolescents, Pakpour et al. tested the extended TPB model by adding action and coping planning suggesting that these two factors may help to overcome the barriers towards implementation of behavioural intention; they concluded that the expanded model accounted for 59.6% of the variance for tooth brushing behaviour. Similar to our study, they reported that perceived behavioural control was the strongest predictor of TPB in their model [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Dumitrescu et al. tested another extension of the TPB model, by adding oral health knowledge, among young adults and concluded that participants&#x02019; attitude, PBC, and oral health knowledge predicted 51.5% of the variance to predict behavioural intention to improve tooth brushing, flossing, and dental attendance behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; however they reported that knowledge was linked to attitude in such a way that increased knowledge led to stronger attitude, which was more stable and resistant to change [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In a longitudinal study using an extended version of TPB model, adult participants&#x02019; attitudes, subjective norms, PBC were significant predictors of intention while participant&#x02019;s intention, self-efficacy and past dental attendance were significant predictors of actual dental attendance [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this prospective cohort study, authors proposed &#x0201c;past dental attendance&#x0201d; as a potential predictor of individual&#x02019;s intention and future behaviour and hypothesized that the inclusion of past experience significantly contributed to the prediction of behavioural intention; they concluded that past behaviour predicted intention beyond TPB components. Their proposed model was able to explain 12.0% of the variance to predict intention. All four components were identified as independent predictors of individual&#x02019;s intention in the model. The TPB model explained 15.5% of the variance in dental attendance while adding the &#x0201c;past behaviour&#x0201d; component increased it by 7.0% [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our study, we measured participants&#x02019; past behaviour as their actual behaviour that might cause the absence of a link between intention and behaviour in the TPB model. Therefore, it could be recommended to design longitudinal studies to evaluate our extended TPB model to predict dental attendance behaviour prospectively.</p><p>In 2013, Van den Branden et al. in Belgium developed and validated a TPB-based questionnaire to predict parents&#x02019; determinants of oral health behaviours, including dietary habits, oral hygiene, and dental attendance for children using CFA and multiple regression analysis. For dietary habits, tooth brushing, and dental attendance, TPB model accounted for 44%, 49%, and 55% of the total variance in the regression model to predict the behaviours respectively. Participants&#x02019; dental attendance was predicted by both their parents&#x02019; intention and PBC [<xref rid="pone.0227233.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Among TPB components, PBC was the strongest predictor of intention which was in line with our results; however, neither intention nor PBC was significantly linked to the behaviour in our study. This inconsistency could be explained by adopting SEM analysis in our study to identify the significant pathways between TPB components while measuring model&#x02019;s goodness of fit and eliminating the effects of confounding variables comparing with regression analysis. SEM enabled us to control the measurement errors and achieve more accurate estimates for studied regression-coefficients.</p><p>In this study, we examined the predictability of the extended TPB model and the direct and indirect effects among the factors; however, the study was of a cross-sectional design which means no causality can be assumed. For example, the components of the TPB may lead to greater SOC or vice versa as tested in our model. Only by collecting longitudinal data in which SOC is measured at baseline, alongside, parent and child demographics, TPB components are collected at a second-time point, and finally outcomes at a third-time point can we explore cause and effect relationships. In this research, only one item adopted to measure intention; therefore, having more items to assess this construct in the future studies will enhance the internal validity of the questionnaire and reduce measurement errors. A further limitation was the use of a convenience sampling method and self-reported outcome variables. For example, dental attendance frequency may have been over-estimated as parents may have answered the question according to how often they should be taking their child to their dentist. Based on the available data, the vaccination rate in Edmonton in 2013&#x02013;14 was approximately 91%. Nonetheless, it&#x02019;s recommended to include mothers who refuse immunizations for their children, as they may have different views about taking their children to receive preventive care services, such as regular dental check-ups. Finally, the external validity of the extended TPB model needs to be investigated in other population groups such as adolescents, young adults, and adults in the future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusions</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Predisposing factors significantly predicted enabling resources; both predicted the TPB components (attitude, subjective norms, and PBC).</p></list-item><list-item><p>TPB components predicted behavioural intention; however, nor intention neither PBC significantly predicted dental attendance.</p></list-item><list-item><p>SOC was directly linked to TPB components and dental attendance while indirectly related to behavioural intention through the TPB components.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Overall, 56% of the variance in dental attendance was explained by the expanded TPB model.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the Alberta Health Services research coordinators, community health centers&#x02019; managers and staff, and parents participated in the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227233.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Kirschstein RL, Slavkin HC.

</p><p>Reviewer: #1</p><p>Major points</p><p>&#x0201c;Figure 2 is difficult to understand and needs to be re-done. Consider breaking the information up into two graphics, adding a color code, and/or move the significant figures to a legend. As it is, arrows overlap the shapes, the shapes are arranged without a discernable pattern, and the significant figures are small and hard to read and it is difficult to determine which metrics go with each interaction effect.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0fffd; Response: We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s constructive suggestion. The information provided in Figure 2 is represented in two separate figures, New Figure 2 and Figure 3, to demonstrate the direct and indirect relationships between variables distinctly. Adjustments were made to eliminate overlaps, arrange the shapes, and enlarge the figures. Also, the metrics applied to evaluate the interaction effects were clarified in new figures. </p><p>&#x0201c;I worry about bias occurring in the study results. By being at the health center, parents were actively engaged in attaining health care for their children and therefore might not be representative of the greater population. Do you have any studies to confirm that 42% a parents seeking dental care visits is close to the average rate? Likewise, is it possible that the context in which the subjects were questioned (a community health centers) may have influence healthcare related intentional behavior? Were subjects in a similar context(s) in the other studies you cite that extend the TPB models to: adolescents, young adults, and adults? I would like to see both of these points addressed in the discussion as potential limitations.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0fffd; Response: The reviewer&#x02019;s abovementioned important points were addressed in the Methods and Discussion sections. The parents were recruited through vaccination programs that hold only at community health centers in Edmonton, AB. According to the 2013-14 Alberta Health Services Report, the overall vaccination rate for preschoolers in Edmonton in 2014 was 91.7%. Therefore, approaching community health centers enabled us to recruit a good representative of our target population. Regarding the reported 42% of dental attendance among pre-schoolers in our study, there is another study done by Locker et al. (Ref #26) reported 42.8% of the regular dental visits among immigrant children and 72.6% among non-immigrant children. Although the age group in these two studies are different but our reported percentage was not comparably high. </p><p>The following statements has added to the Methods and Discussion sections respectively:</p><p>- Page 7, lines142-143: &#x0201c;According to the 2013-14 Alberta Health Services Report, the overall vaccination rate for preschoolers in Edmonton was 91.7%.&#x0201d;</p><p>- Page 20, lines 411-416: &#x0201c;Based on the available data, the vaccination rate in Edmonton in 2013-14 was approximately 91%. Nonetheless, it&#x02019;s recommended to include mothers who refuse immunizations for their children, as they may have different views about taking their children to receive preventive care services, such as regular dental check-ups. Finally, the external validity of the extended TPB model needs to be investigated in other population groups such as adolescents, young adults, and adults in the future studies.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;Please explain in more detail how a subject&#x02019;s dental attendance metric was derived from their Oral Health behaviors survey results (sub-section&#x02018;d&#x02019; from the Materials and Methods section) &#x02013; likewise please include the descriptive statistics on these answers in Table 1.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0fffd; Response: The required changes were made in the body of the manuscript (pages 8-9, lines 174-182) and table 1 (pages 11-12) accordingly. </p><p>Minor points</p><p>&#x0201c;On lines 324 to 325 you say &#x02018;&#x02026;83% 325 of children had dental insurance&#x02026;&#x02019; but in Table 1 you report that 74.8% of children had dental insurance &#x02013; please fix the discrepancy.&#x0201d; </p><p>&#x0fffd; Response: Thanks for the observation; the percentage reported in Table 1 was corrected. The abovementioned discrepancy has been fixed on page 16, line 325.</p><p>&#x0201c;The sentence fragments below need to be re-worded (lines 341-343: </p><p>One surprising finding was from studying the TPB components.
