These are all important factors. However, a student's motivation for learning is arguably the most influential.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Motivation could be looked at as a physiological drive spurring a person, or an animal, to behave in a certain way.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> There are two types of motivation: extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic motivation is linked to reward or punishment while intrinsic can be related to the satisfaction of an inner need.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Exams fall into the category of extrinsic motivation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Frequent testing in a physiology course has been evaluated by 73% of students as one of the main motivating factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> The aim of the present study was to test the effect of end of lecture quizzes on students&#x02019; motivation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHOD</title><p>A total of 137 second year medical students (74 male and 63 female) at King Faisal University, Dammam, participated in the study. A test consisting of 4 MCQs (single best with 4 statements) was given at the end of each lecture on the material covered in that lecture, the 12 lectures on renal physiology. Therefore, students were not given a chance to revise the lecture material. MCQs were based on basic factual and conceptual knowledge. Tests took five minutes and were given in two versions. At the end of the trial period, students filled a questionnaire which consisted of 18 items rated in a five-point scale system and some open questions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Questionnaire &#x02013; Male students&#x02019; responses to the following items regarding the evaluation of short quizzes at the end of lectures on renal physiology</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JFCM-11-79-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Students performance on the major quiz in this course was compared to their performance in the other three quizzes, conducted during the year, on other parts of the course. Performance in the questions of the final exam on the renal system was compared to two other major systems covered (respiratory and endocrine).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Most students (both male and female) thought that such tests enhanced lecture attendance, concentration during lectures as well as knowledge acquisition. The majority also rated these tests as consolidating knowledge, correcting wrong concepts and clarifying ambiguous (unclear) points (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). However, while most males agreed that these tests enhanced preparation for lectures and should be applied to all other courses taught in the college, most female students disagreed with this. On the negative side of the evaluation, most students (both genders) disagreed with the statement that the tests made lectures unenjoyable, were an incorrect measure of a student's level and did not reflect true level of the student. Students thought that this practice was suitable for all courses regardless of the course content since it required understanding (e.g. physiology) or memorization (e.g. Anatomy). Most students were satisfied with the content and the format used in the study, but preferred MCQs over short answer questions. A third difference between male and female students was on the evaluation of cheating. Most male students thought that cheating was significant while most females did not.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Questionnaire &#x02013; Female students&#x02019; responses to the following items regarding the evaluation of short quizzes at the end of lectures on renal physiology</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JFCM-11-79-g002"/></table-wrap><p>In their written comments, the vast majority of both male and female students appraised the trial as excellent, marvellous, enjoyable, etc (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).

However, there was no significant difference between their performance in the two quizzes on endocrine and renal systems conducted in the second semester (quizzes number 3 and 4) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>). Students performance in the three systems covered in the final exam was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Comparison of students performance in the four major quizzes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JFCM-11-79-g006"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T7" position="float"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Comparison of students performance in the final exam in three major systems covered</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JFCM-11-79-g007"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results of the questionnaire clearly express student satisfaction and preference for this practice. Teachers of both male and female students felt that students really enjoyed and liked this experiment. Attendance at most lectures was almost 100%, which is rare in our college. Also students were very attentive and keen to understand every part of the lecture.</p><p>Exams are known to be a strong stimulus as external motivation for learning.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> What is novel in this study is the use of this stimulus to improve attendance and attention at lectures. However, student performance in the final exam was not affected by these end of lecture quizzes. The reason might be linked to the greater effort students make in studying for their final exams and the relative difficulty of the concepts in renal physiology compared to other systems they had to study. Most of the disadvantages mentioned by the students have been felt by the teachers also. Fortunately, these could be remedied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The study proves that an end-of-lecture quiz on the material just covered in that lecture is a useful stimulus to external motivation provided it is done randomly, correct answers are given at the end of the quiz and cheating is minimized.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Thanks are due to Dr. Bodour AboHozaifah for conducting these quizzes for the females, the male and female technical staff and Mr. P.
