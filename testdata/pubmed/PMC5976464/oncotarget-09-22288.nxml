The present study aims to investigate the expression profiles and potential modulation of circRNA on osteosarcoma carcinogenesis. Human circRNA microarray was performed to screen for abnormally expressed circRNA in osteosarcoma tissue and circRNA-0008717 was identified as one circRNA significantly upregulated in osteosarcoma tissue. Osteosarcoma patients with high circRNA-0008717 expression had shortened survival. Gain and loss functional assays suggested that knockdown of circRNA-0008717 suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, but promoted cell apoptosis. By using biotin-labeled circRNA-0008717 probe to perform RNA precipitation in osteosarcoma cells, we identified miR-203 as the circ0008717-associated microRNA. Subsequently, Bmi-1 was identified as the functional target of miR-203. In addition, overexpression of circRNA-0008717 in osteosarcoma could elevate Bmi-1 expression, resulting in the promotion of osteosarcoma cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, the tumor promoting effect of circRNA-0008717 was abolished by miR-203 mimics or Bmi-1 silencing vector. In conclusion, circRNA-0008717 plays an oncogenic role in osteosarcoma and may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker for osteosarcoma patients. Therefore, silence of circRNA-0008717 could be a future direction to develop a novel treatment strategy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>osteosarcoma</kwd><kwd>circRNA-0008717</kwd><kwd>miR-203</kwd><kwd>Bmi-1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and young adults, and accounts for approximately 60% of malignant bone tumors in the first two decades of life [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, pulmonary metastasis is the most common cause for cancer-related death [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite advancement strategies such as surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, the prognosis of osteosarcoma still remains poor, and the survival of osteosarcoma patients reached a plateau [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Genetic changes as well as dysfunction of oncogenes or tumor suppressors have been demonstrated to be tightly associated with the development and progression [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Hence, identification of new molecules involved in tumor progression is of crucial importance to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this devastating disease.</p><p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs characterized by covalently closed continuous loops with neither 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; polarity nor a polyadenylated tail [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They have been found to play an important role in the regulation of multiple diseases, including cancer [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently, certain kinds of circRNAs have been found to be significantly deregulated in gastric cancer, esophageal squamous cancer, and osteosarcoma, and these deregulated circRNAs is suggested to participate in cancer development [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Accumulating evidences demonstrate that circRNAs function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, RNA-binding protein (RBP) sequestering agents as well as transcription regulators to regulate gene expressions [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For example, circRNA CDR1as, also known as ciRS-7, has been identified as a miR-7 sponge, leading to inhibition of miR-7 activity and activating the targeted gene expression [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Compared with linear RNA, circRNA is composed of a ring structure that is hard to break down. Thus, circRNA remains stable and serves as a convenient tool for cancer monitoring. These observations indicate that circRNAs may be a new kind of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer; however, elucidating the deregulated circRNAs and identifying their functions are still an ongoing process in cancer investigation.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of endogenous, small, non-coding RNAs that exert their posttranscriptional regulatory effects by targeting 3&#x02032; untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) of corresponding mRNAs [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. By targeting multiple transcripts, miRNAs regulate a wide range of biological processes, including apoptosis, differentiation and cell proliferation. Deregulation of miRNA expression by the sponge function of circRNAs may be critical for the development of cancers [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we utilized circRNA microarray analysis to screen expression profiles of circRNAs in osteosarcoma specimens, and identified that circRNA-0008717 is significantly upregulated and predicts poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. We found that circRNA-0008717 plays a oncogenic role in osteosarcoma via the sponge of miR-203 to promote thymidylate synthase expression, and consequently suppress osteosarcoma progression. Hence, circRNA-0008717 may serve as a biomarker for prognosis predication and as a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>CircRNAs expression profiles analysis</title><p>To identify specific circRNAs that are differentially expressed between osteosarcoma patients and normal subjects, five tissues samples and matched non-tumor tissue samples pooled from osteosarcoma patients were subjected for circRNA microarray assay analysis.

Subsequently, we narrowed the scope of the study to the 30 most aberrant expressed circRNAs, including 15 upregulated circRNAs and 15 downregulated circRNAs (shown in the heat map, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We then detected the expression of these 30 mostly changed circRNAs in ostesoarcoma and matched non-tumor tissue samples from 45 patients to confirm their expression.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, the expression of circRNA-0008717 was upregulated in most osteosarcoma cell lines when compared with the osteoblastic cell line hFOB. MG-63 and SAOS-2 cell lines were chosen for further investigations, because these two cell lines showed relatively higher expression level of circRNA-0008717 among the osteosarcoma cell lines. Then, the short interfering RNA (siRNA) which covers back-splicing region of circRNA-0008717 was constructed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). RT-qPCR assay showed that si-circ vector but not si-NC significantly downregulated the endogenous levels of circRNA-0008717 in MG-63 and SAOS-2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Subsequently, the effects of circRNA-0008717 on osteosarcoma cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration were examined. MTT assay showed that knockdown of circRNA-0008717 significantly suppressed cell proliferation when compared with control vector in both cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D and 3E</xref>). Similarly, decreased expression of circRNA-0008717 inhibited the colony formation ability, and promoted the proportion of apoptotic cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F and 3G</xref>). In addition, si-circ significantly inhibited the wound healing ability of osteosarcoma cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>).

RT-qPCR showed that miR-203 was significantly downregulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B and 4C</xref>). Spearman correlation test suggested that circRNA-0008717 was negatively correlated with miR-203 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Moreover, knockdown of circRNA-0008717 significantly promoted miR-203 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>), however, miR-203 failed to influence cirRNA-0008717 level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>).

It is widely accepted that searching new therapeutic targets and better understanding the pathway related to cancer initiation and progression is essential for improving the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. In this study, we focused on a novel gene regulator, circRNA, and validated the upregulation of circRNA-0008717 in osteosarcoma specimens. Furthermore, we also uncovered that the increased expression of circRNA-0008717 was a potential diagnostic and prognostic factor for osteosarcoma patients. Mechanistic analysis indicated that circRNA-0008717 suppressed the capacity of proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells through specifically sponging miR-203 and releasing Bmi-1.</p><p>The concept of &#x0201c;circular RNA&#x0201d; was first proposed in 1976, Sanger and colleagues found that viroids are single-stranded covalently closed circRNA molecules pathogenic to certain higher plants [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. CircRNAs are an enigmatic class of RNA with unknown function in mammal cells, and often show tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. They have two significant properties: highly conserved and remarkably stable with a half-life more than 48 hours [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Harboring these properties, circRNAs may be a promising tumor marker in precision medicine. Previously, increasing researches reveal the strong association of circRNAs with the development of several diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and different types of cancer, which make circRNA with the feasible potential of serving as the molecular diagnostic biomarker [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the specific role of circRNA in osteosarcoma is still largely unknown. In the present study, a circRNA microarray was performed to detect the circRNA expression profiles of osteosarcoma tissues and paired nontumor tissues to explore the relationship between the circRNA expression and osteosarcoma and to provide a preliminary theoretical basis for search of biomarkers for the early diagnosis and malignant progression of osteosarcoma. We identified that circRNA-0008717 was upregulated in osteosarcoma. ROC curve analysis and subsequent Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that circRNA-0008717 may be a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for osteosarcoma patients.</p><p>After having verified the clinical value of circRNA-0008717, we then investigate the underlying regulatory mechanism that may account for the clinical findings. CircRNA-0008717 is located at chr1:229665945&#x02013;229678118 with 724 length in gene symbol ABCB10, thus, it was also labeled circ-ABCB10. One study by Liang et al have demonstrated that this circRNA can promote breast cancer proliferation and progression through the sponge of miR-1271 function [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the functional role of circRNA-0008717 was not reported in other type of cancers, including osteosarcoma. In this study, we demonstrated that knockdown of circRNA-0008717 suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis; while enhanced expression of circRNA-0008717 promoted cell proliferation and invasion, indicating that this circRNA plays a oncogenic role in osteosarcoma.</p><p>MiRNAs, an abundant class of small noncoding RNAs (~22 nt), posttranscriptionally modulate the translation of target mRNAs via corresponding miRNA response elements (MRE) [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Computational searches for miRNA target sites in circRNAs identified a portion of circRNA molecules that contain MREs, which might act as miRNA sponge, reducing miRNA binding to its target genes, thereby releasing the expression of the miRNA targets indirectly [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Since the first report of circRNA functioning as a miRNA sponge, the potential of circRNAs in regulating cancer-related genes through fine-tuning miRNAs has recently been recognized. For example, the first characterized circRNA to support this model is ciRS-7, which contains more than sixty miR-7-binding sites, thereby acting as an endogenous miRNA sponge to adsorb and subsequently quench normal miR-7 functions [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. More recently, more and more circRNAs were recognized as miRNA sponges in different cancers, such as colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. By performing luciferase reporter assay, RIP assay and other gain and loss-functional assays, we demonstrate that circRNA-0008717 play an oncogenic role in osteosarcoma through the sponge activity of miR-203.</p><p>MiR-203, located at the chromosome 14q32.33, is one of the most frequently mentioned miRNAs. Previous studies have showed that miR-203 exhibited aberrant expression in multiple malignancies compared with their normal tissues [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although the role of miR-203 in malignancies are conflicting, miR-203 acts as a tumor suppressor in tumor progression of osteosarcoma [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We also validated that miR-203 was silenced in osteosarcoma and the downregulated miR-203 suppressed cell proliferation and invasion. By performing bioinformatics analysis and subsequent functional validation, we identified Bmi-1 as the direct target of miR-203. As a key member of the PcG complex, Bmi-1 was originally identified as an oncogene cooperating with c-myc in murine lymphomas model. It contains a conserved N-terminal RING finger domain and a central HTHTHT motif, which is necessary for telomerase activity induction and cellular immortalization [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Recently, Bmi-1 overexpression has been found in a variety of malignant tumors [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and silence of Bmi-1 expression can cause apoptosis and senescence of tumor cells [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], suggesting an important role in tumor cell growth and survival. Our study also suggests that Bmi-1 is necessary for the anti-oncogenic role of miR-203, which is consistent with the previous studies.</p><p>Finally, our gain and loss-functional assays verified that circRNA-0008717 promotes osteosarcoma progression by sponge activity of miR-203 and upregulation of Bmi-1 expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically identify the expression and functional role of circRNA-0008717 in osteosarcoma. We reported that circRNA-0008717 is upregulated and predicts poor survival in osteosarcoma patients. Moreover, circRNA-0008717 acts as a tumor oncogene through sponging miR-203 and thereby promoting the function of Bmi-1. Therefore, circRNA-0008717 may serve as a promising predictive biomarker and therapeutic target for osteosarcoma patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Clinical samples and preparation</title><p>Forty-five cancer tissues and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues from primary osteosarcoma patients were collected at Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi&#x02019;an Jiaotong University between June 2012 and July 2014.
