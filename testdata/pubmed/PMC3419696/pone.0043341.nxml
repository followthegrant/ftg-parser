With its recent outbreaks in Europe, there is a pressing need for efficacious antivirals. We presented here the identification and characterization of a novel virostatic molecule against BTV, an aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivative named compound 003 (C003). The virostatic efficacy of C003 could be improved <italic>via</italic> chemical modification, leading to a <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized compound 052 (C052). The 50% effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>) of C003 and C052 were determined at 1.76&#x000b1;0.73 &#x000b5;M and 0.27&#x000b1;0.12 &#x000b5;M, respectively. The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>) of C003 was over 100 &#x000b5;M and the CC<sub>50</sub> of C052 was at 82.69 &#x000b5;M. Accordingly, the 50% selective index (SI<sub>50</sub>) of C003 and C052 against BTV was over 57 and 306, respectively. The inhibitory effect of C003/C052 on BTV-induced apoptosis was also confirmed <italic>via</italic> the inhibition of caspase-3/-7 activation post BTV infection. C003/C052 could inhibit BTV induced CPE even when added as late as 24 h.p.i., indicating that they might act at late stage of viral life-cycle. C003/C052 could reduce over two-logs of both the progeny virus production and the number of genomic viral RNA copies. Interestingly, both the activation of host autophagy and viral protein expression were inhibited post BTV infection when cells were treated with C003 and C052, suggesting that C003/C052 might act as virostatic agents <italic>via</italic> inhibiting host autophagy activation. Although further investigations might be needed to pin down the exact mechanism of C003/C052, our finding suggested that these compounds might be potent lead compounds with potential novel mechanism of action against BTV.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was supported by grant 1R03MH08127-01 and 7R03MH08127-02 from NIH to Q.

Bluetongue disease is a non-contagious viral disease affecting domestic animals including sheep and cattle primarily, as well as wild ruminants such as buffalo, antelope, deer, elk and camels. BTV disease is one of the most important diseases of domestic livestock, causing $3 billion per year loss worldwide <xref rid="pone.0043341-Mellor2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043341-Mertens1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In sheep, the disease is acute, and mortality is accordingly high <xref rid="pone.0043341-MacLachlan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

The 1998&#x02013;2001 outbreak of BTV-8 in the Mediterranean Basin is the greatest epizootic of the disease on record, showing that BTV has extended its range northwards into areas of Europe that were never affected before, and has since persisted in many of these locations <xref rid="pone.0043341-Mellor2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043341-Mehlhorn1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043341-Mehlhorn2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043341-Meiswinkel1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

The development and validation of a cytopathic effect (CPE)-based assay led to the screening of the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR), with 194,950 small molecule compounds then. Further studies, using various primary, secondary and confirmatory assays, confirmed 185 structures that were grouped into six analog series corresponding to six scaffolds enriched within the active set compared to their distribution in the library <xref rid="pone.0043341-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Based on the results from the previous studies <xref rid="pone.0043341-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, we selected and evaluated the virostatic efficacy of a cluster of active compounds, in particular, the aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivatives. Furthermore, aiming to understand their mechanism of action, various studies were carried out to determine which viral life stage(s) these compounds acted on, focusing on how these virostatic compounds protect cells from BTV-induced apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Thiophene Derivatives as Lead Virostatic Agents against BTV</title><p>Based on the previously identified six compound clusters <xref rid="pone.0043341-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, we selected 2&#x02013;4 representative compounds from each cluster and assessed their virostatic efficacies against BTV, including the 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) and the 90% effective concentration (EC<sub>90</sub>). The EC<sub>50</sub> of these lead compounds were determined between 0.7 &#x000b5;M and 20 &#x000b5;M, respectively (results not shown). Interestingly, the four thiophene derivative compounds from cluster I, i.e. compound 001 through 004 (C001, C002, C003 and C004), showed potent virostatic efficacy against BTV, especially the aminothiophenecarboxylic acid derivatives C001 and C003. Using the ten-concentration dose response assay, the EC<sub>50</sub>s of C001 and C003 were determined at 0.69&#x000b1;0.15 &#x000b5;M and 1.76&#x000b1;0.73 &#x000b5;M, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043341-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>).

Accordingly, the selective indexes (SI<sub>50</sub>), which equals to EC<sub>50</sub>/CC<sub>50</sub>, were above 145 and 57 for C001 and C003, respectively, indicating that both compounds were highly selective against BTV.

In order to observed both the enhancement and reduction of virostatic efficacy at different time of addition, we used two concentrations of virostatic compound for both C003 and C052, i.e., the C003 at 1.76 &#x000b5;M and 20 &#x000b5;M, and C052 at 0.27 &#x000b5;M and 2.5 &#x000b5;M, respectively.

This is also related to virus replication and the leading indicator of virus-induced apoptosis. Since C003 and C052 prevented BTV-induced apoptosis, we examined the activation and formation of autophagy in BTV-infected cells, with and without virostatic compound treatment. When infected at MOI of 0.01, autophagy was not activated at 24 h post BTV infection as the level of LC3-II showed no difference in sample with or without C003/C052 treatment.

BTV-induced CPE was observed, and BTV replication was not interrupted (results not shown).

During Poliovirus and Coxsackievirus B3 infection, the co-localization of non-structural proteins with autophagy markers LC3-II, together with gene silencing and pharmacological experiments, indicate that autophagy proteins enhance viral replication and progeny virus yields. In BTV, the viral NS3 may act like the membrane protein of enveloped viruses and is responsible for intracellular trafficking and budding of virus particles <xref rid="pone.0043341-Celma1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Virostatics targeting virus egress would be predicted to prevent or slow down virus release and spread in an infected host, thus allowing more time for the individual&#x02019;s immune system to respond and control the infection <xref rid="pone.0043341-Harty1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Further studies on the role of autophagy during BTV progeny virus egress/dissemination may help to understand the exact mechanism of action for C003/C052.</p><p>Our results extend our previous findings that showed cluster of lead compounds that prevent BTV induced CPE <xref rid="pone.0043341-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. While further studies might be needed to define the exact mechanism of action for the virostatic agents C003/C052, our studies showed that these compounds may not interact with host apoptotic machinery, rather posses virostatic activity which block various signals to induce host apoptosis. The finding that host autophagy was involved in BTV life-cycle and C003/C052 might act on host autophagic machinery may open a new avenue to identify and develop novel small molecule antivirals that specifically interact with host autophagy machinery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells, Virus Stock and Use of Compounds</title><p>BSR cells <xref rid="pone.0043341-Buchholz1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, a cloned derivative of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, were maintained in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen).
