Total P in the soil was found to range from 736 to 1952&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;P&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;&#x000a0;1</sup>, of which between 12 and 48% was extractable using a 1&#x000a0;M HCl (HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>) solution with the two variables exhibiting a strong positive correlation. The &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> of the extracted PO<sub>4</sub> ranged from 17.0 to 21.6&#x02030; with a mean of 18.8&#x02030; (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.8). While the spatial variability of Total P has been researched at various scales, this is the first study to assess the variability of soil &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> at a field-scale resolution. We investigate whether or not &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> variability has any significant relationship with: (i) itself with respect to spatial autocorrelation effects; and (ii) HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>, elevation and slope - both globally and locally.

Interestingly, the latter relationships appear to vary in strength locally.

It can be applied as either inorganic mineral fertilizers, or via the spreading of animal wastes or other organic materials. Such wastes can occur either directly voided by the animal in the field or applied in bulk after storage while animals are housed. However, P can have significant detrimental effects when they move from land into water bodies. These effects range from direct toxicity (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Lewis and Morris, 1986</xref>) through to indirect consequences such as eutrophication (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1999</xref>). Surface waters are particularly sensitive to P because critical concentrations of only a few tens of &#x003bc;g of phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) can cause eutrophication, but are an order of magnitude lower than soil PO<sub>4</sub> concentrations required for crop growth (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Heathwaite and Dils, 2000</xref>). Identifying the different pollutant sources that are impacting on a water body is critical to understand its ecosystem health. However apportioning a pollutant to any given source or sources is fraught with difficulty and in recent years techniques have been developed to try to elucidate pollutant origins (e.g. <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Baker, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Old et al., 2012</xref>) and these include the use of natural abundance stable isotope ratios (e.g. <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Amberger and Schmidt, 1987</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Granger et al., 2008</xref>). More recently still the stable isotope approach has been applied to P and although P only has one stable isotope, the technique uses the stable oxygen (O) isotope ratio within the PO<sub>4</sub> molecule (&#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>) to isotopically characterise PO<sub>4</sub> sources and transformations. However, data on the &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> of different PO<sub>4</sub> sources remains limited (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Tamburini et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>One potential source of PO<sub>4</sub> in water is from soil, which often receives P inputs in excess of requirements resulting in P accumulation within the soil (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Haygarth et al., 1998a</xref>). Therefore, as with many other soil properties, an understanding of soil P variability is essential for designing sampling strategies or the evaluation of the effectiveness of diffuse water pollution mitigation measures (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Goovaerts, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Rivero et al., 2007</xref>). Despite this, few studies describe spatial variability of soil properties and their inter-relationships at a landscape scale (i.e. <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Marriott et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Page et al., 2005</xref>). The spatial variability of a given soil property may be related to the combined action of several physical, chemical or biological processes that act at different spatial scales depending on the soil property and process of interest (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Goovaerts, 1998</xref>). Soil spatial variability is present in both natural and agricultural systems, even if the latter have a long-term uniform management history (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Goovaerts, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Marriott et al., 1997</xref>). Understanding soil spatial variability is essential to land-based experiments at all scales and its omission is detrimental to the conclusions drawn from such experimental data.</p><p>In this study, we conduct a spatial analysis of soil &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> from an intensively managed agricultural grassland site. While the spatial variability of total P has been described at different scales by other researchers (e.g. <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Glendell et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Page et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Penn et al., 2007</xref>), this is the first study to assess the variability of soil &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> at a field-scale.

The field sampled, referred to as &#x02018;Great Field&#x02019;, was located on a north-west facing hillslope and comprises clay loam soil overlying the shales and thin subsidiary sandstone bands of the Crackington formation (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Harrod and Hogan, 2008</xref>). The soils can be further divided in three main types; Hallsworth (USDA Aaerichaplaquept, FAO Stagni-verticcambisol), Halstow (USDA typichaplaquepts, FAO dysticgleysol), and Denbigh (USDA Dysticeutrochrept, FAO Stagni-eutriccambisol) (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Harrod and Hogan, 2008</xref>). The long-term annual temperature and rainfall are 9.6&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 1056&#x000a0;mm, respectively, with a high proportion of rainfall occurring between October and March resulting in waterlogged soils.</p><p>Records of the historic farm management show that prior to 2010 the field comprised two separate areas (north 1.5&#x000a0;ha and south 5.6&#x000a0;ha) with contrasting management histories. The northern part had been managed as permanent grassland for at least 25&#x000a0;years, whereas the southern part has been ploughed three times in the last 25&#x000a0;years, most recently in September 2007 when it was re-seeded with a ryegrass/clover mixture following a previous winter barley crop. At the time of the study, both areas of the field had the same vegetation cover being classified under the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) category: &#x0201c;MG7 <italic>Lolium perenne Poa trivialis</italic> and related grasslands&#x0201d;. The southern region, however, had a higher clover content (<italic>Trifolium repens</italic>), less dense vegetation cover and approximately double the sward height compared to the northern part. These management histories are representative of normal management cycles of intensive grassland management (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bilotta et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Sample design, collection and analysis</title><p>To quantify spatial variability in &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>, a sampling pattern was chosen with the view of a geostatistical analysis not only to &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>, but to other soil variables, as presented in <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Peukert et al. (2012)</xref>. In order to assess spatial variability across three different spatial scales, 78 soil samples were taken in total with samples at: (i) a broad scale (75&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;m grid); (ii) an intermediate scale (25&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;25&#x000a0;m grid); and (iii) a small scale (10&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;m grid). A hand-held GPS (Nomad Trimble, Sunnyvale, USA) was used to map and mark the sampling points.</p><p>All samples were collected in May 2011 to a soil depth of 7.5&#x000a0;cm and were oven dried at 105&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x000a0;h. Dried soils were then sieved through a 2&#x000a0;mm mesh. Total P (TP) was determined at an external laboratory (Natural Resource Management, Berkshire, U.K.) through digestion of the soils ground to 0.5&#x000a0;mm in aqua-regia followed by subsequent analysis on an ICP-AES. The &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> of the soil was determined on the 1&#x000a0;M HCl extractant described by <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Tamburini et al. (2010)</xref> but with a few modifications. Briefly, between 10 and 20&#x000a0;g dry soil was added to 100&#x000a0;ml 1&#x000a0;M HCl and shaken overnight. The supernatants were collected after separation from the residual solids by centrifugation and filtration. Phosphate concentrations were determined colourimetrically on an Aquachem 250 analyser using a molybdenum blue reaction (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Murphy and Riley, 1962</xref>) after they were diluted by at least 1/10 to avoid acid interference with the molybdenum chemistry. The extracted PO<sub>4</sub> is precipitated and dissolved as firstly ammonium phospho-molybdate and then magnesium ammonium phosphate before excess magnesium and chloride is removed through the addition of a cation resin and a small dose of silver nitrate crystals respectively. The resultant PO<sub>4</sub> in solution is then converted to silver phosphate (Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) though the addition of an Ag-ammine solution and subsequent adjustment of the pH to between 7 and 8 with 0.5&#x000a0;M HNO<sub>3</sub> before incubation for two days at 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in an oven.</p><p>Soil PO<sub>4</sub> extracted using 1&#x000a0;M HCl (HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>) represents an integration of several potential PO<sub>4</sub> pools (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Zohar et al., 2010</xref>): (i) the most labile, water-extractable soil PO<sub>4</sub>, including intracellular microbial PO<sub>4</sub> typically released through processes such as soil drying and re-wetting and cell lysis (ii) weakly adsorbed bicarbonate-extractable soil PO<sub>4</sub>, and (iii) strongly fixed, calcium and iron bound P. The weak acid extraction does not include the strongly adsorbed aluminium oxide bound PO<sub>4</sub>, which requires a NaOH-based extraction (<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Tiessen and Moir, 1993</xref>), nor does it include P in organic matter, the hydrolysis of which with 1&#x000a0;M HCl has been shown to be negligible during the development of the extraction protocol by <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Tamburini et al. (2010)</xref>. To confirm that organic P forms were not being hydrolysed, duplicate soil samples were extracted using <sup>18</sup>O-labeled and unlabelled 1&#x000a0;M HCl. If the extracted HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> was to contain large amounts of hydrolised organic P or condensed PO<sub>4</sub> species (e.g. polyphosphates, pyrophosphates, etc.) then the &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> of the sample duplicates would be markedly different. For all tested samples, the <sup>18</sup>O of the sample extracted with unlabelled and <sup>18</sup>O-labeled acid was no &#x0003e;&#x000a0;1%. The contribution of calcium-bound P is also considered to be negligible as both the soil parent material was neither igneous nor calcareous, and the soil pH is generally &#x0003c;&#x000a0;6. Therefore HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> is assumed to extract PO<sub>4</sub> from the same soil pool as is released by water, anion resins, and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> extraction, namely extracellular labile PO<sub>4</sub> and metabolic intracellular microbial PO<sub>4</sub> and also some iron bound PO<sub>4</sub>. Using the 1&#x000a0;M HCl as an extractant enables far greater quantities PO<sub>4</sub> to become available, quantities that are required to allow the successful precipitation of Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> from small amount of soil.</p><p>Oxygen isotope analysis was carried out ETH Zurich on a Vario Pyro Cube (Elementar GmbH, Hanau, Germany) coupled in continuous flow to an Isoprime 100 isotopic ratio mass spectrometer IRMS (Isoprime, Manchester, UK). Triplicate samples of ~&#x000a0;0.3&#x000a0;mg of Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> were weighted into silver capsules together with a small amount of fine carbon black powder to promote the reaction between the Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and carbon to produce CO. The produced reaction gases are carried through a temperature-controlled chromatography column and ultimately to the IRMS. Calibration and corrections for instrumental drifts were done by repeated measurements of an internal standard (ACROS Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;97.5%, &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;14.2&#x02030;; measured and calibrated at the University of Lausanne by T.

The &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O values are given in the standard &#x02030; notation with respect to VSMOW (Vienna Standard Mean Oceanic Water). Silver phosphate standards are routinely analyzed, and standard deviation on analytical replicates was better than 0.3&#x02030;.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Unfortunately, the described sampling design of <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Peukert et al.

The design resulted in: (i) large areas of gross under-sampling or voids and (ii) areas of preferential or clustered sampling due to the chosen sampling scheme. Both flaws also interact and compound each other. Given this, the direct application of many statistical methods is likely to be inefficient and sub-optimal, resulting in biased outputs (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Diggle et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Gelfand et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Olea, 2007</xref>). As a consequence, all of this study's statistical analyses had to be conducted in a manner that would account for this sub-optimal sample design.</p><p>As a first step to mitigate against possible biasing effects, the following data pre-processing actions were taken: (1) the limits of the study area were set to lie significantly within the field boundary using a 10&#x000a0;m buffer around the all sample points that lie to the edge; (2) the data were declustered by removing observations that contribute the most to the preferential sampling; and (3) to complement Action 2, one-point declustering weights were found using the algorithm of <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Deutsch and Journel (1998)</xref>, that enables the full data set to be used but where the clustered data are down-weighted (and so negate potential bias).</p><p>The statistical analyses for assessing the variation in &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> accorded to the following four linked stages: (i) a standard exploratory analysis; (ii) a variographic analysis to assess spatial dependence (e.g. <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Goovaerts, 1997</xref>); (iii) a geographically weighted (GW) correlation analysis (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Fotheringham et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Brunsdon, 2010</xref>) to investigate spatial heterogeneity in paired relationships; and (iv) a confirmatory regression analysis based on that observed in stages (i) to (iii), where &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> is taken as some function of HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>, elevation, slope, soil class and the historical north-south division. In addition to these analyses, that are centred on &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>, complementary spatial analyses were conducted on TP and HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> to provide useful context.

Lags for all empirical variograms were chosen to reflect the study's sample design; and only omni-directional variograms were found. To counter any biasing effects on variogram estimation caused by the sample design, a two-point declustering algorithm was also used to provide weighted variograms (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Richmond, 2002</xref>). For variograms that displayed spatial structure, they were modelled using a weighted least squares (WLS) approach specified with an exponential variogram model-type.</p><p>For investigation (ii), an OLS MLR fit and its corresponding WLS residual variogram model fit are sub-optimal (but often informative in an explorative context). As such (and when required), both sets of parameters (i.e. those for the MLR and those for the variogram) were optimally re-estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) (e.g. <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Schabenberger and Gotway, 2004</xref>). REML is also useful in that it can similarly account for variogram bias due to the sample design, as can the two-point declustering algorithm, above (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Marchant et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.3.3</label><title>Geographically weighted correlations</title><p>Spatial heterogeneity in &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> relationships was investigated via the mapping of GW correlations. These localised correlations are found at the sample sites of the study area, where they are calculated in the same manner as their standard (global) counterpart, but only use data that are spatially nearby to the sample locations. Nearby data are spatially weighted (via a kernel weighting function), so that the closest data points are given more influence in the local statistic. Geographically weighted correlations form one of a suite of GW methods (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Fotheringham et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Gollini et al., 2015</xref>), another of which, GW regression (GWR) is described below.</p><p>A GW method can be viewed as a moving window weighting technique, where the size of the window over which any localised statistic/model might apply is controlled by the kernel's bandwidth. Commonly, this exploration of spatial heterogeneity involves: (i) a carefully judged choice of bandwidth; (ii) a test for significance of the observed heterogeneity; together with (iii) a mapping of the outputs. For this study, we specified the GW correlations using an adaptive Gaussian kernel. In the absence of an objective procedure for bandwidth selection, we experimented with three user-specified bandwidths of 30%, 40% and 50%. Hypothesis tests for this stage, followed a randomisation approach where the true local correlation is compared to that found from 999 random permutations of the data (e.g. <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Fotheringham et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>2.3.4</label><title>Regression analysis</title><p>The following three regressions were considered, where &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> is the response variable: (i) MLR; (ii) MLR with spatially-autocorrelated error; and (iii) GWR (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Brunsdon et al., 1996</xref>). The first two regressions assume data relationships are globally-fixed, while the third regression allows data relationships to locally-vary. The parameters of the two MLR models can be estimated by OLS and REML, respectively. Similar to GW correlations, GWR enables the exploration of data relationships, where localised regressions are fitted using spatially weighted data and the resultant regression coefficients are mapped. GWR parameters are estimated using a WLS procedure, where we again specify an adaptive Gaussian kernel weighting scheme. For GWR, an objective function exists for bandwidth selection; and here we use an automatic AIC procedure (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Fotheringham et al., 2002</xref>). To compare the fit of chosen regressions, AIC and R<sup>2</sup> values are reported.</p><p>Hypothesis tests for significant regression coefficient heterogeneity follow both: (i) a randomisation approach (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Brunsdon et al., 1998</xref>) and (ii) a parametric bootstrap approach (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2015</xref>). For the former, GWR is applied to 999 random permulations of the data and the variance of a given coefficient is found. The actual variance of the same coefficient is then included in the ranked distribution of variances, where its position (i.e. its <italic>p</italic>-value) relates to whether there is significant spatial variation in this coefficient.</p><p>For the latter, bootstrap samples of the response variable are found for a null (fixed coefficient) model (e.g. MLR), where the simulations are based on the estimated parameters of the null model fit to the sample data. The predictor variables are not considered random and are the same as the sample data. A test statistic <italic>q</italic> that measures the spatial variability in the GWR coefficients is then used to test against the null hypothesis. Thus a GWR model is fitted to each bootstrap sample and a <italic>q</italic>-statistic is found for each regression coefficient. As the null model is a random process, even when coefficients do not vary spatially, one would not expect the GWR coefficients to be identical in different locations. The bootstrap analysis determines how much coefficient variability one might expect to encounter due to random variation in a model, and to compare the level of variability in the observed data set, against this.</p><p>The bootstrap tests are run with the number of simulations set at 999. For each regression coefficient, the 95% points of the bootstrap samples are computed, and significance levels are found for upper single-tailed hypothesis tests. In addition, at every sample (i.e regression point) location, the localised set of regression coefficients are tested for significant difference to their corresponding fixed coefficient estimates. Here at each sample location, a bootstrap sample of pseudo <italic>t</italic>-values (e.g. <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Harris et al., 2010</xref>) are found for each coefficient, enabing a bootstrap <italic>p</italic>-value to be found accordingly.

The study field slopes downwards from its south-east corner to broadly where the historical divide starts to the west; and similarly slopes downwards from the north to the same point.

For Action 2 the data were both moderately and strongly declustered by removing 7 and 22 observations, respectively through expert judgement. Actions 1 and 2 are depicted in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Both declustered data sets simply lessen the impact of the three main areas of clustering, where data have been manually removed according to their location (and not by their measurements).

Results suggest that continuing with the clustered data is reasonable, with a proviso that only models that cater for possible bias are applied. Weighted correlations and weighted regressions (WLS MLR) can also be found using the clustered data, where we assume that the cell-declustering weights found for an unbiased global mean (for &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), are also suitable to down-weight data relationships in areas of clustering.

Variography for both KED models was reasonably well-behaved, with a clear single structure depicting spatial dependence up to distances of around 100&#x000a0;m.

The behaviour of the within-class variograms somewhat endorses this (noting that they mimic the south variograms at higher lags as no such semivariance pairs exist in the north). North data variograms were not found as there were too few data points to compute a valid variogram. All residual variograms clearly depict pure nugget effects, as do the REML models.

Here we calculate correlations for the northern and southern parts of the field. Given that spatial autocorrelation effects are absent (both globally and within each partition), and that the declustered data is used, we can report the significance of these correlations (using standard <italic>t</italic>-tests with correlations) with relative assurance.

As a continuous (Gaussian) weighting scheme is specified, all GW correlations are actually informed by all 58 observations of the strongly declustered data (a bandwidth of 40% entails that the nearest 22 observations exert the greatest influence on each localised correlation). This weighting specification is considered crucial to a GW analysis to such a relatively small data set.

However the historic field divide is considered the most important driver, with higher values to the north of the divide than to the south. This is not unexpected given the management differences between the two sectors and is because the northern part of the field has not been ploughed for a significant time, while the southern part had been ploughed and most recently in 2007. The surface enrichment of P is normal in agricultural soils, especially grasslands which may not be ploughed frequently, and reflects the accumulation of P from inorganic fertilizers and manures over time. The decrease in P with depth is often marked over a few cm with the bulk of the soil profile considerably lower in P. Where ploughing has occurred, such profiles are destroyed within the plough zone and the high P surface soil diluted or replaced with lower P soil brought up from depth (e.g. <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Haygarth et al., 1998a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Haygarth et al., 1998b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Watson and Matthews, 2008</xref>).

Given the negligible contribution of bedrock apatite PO<sub>4</sub> it is assumed that the bulk of the HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> is comprised of PO<sub>4</sub> adsorbed to soil particles and microbial PO<sub>4</sub>. The soils in this region have been shown to have a high microbial biomass P content, which in turn has been shown to be released upon drying and rewetting through cell lysis (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell et al., 2013</xref>). The amounts of HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> measured are very similar to the levels of microbial P reported by <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell et al. (2013)</xref> and therefore we assume that HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> in these soils represents, in large part, adsorbed soil PO<sub>4</sub> and intracellular microbial PO<sub>4</sub>, the latter normally exceeding the former (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><label>4.2</label><title>Variability of &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub></title><p>In order to discuss &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> values observed, we need to estimate the theoretical equilibrium &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> value that might be expected for PO<sub>4</sub> in equilibrium with soil water which is believed to be mediated by the ubiquitous intracellular enzyme pyrophosphatase (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Blake et al., 2005</xref>). This causes the exchange of PO<sub>4</sub> oxygen with the oxygen in H<sub>2</sub>O and results in a temperature dependent relationship initially described by <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Longinelli and Nuti (1973)</xref>. However recent work by <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Blake (2015)</xref> has developed a refined, rigorous and controlled laboratory calibration of the temperature-dependence of equilibrium PO<sub>4</sub> and water, catalyzed by pyrophosphatase, over a typical environmental temperatures (3&#x02013;37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C):</p><p>E&#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.18&#x000a0;T&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;26.3&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;&#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>where E&#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> is the stable oxygen isotope ratio of PO<sub>4</sub> at equilibrium in &#x02030;, T is the temperature in degrees Celsius and &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is the stable oxygen isotope ratio of H<sub>2</sub>O in &#x02030;. The intracellular phosphate, already at equilibrium, is released to the soil after cell lysis.</p><p>Although measurements of soil water &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> were not directly made it has been suggested that soil water at the location is very similar &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> to ground water, in that it is an integrated value of many rainfall events (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Granger et al., 2010</xref>). As such the &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> should be similar to that of the global meteoric water line for this area with &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> ranging between &#x02212;&#x000a0;5.5 to &#x02212;&#x000a0;6.0&#x02030; (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Darling et al., 2003</xref>). The average soil temperature measured at 10&#x000a0;cm depth nearby was 13&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for the month of May and this would give estimated vales of &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> at equilibrium with soil water of between 18.0 and 18.5&#x02030;. However given the uncertainties in these assumptions it is wise to examine a window of potential soil &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> and temperature values to understand better the measured &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> data compared to the theoretical equilibrium &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> values. For example, it might be expected that the integrated soil temperature of the soil profile from surface to 7.5&#x000a0;cm depth is slightly warmer than that measured at 10&#x000a0;cm. Further, although ground water is an analogue for soil water, the variability of soil water &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is more pronounced and subject to strong influence from individual rainfall events and also from enrichment in <sup>18</sup>O through evapotranspiration, especially in the surface of the soil (e.g. <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Hsieh et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Treydte et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore if it is assumed that the integrated 7.5&#x000a0;cm profile soil temperature ranges between 13 and 15&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and that the &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is enriched by up to 4&#x02030; compared to groundwater, then the theoretical &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> equilibrium values range between 18.0 and 23.0&#x02030;. This range of values better matches the &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> of the soil and suggests that the HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> within the soil is at or around equilibrium. This finding is in common with other researchers. <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Angert et al. (2012)</xref> found that across a Mediterranean bed rock and rainfall gradient, both soil resin extractable PO<sub>4</sub> and HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> were broadly in equilibrium with soil water and proposed, amongst other reasons, that a flux of intracellular equilibrated PO<sub>4</sub> from the soil microbial biomass may be causing this. <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Tamburini et al. (2012)</xref> also conclude that in young and developing alpine soils, regardless of the contribution of PO<sub>4</sub> from minerals or vegetation, or from the activity of extracellular enzymes, microbial biomass was the main controller of the &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>, keeping it in equilibrium with soil water. In both these examples however the soils were generally low in P, and where P is limiting it is expected that microbial cycling would be rapid. Within this current study soil P should not be limiting and it is therefore interesting that &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> would still appear to be relatively rapidly cycled and have no obvious trace of any P source signatures. One explanation for this, would be if the predominant P sources had &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> signatures similar to that of the equilibrium &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> value. The &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> of inorganic fertilizers have been reported to show a very wide range of values from 14.8 to 27.0&#x02030; while virtually no &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> values have been published for animal excreta (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2009</xref>) or for stored and managed animal wastes, however, water-extractable PO<sub>4</sub> from dairy farm slurries in this area have been found to range from 12.0 and 15.0&#x02030; (Granger, unpublished data).</p><p>Analysis results for &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> relationships within the data are enigmatic. Considering the field as a whole, all relationships for &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> are weak or indistinct. HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>, elevation, slope, soil class and the historic field divide are not particularly good drivers of &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> variability; and &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> is not spatially correlated with itself. For within-field relationships between &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> and HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>, elevation and slope; only the local relationship for &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> with HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> appears to have any value, showing a positive relationship north of the historic field divide which does not exist to the south. However, such localised relationships are not significantly different to that found for the field as a whole. Thus in essence, &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> is not only randomly distributed with respect to itself, but also to the particular environmental factors that this study has considered.</p><p>If it had been found that the positive relationship between &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> with HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> was significant in the northern part of the field, which this study can only allude to; this may imply that the process of ploughing, which has destroyed the soil P profile in the south, has also decoupled any link between HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> and &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> that is present in the north. The scenario described by the data seems to suggest that, in the north, elevated HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> occurs as &#x02018;hotspots&#x02019; with associated higher &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>, and that as the HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> of these hotspots declines so the &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> becomes lower. Such P hotspots have been described previously under cattle grazing regimes which not only leads to an increasing the TP in the surface of the soil but also to a heterogeneous distribution of TP &#x02018;hotspots&#x02019; as a result of livestock excreta (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Page et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Penn et al., 2007</xref>). However, the available data on &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> in excreta, although limited, indicates that it is not elevated. If however metabolic PO<sub>4</sub> released from leaf litter has an elevated &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Pfahler et al., 2013</xref>) this might explain the difference between the north and south of the field. In the south, ploughing has buried and mixed soil organic matter, which in the north has had time to accumulate. Potentially, this accumulation may not be homogenous and may still be affected by the hotspots of excreta described previously or it might just reflect a heterogeneous accumulation of non-excretal plant material within the soil profile. However if this is the cause of the relationship between &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> and HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> it is not reflected in the soil total carbon content which shows no relationship with &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s0105"><label>4.3</label><title>Controling variables</title><p>Throughout this study, we have not attempted to de-couple the effects of the historic field divide from the underlying soil class, in how these categorical variables influence variation and co-variation in HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>, TP and &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>. It is clear from <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> that both categorical variables act as similar discriminators, as data only coincides with the Denbigh class in the northern part of the field, while the Halstow class primarily relates to data in the south. Such similarity in discriminating power is then clearly evident in the subsequent analyses. Given that sample size is small and many results are null, it was considered appropriate to maintain the controlling interaction between these categorical variables in all regression fits. However, as the distinction between the three soil classes is considered minimal in practise, any HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub>,</sub> TP or &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> difference between the soil classes is considered more likely a reflection of the historic field division rather than a characteristic of the soil classes themselves.</p></sec><sec id="s0110"><label>4.4</label><title>Analysis limitations</title><p>Although the statistical analyses for &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> point to a series of null results, it should be borne in mind that the study data is limited in size and that the sampling configuration may miss the key scales of spatial dependence and co-dependence in &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>. In this respect, future &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> (and HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>) studies should consider sampling on a finer grid with increased sampling, with nested sampling strategies (e.g. <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Atteia et al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Corstanje et al., 2008</xref>). Increased sampling should also guard against results simply reflecting sampling variation rather than the true properties of the spatial process.</p><p>Issues of sample design necessitated the use of the strongly declustered data for all localised analysis; and the associated loss of information. The only way to have proceeded with the clustered data would have required the calculation of localised sets of de-clustering weights, as it was not viable to use the globally-found ones of <xref rid="s0060" ref-type="sec">Section 3.2</xref>. As this would have presented a challenge for any partitioned analysis, and more so for any GW analyses (where the nature of the clustering bias would locally-vary according to the kernel and its bandwidth), the use of localised de-clustering weights was not considered.</p><p>Given the poor model fits throughout, the small sample size and the known issues for GWR with respect to local predictor variable collinearity (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e1;ez et al., 2011</xref>), the results of <xref rid="s0085" ref-type="sec">Section 3.7</xref> are viewed with caution. Although here, the GWR fit was assessed for adverse collinearity effects following the procedures outlined in <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Gollini et al. (2015)</xref>, and although collinearity was present, its effects were not considered serious. Further work could extend the GWR analyses in this respect, where in addition to the fit of a penalised form of GWR, a mixed GWR (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Brunsdon et al., 1999</xref>) could be considered where the categorical predictors are globally fixed, while the other predictors are allowed to locally-vary.</p><p>It is also worth noting that variation in &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> may be driven by environmental covariates not considered in this study, as such, future studies should consider identifying these missing covariates. Measurement error in &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> could also be mitigating factor in this study's null results and could be incorporated in future work, noting that the &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> values of this study represent an average of a three replicates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0115"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has shown that, despite differences in elevation, slope, the under lying soil class and management, the &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> has no relationship with these field variables even though the HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> can have. The soil &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> values within the field were found to be within the range predicted for that has been microbially cycled and is at equilibrium with &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub>. However given the lack of information of PO<sub>4</sub> source &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> signatures, it is not clear whether this is due to the rapid microbial cycling of PO<sub>4</sub> or because PO<sub>4</sub> sources have a similar &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> to that of the equilibrium value. Although no relationships were found between the &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub>, and itself (with respect to spatial autocorrelation) and the field variables investigated, there was a suggestion of a positive correlation between &#x003b4;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> and HCl<sub>PO<sub>4</sub></sub> in the northern unploughed, field sector which was not present in the southern ploughed part of the field. While no conclusive evidence has been found to explain this, it has been suggested that this might be related to the metabolic PO<sub>4</sub> within plant material heterogeneously accumulating in the soil surface in the unploughed part of the field.</p><p>This study provides an important advance to understanding spatial dependencies and spatial relationships in phosphate stable oxygen isotopes within a temperate agricultural soil. Some variability information was as hypothesised while intriguingly others were not. Given this, further work is ear-marked to learn and benefit from this study's results, via the implementation of a coherent multivariate sampling design, to a different field, with a known long-term management history.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amberger</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>H.L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The natural isotope content of nitrate as an indicator of its origin</article-title><source>Geochim.
