We have previously shown that in WARP-deficient mice, collagen VI is specifically reduced in regions of the peripheral nerve ECM where WARP is expressed, suggesting that both macromolecules are part of the same suprastructure. The object of this study was to conduct a detailed analysis of WARP-collagen VI interactions <italic>in vitro</italic> in cartilage, a tissue rich in WARP and collagen VI. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse and human articular cartilage showed that WARP and collagen VI co-localize in the pericellular matrix of superficial zone articular chondrocytes. EM analysis on extracts of human articular cartilage showed that WARP associates closely with collagen VI-containing suprastructures. Additional evidence of an interaction is provided by immunogold EM and immunoblot analysis showing that WARP was present in collagen VI-containing networks isolated from cartilage. Further characterization were done by solid phase binding studies and reconstitution experiments using purified recombinant WARP and isolated collagen VI. Collagen VI binds to WARP with an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of approximately 22 nM and the binding site(s) for WARP resides within the triple helical domain since WARP binds to both intact collagen VI tetramers and pepsinized collagen VI. Together, these data confirm and extend our previous findings by demonstrating that WARP and collagen VI form high affinity associations <italic>in vivo</italic> in cartilage. We conclude that WARP is ideally placed to function as an adapter protein in the cartilage pericellular matrix.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Health and Medical Research grant 284524 (to JF and JB), an Arthritis Research Campaign Travel Award (to RW) and by the National Institutes of Health (to JF, R01AR055957), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Grant SFB, A2 (to PB), the Victorian Government's Operational Infrastructure Support Program and by the National Center for Research Resources (S10-RR023432).

A detailed understanding of how these components interact is important for elucidating the pathobiology of diseases that involve the ECM. Defining the major protein-protein interactions in connective tissues provides important insights into specific developmental processes and for interpreting transgenic and knock-out mouse phenotypes. The goal of this study is to characterize the molecular interaction between von Willebrand factor A-domain related protein (WARP) <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052793-Fitzgerald1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and the ubiquitous ECM macromolecule, collagen VI. The rationale for this study came from our finding that in mice null for <italic>Vwa-1</italic>, the gene for WARP, collagen VI is reduced suggesting a direct functional relationship between the two ECM components VI <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Six genetically distinct collagen VI chains, &#x003b1;1(VI), &#x003b1;2(VI), &#x003b1;3(VI), &#x003b1;4(VI), &#x003b1;5(VI) and &#x003b1;6(VI), encoded by the <italic>COL6A1</italic> to <italic>COL6A6</italic> genes, are now known to exist <xref rid="pone.0052793-Chu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052793-Chu2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052793-Chu3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052793-Gara1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052793-Fitzgerald2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Like all collagens, these chains initially assemble into trimeric structures. Heterotrimers of the &#x003b1;1(VI), &#x003b1;2(VI), &#x003b1;3(VI) chains are known to assemble into microfibrillar structures by a unique hierarchical process <xref rid="pone.0052793-Furthmayr1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052793-Chu4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The molecular and suprastructural associations of the recently described &#x003b1;4(VI), &#x003b1;5(VI) and &#x003b1;6(VI) chains are not yet established. Collagen VI is integrated in many tissues into abundant and structurally unique microfibrils in close association with basement membranes. Several recent studies suggest that such microfibrils tether basement membranes to the interstitial matrix <xref rid="pone.0052793-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052793-Niiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that collagen VI interacts specifically with several macromolecules of basement membranes or the interstitial extracellular matrix, including perlecan <xref rid="pone.0052793-Wilusz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, collagen IV <xref rid="pone.0052793-Kuo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, &#x003b2;ig-h3 <xref rid="pone.0052793-Hanssen1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and NG2 <xref rid="pone.0052793-Burg1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> or fibrillar collagens <xref rid="pone.0052793-Keene1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, biglycan, and decorin <xref rid="pone.0052793-Wiberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, respectively.</p><p>In cartilage, collagen VI is an abundant component of the chondrocyte pericellular matrix (PCM) <xref rid="pone.0052793-Poole1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, a basement membrane-like structure <xref rid="pone.0052793-Kvist1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Atomic force microscopy experiments demonstrated that collagen VI is a major contributor to the biomechanical integrity of the PCM <xref rid="pone.0052793-Wilusz2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A biomechanical role for collagen VI in articular cartilage is further supported by the finding that mice null for the <italic>Col6a1</italic> gene demonstrate reduced biomechanical characteristics <xref rid="pone.0052793-Alexopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Human WARP is a 50 kDa protein encoded by the <italic>VWA1</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0052793-Fitzgerald1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Biochemical studies demonstrate that WARP oligomerizes to form large disulfide-bonded multimeric structures in cartilage. During development, WARP is expressed within presumptive articular cartilage prior to joint cavitation and is present in the PCM of developing elements of articular and fibrocartilage including intervertebral disc, sternal cartilage and meniscus <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Further studies using a mouse line expressing a reporter gene at the <italic>Vwa1</italic> locus demonstrated that, in addition to cartilage, WARP is expressed near basement membrane structures in several tissues including the peripheral nervous system, the apical ectodermal ridge of developing limb buds, and skeletal and cardiac muscle <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Consistent with a basement membrane role for WARP is the finding that it forms high affinity associations with perlecan, a proteoglycan prominently occurring in the cartilage pericellular matrix <xref rid="pone.0052793-Melrose1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and in basement membrane <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>We previously reported that the primary phenotype of the WARP-null mouse is a peripheral nerve abnormality that manifests as a delayed response to acute painful stimulus and impaired fine motor coordination <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The main biochemical phenotype is a reduction and mislocalization of collagen VI in the endoneurium where WARP is expressed, but not in the outer perineurium layer where WARP is not expressed, suggesting that the reduction in collagen VI is directly related to the absence of WARP protein. Support for the hypothesis that WARP and collagen VI associated directly was provided by a surface plasmon resonance experiment <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Here, we expand the analysis of the WARP-collagen VI interaction with <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments including immunohistochemistry, solid phase binding studies, electron microscopy analyses and a novel approach for isolation and analysis of matrix suprastructures. The <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments are focused on normal human cartilage, a tissue where both WARP and collagen VI are known to be expressed in close association with the PCM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Paraffin embedded sagittal femoral cartilage sections from healthy individuals were treated with hyaluronidase (2 mg/ml; from bovine testes; Sigma Aldrich) and incubated with 0.2% glycine for 1 h.

The extrafibrillar material was labeled with antibodies against WARP and collagen VI antibodies (panels a&#x02013;c), confirming that they are closely associated in cartilage. The experiment was repeated using an antibody against the C-terminal domains of WARP and gave similar results (data not shown). A control experiment where primary antibodies were omitted is shown in panel d. When WARP primary antibodies were pre-absorbed with purified WARP protein no labeling was detected (data not shown). In addition, immuno-gold EM was performed on ultrathin sections of articular cartilage of adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052793-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Similar to the results using cartilage extracts, immuno-labeling of suprastructural aggregates for WARP and collagen VI occurred in close vicinity, confirming the <italic>in-vivo</italic> association of collagen VI and WARP.</p><p>The immunohistochemical and EM experiments presented so present evidence that WARP and collagen VI co-localize at the tissue level in articular cartilage. However, to assess whether WARP and collagen VI interact directly, reconstitution experiments were conducted using collagen VI microfibrils prepared from bovine cornea and recombinant human WARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052793-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). SDS PAGE of collagen VI and WARP preparations is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052793.s001">Figure S1</xref>. Collagen VI microfibrils and WARP dimers were mixed and the reaction products were analyzed by negative staining and immuno-gold EM. A representative micrograph showing collagen VI microfibrils in the absence of recombinant WARP is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052793-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. Characteristic beaded microfibrils which contained short triple helical domains separated by globular domains were apparent. Unlike collagen VI isolated from Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cells under similar conditions <xref rid="pone.0052793-Wiberg2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, these microfibrils appear to lack bound ligands such as COMP, WARP, or matrilins which was also confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). The recombinant WARP preparation used in the reconstitution experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052793-g004">Figure 4B</xref>. The presence of WARP in a negatively stained preparation was confirmed using biotinylated dimers or multimers of WARP detected with 5-nm-streptavidin-gold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052793-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). When WARP dimers and collagen VI microfibrils are mixed the globular domains of the collagen VI microfibrils became conspicuously larger (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052793-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) suggesting that WARP is binding close to the junction between the triple helical and globular domains of collagen VI. Streptavidin-gold-EM analysis conducted on the WARP-collagen VI reconstitution mixture confirmed that WARP dimers bound to collagen VI in a regular spacing pattern that corresponded to the globular domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052793-g004">Fig. 4E&#x02013;G</xref>).

The reciprocal binding experiment with immobilized WARP and soluble collagen VI tetramers was also conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052793-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Three different preparations of WARP were assessed for binding to collagen VI; WARP dimers, WARP multimers and a mix of WARP dimers and multimers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0052793.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, panel b for WARP fractions). Immobilized WARP dimers, but not multimers bound to collagen VI tetramers. A mix of dimers and multimers gave intermediate results indicating that WARP dimers are competent to associate with collagen VI tetramers <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas WARP multimers are not. This finding is consistent with the WARP and collagen VI reconstitution experiments which demonstrated interaction of WARP dimers but not WARP multimer preparations with isolated collagen VI (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052793-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). The reason for this difference is not known. However, collagen VI tetramers may only be able to co-assemble with WARP before it undergoes multimerization. Also, the binding of WARP-multimers may be sterically unfavorable. An alternative explanation is that, depending on the nature of their binding partners, distinct WARP&#x02013;oligomers may be amalgamated into discrete suprastructures, each exerting specific tissue functions.</p><fig id="pone-0052793-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0052793.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Solid phase analysis of WARP/collagen VI interaction.</title><p>a, WARP binding to collagen VI tetramers.

Our data suggests that the high affinity interactions between WARP and collagen VI are critical for stabilizing collagen VI in peripheral nerves, since in the absence of WARP collagen VI assemblies are unstable. Using cartilage as a rich source of both macromolecules we have shown in this study that collagen VI and WARP interact <italic>in vivo</italic>. We demonstrated that WARP and collagen VI exist in the same location in articular cartilage using immunohistochemistry and EM methodologies. Evidence for a more direct interaction was provided by solid phase binding assays and mixing experiments using purified preparations of the two molecules. Lastly, we employed a novel immuno-bead pull-down approach to show that WARP is bound to collagen VI networks isolated from cartilage.</p><p>However, unlike in peripheral nerve, collagen VI levels appeared unaffected by the loss of WARP in developing and adult articular and vertebral cartilage as assessed by immunohistochemistry <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These data suggest that, although WARP and collagen VI interact in cartilage as we have shown, WARP does not have a critical role in stabilizing collagen VI in this tissue <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The reason for the difference between nerve and cartilage is not known but may be related to the composition of collagen VI. The purified protein used in the interaction studies contain &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3 chains and the antibodies used in the immunohistochemistry and EM experiments recognize primarily the same chains. Now that it is known that six collagen VI chains exist <xref rid="pone.0052793-Gara1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052793-Fitzgerald2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, it is plausible that different collagen VI assemblies exist in different tissues or stages of development. For example, it is possible that the other collagen VI chains (&#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;6) chains form different types of collagen VI isoforms or assemble in different ways with &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3 chains to provide different functional properties and binding partners in cartilage compared to nerve. Experiments are currently underway to explore the hypothesis that collagen VI chain composition varies between tissues.</p><p>We have previously reported that WARP binds to perlecan and is an integrated component of the cartilage ECM <xref rid="pone.0052793-Allen2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052793-Melrose1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Perlecan has been shown to play a major role in the mechanical and biochemical properties of the cartilage PCM <xref rid="pone.0052793-Wilusz1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and, interestingly, has been shown to interact with collagen VI via its heparan sulfate domains <xref rid="pone.0052793-Tillet1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It is possible that WARP connects the collagen VI and perlecan networks. In support of this hypothesis is a triple labeling experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052793-g008">Fig. 8</xref>) showing that collagen VI (arrows), WARP (black arrowheads) and perlecan (white arrowheads) are part of the same extrafibrillar suprastructural complexes in human articular cartilage. We suggest that by interacting with perlecan and collagen VI, WARP may function as an adaptor to bridge the pericellular perlecan network with the underlying interstitial matrix via collagen VI. We speculate that different interactions between the three molecules may also allow the generation of suprastructural organizations that vary between tissues.</p><fig id="pone-0052793-g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0052793.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Analysis of collagen VI, WARP and perlecan in human articular cartilage.</title><p>Immuno-gold EM was conducted on native supramolecular fragments isolated from human articular cartilage for WARP (18-nm gold particles; black arrowheads), perlecan (12-nm gold particles; white arrowheads) and collagen VI (6-nm gold particles, arrows).
