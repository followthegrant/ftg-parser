Animated sitcoms often dissect sensitive social and political concerns using negative humor, exaggeration, and stereotyping. The present study aimed to explore the motives for viewing animated sitcoms using qualitative and quantitative research methods and investigate their associations with humor styles, positivity, and self-criticism in a sample of Hungarian viewers. A total of 816 Hungarian adults (54.5% female; <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>age</italic></sub> = 23.9 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.6) completed an online questionnaire focusing on animated sitcom viewing habits and other relevant psychological constructs. As a result, three major motive dimensions were identified: (1) social criticism, (2) fun and entertainment, and (3) relaxation. These motives were assessed by the Motives for Animated Sitcom Viewing Questionnaire (MASVQ), which demonstrated strong psychometric properties. Using a MIMIC model, multiple associations were described across motives and other psychological constructs, indicating that individuals with different levels of humor, positivity, and self-criticism are motivated to view animated sitcoms for different reasons in this sample of Hungarian viewers.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>ELTE Institutional Excellence Program supported by the Hungarian Ministry of Human Capacities</institution></funding-source><award-id>783-3/2018/ FEKUTSRAT</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office</institution></funding-source><award-id>KKP126835</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was completed in the ELTE Institutional Excellence Program (783-3/2018/ FEKUTSRAT) supported by the Hungarian Ministry of Human Capacities.

Due to the unexpected success of this genre, several animated sitcoms have been produced since the late 1980s such as <italic>The Simpsons</italic> (created by Matt Groening in 1989), <italic>South Park</italic> (created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone in 1997), and <italic>Family Guy</italic>(created by Seth McFarlane in 1998)[<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Animated sitcoms often discuss taboo or controversial social and political topics in a US context [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], using hints of social criticism, malicious humor, strategies of exaggeration, and hyper-stereotyping in an entertaining way [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Interest in such animated sitcoms soon expanded to an international context, resulting in that &#x0201c;the genre has achieved a prominent spot in contemporary Western popular culture&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, p. 3.]. Indeed, 75% of sales related to animated sitcoms were reported from non-US markets in 1999, shortly after <italic>South Park</italic> and <italic>Family Guy</italic> were first released in the US [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>It is particularly difficult to make estimations about the size of the global audience of animated sitcoms due to the wide variety of viewers across the episodes [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. According to the reports by Nielsen Television Audience Measurement, <italic>Family Guy</italic> has attracted 6 millions of viewers a night, while <italic>The Simpsons</italic> gathered 4.1 million viewers, followed by <italic>American Dad</italic> with 4.6 million viewers, and <italic>The Cleveland Show</italic> with 2.6 million total viewers in 2011 among American young adults aged between 18 and 49 years [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In 2019, <italic>Family Guy</italic> still attracts 2&#x02013;3 million viewers among 18&#x02013;49 years old television viewers [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], while <italic>South Park</italic> draws 1.4 million viewers in America [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In Hungary, several popular animated sitcoms (e.g., <italic>Family Guy</italic>, <italic>The Cleveland Show</italic>) have been broadcasted since the late 2000s, and attracted considerable interest shortly after their first release in Hungary [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Indeed, three years later, <italic>Family Guy</italic>, <italic>Drawn Together</italic>, and <italic>The Cleveland Show</italic> were ranked at number four to six in &#x0201c;The 20 Most Popular Comedy Central Shows&#x0201d; in Hungary, while <italic>South Park</italic> was ranked at number 13 [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite this popularity, there is a lack of empirical research on the motives for viewing animated sitcoms. This study endeavors to fill this gap by applying both qualitative and quantitative research methods to investigate the motives of animated sitcom viewing in a sample of Hungarian animated sitcom viewers.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Motives</title><p>Early studies in media research explored motives for viewing television [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Rubin [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] identified seven major motives: relaxation, companionship, habit, pass time, entertainment, social interaction, information, arousal, and escape. Almost two decades later, Weaver [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] examined the personality correlates of motives, and found that individuals scoring high on the neuroticism personality dimension exhibited higher motives in four aspects: pass time, companionship, relaxation, and stimulation. Potts, Dedmon and Halford [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] investigated the strength of motives, and found that the strongest motives in television viewers were entertainment, relaxation, information, and passing the time, while social [e.g., conversation topics] and escapism motives [e.g., to get away from people] were weaker motives. Besides general television motives, Gantz [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] investigated motives for viewing television sports, while another study by Perse [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] focused on local television news. The motive of passing time was identified in both studies as a major motive to view such television shows [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the motive of entertainment was identified in relation to local television news [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] alongside some specific motives [e.g., utility].</p><p>Recent motivation research in the field of popular culture has investigated the motives relating to the use of Facebook [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Tinder [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], Pok&#x000e9;mon Go [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and online games [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], for instance. The motives explored in these studies reflect some general motives identified in earlier studies with regard to television viewing (e.g., entertainment, pass time, social motives), while some specific motives were also identified (e.g., nostalgia in relation to Pok&#x000e9;mon Go use)[<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Alhabash and Ma [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] identified entertainment as the strongest motive for using Facebook, followed by information sharing, medium appeal, and escapism. Demetrovics et al. [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] identified recreation and social motives as the strongest motives for playing online games, while escape was a weaker motive. The motive of alleviating boredom was identified as a major motive in relation to Pok&#x000e9;mon Go [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Tinder use [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which is similar to the motive of passing time in earlier studies on general television viewing motives [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This pattern suggests that the appreciation of some popular media products share some similarities with the enthusiasm towards general media content alongside specific motives, and the exploration of these motives can contribute to a better understanding of the preferences of different audiences.</p><p>The aim of this study is to contribute to the growing body of literature on motives relating to various aspects of popular culture, and identify beneficial and adverse motives in terms of psychological well-being by investigating the association of animated sitcom viewing motives with relevant psychological constructs such as humor styles, positivity, and self-criticism. The exploration of motives can provide producers and creators of such animations with a more nuanced picture of thematic and psychological aspects of a cartoon targeted at an adult audience that can attract more viewers. Indeed, the identification of main motives and individual preferences based on gender, age, and other psychological characteristics can help creators to integrate such components into their products that can allow for a more targeted effort to draw viewers&#x02019; interest towards these animations and maintain this attention in the long run. Furthermore, the exploration of motives can provide scholars with a more nuanced understanding of motive patterns underlying viewer interest in this specific media content.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Humor styles</title><p>Provided that humor is a central element of animated sitcoms [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], humor style can be considered as an important psychological construct in the exploration of associations with animated sitcom viewing motives.</p><p>Previous research has provided evidence that psychological well-being is related to certain humor styles [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Martin et al. [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] identified four humor styles: affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating humor. Affiliative humor is a benign form of humor that facilitates social relationships, whereas self-enhancing humor refers to the ability to maintain a humorous outlook on life, even in stressful situations. Aggressive humor is a hostile form of humor, involving the use of sarcasm, teasing, and ridicule. Self-defeating humor refers to self-disparaging humor, which is used at the expense of the self [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. According to previous studies, affiliative and self-enhancing humor styles can be considered as adaptive forms of humor, while aggressive and self-defeating humor are maladaptive styles [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, affiliative and self-enhancing humor have been associated with increased psychological well-being [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and higher positivity (i.e., dispositional optimism, hope, and happiness)[<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. By contrast, aggressive humor was associated with greater hostility and aggression [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and self-defeating humor was related to lower levels of psychological well-being [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Martin et al. [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] found significant gender differences in humor styles, reporting an increased use of all four humor styles among males, particularly in aggressive and self-defeating humor. Furthermore, younger individuals were more likely to use affiliative and aggressive humor compared to older individuals [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Barbato, Graham and Perse [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] investigated the function of humor in social interactions among elders, and found that positive and expressive humor were used to express pleasure, affection, comfort, and the motive of escape, while negative humor served to gain control, seek comfort, and escape. These findings suggest that positive humor styles are used to express positive emotions, while negative humor styles may be used to alleviate frustration and negative feelings.</p><p>Although there are only a few empirical studies applying content analysis to explore humor styles represented in animated sitcoms, it is commonly known that some forms of negative humor [e.g., sarcasm and disparagement humor] are main components of such animations [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, Eisenberg et al. [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] explored incidents of weight stigmatization in popular adolescent television programming (e.g., <italic>Family Guy</italic>, <italic>The Simpsons</italic>), and found that half of the analyzed episodes contained at least one incident of offensive weight stigmatization. In a similar vein, Pehlke et al. [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported that father figures are often portrayed as targets of malicious jokes in non-animated television sitcoms. Scharrer [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] found that this tendency had increased between 1950 and 1990 in family-oriented sitcoms. In relation to general humor, Weiss and Wilson [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] analyzed the five most popular prime-time family sitcoms in 1992, and found that humor was more often associated with situations that evoke negative emotions than positive emotions in the plot (e.g., angry or frightened characters were often targets of malicious humor). With regard to animated sitcoms, a recent study by Juckel, Bellman and Varan [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] analyzed humor categories and techniques in non-animated sitcoms (i.e., <italic>The Big Bang Theory</italic>, <italic>Modern Family</italic>, <italic>The Office</italic>) and in an animated sitcom (i.e., <italic>Family Guy</italic>). It was found that <italic>Family Guy</italic> used more derisive and offensive humor techniques such as parody, absurdity, and repulsive behavior compared to non-animated sitcoms. Besides, <italic>Family Guy</italic> derived humor mostly from situations discussing moral and social standards according to the findings, while non-animated sitcoms contained frequent hints of malicious and character-based humor. Juckel, Bellman and Varan [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] suggested that the genre characteristics of animated sitcoms allow for the explicit portrayal of superiority without the limitation of considering real consequences, and the portrayal of superiority is often accompanied by negative humor. Therefore, it is possible that viewers using maladaptive humor forms are more motivated to view animated sitcoms.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Positivity</title><p>Studies investigating the association of humor styles with psychological well-being concluded that humor measures had a stronger association with assessment instruments relating to positive psychology constructs compared to measures of mental health concerns (see 22 for a review). Therefore, the present study investigates the association of motives for animated sitcom viewing with positivity to gain more insight into the relationship between motives and psychological well-being. Positivity can be defined as a tendency to view life with a generally positive outlook [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

To attain these goals, two aims have been formulated: 1) to explore motives for animated sitcom viewing in a sample of Hungarian viewers, using qualitative and quantitative research methods, and construct an assessment instrument that assesses these motives, 2) to investigate the association of motives with relevant psychological constructs such as humor styles, positivity, and self-criticism. With regard to the sample characteristics, it should be noted that the present study was conducted on a sample of Hungarian adult viewers who must have been dedicated fans of this genre, considering their active membership in various discussion forums for cartoons. Their critical expertise on animated sitcoms may result in some biases in the perception of humor, aggression, or positivity with regard to these cartoons or themselves, which should be taken into account when considering the present findings. It should also be noted that this sample of Hungarian adult viewers is not representative of the general audience of television viewers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was carried out with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of ELTE E&#x000f6;tv&#x000f6;s Lor&#x000e1;nd University and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Participants were recruited from the same four Hungarian online communities devoted to cartoons (having more than 2,000 members) as for the subsequent quantitative data collection. Survey participation was voluntary. Using an online questionnaire, participants over 18 years of age were invited to complete the following sentence: &#x0201c;I view animated sitcoms because&#x02026;&#x0201d; A total of 191 responses were recorded, of which 186 were considered for further analysis (the content of five responses were not related to motives). Subsequently, three expert raters with former experience in motivation research and qualitative data analysis independently categorized participants&#x02019; responses. In the case of three responses, consensus was achieved after raters were allowed to discuss the categorization of the respective responses. As a result of the content analysis, 104 responses (55.9%) were categorized into four major motive dimensions: Social Criticism (<italic>n</italic> = 43; 23.1%), Fun (<italic>n</italic> = 33; 17.8%), Entertainment (<italic>n</italic> = 14; 7.5%), and Relaxation (<italic>n</italic> = 14; 7.5%).

These associations were again weak.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec023"><title>Definition and assessment of motives for animated sitcom viewing</title><p>According to the present qualitative investigation, four major higher motives were identified such as Social Criticism, Fun, Entertainment, and Relaxation; however, as a result of a series of factor analyses, motive factors were reduced to three dimensions such as Social Criticism, Fun and Entertainment, and Relaxation. Social criticism refers to the motive of viewing media content that breaks social taboos and ridicule people in society. Fun and Entertainment refers to the motive of viewing animated sitcoms for the jokes, laughs, and the amusement that can be derived from this kind of animation. Finally, relaxation refers to the motive of spending time to rest while watching animation. These motives were considered as a basis for the construction of the Motives for Animated Sitcom Viewing Questionnaire (MASVQ). The MASVQ yielded strong psychometric properties in terms of factor structure and internal consistency. Therefore, the MASVQ can be considered as an appropriate assessment tool to measure motives for animated sitcom viewing.</p><p>The motive of Fun and Entertainment and Relaxation share considerable similarities with the motive factors of Entertainment and Relaxation reported in early studies that investigated motives for general television viewing [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, entertainment was also identified as a main motive for viewing local television news [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and using Facebook [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This pattern reflects that the majority of motives relating to animated sitcom viewing share common features with those identified in previous studies in relation to general television viewing. In addition, one specific motive was described (i.e., Social criticism) that has not been identified in previous research, suggesting that the portrayal of social criticism in animation is a specific aspect of this media genre that appeals to a broad audience.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>The association of motives with humor styles, positivity, and self-criticism</title><p>The associations of motives with relevant psychological constructs were also explored in this study. Provided that substantial gender and age effects have been reported in previous studies concerning humor styles, positivity, and self-criticism [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and considering the fact that these personal dispositions are associated constructs [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], a multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) model was applied which allowed for the estimation of the effect of indicators on latent constructs while controlling for all other variables included in the model.</p><p>With regard to demographic characteristics, males were more likely to view animated sitcoms for fun and entertainment than females. This result is in line with previous findings indicating that males have a higher tendency to engage in all forms of humor compared to females [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In turn, no association could be found between motives and age. This result suggests that both younger and older viewers can be motivated to seek media content that criticizes people in society, derive amusement from such animation, and have a pleasant rest while watching it.</p><p>In relation to humor styles, affiliative humor was positively associated with the motive of fun and entertainment, which suggest that viewers with an increased use of affiliative humor may benefit more from the amusement that can be derived from this media content since these viewers tend to share their experience with humorous situations, which in turn can enhance interpersonal relationships. This process can possibly contribute to the formation of fan communities dedicated to enthusiasts of animated sitcoms.</p><p>Self-enhancing humor was related to all three motive dimensions, which suggests that viewers with an increased use of self-enhancing humor may be more motivated to view animated sitcoms in general. Animated sitcoms that portray the incongruities and absurdities of life in a humorous form may facilitate the maintenance of a general positive outlook on life even in times of stress. Besides, Weiss and Wilson [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] suggested that negative humor in sitcoms can possibly enhance adaptive coping with negative life events in young individuals, since they learn how to use humor in such situations instead of using maladaptive coping strategies or emotional reactions (e.g., escape, feeling embarrassed or frightened). It is possible that animated sitcoms also encourage viewers to use humor in negative emotional situations.</p><p>By contrast, aggressive humor was related to the motives of fun and entertainment and social criticism but unrelated to the motive of relaxation. This result suggests that viewers with a tendency to engage in aggressive humor are more likely to become attracted to animated sitcoms for the criticism and the amusement that can be derived from its humorous portrayal. This result is in line with previous studies suggesting that viewers who appreciate negative humor are more likely to have a preference for television shows that portray stigmatization, offensive behavior, and superiority using malicious hints of humor [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230474.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Self-defeating humor was not associated with motives, which indicates that individuals with a tendency to use self-defeating humor are not motivated to view animated sitcoms for relaxation, fun and entertainment, or the portrayal of social criticism. In connection with this result, it was found that individuals with a higher level of self-criticism were more motivated to view animated sitcoms for all these reasons than individuals with a generally lower level of self-criticism. One possible explanation for this result may be that individuals with a high level of self-criticism consciously avoid using self-defeating humor in order to maintain their self-esteem; therefore, individuals with this humor style are not motivated to view animations that entertain viewers by using strategies of malicious humor and criticism. However, results also indicate that those with higher levels of self-criticism appreciate the humorous portrayal of social criticism in animated sitcoms. This result is in line with the findings reported by Frewen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], who considered perfectionism and self-criticism as closely associated constructs in their investigation, suggesting that highly self-critical individuals may also be critical of others.</p><p>Positivity was only weakly associated with two motives: social criticism and relaxation, while the motive of fun and entertainment failed to reach the level of significance. This result indicates that individuals with a generally positive outlook on life are slightly more motivated to view animated sitcoms in general than individuals with a less positive outlook on life. It is possible that the irrationalities of life portrayed in animated sitcoms facilitate the maintenance of a positive perspective in viewers with high levels of happiness, optimism, and life satisfaction. Besides, it is also possible that the absurdities of life portrayed in animated sitcoms encourage viewers to use humor in negative or challenging real-life situations to alleviate negative feelings associated with the situation, as was suggested by Weiss and Wilson [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations that need to be discussed. First, the present findings may not be generalizable to the whole population of Hungarian animated sitcom viewers due to the convenience sampling method. In addition, the present investigation exclusively focused on Hungarian viewers, which limits the generalizability of the findings to viewers of other cultures. Future research should extend this investigation to a broader audience in order to gain a more nuanced picture of viewer motives. For instance, some social and political concerns dissected in animated sitcoms are relevant in a US context; therefore, animated sitcoms may have a different meaning for American and non-American viewers, which can possibly be reflected in a different motivational background. Second, only the most frequently reported motives were considered as a basis of the assessment of motives in the present study which allowed for the construction of a separate motive factor. However, some relevant motives may be ignored in the quantitative data analysis due to the lack of information provided by respondents in the qualitative survey. Future research should investigate these motives in more depth. Third, this study used a cross-sectional research design, which limits the possibility of drawing clear conclusions about the direction of associations. Further research is needed to develop a more nuanced understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying the associations of animated sitcom viewing motives with humor styles, positivity, and self-criticism. Finally, this study relied on self-report measures; therefore, various biases may affect the results (e.g., social desirability, inaccurate memory). Future research should also investigate the associations of motives with other psychological constructs (e.g., personality traits, social relationships) in order to clarify which animated sitcom viewing motives can be considered as adaptive and maladaptive motives in terms of psychological well-being. Results of the present study pointed out the complexity of these motives, preventing a clear classification of positive and negative motive dimensions. Future research should also investigate possible similarities and differences between animated and non-animated sitcoms with regard to viewer motives. The present study exclusively focused on the motives for viewing animated sitcoms; therefore, the results are not generalizable to non-animated sitcoms. A recent study by Juckel, Bellman and Varan [<xref rid="pone.0230474.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] has pointed out some important differences between animated and non-animated sitcoms in humor techniques. Drawing on this finding, it is possible that there are major differences in viewer motives for animated and non-animated sitcoms, considering that some specific humor techniques portrayed in sitcoms may appeal to viewers with certain personality characteristics, preferences, and motivational background.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite the limitations, the present investigation has some implications. This study was among the first to investigate animated sitcom viewing motives employing both qualitative and quantitative research methods, using a sample of Hungarian adults. As a result, three major motives were identified (i.e., Social Criticism, Fun and Entertainment, and Relaxation), which can be assessed by the Motives for Animated Sitcom Viewing Questionnaire (MASVQ). The MASVQ demonstrated strong psychometric properties in this study. According to the results, it can also be concluded that individuals with different humor styles and different levels of positivity and self-criticism are motivated to view animated sitcoms for different reasons in this sample of Hungarian adults. A cross-cultural research would allow for the identification of general and culture-specific motives, and extend knowledge on the psychological characteristics associated with animated sitcom viewing motives.</p><p>Overall, the findings reported in this study may provide creators of animated sitcoms with a more detailed picture of the content and psychological characteristics of a cartoon that can attract considerable viewer interest among adults. These findings may also allow producers to create more targeted content to maintain viewers&#x02019; interest in their animations in the long run. Finally, these results point out some elements (e.g., fun and entertainment) of animated sitcoms that appeal more strongly to some specific audiences (e.g., male viewers) than other aspects. The incorporation of such elements into the content of animated sitcoms targeted at specific audiences may increase the efficacy of efforts invested in enhancing viewer interest and dedication. In addition, these findings could possibly provide scholars with a more nuanced picture of motives underlying viewer interest in this specific media content, and offer more insight into some relevant motives for future research that aims to clarify the similarities and differences between motives for viewing animated and non-animated situation comedies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0230474.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Estimated bivariate correlations between motives for animated sitcom viewing and major demographics, humor styles, positivity, and self-criticism.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0230474.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0230474.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>. <chapter-title>"Smarter than the average art form" Animation in the television era</chapter-title> In: <name><surname>Stabile</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, editors. <source>Prime Time Animation: Television Animation and American Culture</source>. <publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Routledge</publisher-name>; <year>2003</year> p. <fpage>15</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>32</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0230474.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>. <source>Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Defined a Generation</source>. <publisher-loc>Cambridge</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Da Capo Press</publisher-name>; <year>2004</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0230474.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>CW</given-names></name>. <article-title>Gender and sexuality in animated television sitcom interaction</article-title>. <source>Discourse &#x00026; Communication</source>. <year>2013</year>;<volume>7</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>199</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>220</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0230474.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>. <chapter-title>Watching with the Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality</chapter-title>
