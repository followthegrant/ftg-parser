Preadolescence is the preferred time for circumcision; among adults, the popularity of seeking VMMC is low. From 2009 to 2014, only 21% of VMMC clients were men aged 25&#x02013;34 in Iringa, Njombe, and Tabora regions (16,252/76,813). In Iringa, men and women report that seeking VMMC is shameful for adult and married men.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> A demand-creation strategy developed in 2012 to increase adult VMMC uptake included revising behavior change materials and messages, establishing a peer promoter program, advocating with business and religious leaders in communities, and modifying services (eg, to allow adults to be served first). Between 2012 and 2013, these efforts led to only a 5% increase in VMMCs among men ages 20 and older. The government has identified a need to increase VMMC uptake by males aged 20&#x02013;34.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Financial incentives have been investigated across a variety of preventive health services including those related to sexually transmitted infections (STIs).<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Incentives were shown to increase VMMC service uptake in Kenya and testing for HIV and other STIs.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>The use of lotteries is a promising strategy to increase the motivation of beneficiaries to use health services.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Lotteries are believed to enhance targeting by introducing an element of risk, which appeals to risk-taking individuals, such as those at greater risk of acquiring HIV. Studies have found a tendency to overestimate the chance of winning a big prize even when the likelihood of winning is small, and a preference for a small chance at a large reward over the certainty of a small reward.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> To our knowledge, no studies have addressed the use of lotteries to increase the delivery of VMMC services.</p><p>The Government of Tanzania's VMMC services have been supported by Jhpiego since 2009 with funding from USAID through The President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Routine services at fixed facilities are supplemented by frequent outreach activities. From 2009 to 2012, the male circumcision prevalence rate among males aged 10&#x02013;34 increased from 29% to 60% in Iringa, from 29% to 49% in Njombe, and from 38% to 56% in Tabora.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In 2011&#x02013;12, HIV prevalence was 6.9%, 14.2%, and 4.5% in Iringa, Njombe, and Tabora regions, respectively.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In this study, lottery messages portrayed the adult man who received VMMC as a socially successful <italic>Bwana Mkubwa</italic> (&#x0201c;big man&#x0201d; in Swahili) to try to reduce stigma associated with seeking circumcision services in adulthood. In Tanzania, 61% of the population owns a mobile telephone.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The smartphone was selected as the incentive based on the idea that mobile phone ownership conveys social status, which is supported by research from Kenya.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The intervention, agreed upon with local stakeholders, drew on the Health Belief Model,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> in which barriers to action including stigma are believed to be overcome through motivational incentives.</p><p>This article describes the evaluation of the smartphone lottery and its effects on the volume of VMMC clients aged 20 years and above.

Some men wondered why the phone being given was not the older model phones that men know, such as the Nokia. Some felt the smartphone was too expensive and out of touch with the men's daily needs. One Iringa promoter explained, &#x0201c;<italic>The price of smartphone is around two hundred thousand [Tanzania shillings]. With that money, you can buy 3 bicycles. The bicycle is helpful for the people living in the villages. If in the villages there is no electricity, and you give someone a smartphone, how does it help him?</italic>&#x0201d; Others suggested that an incentive that all clients could receive would be preferable.</p><p>Money was most frequently recommended as an incentive for VMMC, and the amounts spontaneously suggested ranged from TSh 1000 to TSh 20,000 (approximately $0.54&#x02013;$10.81). Similarly, some suggested that all VMMC clients should receive transportation reimbursement, transportation to the facility, food to take home, or farming commodities. These items would help men provide for their families while they healed from the surgery. Some clients and peer educators said they believed that a free good-quality service was incentive enough. One Tabora client at an intervention site stated, &#x0201c;<italic>I do not believe that the phone is the thing which will attract people, the important thing is the service; if the service is good, people will still come.</italic>&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The Bwana Mkubwa study had mixed results, making the relative benefit of a smartphone raffle promotion, in the context of free, high-quality services, and other behavior change communication components, challenging to interpret. Fewer than anticipated smartphone raffles were held because no raffle entrants presented during some weeks.</p><p>The study found a 47% increase in VMMC clients aged 20 and older at intervention sites during the study period compared with the same period in the previous year, and an 8% increase at the matched control sites. However, these changes were not statistically significantly different. In focus groups, some participants liked the smartphone raffle, whereas others thought that all men should receive an incentive of a modest value more related to their work or transportation reimbursement.</p><p>Comparing the 2 time periods, the number of clients aged 30 or older increased 10%, and the share of clients aged 20 and older who tested HIV positive increased from 1.6% to 11.9%. These shifts likely reflect the maturity of the VMMC program in the regions, where most of the younger men have already been circumcised and male circumcision has become an important social norm even for those who are HIV positive.</p><p>The level of scale-up of services may explain the differences in uptake of VMMC among older men in Iringa compared with the total sample. Iringa was the first region to scale up VMMC in Tanzania, with robust acceptance of VMMC services. Routine monitoring data maintained by Jhpiego and the Ministry of Health show that circumcision coverage is now at nearly 100% among 10- to 19-year-olds in Iringa and is approaching similar coverage among 20- to 24-year-olds. In contrast, the Njombe region program has struggled to overcome reluctance of promotion of VMMC among religious leaders and rumors about the government's motives for providing free circumcision. In Tabora region, the VMMC program is newer and scale-up is only approximately 50% complete. The smartphone raffle, which was implemented in the Iringa program at an opportune moment, may have played a role in helping adult men move from intention to actively seeking services, whereas the other regions may not be ready for an intervention to increase uptake among late adopters.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study in which a raffle incentive was used to promote VMMC. Lotteries in other studies have had mixed results. A Lesotho study provided lottery tickets valued at either $50 or $100 to adults who tested negative for STIs; the higher payoff intervention group participants had a 21% decrease in HIV incidence over 2 years compared with the control group, which received no lottery, whereas no statistically significant decrease was found in the lower lottery group.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> A qualitative evaluation of a program in which a lottery was used to increase participation in workplace HIV testing found that the lottery helped to reduce stigma and engender a supportive social environment for HIV counseling and testing.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Iringa region, where the raffle seemed to increase VMMCs significantly, might have a more favorable social environment for VMMC seeking, greater desirability of smartphones, and/or a more favorable perception of the value of the smartphone in offsetting lost wages.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>A limitation of this study is that the rigorous evaluation of the smartphone raffle intervention was not preceded by formative research to determine acceptability of the planned intervention among the local population. An implementation period longer than 3 months would have yielded higher VMMC uptake and a higher sample size with possibly higher power to detect statistical differences.</p><p>At the project design stage, after looking at monthly VMMC volumes with data from February to June 2013, it was determined that 14 facilities would provide sufficient power given the study objectives and with the parameters and assumptions used. VMMC volumes from February to June 2013 were higher than those found during the study period (November 2014&#x02013;February 2014), possibly for 2 reasons. The period includes the farming season during which men are less able to miss work for the post-VMMC healing period and end-of-year holidays, in which men may not wish to be abstinent during the post-VMMC healing period. Another reason for lower VMMC volumes in 2014&#x02013;2015 may have been saturation, as many men in the community would have already been circumcised by 2014 and those attracted to VMMC would be late adopters.</p><p>Qualitative data were not collected from men in the community who did not seek VMMC or did not return for follow-up. However, the focus group discussions with peer promoters described interactions with men who refused VMMC services.</p><p>This study contributes to the growing evidence on how to promote and incentivize VMMC service uptake among adult males in regions of sub-Saharan African countries with high HIV burden. A smartphone raffle might increase VMMC uptake in some settings by helping late adopters move from intention to action; however, there is no recommendation for this intervention more generally.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no funding or conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bailey</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Moses</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>CB</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
