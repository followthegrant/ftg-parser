Hec1 contributes to chromosome segregation in part by mediating SAC signaling and chromosome alignment. However, the molecular mechanism by which Hec1 modulates checkpoint signaling and alignment remains poorly understood. We found that Hec1 serine 165 (S165) is preferentially phosphorylated at kinetochores. Phosphorylated Hec1 serine 165 (pS165) specifically localized to kinetochores of misaligned chromosomes, showing a spatiotemporal distribution characteristic of SAC molecules. Expressing an RNA interference (RNAi)-resistant S165A mutant in Hec1-depleted cells permitted normal progression to metaphase, but accelerated the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. The S165A cells were defective in Mad1 and Mad2 localization to kinetochores, regardless of attachment status. These cells often entered anaphase with lagging chromosomes and elicited increased segregation errors and cell death. In contrast, expressing S165E mutant in Hec1-depleted cells triggered defective chromosome alignment and severe mitotic arrest associated with increased Mad1/Mad2 signals at prometaphase kinetochores. A small portion of S165E cells eventually bypassed the SAC but showed severe segregation errors. Nek2 is the primary kinase responsible for kinetochore pS165, while PP1 phosphatase may dephosphorylate pS165 during SAC silencing. Taken together, these results suggest that modifications of Hec1 S165 serve as an important mechanism in modulating SAC signaling and chromosome alignment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Hec1 (also called Ndc80) is a conserved mitotic regulator dedicated to ensuring faithful chromosome segregation and genome integrity. Hec1 overexpression has been observed in a variety of human cancers, and was found to associate with adverse clinical outcomes of primary breast cancers and cases with multiple cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">van 't Veer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Glinsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). At the molecular level, Hec1 forms a dumbbell-like heterotetramer with Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25 to form the Ndc80 complex, which is part of the broad KMN network consisting of KNL-1, Mis12 complex, and Ndc80 complex at the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Cheeseman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Spc24 and Spc25 dimerize and face inward toward the centromere, while Hec1 and Nuf2 dimerize and their globular domains and N-terminal tails face outward. Hec1 has a microtubule-binding activity at its N-terminal region (aa 1&#x02013;196), which is negatively regulated by the mitotic kinase Aurora B for proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Cheeseman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Guimaraes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, substantial evidence indicated that Hec1 plays a positive role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) control. The SAC is a mechanism that ensures faithful chromosome segregation by monitoring the kinetochore-microtubule attachment. This checkpoint is highly conserved from yeast to higher eukaryotes; the basic units of the mammalian SAC machinery include several Mads (Mad1/Mad2), Bubs (Bub1/BubR1/Bub3), and Mps1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Musacchio and Hardwick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). Unattached kinetochores recruit SAC components through a poorly understood mechanism, thereby eliciting a positive SAC signal to inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome necessary for sister chromatid separation and exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">King <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Sudakin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). When cells are challenged with microtubule poisons to generate persistently unattached kinetochores, mitosis can be arrested for an average of 12 h in U2OS cells and 20 h in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Brito and Rieder, 2009</xref>). Active SAC signaling involves not only the above checkpoint effector molecules, but also structural components of the kinetochore and mitotic kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). For instance, the Ndc80 complexes are critical structural components of the kinetochore and are required for proper SAC control, as they recruit Mad1 and Mad2 to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Martin-Lluesma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">DeLuca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Buffin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Of disease relevance, overexpression of Hec1 in a transgenic mouse model caused high incidence of lung adenoma and hepatoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Diaz-Rodriguez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), which correlated with SAC hyperactivation in mitotic cells. These animal studies reinforced previous observations that Hec1 (and the intact Ndc80 complex) is important for proper SAC control to prevent cancer-initiating chromosome missegregation.</p><p>During SAC signaling, Hec1 relays the checkpoint signals to downstream SAC effectors (Mad1 and Mad2). However, the exact regulation centered on Hec1 by upstream regulators is poorly understood. Proper SAC signaling is known to entail the delicate interplay of upstream mitotic kinases and phosphatases, aberrancy of which may undermine the accuracy of SAC control. It is therefore imperative to elucidate how Hec1 can be modulated by upstream kinases and phosphatases during SAC signaling. We have previously found that Hec1 is phosphorylated at serine 165 (S165) by the cancer-associated kinase Nek2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). This phosphorylation site is conserved from yeast to human and is important for faithful chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Du <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In this study, we sought to examine how this phosphorylation can contribute to faithful segregation, with the primary focus on the control of the SAC in the context of chromosome alignment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>To explore SAC signaling mediated by Hec1 phosphorylation at S165, we first raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Hec1 phospho-serine 165 (pS165) using a peptide antigen distinct from our previous design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), in part because the previously used antibody is not suitable for immunofluorescence staining. For this study, the newly generated anti-pS165 antibody was affinity-purified and characterized. It recognized ectopically expressed wild-type (WT) Hec1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) but not the Hec1 S165A mutant (serine changed to alanine) in a Western blot assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that this antibody is specific to pS165. Consistently, the pS165 level was found to be much higher in cells enriched in mitotic phase than those at the G1/S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming the previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Generation of phospho-specific antibody recognizing Hec1 S165 phosphorylation during mitosis.

However, the details of steps in this process have yet to be explored. We examined the temporal and spatial distribution of pS165 in an immortalized noncancerous epithelial cell line, MCF10A. Notably, punctate pS165-staining signals were readily detected in mitotic cells, which colocalized with the kinetochore marker anti-centromere antibody (ACA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Kinetochore pS165 signals were not evident in interphase cells but became detectable at the G2/M transition and peaked at prophase and prometaphase, eventually diminishing at metaphase and disappearing at later mitotic stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), even though Hec1 is present at kinetochores during all stages of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). These kinetochore pS165 signals were abolished upon depletion of endogenous Hec1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). To ascertain that these punctate foci were endogenous pS165 signals, rather than nonspecific epitopes that can be masked by structural alteration of kinetochores upon Hec1 depletion, we complemented Hec1-depleted cells with an RNA interference (RNAi)-resistant WT Hec1 or the S165A (serine mutated to alanine) point mutant tagged with GFP. The WT Hec1, but not the S165A mutant, restored the kinetochore pS165 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Taken together, these results validated that the anti-pS165 antibody is specific to Hec1 S165, and revealed that the kinetochore Hec1 is phosphorylated at this residue during the early stages of mitosis.</p><p>It was noticed that pS165 also showed clear distribution to spindle poles, where staining was reduced but not completely abolished after treatment with Hec1 siRNA (unpublished data). This is probably due to enhanced stability of centrosomal pS165 species because Hec1 is present at centro&#x000ad;somes to interact with Hice1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), or nonspecific antibody cross-reactivity with a phospho-species at the centrosome.</p><p>Although pS165 signals were absent from kinetochores after metaphase, endogenous Hec1 persisted on these kinetochores (Supplemental Figure S1A). The same temporal and spatial distribution of pS165 signals was also observed in the kangaroo rat Ptk2 cells (Figure S1B). The pattern and timing of pS165 signals are reminiscent of SAC-signaling proteins. To test whether pS165 represents active SAC signaling, we costained U2OS mitotic cells with antibodies for pS165 and Mad2. We found that Mad2 colocalized with pS165 on kinetochores primarily at prophase and prometaphase, but not at metaphase or after onset of anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Further, because misaligned chromosomes often incur active SAC signaling, we examined the status of pS165 on misaligned chromosomes. The pS165 signals on kinetochores were preferentially retained on chromosomes that had not congressed to the middle plate but were absent from those that were already properly aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus the kinetochore pS165 signal is characteristic of a marker of active SAC signaling. To gain further evidence to support this notion, we then tested whether the kinetochore pS165 can be retained or generated on metaphase chromosomes that have been intentionally perturbed to increase chromosome misalignment by using the spindle poison nocodazole or Taxol. For this purpose, U2OS cells were transiently arrested at metaphase by a proteosome inhibitor, MG132, and then treated with vehicle control, Taxol, or nocodazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Nishino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Elowe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Control-treated cells exhibited positive Hec1 but negative pS165 signal at metaphase kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In comparison, nocodazole or Taxol treatment increased the kinetochore pS165 signal significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). It is noted that nocodazole treatment yielded kinetochore pS165 signals that were about twofold stronger than in the Taxol-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), probably because pS165 is more responsive to loss of kinetochore-microtubule attachment than loss of tension caused by Taxol. Taken together, these results demonstrated that kinetochore pS165 represents active SAC signaling.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><p>Phosphorylation of Hec1 S165 occurs specifically on kinetochores of misaligned chromosomes.

To explore this possibility, we expressed Hec1-GFP fusions (WT and S165A) as RNAi-resistant versions in U2OS cells via retroviral gene delivery. In the presence of endogenous Hec1, the integrated Hec1-GFP allowed fairly normal mitosis and cell proliferation for over 1 mo, suggesting minimal cytotoxicity. Importantly, the expression of Hec1-GFP did not alter the expression levels of SAC proteins compared with uninfected parental cells (Figure S2), nor did the expression of Hec1 WT versus S165A mutant when cells were treated with Hec1 siRNA (resultant cells are hereafter called WT cells and S165A cells in all figures, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The expression of Hec1 WT or S165A mutant alone did not significantly change the mitotic index of parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Knockdown of endogenous Hec1 alone increased the mitotic index to a level (31%) comparable to that of the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Martin-Lluesma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Notably, in Hec1 knockdown cells, expressing Hec1 WT or S165A mutant restored the mitotic index almost to the parental level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3:</label><caption><p>Expression of Hec1 S165A results in shortened mitotic duration and increased chromosomal segregation errors.

The initial time point was zeroed at nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) and the duration from NEB to anaphase onset was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The duration from NEB to anaphase onset averaged 57 &#x000b1; 3 min for WT cells (n = 23) but was shorter for S165A cells (42 &#x000b1; 2 min; n = 36; p &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). To determine whether the decrease in NEB-to-anaphase onset time was due to faster chromosome alignment or premature anaphase entry, we reexamined the time-lapse recordings to measure the duration from 1) NEB to metaphase and 2) metaphase to anaphase. The WT and S165A cells had a similar duration from NEB to metaphase, but S165A cells had a shorter metaphase-to-anaphase transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These observations suggested that S165A did not alter the duration of chromosome alignment, but promoted precocious anaphase entry, probably due to defective SAC.</p><p>To further examine SAC activity, we challenged cells with 50 ng/ml nocodazole to create unattached kinetochores, thereby enhancing SAC response. The mitotic indices were then calculated at indicated time points. Measurement of the kinetics of mitotic indices upon nocodazole treatment showed that both WT and S165A cells were initially delayed in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, the mitotic index of S165A cells peaked at only &#x0223c;41%, significantly lower than that of WT cells (&#x0223c;60%; p &#x0003c; 0.001). This result suggested a weakened SAC in the S165A cells. It is noteworthy that the reduction of mitotic index of WT and S165A cells after 20 h was not likely to be due to cell death; this became apparent only after 48 h. Because S165 is located in the CH domain of Hec1, our results supported the previous observation that the CH domain is involved in SAC control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Ciferri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that S165A indeed weakens the SAC, we assessed SAC activity using time-lapse microscopy of cells stressed with nocodazole treatment. Intriguingly, when cells were treated with nocodazole (20 or 100 ng/ml), the mitotic durations of WT and S165A cells differed more with a higher dosage of the drug. At the dosage of 20 ng/ml, the duration was 194 &#x000b1; 9 min for WT cells (n = 58) and 72 &#x000b1; 6 min for S165A cells (n = 44; p &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). At 100 ng/ml, the duration of WT cells (n = 18) was increased to 311 &#x000b1; 18 min, whereas that of S165A cells (n = 22) was only increased to 95 &#x000b1; 14 min (p &#x0003c; 0.001). These findings argued strongly for a weakened SAC in S165A cells. Notably, these S165A cells, similar to other cells defective in several known SAC molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Burds <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Kienitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), showed more frequent lagging chromosomes during anaphase than WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>), and consequently, higher incidences of micronuclei, multinuclei, and dead cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, I&#x02013;J</xref>). Taken together, the results highlighted a critical role of S165 for adequate SAC activity. The results also suggested that the shortening of mitotic duration in S165A cells was not attributable to more rapid chromosome movement.</p><p>The SAC machinery is composed of multiple effectors that are specifically recruited to unattached kinetochores to relay an inhibitory signal to delay anaphase onset. Thus it is likely that the phosphorylation at Hec1 S165 may affect SAC effector molecules. To test this possibility, we performed immunofluorescence staining using a set of antibodies specific for key SAC molecules (including Mad1, Mad2, ZW10, Zwint-1, and BubR1). We quantified the intensity of SAC proteins at the prometaphase kinetochores against that of ACA. Importantly, Mad1 and Mad2 were reduced by 65 and 50%, respectively, in S165A cells compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). The reduction of Mad1 and Mad2 was not a result of decreased protein level, since the expression of all SAC components was unaltered by S165A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, the kinetochore Mad1/Mad2 signals were properly retained on misaligned metaphase chromosomes in WT cells, but were significantly diminished in S165A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, G and H</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of S165 is important for Mad1/Mad2 localization at kinetochores for active SAC signaling. However, how S165 phosphorylation triggers Mad1/Mad2 recruitment to the kinetochore is unclear. Others and we have not been able to demonstrate direct binding between Mad1 (or Mad2) and Hec1, and thus we believe that the Mad1/Mad2 recruitment to kinetochores probably requires additional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Martin-Lluesma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4:</label><caption><p>Expression of Hec1 S165A impairs recruitment of Mad1 and Mad2 to kinetochores.

We reasoned that pS165 has to be removed to allow timely anaphase entry; failure to remove pS165 would lead to robust SAC signaling. To test this idea, we generated an RNAi-resistant and phosphomimic Hec1 S165E (S165 changed to glutamate) retrovirus. As for S165A, retroviral expression of S165E mutant did not alter the level of SAC proteins compared with WT, nor did protein levels change following depletion of endogenous Hec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Intriguingly, the expression of S165E alone in U2OS cells caused a threefold increase of mitotic index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) and prometaphase enrichment (&#x0223c;70% of mitotic cells) after 48 h of expression, indicative of a dominant negative effect to trigger SAC activation. When cells were concomitantly depleted of endogenous Hec1 (resultant cells are hereafter called S165E cells), the mitotic index increased further (sevenfold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). To further dissect the mitotic phenotypes of S165E cells, we performed time-lapse imaging of individual live cells in the absence of spindle poisons. Live-cell imaging demonstrated that S165E cells depleted of endogenous Hec1 were dramatically delayed at prometaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).

When the S165E cells were challenged with nocodazole (50 ng/ml), the mitotic indices were significantly higher than those of WT cells at early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), but the differences were negligible at later time points (12 h or later; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5:</label><caption><p>Expression of Hec1 S165E prolongs mitotic duration, increases segregation errors, and causes cell death.

Consistent with this notion, none of the S165E cells (0 of 2000 fixed mitotic cells) could form a distinct metaphase plate. A few did bypass the SAC (47 of 2000), of which over one-half (28 of 47) showed anaphase lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>), eventually leading to massive segregation errors indicated by high levels of micronuclei, multinuclei, and consequential cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). Apparently, the major defect of chromosome alignment caused by S165E has masked the direct effect of this mutant in SAC signaling. Nevertheless, the prometaphase S165E cells showed higher intensity of Mad2 and Mad1 kinetochore foci than the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>), indicating a robust SAC response. Taken together, these results suggested that the S165E mutant hampered chromosome alignment, which in part ignited a robust SAC signaling to prevent timely anaphase entry.</p><p>To address how S165E may mechanically affect the chromosome alignment, we tested whether it affects the k-fiber (kinetochore microtubules) stability using a cold-stability assay. We found that S165E cells had less cold-stable kinetochore microtubules than WT or S165A cells (Figure S3), suggesting that reduced k-fiber stability may account for the defect in chromosome alignment. It is possible that the S165E mutation may trigger a structural change more profound than phosphorylation and affect the microtubule-binding by Hec1, as suggested in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Lou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Nek2 is the mitotic kinase known to directly phosphorylate Hec1 at S165 for faithful chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Knockdown of Nek2 impairs Mad2 localization at kinetochores and negatively affects the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Lou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Therefore Nek2 is a candidate upstream kinase responsible for generating pS165 signals on kinetochores. In mammalian cells, Nek2 has two major isoforms (Nek2A and Nek2B). Nek2A is substantially degraded at prometaphase, whereas Nek2B is sustained throughout mitosis. Both isoforms, either one of which may be sufficient for generating pS165 signals, were associated with Hec1 in a coimmunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Consistently, Nek2 knockdown by siRNA significantly reduced the kinetochore pS165 signal (&#x0003e; 70% reduction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6, B and C</xref>). Furthermore, endogenous Nek2 was found to colocalize with the pS165 signal at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting possible on-site phosphorylation at kinetochores by Nek2. On the other hand, in budding yeast, the checkpoint kinase Mps1 was shown to phosphorylate Ndc80 (yeast Hec1), therefore affecting SAC activation; however, treating human cells with potent Mps1 inhibitors (MPS-IN-1) had no evident effect on kinetochore pS165 signals (Figure S4, A and B), arguing against the role of Mps1 in generation of pS165 in mammalian cells. Taken together, these results suggested that Nek2 may serve as a primary upstream kinase in generation of pS165 during SAC signaling.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6:</label><caption><p>Nek2 phosphorylates Hec1 on S165.

The pS165 signals diminished at metaphase kinetochores when chromosomes had achieved proper alignment, correlating with checkpoint silencing. The removal of pS165 was not attributed to Hec1 degradation, because endogenous Hec1 persisted on the pS165-negative kinetochores, such as those at anaphase or telophase (Figure S1A). Rather, a phosphatase is likely to be responsible for dephosphorylating pS165 during checkpoint silencing. Both PP1 (PP1a and -b) and PP2A are known to localize to the kinetochore, where they play important regulatory roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Gentry and Hallberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Trinkle-Mulcahy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). PP1 is required for silencing the SAC in yeast, but its exact downstream targets are not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Pinsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Vanoosthuyse and Hardwick, 2009</xref>). Initially, the pS165 signals were barely detectable unless the phosphatase inhibitor Microcystin-LR was added to the extraction buffer before fixation, which is a potent inhibitor for the serine/threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. To further determine whether PP1 or PP2A is responsible for dephosphorylating pS165, we tested two additional PP1 and PP2A inhibitors (okadaic acid and calyculin A) and one PP2A-specific inhibitor, fostriecin (10,000-fold selectivity for PP2A over PP1) during the prefixation extraction step in MCF10A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), U2OS, and Ptk2 cell lines (Figure S5, A and B). At 500 nM, all three PP1 and PP2A inhibitors (okadaic acid, Microcystin-LR, and calyculin A) were able to preserve kinetochore pS165 signals in all three cell lines; Microcystin-LR did so even at a much lower concentration (100 nM), while the PP2A-specific inhibitor fostriecin failed to preserve pS165 at either concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A</xref> and S5, A and B), suggesting that PP1 may be responsible for dephosphorylation of pS165. Consistently, a portion of cellular PP1 was found to associate with Hec1 in a coimmunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>); this association is perhaps mediated by KNL1 in the context of KMN networking, which directly interacts with PP1 via a defined motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, treating cells with the PP1 inhibitor (okadaic acid ), but not the PP2A inhibitor (fostriecin), resulted in a mitotic accumulation at the prophase and prometaphase stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7, C and D</xref>), reflective of active SAC signaling when PP1 was inactivated.

S165 appears to serve as an intricate molecular switch modulating the activity of the SAC. Lack of S165 phosphorylation weakens the SAC, in part by reducing the Mad1/Mad2 signals at kinetochores. During early mitotic stages, pS165 preferentially localizes to kinetochores on misaligned chromosomes, which often lack microtubule attachment. On successful chromosome alignment, pS165 is dephosphorylated to allow timely anaphase entry. The spatial and temporal distribution of pS165 is typical of a SAC marker such as the 3F3/2 phospho-epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Gorbsky and Ricketts, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Campbell and Gorbsky, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Wong and Fang, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The role of S165 in SAC signaling seems to be delicate, yet critically important for faithful chromosome segregation. It specifically fortifies the Mad2/Mad1 signals at the kinetochore. The results concur with and further deepen the previous understanding that Hec1 is required for proper Mad2 localization to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Martin-Lluesma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). How is this delicate control achieved at the molecular level? It has been shown that Mad2 preferentially recognizes phosphorylated kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Waters <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Yet evidence for direct interaction between Hec1 and Mad2 (or Mad1) is lacking. It is possible that S165, in response to signaling from upstream kinases, becomes phosphorylated as an integral part of an unspecified multicomponent module that recruits Mad1 and Mad2. This unspecified module presumably includes the checkpoint kinase Mps1, because it dictates the Mad2 signaling at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Tighe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Hewitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Kwiatkowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Sliedrecht <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), and requires Hec1 for its own kinetochore localization and early activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Saurin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Yeast Mps1 was shown to interact with the N-terminal region of Ndc80. It was therefore intriguing to test whether S165 may facilitate Mps1 localization and activation at the kinetochores during early mitosis of mammalian cells. On the other hand, Mps1 can directly phosphorylate Hec1 in a feedback manner, at least in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Kemmler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Using potent Mps1 inhibitors, we have shown that S165 is not the target site for mammalian Mps1 (Figure S4). Another possible scenario is that phosphorylation of S165 is an early SAC activation step that precedes and potentiates the Mps1-mediated phosphorylation on other residues, which together with pS165 allow full activation of the Hec1-Mps1-Mad2 signaling cascade.</p><p>Hec1 is becoming increasingly prominent as a potential link between microtubule binding and checkpoint control. The N-terminal tail of Hec1 is a major part of the KMN network that constitutes several sites for microtubule attachment. Aurora B is the critical kinase that phosphorylates this N-terminal tail to release faulty attachments and ensures proper chromosome biorientation and alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Cheeseman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">DeLuca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>); Aurora B has also recently been shown to act together with Hec1 to ensure early SAC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Saurin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Because S165 is physically close to the N-terminal tail, it may conveniently convey the status of microtubule attachment to downstream SAC effectors. Our unpublished data suggested that Aurora B affects the status of pS165 and Nek2, thus providing initial evidence pointing toward a possible Aurora B-Nek2-Hec1 signaling branch of the SAC. Meanwhile, possibly due to the close proximity of S165 to the N-terminal tail, the serine to glutamate change (S165E) seemed to cause significant effects both in chromosome alignment and SAC signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In this regard, it is noted that S165 is within the microtubule-binding &#x0201c;toe&#x0201d; of the Hec1 CH domain and is close to a few key residues, including K166 (Alushin <italic>et al.</italic>). Conceivably, phosphorylation of S165 may dislodge K166 from the microtubule lattice and hence be recognized as an indicator of detachment or a signal of SAC activation.</p><p>Our study suggests that Nek2 and PP1 are the candidate antagonistic pair of enzymes for modifying S165 in a dynamically sequential manner. Nek2 is prominent for its roles in centrosome duplication and separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Hayward and Fry, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">O'Regan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The novel role of Nek2 in SAC signaling can be direct, because a portion of Nek2 is located at the kinetochore, as shown by this study and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Lou <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). The timing and mode of action by Nek2 must be carefully examined, since two Nek2 isoforms may function during mitosis, Nek2A and Nek2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Uto <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hames and Fry, 2002</xref>). Nek2A is degraded during mitosis, starting at prometaphase, in an APC-dependent manner, whereas Nek2B, a C-terminal splice variant of Nek2A, persists throughout mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Hames <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hames and Fry, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Hayes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). One relevant question is how the pS165 signal is maintained on the misaligned kinetochores at metaphase, during which Nek2A is presumably already down-regulated. Both Nek2A and Nek2B can be associated with Hec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus Nek2B or, less possibly, an unknown substitute kinase, may target S165 to sustain SAC signaling when Nek2A becomes substantially degraded. Of clinical relevance, the Nek2-Hec1 node of mitotic network has now been exploited as a promising target of cancer therapeutic inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The role of PP1 in SAC silencing is well documented, but its downstream targets are poorly understood. Using phosphatase inhibitors, we observed that PP1 may be responsible for the dephosphorylation of Hec1 pS165. Since a portion of cellular PP1 can be coimmunoprecipitated with Hec1, a close interaction between these two exists. PP1 directly binds KNL-1 via a conserved PP1-interacting motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) that, together with Hec1, is a part of the KMN network. Alternatively, PP1 has been shown to interact directly with Nek2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Helps <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), which binds to Hec1 directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In either situation, Hec1 is closely associated with PP1. Although direct evidence to support the enzyme&#x02013;substrate relationship between PP1 and Hec1 is currently unavailable, the circumstantial evidence described herein implicates PP1, but not PP2, as the enzyme that dephosphorylates pS165. Whether the dephosphorylation of pS165 of Hec1 is executed in the complex of KMN or Nek2/PP1 remains to be explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and RNAi</title><p>Human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37&#x000b0;C under 10% CO<sub>2</sub>.

All image files were converted to TIFF, and Illustrator CS3 (Adobe, San Jose, CA) was used to assemble the figures. For time-lapse studies, cells were grown in glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and imaged within an enclosed temperature-, humidity-, and CO<sub>2</sub>-controlled environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Measurement and quantification of kinetochore and microtubule intensities was done using ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>). For quantifying kinetochore intensities, a circular region with fixed diameter was centered over the kinetochore and intensities were measured for both the protein of interest and, unless otherwise stated, for ACA. ACA was used for normalization after subtraction of background intensity. Data from all quantifications are reported as the mean &#x000b1; SEM. Significance between groups of data was assessed by two-way analysis of variance or by unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> test using Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Results were considered significant when p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec>
