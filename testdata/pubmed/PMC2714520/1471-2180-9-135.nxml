This test has been used for more than 40 years in cholera surveillance and strain analysis in China. Understanding of the mechanisms of sorbitol metabolism of the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains may help to explore the genome and metabolism divergence in these strains.

We compared the protein expression profiles of the toxigenic strain N16961 and nontoxigenic strain JS32 cultured in sorbitol fermentation medium, by using fructose fermentation medium as the control. Seventy-three differential protein spots were found and further identified by MALDI-MS. The difference of product of fructose-specific IIA/FPR component gene and mannitol-1-P dehydrogenase, may be involved in the difference of sorbitol transportation and dehydrogenation in the sorbitol fast- and slow-fermenting strains. The difference of the relative transcription levels of pyruvate formate-lyase to pyruvate dehydrogenase between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains may be also responsible for the time and ability difference of formate production between these strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Multiple factors involved in different metabolism steps may affect the sorbitol fermentation in the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of <italic>V. cholerae </italic>El Tor.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>Vibrio cholerae </italic>is the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera. Out of the 200 serogroups of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, only two biotypes of serogroup O1 (classical and El Tor) and serogroup O139 cause severe diarrhea and epidemic cholera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], although not all strains in these two serogroups are pathogenic. Toxigenic and nontoxigenic <italic>V. cholerae </italic>strains are genetically diverse. The toxigenic strains form a genetically homogenous group, while nontoxigenic strains are heterogeneous and may have diverse origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The nontoxigenic strains, which are usually isolated from environmental sources such as sewage, oysters, and brackish water, do not carry cholera toxin (CT) and other major virulence genes necessary for human pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p><italic>V. cholerae </italic>is capable of metabolizing many types of carbohydrates. Previously, we found that not only is D-sorbitol metabolized by <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, but it is also fermented at different rates by the toxigenic and nontoxigenic El Tor strains. The toxigenic strains have a low sorbitol fermentation rate and are called slow-fermenting strains, whereas the nontoxigenic strains have a faster sorbitol fermentation rate and are called fast-fermenting strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The sorbitol fermentation test is included in the Phage-biotyping scheme, which consists of phage typing and biochemical typing and is developed in 1970s in China. This scheme is used to distinguish and type the El Tor strains which are pathogenic and are potential to cause epidemic or not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It is found that the O1 El Tor strains isolated from patients and environmental samples in epidemics are toxigenic and sorbitol slow-fermenting, whereas the strains isolated from environment in non-epidemic periods are nontoxigenic and fast-fermenting.</p><p>In some bacteria, D-sorbitol is transported into the cell via the sorbitol specific phosphotransferase system (PTS) or some non-sorbitol specific PTS, and then it is transformed from sorbitol-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and enters the fructose/mannitol metabolism pathway. All genes involved in the fructose/mannitol metabolism pathway in <italic>V. cholerae </italic>have been identified and annotated on the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], but the genes involved in sorbitol transportation and transformation are unknown <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/show_pathway?vch00051">http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/show_pathway?vch00051</ext-link>, though a previous study identified the differential proteins expressed in the presence or absence of sorbitol, based on which only the sorbitol induced proteins could be found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>An investigation into the mechanism behind the different fermentation rates in toxigenic versus nontoxigenic <italic>V. cholerae </italic>strains may help to further the understanding of their genetic and evolutionary differences. Here, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) to identify differences in metabolites and proteins involved in sorbitol fermentation between toxigenic (sorbitol slow-fermenting) and nontoxigenic (sorbitol fast-fermenting) <italic>V. cholerae </italic>El Tor strains. Proteomics is a useful high-throughout technique and has been used in <italic>V. cholerae </italic>to construct proteome reference map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], protein expression analysis in the different culture environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and in the human host environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Large genetic differences exist between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic <italic>V. cholerae </italic>based on the comparative genomic hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], accordingly protein components of these strains will be much more divergent. The direct comparison of protein profiles of the fast- and slow-fermenting strains cultured in sorbitol fermentation medium will lead the confusion and misunderstanding of the proteins associated with the mechanisms of fermentation difference. Fructose and sorbitol metabolisms share the same pathway after the fructose-6-phosphate step, and we found no differences in fructose fermentation rates between the sorbitol fast- and slow-fermenting strains, therefore in this study we used fructose as a control when comparing protein profiles, to exclude proteins constitutively involved in sugar metabolism. This approach allowed to identify differences in protein expression associated with sorbitol metabolism difference in the toxigenic and nontoxigenic <italic>V. cholerae </italic>strains. Differences of formate production, fructose-6-phosphate production and subsequent metabolism were found to be causative mechanisms in the sorbitol fermentation difference in the toxigenic and nontoxigenic <italic>V. cholerae </italic>strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial Strains</title><p>Two <italic>V. cholerae </italic>strains of serogroup O1 El Tor (N16961 and JS32) were used to compare protein expression profiles by 2-DE analysis.

Their different expression may suggest their roles in formate production in the sorbitol fast- and slow-fermenting strains. In addition, the haemolysin and hcp proteins, which are related to <italic>V. cholerae </italic>pathogenicity, were also abundant spots on the SN gel, showing higher expression levels in N16961.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Part view of four differential protein spots related to sorbitol transportation and acid metabolite production</bold>.

All of the sequences contained three predicted conserved domains: the fructose specific PTS EIIA component, the EIIA component of PTS, and the HPr protein. The sequences of the nine toxigenic strains were highly similar but differed from the nontoxigenic strains, while three of four nontoxigenic strains had identical sequences. A comparison of amino acid residues of the nontoxigenic and toxigenic strains revealed changes mainly localized at the spacer region between the latter two domains. Nearly all of these residues involved changes in the polarity or acid-alkalinity of the amino acid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Three of the four nontoxigenic strains (JS32, 79327 and V05-18) lacked a 15 nucleotide (nt) region (AGCTGTGGGAACGAT) from 861 to 875, and the p<italic>I</italic>s of their proteins changed from 5.88 to 5.75. This data was consistent with the appearance of the FIIA protein spots on the 2-DE gels. The nontoxigenic strain 60&#x02013;61 did not lack the 15 nt fragment, but amino acid mutations placed it in the farthest phylogenetic cluster from the other strains (data not shown).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>The conserved domains and homology analysis of VCA0518 encoding product of the toxigenic strain N16961, nontoxigenic strains JS32 and 60&#x02013;61</bold>.

We monitored transcription levels at four time points during the fermentation assay. The transcription levels of both VC1866 and VC2414 of JS32 were higher than those of N16961 in sorbitol fermentation medium at 4 hrs and reversed at 8 hrs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). When comparing the relative transcription levels of VC1866 to VC2414 of JS32 and N16961 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), we found that the relative transcription of VC1866 of JS32 was higher than of N16961 at all time points. JS32 transcription of VC1866 reached a peak five-fold increase at 6 hrs, whereas N16961 transcription was only increased two-fold.

To understand the mechanism of this difference in sorbitol fermentation rate, here we compared the expression of proteins involved in sorbitol fermentation in toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains. The proteome profiles of the cells cultured in sorbitol and fructose medium were very similar with few differential spots, indicating that the status of the cells in these two conditions was similar. Therefore, we could subtract the most commonly expressed constitutive proteins not related to sorbitol fermentation when comparing SN/FN and SJ/FJ. This approach identified two PTS proteins and two proteins involved in formate production.</p><p>In general, the specificity of sugar PTSs lies in their EIIA component, while the HPr protein and EI enzyme are encoded by independent genes and are commonly used by different sugar PTS systems. In the conservative domain analysis of the <italic>V. cholerae </italic>VCA0518 gene, we found that this EIIA component was larruping and it contained three conservative domains, two of which are not sugar-specific. The sequences of the three domains were almost completely identical for all tested strains, further demonstrating their highly conserved nature. We conjectured that the low specificity of the co-expressed HPr and EIIA domains endowed the VCA0518 gene product with a role in sorbitol utilization. Contrary to the conservation of the domains, the entire VCA0518 gene sequences of the 13 tested strains showed obvious differences between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains, with the variable amino acid residues located at the spacer region between the domains. These differences may impact the steric conformation and the regulation of this protein, and further impact the efficiency of sorbitol transportation. The regulation of transcription, which maybe also affects the expression of VCA0518 in the sorbitol fast-fermenting and slow-fermenting strains, should also be considered</p><p>MtlD catalyses the transformation of mannitol-1-P to fructose-6-P, the later enters the fructose metabolism pathway. Mannitol and sorbitol are very similar in molecular structure. In <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, sorbitol is transported by the mannitol PTS system and transformed by polyol dehydrogenase, which has a broad substrate spectrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In a previous study we confirmed the transcriptions of the N16961 VCA1046 gene in sorbitol and mannitol fermentation media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Here, our results indicate that two non-sorbitol specific PTSs are involved in the <italic>V. cholerae </italic>sorbitol utilization process. This may be similar to the uptake of L-sorbose in <italic>Lactobacillus casei </italic>where L-sorbose is mainly taken up via EII<sup>Sor </sup>and EII<sup>Man </sup>plays a secondary role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, MtlD is required for sorbitol assimilation in addition to the <italic>gut </italic>operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, both of these PTSs are located on chromosome II of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Several studies indicate that the two chromosomes of <italic>V. cholerae </italic>are heterologous and that chromosome II may be a megaplasmid captured by an ancestral <italic>V. cholerae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The ability to ferment sorbitol used to differentiate <italic>V. cholerae </italic>strains may provide clues as to both the origins and genetic variation of the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains.</p><p>The traditional sorbitol fermentation test is a phenotypic method using phenol red as the indicator. In our study, we showed that the observed differences in sorbitol fermentation rates were the result of changes in the production rate of formate in the fast-fermenting and slow-fermenting strains. The fact that the ratio of formate to acetic acid was not consistent between the two strains also indicated that, besides the differences early in the metabolic pathway (including the transportation and transformation of sorbitol), pyruvate catabolism could be different in sorbitol fermentation in the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains. Both pyruvate dehydrogenase and PFL can catalyze the transformation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, but they have different electron acceptors and outputs. Their activities affect the relative proportion of the end products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Pyruvate dehydrogenase produces CO<sub>2 </sub>in addition to acetyl-CoA, while formate is the product of PFL. In the proteomic and qRT-PCR analyses of this study, the respective expression and transcription levels of these two genes were significantly different in the fast-fermenting JS32 and slow-fermenting N16961. Consistent with this fact was that formate was produced earlier in JS32 than in N16961. In a previous study, we had confirmed that the sequences of VC1844 including the promoter region of the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains could be identical (data not shown). The differential transcription or metabolism of pyruvate was not at VC1844 gene level and there must be a regulation mechanism, which acts at the pyruvate point, differs between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains.</p><p>The most important difference between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains is the presence or absence of the cholera toxin gene <italic>ctxAB</italic>. When we deleted <italic>ctxAB </italic>from the toxigenic strains or complemented <italic>ctxAB </italic>via plasmid into the nontoxigenic strains, we did not observe the reversion of the sorbitol fermentation rate when comparing the mutants with the wild-type strains (data not shown). In the proteomic analysis, we identified two virulence-related proteins. Among them, hemolysin has a predominant role in lethality and confers <italic>V. cholerae </italic>the ability to prevent clearance and establish prolonged colonization without a requirement for cholera toxin or toxin-coregulated pili [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. <italic>V. cholerae </italic>Hcp protein is a 28-kDa secreted protein regulated coordinately with hemolysin. The expression of both proteins has been shown to promote expression of virulence determinants <italic>in vivo </italic>and increase LD50 in the infant mouse cholera model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Consistent with their co-regulation relationship, both hemolysin and hcp were more abundant in the N16961 sorbitol culture profiles, suggesting that sorbitol induction and metabolism may have relationship with the regulation of the expression of virulent elements in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We carried out a comparative analysis of the differences induced by sorbitol between toxigenic (sorbitol slow fermentation) and nontoxigenic (sorbitol fast fermentation) <italic>V. cholerae </italic>strains. Our results suggest that the differential expression of the FIIA protein and MtlD of mannitol PTS demonstrate changes in the transportation and metabolism of sorbitol, and that pyruvate dehydrogenase and PFL relate to the different production rate of the acid metabolites.
