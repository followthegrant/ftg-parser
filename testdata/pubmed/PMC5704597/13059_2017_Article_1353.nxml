Use of this type of evidence has become a routine part of assessment of novel variants identified through gene-focused projects or as a part of whole exome or genome annotation pipelines. In a clinical setting, predictions from <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms are included as one of the eight evidence criteria recommended for variant interpretation by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association of Molecular Pathologists (AMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The ACMG/AMP guideline for use of <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms specifically states: &#x0201c;If all of the <italic>in silico</italic> programs tested agree on the prediction, then this evidence can be counted as supporting. If <italic>in silico</italic> predictions disagree, however, then this evidence should not be used in classifying a variant.&#x0201d; For a given missense variant, predictions by numerous algorithms are publicly available, e.g. via dbNSFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] or Variant Effect Predictor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] from which a few algorithms are typically chosen for variant interpretation and are often used without additional calibration. Different testing laboratories use distinct combinations of <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms for variant interpretation and this can lead to discordant interpretations. For example, in a recent assessment of the ACMG/AMP guidelines by the Clinical Sequence Exploratory Research consortium (CSER), the frequency of use of <italic>in silico</italic> algorithm evidence for pathogenic and benign variant assertion were 39% and 18%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The CSER study noted that use of <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms were one major source of discordance among different clinical laboratories and that the ACMG/AMP guideline for <italic>in silico</italic> algorithm usage may be aided by further recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Missense variants constitute a major set of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in ClinVar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An improved recommendation for use of <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms is important for reducing the VUS burden in clinical medicine and increasing concordance of variant interpretation. Currently, there is little consensus among clinical labs on how many and which algorithms to use for missense variant interpretation. For example, a recent exome sequencing study classified variants in 180 medically relevant genes for hereditary cancer according to ACMG/AMP guidelines. The authors found that the VUS rate was higher when requiring full concordance vs majority agreement among the 13 <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms used in their pipeline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Other examples from the&#x000a0;literature demonstrate requiring full concordance among three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] to seven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] different algorithms for variant interpretation. However, to our knowledge, no analysis has been conducted to assess the applicability of the current ACMG/AMP guideline for <italic>in silico</italic> algorithm usage. Here, using predictions from 25 <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms for 14,819 clinically relevant missense variants in the ClinVar database, we highlight several limitations of implementing the ACMG/AMP guideline for <italic>in silico</italic> algorithm usage. We find highly variable degree of concordance among different combinations of algorithms with particularly low concordance of the predictions of variants reported in ClinVar as benign. Using the ClinVar dataset, we identify algorithms with higher predictive power whose performances are robust to variables such as disease mechanism, level of constraint, and mode of inheritance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Concordance among <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms</title><p id="Par6">To identify the extent of concordance among <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms for known pathogenic and benign variants, we obtained 14,819 missense variants from ClinVar for which the rationale for pathogenic or benign assertion has been provided by at least one submitter (one-star status in ClinVar), primarily clinical laboratories, and annotated these variants with scores and predictions from 25 algorithms using dbNSFP (v3.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or the respective authors&#x02019; websites. We generated a matrix of binary predictions (pathogenic or benign) for these variants with scores from the 18 algorithms, for which thresholds of pathogenicity were publicly available (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1, see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d;). We found that when using this large number of algorithms only 5.2% of the benign and 39.2% of pathogenic variants had concordant assertions across all algorithms&#x000a0;(Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Some algorithms did not produce a prediction for all 14,819 variants (indicated by white spaces in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To ensure that missing data did not introduce a bias in our results, we analyzed concordance with a smaller dataset of 8386 variants (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1), where there were no missing data. Similarly, we found that for the dataset without missing values only 3.2% of the benign and 41.5% of pathogenic variants had concordant assertions across all of them (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2, Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). We also obtained similar results when we restricted our analysis to benign and pathogenic variants in ClinVar that had identical assertions from at least two independent laboratories (two stars &#x02013; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1, Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1B), suggesting that errors in ClinVar assertions by a single submitter or missing data contributes little to the low level of concordance among algorithms.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Concordance among predictions of 18 algorithms for variants in ClinVar.

Our data suggest that while interpreting large number of variants, full concordance, as suggested by the ACMG/AMP guidelines, is less likely to be achieved even when using only two algorithms, particularly for benign variants, consistent with earlier observation of poor correlations among predictors by Thusberg et al.

</p><p id="Par8">To assess the level of concordance among the most commonly used algorithms, we reviewed algorithm use in the medical genetics literature between January 2011 and January 2017 (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d;). We found that Polyphen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and SIFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] are cited most frequently, followed by MutationTaster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], CADD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], PROVEAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Mutpred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and Condel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We did not detect any consistent pattern of combinations among these algorithms. In general, there was more frequent usage of some algorithms while others, especially the more recently developed algorithms, are used less frequently. Predictions from five commonly used algorithms (Polyphen, SIFT, CADD, PROVEAN and MutationTaster) resulted in higher concordance relative to all 18 algorithms, with 79% concordance for pathogenic variants and only 33% for benign variants (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) with no significant departure in concordance when using the dataset without missing data (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2).</p><p id="Par9">In addition to lack of full concordance in prediction, we also identified &#x0201c;false concordance&#x0201d; across algorithms as a potential problem for variant classification. We identified 773 of 7346 (10.5%) variants classified as benign in ClinVar, for which all five commonly used algorithms predicted the variant to be pathogenic and conversely 64 of 7473 (0.8%) pathogenic variants in ClinVar were predicted benign by all five algorithms. These numbers grow to 815 and 68 variants, respectively, when we included concordance among algorithms for variants with some missing predictions&#x000a0;(Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Evaluating only three commonly used algorithms (Polyphen, SIFT, and CADD) resulted in higher concordance for pathogenic (84%) and benign (46%) variants, however, coupled with an increase in false concordances (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). In fact, 22.5% (1653/7346) of benign ClinVar variants were assessed as pathogenic by&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50% of the 18 algorithms including 87 variants where the benign classification of the variant had been reviewed by a ClinVar recognized expert panel (three-star review status) suggesting that these variants are benign and not misclassified&#x000a0;in ClinVar (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). There were 57 benign variants spread among 42 genes, for which all 18 algorithms predicted the variant as pathogenic. In comparison, 5.2% (389/7473) of ClinVar pathogenic variants were deemed to be benign by&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50% of algorithms (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). It is possible that some of these variants may result in splicing defects that may not be captured by these 18 algorithms. However we note, for example, that the variant NP_000234.1:p.Val726Ala in the MEFV gene interpreted as pathogenic by four independent clinical laboratories was predicted to be tolerant by 16 of 18 algorithms. The ClinVar record for this variant&#x000a0;suggests a decrease in catalytic activity rather than a splicing defect as part of the reason why the clinical laboratories interpreted this variant as pathogenic. Conversely, the MSH2 variant, NP_000242.1:p.Glu198Gly, was classified as benign by an expert panel due to lack of an effect in functional assays including splicing but was predicted to be damaging by all 18 algorithms.</p><p id="Par10">Not surprisingly, we failed to identify any combinations of algorithms that resulted in false concordance of zero and true concordance of 100% among the 18 algorithms whose default predictions are publicly available. We generated all possible combinations of three (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;816), four (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3060), or five (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8568) algorithms and obtained their true and false concordance rates across the 14,819 variants. As before, there was a lower false concordance rate and a higher true concordance rate for pathogenic variants relative to the benign variants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Overall, the concordance among combinations was in the range of 83.4&#x02013;64.5% for two to five algorithms, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional data 2&#x02013;5, see Availability of data and materials section). We found that the best performing combinations of algorithms were different for benign and pathogenic variants (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S4, Additional data 2&#x02013;5, see Availability of data and materials section). For example, for benign variants the best performing combinations of three algorithms consisted of VEST3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], REVEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and MetaSVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] with a true concordance rate of 81.3% and a false concordance rate of 2.8%, whereas for pathogenic variants the same combination resulted in a 70% true concordance and a 5.4% false concordance. For pathogenic variants, the best performing trio combination consisted of MutationTaster, Mcap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and CADD (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4), with a fairly high false concordance for benign variants (18.2% and 25.8% false concordance, Additional data 3, see Availability of data and materials section). We obtained similar results for combinations of four or five algorithms (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4, Additional data 4 and 5, see Availability of data and materials section). Note that these best performing combinations are relevant only in the context of the particular dataset we used and may not be optimal across other designs (such as whole-genome analysis). In general, many different combinations performed better for pathogenic than benign variants (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Concordance among combinations of algorithms across all variants using publicly available thresholds.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Algorithms (n)</th><th>Algorithms</th><th>Overall true concordance (%)</th><th>Overall false concordance (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>REVEL, MetaSVM</td><td char="." align="char">83.4</td><td char="." align="char">7.8</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>VEST3, REVEL, MetaSVM*</td><td char="." align="char">75.6</td><td char="." align="char">4.1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Polyphen2, REVEL, MetaSVM, Eigen*</td><td char="." align="char">69.3</td><td char="." align="char">4.1</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Provean, Polyphen2, REVEL, MetaSVM, Eigen</td><td char="." align="char">64.5</td><td char="." align="char">3.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Asterisks indicate that there were combinations with higher concordance but they included MetaSVM and MetaLR (see text)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>

Additionally, we analyzed variants in genes that are primarily linked to diseases with dominant mode of inheritance. The latter dataset is likely a mixture of LOF and GOF variants.

For example, REVEL, a meta-predictor whose features include 13 out of the 25 algorithms that we analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] performed well in all nine datasets described above with high sensitivity and specificity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6 and Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2 and S3). It was possible that the variants we used to assess the performance of REVEL and other algorithms described here were also included in its training sets, which for REVEL included some of the ClinVar and HGMD variants available until October 2015. This type of circularity inflates the performance measures of some algorithms and is referred to as type I circularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To examine the possibility of type 1 circularity inflating the performance of algorithms that were trained on HGMD and ClinVar variants, we compared performance of all the algorithms in six additional datasets:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(A)</label><p id="Par20">ClinVar Oct 2015 to Dec2016: this dataset consists of ClinVar missense variants with one-star or more review status that were released between October 2015 and December 2016;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(B)</label><p id="Par21">ClinVar Sept 2016 to March 2017: this even more recent set of missense ClinVar variants with one star or&#x000a0;more and&#x000a0;absent in ClinVar data releases before September 2016. The A and B datasets consists of newer variants that are likely to be absent in the training sets of algorithms that were developed earlier.

</p><p id="Par25"> The resulting predictions of these datasets which removed variants used in training different algorithms did not demonstrate a major change in the rank order of the top five algorithms that exhibited an AUC&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.9 with REVEL performing the best in these datasets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). We next tested if the top performing algorithms suffered from type 2 circularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which has been described as a caveat introduced due to the reliance of an algorithm&#x02019;s performance on the distribution of pathogenic or benign variants in a protein. Thus, in a variant dataset where there are proteins with only pathogenic variants or only benign variants (unbalanced dataset) some algorithms tend to perform better than in a dataset that have equal number of pathogenic and benign variants per gene (perfectly balanced), even if this is not what is biologically present. To this end, we compared performance on an unbalanced dataset (Varibenchselected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]) and a balanced dataset which includes equal number of pathogenic and benign variants per protein in ClinVar (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>&#x0201d;). Consistent with earlier results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], we found that FATHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] is particularly sensitive to this type of circularity. In other words, there is a drop in performance of FATHMM in analysis of a dataset that is perfectly balanced (balanced dataset * in Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3). We also detected evidence for potential type 2 circularity for algorithms such as MetaSVM/LR and MCAP (balanced vs varibench for MetaSVM, MetaLR, and MCAP, bootstrap <italic>p</italic> value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001; Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S3). Thus, caution should be used in interpreting scores using algorithms such as FATHMM as the prediction efficacy is partly dependent on pathogenic and benign variant distributions in any given gene.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par26">The ACMG/AMP guideline for use of <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms in a clinical setting suggests full concordance among multiple algorithms for this type of evidence to be used in missense variant classification without further clarification of the number or choice of algorithms. As we have shown, such usage leads to discrepancies arising mainly because of the lack of specification of the guideline. Our review of the literature reveals that the metric for concordance is not consistent across different laboratories. While some studies have adhered to the ACMG/AMP guidelines for strict concordance, others have used a majority vote rule and the number of algorithms used by laboratories also varies widely. It has been reported that use of the strict ACMG criteria gave rise to a higher rate of VUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and increased discrepancies among laboratory classifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The lack of a standard guidance for incorporating <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms could potentially lead to increased VUS burden and inter-lab discrepancies. As discussed in the following section, we identified certain limitations of using the ACMG/AMP guideline for <italic>in silico</italic> evidence and provide suggestions that may help optimize this guideline (Box 1).</p><p id="Par27">In addition, based on review of abstracts in the medical literature, we find that frequently used algorithms are older and vary in performance. Our analyses identified several high-performance relatively newer algorithms which do not appear to have been incorporated into clinical laboratory pipelines such as REVEL, VEST3, etc. Many of these algorithms are ensemble predictors (e.g. REVEL, VEST3, MetaLR, MetaSVM, Condel, Mcap, Eigen, and CADD) incorporating many older algorithms as features. When tested across 1821 disease genes with variants in ClinVar, the performances of these algorithms are robust to technical artifacts, levels of constraint on genes, the underlying nature of variants, and Mendelian inheritance pattern. Moreover, we find that performance does not seem to be affected by restriction to definite pathogenic and benign categories. Thus, laboratories will potentially benefit from modifying pre-existing variant interpretation pipelines that currently use older algorithms.</p><p id="Par28">The ACMG/AMP guideline encourages use of multiple algorithms. However, as expected, we observed an increase in the discordant calls as more algorithms are used to infer variant pathogenicity thus hindering the use of <italic>in silico</italic> evidence. An alternative is to use metapredictors that in effect combine multiple individual predictors to generate a score. These metapredictors satisfy the concept underlying the multiple algorithm criteria. However, combining metapredictors with their constituent predictors for variant interpretation may not be ideal given the duplication of analyses.</p><p id="Par29">In general, we show, using author recommended thresholds for variant assertion, a substantial likelihood of discordance, particularly for benign variants. Many of the algorithms analyzed here were not necessarily designed for clinical classification purposes. They are often designed to predict whether a missense variant disrupts a protein domain, inferring that this is damaging to protein function, and were not intended to be a classifier of disease causality. However, as demonstrated in our review of the medical literature, clinical classification pipelines often use these damaging or deleterious predictions as a proxy for pathogenicity.</p><p id="Par30">We also found several algorithms exhibit a bias towards calling a variant pathogenic (Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5) leading to incorrect inferences that may lead to relatively higher concordance for pathogenic variants. Consistent with this, we identified more false concordance (in which multiple algorithms made concordant assertions that were opposite to what is reported in ClinVar) for benign variants than pathogenic variants. Although this could be a result of misclassification in ClinVar, we found that a ClinVar designated expert panel has interpreted some of these benign variants. These false concordances by <italic>in silico</italic> prediction are another important source of error for variant interpretation. The problem of false concordance both increases the VUS rate and highlights why it may be inappropriate to increase the ACMG/AMP evidence strength for computational algorithms from &#x0201c;supporting&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;strong&#x0201d; without some further calibration of thresholds for the genes under consideration. We independently identified combinations of algorithms that tend to be more concordant via a hierarchical clustering of the output scores of all algorithms. The clustering pattern suggested that it is probably best to make inferences separately for evolutionary conservation algorithms, e.g. GERP and for metapredictors. Combining them is likely to result in discordant calls.</p><p id="Par31">Our results analyzing variant data from a large number of disease genes are not designed to identify a single algorithm for use across all genes or for disease gene discovery. However, the data provided here suggests that high performing algorithms perform well across many different gene and mutation mechanism type. In addition, gene-specific algorithms or gene-specific calibration of algorithms using well-characterized sets of benign and pathogenic variants may perform better than the general approach described here.

In particular, our results identify poor concordance among algorithms, particularly for variants classified as benign by clinical laboratories.

We also identify a previously unreported source of error in variant interpretation where <italic>in silico</italic> predictions are opposite to the evidence provided by other sources (false concordance). Finally, we identify high-performing algorithm combinations, many of which are based on recently developed algorithms and metapredictors that perform well independent of the underlying disease mechanism.

We next generated all possible pairwise combinations of algorithms and determined the proportion of variants for which they agree with each other with a dataset with as well as without any missing values. Next, we also generated all possible combinations of algorithms with three, four, or five members and determined the concordance with ClinVar assertions for each of these pairs. We also determined the fraction of variants for which algorithms in each combination was concordant but the assertion was opposite to that designated in ClinVar. We refer to these instances as false concordances.
