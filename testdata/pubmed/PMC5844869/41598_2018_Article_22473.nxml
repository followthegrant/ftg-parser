Given the low sensitivity and the high cost of current genotyping methods we sought to develop fast, simple and inexpensive assays for PIK3CA H1047R and E545K mutation screening in clinical material. The methods we describe are based on a real-time PCR including a mutation specific primer combined with a non-productive oligonucleotide which inhibits wild-type amplification and a parallel internal control reaction. We demonstrate consistent detection of PIK3CA H1047R mutant DNA in genomic DNA extracted from frozen breast cancer biopsies, FFPE material or cancer cell lines with a detection sensitivity of approximately 5% mutant allele fraction and validate these results using both Sanger sequencing and deep next generation sequencing methods. The detection sensitivity for PIK3CA E545K mutation was approximately 10%. We propose these methods as simple, fast and inexpensive diagnostic tools to determine PIK3CA mutation status.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>PCR-based techniques</kwd><kwd>Cancer genetics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway is a key regulator of many essential cellular functions including survival, proliferation and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It is one of the most commonly altered signal transduction pathways in human cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and its aberrant activation also causes mosaic hyper-proliferative syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The activation of PI3K signalling observed in cancer and other pathologies appears to be a consequence of mutations in at least one component of the pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, including the PI3K catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA). The identified PIK3CA mutations are dominated by a small number of recurrent mutations located within two major hotspots: E542K and E545K in the helical domain (encoded within exon 9) and H1047R in the kinase domain (encoded within exon 20). These missense mutations each produce a constitutively active form of the PI3K protein that promotes enhanced downstream signalling contributing to cellular transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Somatic PIK3CA mutations are present in approximately 40% of all breast cancer tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> with a higher frequency in estrogen receptor (ER) positive subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Despite its potential predictive value, the prognostic and therapeutic implications of genetic alterations in the PI3K pathway still remain unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. PIK3CA mutations appear to be associated overall with a better clinical outcome mainly due to their correlation with ER expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> which is considered a good prognostic feature itself. However, activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene have also been proposed as indicative of a poor outcome for Trastuzumab-based therapies in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Subsets of patients with different PIK3CA mutations might present distinct outcomes or show differential sensitivity to a specific treatment given the distinct biochemical properties of these mutant enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In the COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database, PIK3CA H1047R and E545K represent the two most commonly identified PIK3CA mutations in human tumours, accounting for 55% and 24% respectively of all PIK3CA mutations detected in breast cancer and 38% and 27% respectively of PIK3CA mutations in all cancers. In laboratory experiments, activating PIK3CA point mutation has been presented as a strong driver of tumour development by inducing multipotency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and cell transformation in the mammary gland and being considered an early event in oncogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Several studies suggest that patients harbouring a PIK3CAmutation benefit from PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Conversely, PIK3CA mutation has been proposed as a negative predictive biomarker to anti-EGFR therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Consequently, addressing PIK3CA mutation status in cancer patients may provide a more accurate molecular diagnosis enabling tailored therapeutic approaches.</p><p id="Par5">Mutation status in tumours has been often assessed by Sanger DNA sequencing from tissue samples although this method is often limited by its poor sensitivity (~20%) for low abundance mutations. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled high throughput analysis of tumour DNA samples with greatly improved sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, due to the complexity and high cost of NGS techniques, their routine implementation into widespread clinical practice seems some way off, particularly in healthcare settings with more limited resources.</p><p id="Par6">Alternative approaches based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principle such as Digital Droplet PCR (ddPCR) and its variant BEAMing or High Resolution Melting Analysis and Amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS), among others, have been described for the detection of mutant variants in clinical samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Although some of these methods have already been validated in clinical contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, their greater complexity and expense challenge their widespread uptake in clinical laboratories. Therefore there remains a need for cheaper and simpler screening methods that can efficiently detect actionable genetic variants in solid tumours.</p><p id="Par7">Allele-specific PCR strategies, using primers specific for mutant sequences, have been widely used in the clinical detection of DNA sequence variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. A method, termed INTPLEX, was recently described to detect oncogenic KRAS and BRAF mutations in plasma samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Here we use this approach to detect PIK3CA H1047R and E545K point mutations with a method based on standard Sybr Green real-time PCR. Given the simplicity of the technique, this analysis could be potentially performed in any lab with real-time PCR capability and its principle could be easily adapted to other clinically relevant point mutations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Method design</title><p id="Par8">We sought to develop an assay that could accurately test the PIK3CA H1047R and E545K mutation status in human-derived samples. Our quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach involves the use of a set of primers specifically designed to target the mutant sequence while minimizing the amplification of mismatched products derived from the wild-type allele (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The antisense oligonucleotide targeting the mutant-specific sequence has the variant base located at its 3&#x02032; end in order to minimize cross-amplification of the wild-type template. The use of a non-productive phosphate-modified oligonucleotide complementary to the wild-type sequence is intended to supress the amplification of the wild-type allele. It has been designed with the variant base located approximately in the middle of this blocking primer sequence and to partially overlap with the mutant-specific oligonucleotide to ensure high specificity. Each assay also includes the amplification of a non-mutated internal control sequence in a separate reaction.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Primer design. The diagram illustrates the position of the primers used for detection of human PIK3CA E545K and H1047R mutations by real-time quantitative PCR. Two separate qPCR reactions are conducted for each mutation detection: a control reaction illustrated with blue arrows representing the primers and a reaction designed to amplify selectively the mutant H1047R or E545K encoding sequences, illustrated with two green arrows (forward and reverse) and an internal red blocking primer. The 3&#x02032; end of the reverse orientation oligonucleotide targeting the mutant-specific sequence is anchored to the point mutation site to increase the selectivity of the assay. The reverse orientation blocking primer complementary to a wild-type sequence (red) is phosphorylated at its 3&#x02032; end to prevent amplification of the wild-type allele. This blocking oligonucleotide has been designed to partially overlap the mutant-specific primer sequence and to have the variant base approximately in the middle of the primer sequence. The amplicon that serves as a wild-type internal control is located 103&#x02009;bp upstream of the PIK3CA H1047R mutant amplicon targeting a genomic DNA-based sequence (blue primers).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2018_22473_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e504"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Detailed sequences of the primers and size of the amplicons obtained.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Primer name</th><th>Primer sequence</th><th>Tm (&#x000b0;C)</th><th>Direction</th><th>Amplicon size (bp)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PIK3CA MUTANT H104R fw</td><td>5&#x02032;-AACTGAGCAAGAGGCTTTGGAG-3&#x02032;</td><td>60.8</td><td>sense</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>PIK3CA MUTANT H104R rv</td><td>5&#x02032;-TTGTTGTCCAGCCACCATGAC-3&#x02032;</td><td>62.8</td><td>antisense</td><td>&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td>PIK3CA WT BLOCKER (H1047R SITE)</td><td>5&#x02032;-CCAGCCACCATGATGTGCAT-PHO-3&#x02032;</td><td>63.7</td><td>antisense</td><td>&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td>PIK3CA WT1 fw</td><td>5&#x02032;-CATTTGCTCCAAACTGACCA-3&#x02032;</td><td>55.2</td><td>sense</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>PIK3CA WT1 rv</td><td>5&#x02032;-GATTGGCATGCTGTCGAATA-3&#x02032;</td><td>55.2</td><td>antisense</td><td>&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td>PIK3CA WT2 fw</td><td>5&#x02032;-CGACAGCATGCCAATCTCTTC-3&#x02032;</td><td>59.8</td><td>sense</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>PIK3CA WT2 rv</td><td>5&#x02032;-CTAAGGCTAGGGTCTTTCG-3&#x02032;</td><td>56.7</td><td>antisense</td><td>&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td>PIK3CA MUTANT E545K fw</td><td>5&#x02032;-GGGAAAATGACAAAGAACAGC-3&#x02032;</td><td>55.9</td><td>sense</td><td>87</td></tr><tr><td>PIK3CA MUTANT E545K rv</td><td>5&#x02032;-TCCATAGAAAATCTTTCTCCTGCTT-3&#x02032;</td><td>58.1</td><td>antisense</td><td>&#x02014;</td></tr><tr><td>PIK3CA WT BLOCKER (E545K SITE)</td><td>5&#x02032;-CTCCTGCTTAGTGATTTCAG-PHO-3&#x02032;</td><td>55.2</td><td>antisense</td><td>&#x02014;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The primer pairs WT1 and WT2 were designed to target either a genomic or an intron-spanning internal control sequence within the human PIK3CA gene respectively.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Allele specificity</title><p id="Par9">To evaluate the specificity of the assay we used plasmids containing either the human wild-type PIK3CA cDNA (PIK3CA WT) or the variant cDNA sequence (PIK3CA H1047R or PIK3CA E545K).

In order to assess the performance of our assay in FFPE material, genomic DNA was extracted from FFPE blocks from 8 different patients (including B12 and B16) and samples were then subjected to PIK3CA H1047R mutation analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Mutation status assignments were made based on the relative mutant amplification compared to a control human genomic DNA sample. A positive control containing a pool of DNA derived from 3 cell lines harbouring the mutation was also included in the assay. The analysis again showed a significantly increased relative amplification of the mutant allele in FFPE samples from patients B12 and B16 compared to the non-mutated human genomic DNA control, consistent with the presence of PIK3CA H1047R mutation in these patients. The rest of the samples tested showed a wild-type genotype. To validate the data obtained using our qPCR approach in clinical samples, we were able to subject 15 of these samples to targeted deep sequencing (TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel, Illumina) giving a measured allele frequency (AF) for the PIK3CA H1047R mutation in each tumour and white blood cell reference sample (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

Although the mutation was not detected above 5% AF in other samples, sample B23 appeared to carry the mutation very close to this level (AF&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.8%) and this mutant genotype had not been detected by our qPCR method. Finally, the presence of PIK3CA H1047R mutant DNA was also analysed by PCR amplicon Sanger sequencing in samples B12 and B16, as well as the wild-type genotype of two samples that had been called negative for the mutation (B15 and B20) in our qPCR assay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>).

The assays reported herein rely on the combined use of a set of mutant allele-specific primers with a non-productive phosphate-modified oligonucleotide complementary to the wild-type sequence that blocks the wild-type allele amplification thus achieving high specificity. A separate internal control reaction allows the quantification of the qPCR product.</p><p id="Par16">In reference samples this approach is sensitive enough to detect down to 5% H1047R mutant DNA against a background of 95% wild-type sequences and down to 10% mutant DNA for the E545K mutation. The method successfully identified two PIK3CA H1047R positive patient samples from a test set of available tumour biopsy DNA samples purified either from fresh frozen tumour tissue or from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) material. Of a cohort of 22 breast cancer samples, genomic DNA from fresh frozen core biopsies was prepared from all 22 samples and subjected to the qPCR mutation detection assay, 15 of these samples were subjected to amplicon deep sequencing, and 4 of them were additionally genotyped by Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, for 8 of the tumours DNA was extracted from FFPE material and tested using the qPCR assay. The data obtained were coherent and self-consistent. Using the deep sequencing data as a reference, the qPCR assay identified, using DNA from both fresh frozen and FFPE material, two positive tumours (B12 and B16). These two positive samples had observed mutant allele fractions in the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data of 26.1% and 22.1% respectively. Notably, the assay did not detect a tumour (B23) in which NGS analysis detected a substantial number of mutant bases: 213 mutant in 4426 total reads giving a mutant allele fraction (AF) of 4.8%, which is below the limit of detection of this method. Overall, this H1047R detection method achieved high sensitivity detecting 67% of mutant samples (100% of samples &#x0003e;5% AF) and gave no false positives (a selectivity of 100%) in a cohort of 22 patients. The data obtained with the qPCR assay were far clearer than that obtained using targeted Sanger sequencing <bold>(</bold>Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The PCR assay to detect the PIK3CA E545K mutation had lower sensitivity (&#x0003e;10% mutant AF) and was not validated using clinical samples.</p><p id="Par17">PIK3CA is probably the most commonly mutated gene found in human breast cancers and is also mutated in many other solid cancer types. The increasing number of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors that are currently under development for breast cancer and other malignancies suggest the potential value of PIK3CA genotyping as a tool for guiding personalized therapies, although its clinical significance still remains incompletely understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Targeted screening for and detection of these mutations is routinely achieved using several approaches, which either have low sensitivity (targeted Sanger sequencing) or are expensive and/or complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In the latter categories, non-standard PCR detection methods have been used and clinically validated by a few laboratories [32, 33], proprietary detection kits are commercially available, and targeted NGS and digital droplet PCR can give excellent high sensitivity data but are individually costly and also rely on high cost facilities, trained personnel and often have long turnaround times. The ability of our assay to detect PIK3CA H1047R mutations not only in frozen biopsy tissue but also in FFPE tissue specimens is of particular interest, given the value of archived FFPE blocks and the low quality DNA typically obtained from these samples that sometimes limits their use for genomic analysis in downstream applications. We aim that our qPCR based method can be applied at low cost and quick turnaround times in locations lacking expensive genomics facilities. It should also give more sensitive robust data than targeted Sanger sequencing without the need of proprietary reagents and workflows other than those normally used for Sybr Green real-time qPCR. This will improve our knowledge about the prognostic and therapeutic implications of these mutations and further facilitate the development of more individualized PIK3CA targeted therapies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study population, recruitment and sample collection</title><p id="Par18">Matching fresh frozen core biopsies, blood samples and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from 22 female patients with a newly diagnosed breast cancer were collected by the Oncology team of the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, UK.
