MSy is frequently seen in survivors of HIV, cancer survivors treated previously with chemotherapy and/or radiation, and as a side effect of chronic toxicity of certain medications, such as antipsychotic agents. MSy and T2D are cardiovascular risk factors, and their treatment reduces cardiovascular risk, but requires combinations of hypoglycemic agents, statins, fenofibrate, and niacin that together pose a significant therapeutic challenge related to patient compliance, toxicities and drug-interactions <xref rid="pone.0024688-Annaloro1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024688-Ginsberg1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>There is a strong correlation between oxidative-stress and acquired insulin-resistance, and the pathological conditions that are associated with oxidative stress frequently result in hyperglycemia <xref rid="pone.0024688-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024688-Tiedge1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

Oxidative stress is implicated as a contributor to pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell-apoptosis because of their susceptibility to the damaging effects of free radicals due to low levels of free radical quenching enzymes including catalase, glutathione-peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase <xref rid="pone.0024688-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Jakoby1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024688-Evans2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Oxidative stress generated by a short exposure of &#x003b2;-cells to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> results in decrease in insulin mRNA level, and consequent suppression of insulin secretion <xref rid="pone.0024688-Maechler1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Sakai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Moreover, exposure of &#x003b2;-cells to high glucose concentration induces generation of intracellular free radicals causing the inhibition of insulin release <xref rid="pone.0024688-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Prolonged exposure to oxidative stress affects transcription of glucose transporter GLUT4 through inhibition of binding of nuclear proteins to the insulin-responsive element in the GLUT4 promoter <xref rid="pone.0024688-Pessler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These and other mechanisms have been proposed as causes of insulin-resistance, but a unified model has not emerged that adequately explains the mechanisms through which clinically used drugs reverse insulin resistance, which is a characteristic of MSy and T2D.</p><p>Important and effective oral hypoglycemic agents that function through transcriptional regulation of gluconeogenic and lipid-metabolizing enzymes in the liver induce their effects either indirectly or directly by mechanisms that are mediated through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors &#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos) are thiazolidinedione-class (TZD) oral hypoglycemic agents whose primary mechanism is through PPAR&#x003b3; mediated transcriptional regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism <xref rid="pone.0024688-Krishnaswami1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Metformin (Glucophage) is a biguanide-class hypoglycemic agent that operates primarily through inhibition of AMPK (which regulates the rate of endocytosis), but is also linked with PPAR&#x003b3; through PGC1&#x003b1; (PPAR&#x003b3;-receptor co-activator) <xref rid="pone.0024688-Pollak1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These medications generally function to increase the effectiveness of insulin-mediated postprandial inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Increasingly, the beneficial effects of these medications have been linked with their ability to act as antioxidants or to induce biological antioxidant defenses <xref rid="pone.0024688-Krishnaswami1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Pollak1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>During our studies of a mercapturic acid pathway transporter protein (RLIP76, ral-interacting protein) which is involved in protecting cells from oxidative and electrophilic stress, we discovered that RLIP76 homozygous knockout (RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice had blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels that were each approximately half of those found in wild-RLIP76 (RLIP76<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>) mice. Because these mice had decreased body fat as well as marked central and peripheral insulin-sensitivity, they appeared in essence the diametric opposite of MSy <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This observation is even more remarkable considering that the &#x0201c;anti-MSy&#x0201d; phenotype of these animals occurs despite the fact that lipid-peroxidation levels in the tissues of these mice are 2&#x02013;7 fold higher than wild-type mice <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024688-Singhal2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. That is, conditions (i.e oxidative-stress) that lead to insulin-resistance in the presence of RLIP76 do not have this effect in its absence. These considerations led us to hypothesize that RLIP76 represents a required mechanism to translate the presence of markedly increased levels of oxidative-stress into insulin-resistance and hyperlipidemia. A corollary to this hypothesis is that medications commonly used to treat hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia should fail to function in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice if RLIP76 is indeed necessary for the clinical manifestations of oxidative-stress characteristic of MSy and T2D. In present studies, we describe the findings of studies with rosiglitazone, metformin, atorvastatin and gemfibrozil, showing that these drugs indeed entirely lack hypoglycemic or hypolipidemic effects in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Results of present studies thus offer conclusive evidence for a critical role of RLIP76 as an effector protein directly involved in translating oxidative-stress into the clinical manifestations of MSy and T2D. Implications of our findings include the possibility of single RLIP76-targeted molecules that can have broad salutary affects in T2D as well as MSy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>Gemfibrozil and metformin were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St Louis, MO).

Prolonged signaling by insulin bound to the plasma membrane receptor due to the lack of CDE, and consequent insulin-sensitivity has been shown to play a key role in the baseline hypoglycemia, but the most relevant kinase pathways involved were not elucidated.

These results were further confirmed by immuno-histochemical studies showing that metformin caused expected increase in PPAR&#x003b3; and pAMPK, and a decrease in HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) as well as RLIP76. RLIP76 was absent, and PPAR&#x003b3; and pAMPK were maximally induced in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and no further effect of metformin was found. Most remarkably, HMGCR was markedly deficient in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, explaining the observed hypocholesterolemia in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024688-g003">
<bold>Fig. 3</bold>
</xref>). Taken together, these findings strongly support that RLIP76 is necessary for the hypoglycemic effect of metformin, and indicate that direct inhibition of RLIP76 by metformin is the mechanism. RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have baseline hypoglycemia, and baseline increases in pAMPK, PPAR&#x003b3;, pJNK, and pAKT, which provides perhaps the reason for their hypoglycemia. If this were true, further activation of these signals by metformin, (as is seen in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice), should cause further hypoglycemia &#x02013; but it clearly does not. These findings are perhaps best understood in the context of previous studies showing that RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have markedly elevated levels of lipid-peroxidation and consequent elevation of lipid hydroperoxides and their degradation products <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024688-Singhal1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Although such alterations are strongly clinically linked to insulin-resistance and metabolic syndrome, the precise opposite findings are seen in the RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice: insulin-sensitivity, hypoglycemia, hypolipidemia and fat-loss. That is, oxidative stress is insufficient to cause insulin-resistance in the absence of RLIP76. Because of the recently established role of RLIP76 as a mediator of CDE through its activity as an ATP-dependent efflux transporter of glutathionylated derivatives of lipid-peroxidation, the established role of CDE in mediating insulin-resistance <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi4" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024688-Ikeda1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and in the context of present findings, we conclude that insulin-resistance should result from an abundance of RLIP76, as occurs under stress-conditions. Thus, under stress conditions, increased expression and activity of RLIP76 causes increased CDE, which antagonizes insulin-induced hypoglycemic effects leading to insulin-resistance. In the absence of RLIP76, the CDE-mediated antagonism is absent and insulin-sensitivity results, presumably as a result of failure to suppress PPAR&#x003b3; or AMPK. According to this postulate, drugs which inhibit the transport activity of RLIP76 should reduce CDE allowing more prolonged insulin action at the plasma membrane. These findings strongly support a model in which metformin's hypoglycemic actions are mediated by inhibition of RLIP76, and a consequent activation of AMPK and PPAR&#x003b3; as a result of increased oxidative stress due to depleted RLIP76 activity. PPAR&#x003b3; and RLIP76 appear to be mutually inversely regulated, and baseline activation of AMPK and PPAR&#x003b3; are the specific down-stream kinases whose activation is increased with the loss of CDE.</p><fig id="pone-0024688-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0024688.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Differential effect of metformin in RLIP76<sup><bold>&#x0002b;<bold>/</bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> and RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</title><p>

PPAR&#x003b1; is inducible by the lipid-hydroperoxidation product of &#x003c9;-6 fatty acid, in particular leukotrienes B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>), the direct precursor of its glutathionylated metabolite, LTC<sub>4</sub> (which is metabolized to mercapturic acid and is a known substrate for efflux by RLIP76) <xref rid="pone.0024688-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024688-g006">

</xref>). Thus, a potential direct mechanism exists that could explain hypotriglyceridemia. We found that PPAR&#x003b1; was indeed constitutively activated in the tissues of the RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024688-g006">

</xref>). In such a case, gemfibrozil should have no further triglyceride depleting effects. However, the effects of gemfibrozil have also been directly linked to inhibition of fatty acid synthesis enzymes, suggesting that their effects may not be completely abrogated. The differential effects of these drugs on lipid particle distribution (increasing HDL and lowering VLDL) appears more likely due to direct or indirect effects on CDE, which plays a critical role in lipid trafficking. So we conclude that hypotriglyceridemia in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are due largely or entirely to PPAR&#x003b1; accumulation.</p><fig id="pone-0024688-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0024688.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Differential effect of gemfibrozil in RLIP76<sup><bold>&#x0002b;<bold>/</bold>&#x0002b;</bold></sup> and RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</title><p>

Mechanistic rationale for this possibility could be based on the fact that leukotrienes B<sub>4</sub>, a physiological ligand for activation of PPAR&#x003b1;, is also a mercapturic acid precursor (through leukotrienes C<sub>4</sub>), and would be expected to be increased in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Because hypotriglyceridemic agents such as gemfibrozil function largely through activation of PPAR&#x003b1;, their actions could also be deficient in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The striking absence of hypoglycemic function of rosiglitazone and metformin, and hypolipidemic function of gemfibrozil and atorvastatin (Lipitor) in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice has broad and significant impact on our understanding of the mechanisms involved in mediating and treating metabolic syndrome. RLIP76, a glutathione-conjugate transporter, may play a central role in oxidative-stress-associated hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are extremely insulin sensitive, and have baseline BG, cholesterol and triglyceride levels that are about one-half of that in wild-type mice <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Depletion of RLIP76 by antisense or inhibition by antibodies decreases blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol. In contrast, the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinedione drug, rosiglitazone, and metformin (Glucophage) is a widely used drug for T2D treatment, had absolutely no effect on the blood glucose of RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Present studies indicate that this lack of action is because PPAR&#x003b3; and AMPK are already maximally induced in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and that PPAR&#x003b3; and AMPK activation in RLIP76<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> is associated with inhibition of the transport activity of RLIP76.</p><p>Present studies also indicate that in RLIP76<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice, rosiglitazone inhibits the transport activity of RLIP76 and causes depletion of RLIP76 protein without affecting the level of mRNA, and induces PPAR&#x003b3;. In stark contrast, PPAR&#x003b3; is maximally activated in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice even in the absence of rosiglitazone, treatment with which causes absolutely no further effect on PPAR&#x003b3; level. That is, PPAR&#x003b3; activation correlates with RLIP76-inhibition, and RLIP76-inhibition leads invariably to inhibition of CDE; thus, PPAR&#x003b3; activation should vary inversely with CDE. The link between endocytosis and PPAR&#x003b3; is also apparent from the known mechanism of action of another hypoglycemic agent, metformin, which functions through inhibition of AMPK, a kinase that regulates the rate of endocytosis, and also affects PPAR&#x003b3; through PGC1&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0024688-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Tomkin1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Because CDE plays a crucial role in cholesterol trafficking, and because the Ral-pathway is known to be critically regulated by products synthesized through HMG-CoA <xref rid="pone.0024688-Musera1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, it is possible that the hypocholesterolemic effect of HMGCR inhibition will be diminished in the RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. CDE also plays a crucial role in trafficking of triglycerides, and because hypotriglyceridemic agents such as gemfibrozil operate through PPAR&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0024688-Sanguino1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, it is possible that these agents will also fail to exert their therapeutic effect.</p><p>Our studies have characterized that RLIP76 represents a critical and determinant node of signaling that regulates the MSy incidence and response to interventional strategies. The JNK1 activation is a known factor that regulates the insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0024688-Belgardt1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Some studies have reported that JNK1 knock out mice have marked resistance to high fat induced obesity <xref rid="pone.0024688-Belgardt2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Further studies in JNK1 knock-out mice would unveil the precise cross-talk between RLIP76 and JNK1 and whether RLIP76 can also act independent of JNK1 in regulating the incidence of MSy. Besides its potential role in the incidence of MSy, RLIP76 has emerged as a mechanistically significant and effective interventional target for MSy. According to a prospective study, metformin used for the management of MSy also reduced the incidence of cancer-risk <xref rid="pone.0024688-Anisimov1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Anisimov2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. RLIP76 is an established factor essential for the incidence and progression of multiple cancers and RLIP76 knock-out mice are resistant to chemical neoplasia <xref rid="pone.0024688-Singhal3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024688-Singhal6" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Thus, inhibition of RLIP76 by metformin has revealed an RLIP76 dependent mechanism for both the anti-MSy and anti-cancer effects of metformin.</p><p>Our recently published studies demonstrate that RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice used for these studies were found to have marked insulin-sensitivity, and blood glucose was 46&#x00025; lower than in RLIP76<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> animals (p&#x0003c;0.001). RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also had lower total serum cholesterol and triglycerides (43&#x00025; and 40&#x00025; of control, respectively; p&#x0003c;0.01) <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The hypoglycemia in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is particularly remarkable because markers of oxidative-stress are remarkably increased in the tissues of the RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024688-Singhal1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus, in the absence of RLIP76, increases in these lipid-peroxidation products are insufficient by themselves to turn on any signaling pathway that can increase BG or lipids. Increased gluconeogenesis was particularly remarkable given that the activity of key gluconeogenic enzymes, G6Pase, F1,6-BPase, and PEPCK, in liver of RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was significantly inhibited.</p><p>Enhanced basal pAMPK levels in RLIP76<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was another salient finding which strengthens the postulate that RLIP76 is a highly effective target for developing interventional strategies for MSy. Resveratrol, commonly used anti-oxidant, is known to activate AMPK which could contribute to its protective effects from high fat diet induced insulin-resistance <xref rid="pone.0024688-Vetterli1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Lagouge1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. AMPK protects cells from stresses that cause ATP depletion by switching off ATP-consuming biosynthetic pathways. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation by an upstream protein kinase known as AMPK kinase. Activated AMPK can phosphorylate and regulate <italic>in vivo</italic> HMG-CoA, which is key regulatory enzyme of sterol synthesis <xref rid="pone.0024688-Musera1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Tomkin1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. HMG-CoA limits the rate of cholesterol synthesis in liver tissue. Lipitor, inhibitor of HMG-CoA, exerts anti-inflammatory effects by lowering plasma cholesterol. Activation of AMPK leads to the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by the phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase <xref rid="pone.0024688-Musera1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Loss of RLIP76 significantly affects the activation of stress and apoptosis pathway proteins <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Singhal1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Singhal6" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Activation of AMPK leads to the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by the phosphorylation of HMGCR. AMPK activation would be a good approach to treat T2D. These medications generally function to increase the effectiveness of insulin-mediated postprandial inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. These findings provide a new insight on the mechanisms of action of hypoglycemic and/or hypolipidemic drugs.</p><p>RLIP76 knock-out mice survive well and are active. In our extensive and previously published studies, RLIP76 inhibition specifically leads to targeting signaling of importance in diabetes mellitus and other oxidative stress related conditions like cancers where targeting RLIP76 leads to selective cancer cell death without affecting the survival of normal cells and tissues <xref rid="pone.0024688-Awasthi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024688-Singhal3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024688-Singhal5" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Hence, both global and selectively targeted approaches can be reasonably pursued as required while targeting RLIP76. In conclusion, our results suggest that RLIP76 is a key effector controlled by multiple proteins known to regulate the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and that in its absence drugs that target these proteins will fail to function. The specific events that regulate the transport-effector/clathrin-endocytosis activity of RLIP76 (i.e. phosphorylation of RLIP76 by JNK, Akt, AMPK) will be explored in the future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Xiangle Sun, core facility at the University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, for helping in imaging using the Olympus Provis AX70 microscope.
