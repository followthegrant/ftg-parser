This study explored the role of G9a- and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-mediated methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in COX-2 silencing in IPF. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and re-ChIP assays demonstrated marked increases in H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and DNA methylation, together with their respective modifying enzymes G9a, EZH2, and DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) and respective binding proteins heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), polycomb protein complex 1 (PRC1) and methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), at the COX-2 promoter in lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF (F-IPFs) compared with fibroblasts from nonfibrotic lungs. HP1, EZH2, and MeCP2 in turn were associated with additional repressive chromatin modifiers in F-IPFs. G9a and EZH2 inhibitors and small interfering RNAs and the Dnmt1 inhibitor markedly reduced H3K9me3 (49&#x02212;79%), H3K27me3 (44&#x02212;81%), and DNA methylation (61&#x02212;97%) at the COX-2 promoter. These reductions were correlated with increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation, resulting in COX-2 mRNA and protein reexpression in F-IPFs. Our results support a central role for G9a- and EZH2-mediated histone hypermethylation and a model of bidirectional, mutually reinforcing, and interdependent crosstalk between histone hypermethylation and DNA methylation in COX-2 epigenetic silencing in IPF.&#x02014;Coward, W.

Acetylation on lysines by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylation by histone deacetylases (HDACs) are associated with transcriptional activation and repression, respectively. The most well-characterized histone methylations are the di- and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3) and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which repress gene expression, and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), which is associated with gene activation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). H3K9me2/3 is catalyzed by H3K9 specific histone methyltransferases (HMTs), including G9a and SUV39H (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Methylated H3K9 then serves as a docking site for chromatin modifier proteins that mediate downstream effects, such as heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which, in turn, recruits additional HMTs, DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) and HDAC-containing complexes, such as nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR), co-RE1-silencing transcription factor (CoREST), and mammalian SIN3 homolog A (mSin3a) to reinforce gene silencing (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The polycomb group (PcG) proteins are an epigenetic system essentially involved in heritable repression of gene transcription, but the molecular underpinnings are not entirely clear, and several different PcG-mediated mechanisms have been proposed. The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which also includes the suppressor of zeste 12 protein, embryonic ectoderm development (EED) protein, and EED-associated HDAC1 and HDAC2 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). EZH2 acts as a lysine-specific HMT that mediates H3K27me3; this modification, in turn, provides a specific binding site for another PRC, PRC1, to silence the expression of PRC2 target genes by blocking the recruitment of transcriptional activation factors and preventing initiation of transcription (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). A large percentage of PRC2 target genes contain CpG islands and therefore are likely to undergo DNA methylation as a means to ensure a stable repressive state. There are reports indicating that EZH2 directly interacts with Dnmts and is necessary for <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation for PRC2 target gene promoters (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>DNA methylation by Dnmts at 5-cytosine at CpG islands of gene promoters is the most common epigenetic modification associated with transcriptional silencing. Dnmt3a/b are considered to be the <italic>de novo</italic> Dnmts, whereas Dnmt1 is the primary Dnmt for the maintenance; however, the functions of these Dnmts overlap extensively (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Direct inhibition of transcription may be through blocking the binding of transcription factors to promoters containing methylated CpG sites (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), whereas indirect repression may involve proteins such as methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) that specifically bind to methylated DNA <italic>via</italic> a methyl CpG-binding domain (MBD; ref. <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Recent studies suggested that intimate communication and mutual dependence exist between DNA methylation and histone modifications in the process of gene silencing. For instance, MBD proteins can bind to methylated DNA and recruit and interact with HDACs and HMTs, thereby linking DNA methylation to histone modifications to reinforce epigenetic silencing (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, it is likely that neither of the repressive epigenetic mechanisms can be universally applied to the silencing of specific genes, because this may be dependent on cell type and physiological or pathophysiological context.</p><p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a deadly respiratory disease of unknown etiology with a median survival of 3&#x02013;4 yr and no effective therapy (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). IPF is characterized by the accumulation and activation of lung fibroblasts and subsequent excessive collagen deposition, leading to distortion of the alveolar architecture, progressive loss of lung function, and ultimately death. Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is a major prostanoid in lung structural cells, including fibroblasts, and is derived mainly from the inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2; ref. <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). There is compelling evidence that PGE<sub>2</sub> is a key antifibrotic mediator in the lung because of its inhibition of fibroblast activation and collagen deposition (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Animal model studies have shown that PGE<sub>2</sub> and its analog have protective effects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>); in contrast, a lack of COX-2 and COX-2-derived PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes fibrosis (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Moreover, COX-2 expression and PGE<sub>2</sub> production are markedly reduced in fibroblasts from IPF lung (F-IPFs; ref. <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and PGE<sub>2</sub> in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and COX-2 expression in lung biopsy specimens (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) are also reduced in patients with IPF. These findings suggest that the COX-2/PGE<sub>2</sub> antifibrotic mechanism is lost in IPF, which in turn promotes fibrosis and contributes to IPF pathogenesis.</p><p>We have demonstrated previously that COX-2 gene transcription was defective in F-IPFs compared with that in fibroblasts from nonfibrotic lung (F-NLs) due to deficient histone acetylation as a result of decreased recruitment of HATs and increased recruitment of the HDAC-containing transcriptional corepressor complexes to the COX-2 promoter (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, whether histone methylation and DNA methylation affect COX-2 repression in IPF is not known. In this study, we explored the role of G9a- and EZH2-mediated histone methylation and DNA methylation and the interactions between histone modifications and DNA methylation in COX-2 epigenetic silencing in F-IPFs. We report here that G9a-mediated H3K9 methylation and EZH2-mediated H3K27 methylation were markedly increased at the COX-2 promoter in F-IPFs in an interdependent manner and were tightly associated with DNA methylation and histone hypoacetylation, thereby resulting in the epigenetic silencing of the COX-2 gene in F-IPFs. Disruption of G9a- and EZH2-mediated histone methylation by epigenetic inhibitors and G9a and EZH2 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) reversed repressive epigenetic modifications and restored COX-2 expression and PGE<sub>2</sub> production. These findings demonstrate a novel and central role for G9a- and EZH2-mediated histone methylation in COX-2 epigenetic silencing in IPF and provide a functional connection between histone methylation and DNA methylation. The intrinsic reversibility and mutual dependence of these epigenetic changes may prove to be beneficial in the reactivation of the antifibrotic COX-2 gene in IPF.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Fibroblast cell culture</title><p>F-IPFs and F-NLs from the explanted lungs of patients with IPF who underwent lung transplantation at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and from normal lung tissues obtained from organ donors under a protocol approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board were cultured as described previously (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The 6 F-IPF donors were all male smokers with an average age of 62.95 yr (range, 40.7&#x02013;74.1 yr) and an average smoking history of 24.17 pack-yr (range, 4&#x02013;70 pack-yr). The 6 F-NL donors included 3 men, 1 woman, and 2 with undisclosed gender. The age of 1 donor was undisclosed and the average age of the other 5 donors was 42.2 yr (range, 22&#x02013;63 yr). One donor was a nonsmoker, 1 had a 13-pack-yr smoking history, and the smoking histories of the other 4 donors were undisclosed. F-IPFs and F-NLs from 6 donors each were used at passages 5 and 6, respectively, to ensure purity and maintain the differences present <italic>in vivo</italic>.

At the indicated time points, the cells were harvested for subsequent analysis, and their responses were compared.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and re-ChIP assays</title><p>ChIP assays were performed using reagents and protocols from a ChIP-IT Express Kit (Active Motif, La Hulpe, Belgium) as described previously (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Antibodies against H3K4me3, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, EZH2, acetylated histone H3 and H4, total histone H3 and H4 (EMD Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA), G9a, SUV39H1, HP1 (recognizes HP1&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3;), PRC1, EED, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, MeCP2 CoREST, NCoR, mSin3a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), and respective control antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation. Purified DNA from the immunoprecipitated antibody-protein-chromatin complexes was subject to real-time PCR amplification with primers designed specifically for the COX-2 promoter region (&#x02212;299/+6) as described previously (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The amounts of COX-2 promoter DNA that were present in the bound (immunoprecipitated) fractions were calculated relative to the input control by using the 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub></sup> method, where &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic> is the difference between the threshold cycle (<italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic>) for the bound fraction and the <italic>C<sub>T</sub></italic> for the input fraction. The association of acetylated and methylated histones H3 and H4 with the COX-2 promoter DNA was further normalized to the association of total histones H3 and H4 with the COX-2 DNA.</p><p>Re-ChIP assays were conducted by using a Re-ChIP-IT Express Kit (Active Motif) as described previously (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). After the first immunoprecipitation using antibody against HP-1, EZH2, or MeCP2, the immunoprecipitated chromatin was removed from the magnetic beads in a buffer that prevents the majority of the first antibody from participating in the second immunoprecipitation reaction. The chromatin was desalted, and a second ChIP step was performed using specific antibodies against NCoR, CoREST, mSin3a, Dnmt3a, Dnmt1, G9a, SUV39H1, EZH2, and PRC1. Purified DNA from the sequentially immunoprecipitated antibody-protein-chromatin complexes was analyzed by real-time PCR as described above.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) assay</title><p>MeDIP assays were performed to detect DNA methylation at the CpG islands within the human COX-2 promoter with the use of a ChIP-IT Express Kit. In brief, after treatment, chromatin was extracted from the cells and portioned into aliquots as described previously (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Aliquots of chromatin were then incubated with no antibody, a nonimmune rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as negative controls, or a specific IgG antibody against 5-methylcytosine (Active Motif) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The MeDIP reaction was calibrated with a set of 2 DNA standards (897 bp) that are linear double-stranded DNA with the same sequence (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA; see also the manufacturer's website; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.zymoresearch.com">http://www.zymoresearch.com</ext-link>). The only difference is that each contains either 100% unmodified cytosines or 5-methylcytosines. Since the sequence and extent of cytosine modification are known, these DNA standards were also used to spike the chromatin to demonstrate the specificity of the MeDIP assay. The immunoprecipitated antibody-DNA complexes were then collected, and DNA was extracted, purified, and subjected to real-time PCR amplification of the minimum COX-2 promoter region (positions &#x02212;299 to+6) with key transcription factor binding sites (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and several known CpG sites (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) with specifically designed primers (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). DNA methylation in distal regions upstream and downstream of the minimum COX-2 promoter was also analyzed with specifically designed primers: forward 5&#x02032;-TCAGCCCAACTGCTTATGTG-3&#x02032; and reverse 5&#x02032;-GGGAGTCATCTCGGTGTGAT-3&#x02032;) for the region from &#x02212;12,360 to &#x02212;12,142; forward 5&#x02032;-CCCAACAAATTTCAGACGCT-3&#x02032; and reverse 5&#x02032;-TACATTTGGGATGCTGGTCA-3&#x02032;, for the region from &#x02212;2440 to &#x02212;2206; forward 5&#x02032;-AAGTGGGTGCCATACTCAGC-3&#x02032; and reverse 5&#x02032;-GAGAAGGCTTCCCAGCTTTT-3&#x02032; for the region from +1727 to +2093; and forward 5&#x02032;-CTTCCATCTCCAAGACCCAA-3&#x02032; and reverse 5&#x02032;-TCTTCCTGCTAGGCTACCCA-3&#x02032;, for the region from +21,087 to +21,307. The amount of COX-2 promoter DNA in the immunoprecipitates (IPs) was calculated as described previously (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The amounts of COX-2 promoter DNA present in both nonantibody and nonimmune rabbit IgG negative control IPs were minimal and markedly smaller than those in the specific-antibody IPs.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>COX-2 mRNA and protein expression</title><p>COX-2 mRNA and protein expression levels in resting and cytokine-stimulated cells were examined by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively, as reported previously (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Epigenetic inhibitor study</title><p>To assess the role of G9a HMT, Dnmt1, and HDACs in COX-2 repression in F-IPFs, inhibitors for these enzymes were used.

By applying the MeDIP assay with an antibody against 5-methylcytosine and amplifying the immunoprecipitated COX-2 promoter DNA by real-time PCR using specific primers for different regions of the COX-2 promoter, we revealed that the minimum COX-2 promoter region (&#x02212;299/+6) was significantly more methylated in F-IPFs than in F-NLs under unstimulated conditions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic></bold>).

However, no difference was observed between F-IPFs and F-NLs in the global protein expression of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a as analyzed by Western blotting (data not shown). These findings suggest that the COX-2 promoter DNA is methylated in F-IPFs as a result of increased recruitment of Dnmts to the COX-2 promoter rather than increased expression of Dnmt proteins.

Although histone methylation has been shown to act cooperatively with histone acetylation and DNA methylation to determine a heritable transcriptional state, the role of histone methylation in the repression of antifibrotic genes, including COX-2, in IPF has not been explored so far. The current study demonstrated that histone H3 was repressively methylated at the COX-2 promoter as manifested by reduced H3K4me3 and increased H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in F-IPFs compared with those in F-NLs, which correlated with the recruitment of the H3K9-specific HMT G9a and the H3K27-specific HMT EZH2. Disruption of the function and expression of G9a and EZH2 by their respective inhibitors and siRNAs resulted in marked reductions in H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 and in DNA methylation at the COX-2 promoter and led to the restoration of COX-2 expression and PGE<sub>2</sub> production. The data strongly suggest that G9a- and EZH2-mediated histone methylation plays a central role and acts interdependently with DNA methylation in the epigenetic silencing of COX-2 in IPF.</p><p>It is well established that G9a- and EZH2-mediated histone H3K9 and H3K27 hypermethylation contributes to the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes. G9a and EZH2 are up-regulated in a number of different cancers (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and seem to be required for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype. However, G9a expression may not be correlated with global H3K9 methylation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We have previously reported that G9a and H3K9me3 are markedly increased at the promoter of another repressed antifibrotic gene, IFN-&#x003b3;-inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10), in F-IPFs, but global G9a expression remains the same between F-IPFs and F-NLs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In the current study, we found no differences in the mRNA levels of EZH2 between F-IPFs and F-NLs (data not shown); the increase in H3K9 and H3K27 methylation at the COX-2 promoter in F-IPFs was therefore probably due to gene promoter-specific recruitment of G9a and EZH2.</p><p>G9a-mediated H3K9 hypermethylation (both H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) serves as a docking site for the chromatin modifier protein HP1, which in turn recruits additional chromatin modifiers to reinforce gene silencing (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). On the other hand, EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 provides a specific binding site for PRC1 to silence the expression of PRC2 target genes by blocking the recruitment of transcriptional activation factors and preventing initiation of transcription (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). EZH2 also interacts with Dnmts, and another PRC2 protein, EED, interacts with HDAC1 and HDAC2 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>); both are necessary for a stable repressive state for PRC target gene promoters (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We revealed that HP1 was associated with H3K9me3, G9a, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and the transcriptional repressor complexes CoREST and mSin3a (containing HDAC1 and HDAC2) and NCoR (containing HDAC3) at the COX-2 promoter in F-IPFs, suggesting that G9a-mediated H3K9 methylation may lead to DNA methylation and histone deacetylation to reinforce the epigenetic silencing of the COX-2 gene. This observation is supported by our previous findings that interactions between G9a-mediated H3K9 methylation and histone deacetylation are critically involved in the repression of IP-10 in IPF (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and suggests that similar epigenetic deregulation may account for the silencing of a group of antifibrotic genes in IPF. We also noticed that PRC1 was associated with EZH2-mediated H3K27me3, EZH2 was associated with EED, Dnmt1, and Dnmt3a, and EED was associated with NCoR, CoREST, and mSin3a at the COX-2 promoter in IPF, suggesting that COX-2 silencing in IPF could be mediated by PRC1 through blocking of transcriptional activation factor recruitment and preventing transcription initiation and that EZH2/EED may also lead to DNA methylation and histone deacetylation to reinforce epigenetic silencing of the COX-2 gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show PRC-mediated COX-2 epigenetic silencing in any cell system.</p><p>To further assess the role of G9a and EZH2 in the epigenetic silencing of the COX-2 gene in F-IPFs, we studied the effects of the G9a-specific inhibitor BIX-01294 and the EZH2 inhibitor DZNep. We found that BIX-01294 significantly reduced not only H3K9me3 and HP1 binding but also DNA methylation and MeCP2 binding and increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the COX-2 promoter. Similarly, DZNep reduced not only H3K27me3 but also DNA methylation and MeCP2 binding and increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the COX-2 promoter. These results are consistent with previous findings showing that BIX-01294 reduced H3K9 methylation and HP1 recruitment but increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the IP-10 promoter in F-IPFs (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, epigenetic inhibitors may have off-target effects as demonstrated by a recent study showing inhibition of both EZH2 and the H3K9 HMT SETDB1 by DZNep (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). By using the G9a inhibitor BIX-01294, we observed a total loss of HP1 binding after &#x0223c;60% reduction in H3K9me3, whereas G9a siRNA-reduced HP1 binding was proportional to the reduction in H3K9me3. Although the reasons for this discrepancy are not known, it is possible that this may be an off-target effect of BIX-01294. The variable levels of effects of epigenetic inhibitors on COX-2 mRNA/protein expression and PGE<sub>2</sub> production despite similar effects on methylation status at the COX-2 promoter may also suggest off-target effects of the inhibitors on genes that may have control of COX-2 expression and function. It is therefore necessary to apply siRNA knockdown to validate the findings with epigenetic inhibitors. We revealed in our current study that successful siRNA knockdown of G9a and EZH2 recapitulated the effects of G9a and EZH2 inhibitors. This finding is consistent with recent findings that G9a knockdown reduces H3K9 methylation and the recruitment of HP1, Dnmt1, and HDAC1 to the promoter of the cell adhesion molecule Ep-CAM and restores its expression in lung cancer cells (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and that G9a knockdown restores E-cadherin expression by suppressing H3K9 methylation and blocking DNA methylation in human breast cancer cells (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). As a result of the removal of epigenetic repression by inhibition and knockdown of G9a and EZH2, active epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation as a result of increased HAT recruitment and the capability of F-IPFs to express COX-2 and produce the antifibrotic mediator PGE<sub>2</sub> in response to IL-1&#x003b2; were restored. The data thus strongly suggest that G9a- and EZH2-mediated histone methylation is closely associated with DNA methylation and histone deacetylation and that G9a and EZH2 inhibition and knockdown lead to decreased recruitment of repressive chromatin modifiers to the COX-2 promoter and the switching of local epigenetic status from repression to activation.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional silencing is a predominant mechanism for COX-2 silencing in various tumors and that the methylation inhibitor 5-deoxy-2&#x02032;-azacytidine restores COX-2 gene expression (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The current study demonstrated that the COX-2 promoter was markedly more methylated in F-IPFs than in F-NLs, which was correlated with increased recruitment of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a. Because there was no difference in global Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a protein expression between F-NLs and F-IPFs (data not shown), DNA methylation at the COX-2 promoter in F-IPFs was probably due to gene-specific recruitment of Dnmts. Similarly, global DNA methylation does not contribute to the methylation of the promoter of the antifibrotic gene Thy-1 in lung fibroblasts with repressed Thy-1 expression (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). DNA methylation can also lead to histone modifications to establish stable gene silencing through the recruitment of additional chromatin modifiers by proteins with methyl DNA binding activity, such as MeCP2 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, the role of such interactions in COX-2 repression has not been understood. Our current study showed that the increase in DNA methylation was correlated with increased H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 and decreased H3 and H4 acetylation at the COX-2 promoter in F-IPFs, suggesting that DNA methylation and histone modifications act cooperatively in COX-2 repression in IPF. We also presented evidence that there was a trend for increased association of MeCP2 with the COX-2 promoter in F-IPFs compared with that for F-NLs and that MeCP2 was associated with G9a, EZH2, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, NCoR, CoREST, and mSin3a at the COX-2 promoter, suggesting that DNA methylation/MeCP2-mediated recruitment of chromatin modifiers may reinforce H3K9 and H3K27 methylation, histone deacetylation, DNA methylation, and eventually COX-2 silencing. This result was supported by the findings that the Dnmt1 inhibitor RG108 not only inhibited DNA methylation and MeCP2 binding but also reduced H3K9 and H3K27 methylation and increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the COX-2 promoter, eventually resulting in COX-2 derepression in F-IPFs. Although Dnmt1 represents the preferential target of RG108 because the catalytic domains of all 3 Dnmts are highly conserved, they are likely to have similar interactions with RG108 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). There is also evidence that the functions of these Dnmts overlap extensively (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), making it impractical to knock down individual Dnmts. These observations suggest that the effect of RG108 observed in this study could be attributed to its inhibition of all 3 Dnmts and/or to its inhibition of the Dnmt1 activities on both <italic>de novo</italic> methylation and maintenance of methylation. However, it is also possible that the inhibition of H3K9 and H3K27 methylation by RG108 at the COX-2 promoter could be a direct effect because it has been shown that another Dnmt inhibitor, 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine could act directly on G9a and EZH2 to reduce H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 at the Bad promoter (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Nevertheless, the fact that MeCP2 is associated with HMTs and HDACs supports a bidirectional and reinforcing interaction between DNA methylation and histone methylation in the epigenetic silencing of COX-2 in IPF.</p><p>It has been increasingly recognized that F-IPFs represent a persistently activated phenotype of lung fibroblasts and play a key role in the development and progression of IPF. Evidence is emerging to support the concept that these cells are epigenetically reprogramed so that a group of antifibrotic genes, including COX-2, Thy-1, and IP-10, are epigenetically silenced in a way similar to the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancers. Here we provide further evidence that deregulated histone and DNA methylation contributes to the epigenetic silencing of COX-2 in F-IPFs. However, one clear limitation of the current study is that it explored the epigenetic events at the end of the disease process. Although the results are novel and valuable in understanding the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the epigenetic silencing of antifibrotic genes in IPF, little is known about the causes and order of events by which repressive patterns of histone and DNA methylation are established and maintained during the disease development and progression. It is of great importance to identify the critical initiating event that triggers antifibrotic gene silencing to understand the mechanisms underlying persistent fibroblast activation and pulmonary fibrogenesis. It is also plausible to propose that environmental and endogenous factors represent key signals that trigger distinct epigenetic changes and influence the order of epigenetic events, leading to antifibrotic gene silencing during pulmonary fibrogenesis. Preliminary data from our ongoing studies show that chronic treatment of F-NLs with the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF&#x003b2;1) markedly reduces IL-1&#x003b2;-induced COX-2 expression, which is accompanied by increased DNA methylation and decreased histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the COX-2 promoter, and that PGE<sub>2</sub> not only prevents TGF&#x003b2;1-induced COX-2 repression in F-NLs but also restores COX-2 expression in F-IPFs (unpublished data). These observations provide a hint that repressive epigenetic modifications at the COX-2 promoter could be introduced, at least to some extent, by TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment and that endogenously produced PGE<sub>2</sub> after COX-2 reexpression could play a key role in preventing and reversing lung fibroblast activation in IPF. However, further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms and order of epigenetic events leading to the epigenetic silencing of COX-2 and other antifibrotic genes in IPF.</p><p>Regardless of the hierarchical order of events, our observations support a central role for G9a- and EZH2-mediated histone hypermethylation and a model of bidirectional, mutually reinforcing, and interdependent crosstalk between histone hypermethylation and DNA methylation in the epigenetic silencing of COX-2 and potentially other antifibrotic genes in IPF (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref></bold>). Our data also suggest that the machinery for the expression of COX-2 and probably other antifibrotic genes in IPF remains intact and functional and can mediate reexpression if the repressive epigenetic modifications are removed. Thus, the epigenetic enzymes regulating these epigenetic modifications and their crosstalk in these cells may represent a key therapeutic target to reactivate silenced antifibrotic genes for treating this progressive and fatal disease.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>A hypothetical model depicting the central role of G9a- and EZH2-mediated histone methylation and the interdependent and mutually reinforcing crosstalk between histone methylation and DNA methylation in COX-2 epigenetic silencing in IPF. G9a- and EZH2-mediated H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 result in the recruitment of Dnmts and HDAC-containing complexes <italic>via</italic> HP1 and EZH2/EED, respectively, to the COX-2 promoter, which then leads to or reinforces DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. DNA methylation in turn causes the recruitment of G9a, EZH2, and HDAC-containing complexes through MeCP2 to strengthen H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and histone deacetylation, leading to reinforced epigenetic silencing of the COX-2 gene in IPF. Therefore, G9a- and EZH2-mediated H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 interact with DNA methylation in a bidirectional and mutually dependent manner to reinforce COX-2 epigenetic silencing in IPF. Disruption of any of these epigenetic modifications by inhibition or knockdown of G9a, EZH2, or Dnmt leads to the removal of the other repressive epigenetic modifications, resulting in an active chromatin state and reactivation of COX-2 in IPF.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="z380071497750009"/></fig></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr" id="gloss"><p><def-list><def-item><term id="G1">CBP</term><def><p>cAMP response element binding protein binding protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">ChIP</term><def><p>chromatin immunoprecipitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">CoREST</term><def><p>co-RE1-silencing transcription factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">COX-2</term><def><p>cyclooxygenase-2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">DZNep</term><def><p>3-deazaneplanocin A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">Dnmt</term><def><p>DNA methyltransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">EED</term><def><p>embryonic ectoderm development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">EZH2</term><def><p>enhancer of zeste homolog 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">F-IPF</term><def><p>fibroblast from IPF lung</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G10">F-NL</term><def><p>fibroblast from nonfibrotic lung</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G11">HP1</term><def><p>heterochromatin protein 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G12">HAT</term><def><p>histone acetyltransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G13">HDAC</term><def><p>histone deacetylase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G14">H3K4me3</term><def><p>histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G15">H3K9me2</term><def><p>histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G16">H3K9me3</term><def><p>histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G17">H3K27me3</term><def><p>histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G18">HMT</term><def><p>histone methyltransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G19">IL-1&#x003b2;</term><def><p>interleukn-1&#x003b2;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G20">IPF</term><def><p>idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G21">IP</term><def><p>immunoprecipitate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G22">IP-10</term><def><p>IFN-&#x003b3;-inducible protein of 10 kDa</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G23">MBD</term><def><p>methyl-CpG-binding domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G24">MeCP2</term><def><p>methyl CpG binding protein 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G25">mSin3a</term><def><p>mammalian SIN3 homolog</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G26">MeDIP</term><def><p>methylated DNA immunoprecipitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G27">NCoR</term><def><p>nuclear receptor corepressor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G28">PCAF</term><def><p>p300/CBP-associated factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G29">PcG</term><def><p>polycomb group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G30">PRC</term><def><p>polycomb repressive complex</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G31">PGE<sub>2</sub></term><def><p>prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub></p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G32">siRNA</term><def><p>small interfering RNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G33">TGF&#x003b2;1</term><def><p>transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><ack><p content-type="financial-disclosure">This work was supported by the <funding-source>UK Medical Research Council</funding-source> (grants <award-id>G0600890</award-id> and <award-id>MR/K003259/1</award-id>) and the <funding-source>Wellcome Trust</funding-source> (grant <award-id>088751</award-id>).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
