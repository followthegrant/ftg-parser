We used XGBoost, a classification method known for achieving numerous winning solutions in data analysis competitions, to capture nonlinear relations among many input variables and outcomes using the boosting approach to machine learning. Longitudinal and comprehensive medical check-up data were collected from 25,942 participants who underwent multiple endoscopies from 2006 to 2017 at a single facility in Japan. The participants were classified into a case group (y&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) or a control group (y&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) if gastric cancer was or was not detected, respectively, during a 122-month period. Among 1,431 total participants (89 cases and 1,342 controls), 1,144 (80%) were randomly selected for use in training 10 classification models; the remaining 287 (20%) were used to evaluate the models. The results showed that XGBoost outperformed logistic regression and showed the highest area under the curve value (0.899). Accumulating more data in the facility and performing further analyses including other input variables may help expand the clinical utility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Gastrointestinal cancer</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Novartis Pharma K.K (no reference number)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, and Japan has one of the highest incidences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Long-term <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection, pernicious anaemia and high salt intake can lead to chronic superficial gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis and eventually intestinal epithelial metaplasia, all of which are considered risk factors for the development of gastric cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">It is important to provide accurate, rapid screening for gastric cancer. If a patient is predicted as being at high risk, then (s)he can seek to undertake preventative measures in advance. Conversely, if a patient is predicted as being at low risk, then (s)he can avoid or reduce the frequency of (e.g. annually in Japan) upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations, which are accompanied by potential risks and high screening costs. A large-scale survey of 200,000 individuals who had been endoscopically examined reported a 0.13% adverse complication rate and a 0.004% mortality rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, endoscopic gastric cancer screening has been proposed in several subgroups of patients considered to be at high risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">While various environmental risk and host-related factors have been suggested to be associated with gastric cancer, rapid screening to classify patients as high or low risk of developing gastric cancer in the clinical setting is often provided based on a few main factors: age, familial history and the presence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection or atrophic gastritis.</p><p id="Par5">Some recent studies have demonstrated that new methods such as machine learning and big data mining approaches are effective for improving screening, prediction, biomarker selection and disease diagnosis in the medical field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that comprehensive screening using a combination of numerous factors accumulated every day in hospitals (e.g. biological characteristics, <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection status, endoscopic findings and blood test results) and a successful machine learning technique could lead to more accurate and rapid screening for gastric cancer.</p><p id="Par6">One such advanced and successful machine learning method is XGBoost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. XGBoost uses multiple (hundreds of) classification and regression trees (CARTs), which can learn nonlinear relations among input variables and outcomes in a boosting ensemble manner, to capture and learn nonlinear and complex relations accurately (see the XGBoost subsection for technical details). Linear approaches such as logistic regression are not generally suitable for prediction models with complex correlations; however, multiple risk factors may jointly and nonlinearly help predict the risk of developing gastric cancer. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to clarify the accuracy of a prediction model for the development of gastric cancer using comprehensive longitudinal data and machine learning algorithms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">We considered a classification problem regarding whether a subject would have a future risk of gastric cancer by predicting whether (s)he would be diagnosed with gastric cancer within the next 122 months. To study this, we collected longitudinal and comprehensive medical check-up data from 25,942 participants who underwent multiple endoscopies from 2006 to 2017 at a single facility in Japan (see the Methods section for details of the data collection). We classified the participants into a case group (y&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) or a control group (y&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) if gastric cancer was or was not detected, respectively, during the 122-month period. As a result, 1,431 participants (89 cases and 1,342 controls) were extracted. From the participants, 1,144 (80%) were randomly selected for use in training classification models, and the remaining 287 (20%) were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the constructed models. Classification performance was measured by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and their area under the curve (AUC) values. In addition to the ROC and AUC values, the resulting accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and its confusion matrix determined by a cut-off value of 0.5 were reported. We constructed 10 classification models to address the following two research questions.

Different hyperparameter settings may yield different classification results. XGBoost possesses several hyperparameters (see the Hyperparameter tuning section for details) that should be optimized using training data. To optimize the hyperparameters, we took advantage of the Bayesian optimization (BO) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which enables the automatic selection of a favourable combination of hyperparameters using Gaussian process regression.

Whereas the AUC value (XGB_cv) was monotonically increasing, the AUC value (XGB_test) was not. One of the reasons for this could be the limited amount of test data. However, models A&#x02013;E were observed to have a robust ranking order in terms of AUC values under several hyperparameter updates.</p><p id="Par11">Lastly, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> presents importance scores for each input variable provided by XGBoost, which contribute to the prediction of future gastric cancer. In model E, HbA1c, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), lymphocyte ratio, age, BMI and post-gastrectomy were found to be more important variables. Sex was not an important variable.

Important input variables automatically selected by XGBoost agreed with previous reports, as described in the Discussion section.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Nonlinear machine learning versus linear logistic regression</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Questions</title><p id="Par13">Our second question was whether an advanced and successful nonlinear machine learning method (XGBoost) could be effective for predicting the future gastric cancer compared with a traditional linear method (logistic regression). We aimed to compute the advantages that could be obtained using XGBoost compared with linear logistic regression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><p id="Par14">We compared the nonlinear machine learning technique (XGBoost) with the linear method (logistic regression) as a baseline. In Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, models F&#x02013;J show the results of linear logistic regression, which used the same input variables as XGBoost (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We found that XGBoost outperformed logistic regression when the input variables were increased (models D and I, models E and J). Whereas models A, B, C, F, G and H input only binary variables, models D, E, I and J input many continuous variables. XGBoost was able to capture the nonlinear relations between the outcome and many input variables by learning, and showed superior performance compared with traditional logistic regression. Supplementary Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> to <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> show a comparison between XGBoost and logistic regression in terms of the time course of AUC values under hyperparameter updates by BO. Although XGBoost and logistic regression showed almost the same results in a few input variables (models A, B, C, F, G and H), they showed significant differences when increasing the number of input variables (models D, E, I and J).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Findings</title><p id="Par15">In the task of predicting future gastric cancer risk, the relation between the outcome and many existing clinical markers (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) was nonlinear; thus, by capturing the nonlinearity, XGBoost achieved higher performance than linear logistic regression. Increasing the number of input factors related to gastric cancer and utilizing advanced nonlinear machine learning methods appears to be effective to predict future gastric cancer risk accurately.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par16">Four gastric cancer screening methods are generally performed: upper gastrointestinal series, <italic>H. pylori</italic> serology, serum pepsinogen test and endoscopy. It has been reported that a combination of anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> antibody and serum pepsinogen can accurately predict the development of gastric cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and in Japan, gastric cancer screening is actually performed using this combination. In a previous review, Kim <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> suggested that gastric cancer screening in the U.S. should be stratified by region, age, family history of gastric cancer, <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and gastric conditions (atrophic gastritis/intestinal metaplasia). Comprehensive assessments of multiple risk factors may contribute to the improved accuracy of gastric cancer screening, and previous reports have suggested other factors that may be associated with the risk of developing gastric cancer, such as diabetes and obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Pernicious anaemia has also been suggested to be associated with the presence of gastric cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, differential leukocyte count, including lymphocyte count, may be useful in predicting prognosis or the presence of gastric cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The risk of gastric cancer may increase after gastric surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In our comprehensive prediction models, especially model E, the indicators related to these previous reports&#x02014;HbA1c, MCV, lymphocyte ratio, age, BMI and post-gastrectomy&#x02014;contributed to our calculations; this resulted in higher accuracy compared with prediction model B, which used merely information regarding <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and the presence of atrophic gastritis. This suggests that calculations using comprehensive data with an advanced nonlinear machine learning method improve prediction accuracy.</p><p id="Par17">Our results may provide information for classifying &#x0201c;high-risk patients&#x0201d; who should be recommended for frequent endoscopic screening for gastric cancer, and &#x0201c;low-risk patients&#x0201d; who should not. Few studies have been conducted on the optimal intervals for endoscopic gastric cancer screening, and no guidelines currently exist. Gastric cancer screening is recommended every 1&#x02013;2 years for high-risk patients in many countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. On the other hand, in their review, Kim <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> recommend endoscopic gastric cancer screening every 3&#x02013;5 years for low-risk patients in the U.S. With reference to these previous reports, if an accurate screening test is obtained after expanding and improving the present study, we may recommend gastric cancer screening every 1&#x02013;2 years for high-risk patients and every 3&#x02013;5 years for low-risk patients.</p><p id="Par18">We defined patients for whom no gastric cancer could be detected for 122 months or longer as the control group. We set 122 months as a cut-off because it is the longest period that gastric cancer could be detected in the case group. It is generally thought that cancer initiation begins about 20 years before detection. Thus, the control group may have included patients who have the potential to develop gastric cancer in the future. The control group in our study did not comprise &#x0201c;patients who will not develop gastric cancer&#x0201d;, but rather &#x0201c;patients in whom gastric cancer will not be detected within a few years&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par19">Our research had several limitations. First, in our survey, we did not use information obtained from questionnaires regarding the participants&#x02019; dietary habits. It is widely known that long-term consumption of a high-salt diet is a risk factor for gastric cancer; however, our questionnaire did not collect information on salt consumption. In addition, various other environmental risk factors (e.g. smoking) and host-related factors (e.g. blood type) have been suggested to be associated with gastric cancer. Although such data were not available this time, it seems that with more related variables included, the model performance would increase.</p><p id="Par20">Second, incidentally, some patients without <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection or atrophic gastritis were classified into the case group; the possible reasons for this are described below. It is widely known that patients in the end stage of chronic atrophic gastritis can show conversion from <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive to -negative. The case group also included patients who received therapy for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication. Because our study used the initial examination data, patients with early gastric findings that were not identified may have been included in the case group.</p><p id="Par21">Third, it remains unclear whether the results from our prediction can be generalized to other populations. Our predictions were calculated based on data from 1,431 patients (89 cases and 1,342 controls). It takes approximately 10 years to obtain one (control) sample for the long-term (122 months) prediction of the development of gastric cancer. We are concerned that the amount of data collected is insufficient to generalize our results. Therefore, collaborative multicentre research would be helpful.</p><p id="Par22">Finally, in our study, almost all of the endoscopic findings, including part of the gastric cancer diagnoses, were diagnosed based on macroscopic findings by endoscopists; therefore, these endoscopic findings may include errors and biases. Mechanical diagnoses of stomach findings (such as the deep learning method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> using upper gastrointestinal endoscopic images) may be able to help avoid human errors and biases. Combining deep-learning-based diagnoses and comprehensive screening methods as in the present study is planned for our future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study design and population</title><p id="Par23">This study was conducted as a retrospective, observational, single-centre study. Most of the participants were aged between 40&#x02013;60 years, and were primarily healthy clerical staff and volunteers from among the employees of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) and their family members. The study data were obtained from a comprehensive, periodic health check-up program carried out at the Center for Preventive Medicine, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, from May 2006 to November 2017. In Japan, the Occupational Health and Safety Law requires employers to provide annual health check-ups to ensure the health of their employees. To comply with this law, the Center for Preventive Medicine has been contracted by NTT to provide periodic medical examinations to their employees. This program includes a comprehensive periodic medical examination and many more services than required by law; the data used in this study were collected at the Center for Preventive Medicine as part of this general health check-up program. We did not specifically intend to collect new data for this study, so we extracted the participants&#x02019; past clinical data from the institution&#x02019;s database. The research plan was described on the websites of both our facility and the Center for Preventive Medicine. It was announced that participants could withdraw from the study at any time without negative consequences. As this was a retrospective study, the need for informed consent was waived by the review board. The study protocol was approved by the ethics review board of Juntendo University (No. 2018148) and the institutional ethics committee at the Center for Preventive Medicine (No. 18-106). All procedures were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par24">Each participant&#x02019;s weight and height were measured after they removed their shoes and heavy clothing. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Serum samples were collected from each participant after overnight fasting and immediately subjected to biochemical analysis. The Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) HbA1c values were converted to National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program values using the formula developed by the JDS: HbA<sub>1c</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;[HbA<sub>1c</sub>(JDS)(%)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1.02&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.25(%)]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Screening using esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed by endoscopy specialists belonging to the NTT Medical Center Tokyo. A diagnosis of gastric cancer was given when gastric cancer was strongly suspected by the endoscopic findings, or when adenocarcinoma was identified in biopsy specimens. Diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was based on the detection of <italic>H. pylori</italic>-specific antibodies in serum. <italic>H. pylori</italic>-specific immunoglobulin G antibody titres were measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Eiken Chem Corp., Tokyo, Japan).

During that period, 89 patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer, with 76 being identified as having adenocarcinoma based on biopsy specimens, and 13 strongly suspected of having gastric cancer based on endoscopic findings. The maximum examination period until the development of gastric cancer identified in the 89 patients was 122 months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par25">Data from each participant&#x02019;s first health check-up were used to predict whether (s)he would later be diagnosed with gastric cancer during the examination period.

We defined the case group (y&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) as patients with detected gastric cancer within 122 months (89 patients), and the control group (y&#x02009;=&#x02009;0) as the negation: patients with no detected gastric cancer at 122 months or longer (1,342 patients). The participants could be classified into three subject categories: X, Y and Z.

We used XGBoost to classify subjects as high or low risk in terms of developing gastric cancer. XGBoost (or GTB) can capture nonlinear relations among the outcome and input variables by sequentially learning multiple CARTs; this jointly helps detect early signs of gastric cancer. CARTs possess parameters that need to be learned, such as various tree structure options and leaf node weights. XGBoost automatically learns multiple CARTs with these parameters by optimising a loss function using gradient methods. In addition, XGBoost includes several hyperparameters that need to be tuned, as described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Evaluation</title><p id="Par28">A trained classification model outputs a probability value [0&#x02013;1] of the risk of developing gastric cancer for each participant.

We report a confusion matrix (true positive, false negative, false positive, true negative) at the cut-off value determined by the probability value of 0.5 (i.e. if the probability value &#x02265;0.5, then the patient is classified as being at risk; otherwise as low-risk).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Hyperparameter tuning: bayesian optimization (BO)</title><p id="Par29">XGBoost includes several hyperparameters that need to be tuned, including the maximum depth of regression trees, number of weak learners (CARTs), subsample ratios of columns and training instances for constructing each tree, partitioning-leaf-node parameters (gamma), imbalance parameters, learning rate (eta) and regularization parameters (lambda and alpha). The hyperparameter settings affect the performance of XGBoost. We optimized the hyperparameters to maximize the mean AUC value computed from 5-fold CV on the training data. Specifically, the training data were randomly divided into five subsets: four were used for training XGBoost and the other was used for validation. An ROC curve and AUC value could be evaluated from the validation subset. This procedure was repeated five times with different validation subsets, and then the mean AUC value was computed by averaging the five AUC values. We used the BO method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> to maximize automatically the mean AUC value (AUC-CV). BO iteratively suggests favourable hyperparameter values that effectively increase the objective function (AUC-CV) by learning the previously observed pairs of hyperparameters and their AUC-CV values. After identifying the favourable hyperparameter values, XGBoost was trained using the entire training dataset. The final ROC and AUC values were then evaluated using the test data (AUC-Test). Supplementary Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> to <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> show the time courses of the monotonically increased AUC-CV values and resulting AUC-Test values for each model A&#x02013;J as a function of iterations of BO explorations for hyperparameters.
