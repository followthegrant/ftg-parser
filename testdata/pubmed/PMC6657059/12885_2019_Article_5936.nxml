Despite a variety of advanced therapeutic approaches, including liver resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, or molecular targeted therapy, the prognosis of some HCC is still poor. Thus, it is urgent to understand the molecular mechanism of HCC tumorigenesis to explore novel biomarkers for HCC prognosis, which will promote the development of therapeutic strategy for HCC patients.</p><p id="Par17">Pseudogene, a subclass of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are considered as genomic loci that resemble real gene, but lost some functionality because they are lack of protein-coding ability because of disabling mutation, lack of transcription, or their inability to encode RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, recent studies have revealed that pseudogene-derived lncRNAs play important roles in cellular process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Accumulating evidence indicates that lncRNAs, longer than 200 nucleotides in length and no protein coding potentials, exert crucial roles in pathological process, including cancer development and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For example, LincDUSP regulates the colon cancer cell cycle progression and reduces the susceptibility to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which is upregulated in colon cancer. LncRNA00152 promotes glioma cell proliferation and invasion via the regulation of miR-16, functioning as an oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules, 22 nucleotides in length, and act as important regulatory modulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through the complete or incomplete base pairs between miRNAs and their targets&#x02019; mRNA 3&#x02019;UTR, resulting in the target mRNA degradation or translational repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. MiRNAs are reported to involved in multiple cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Bioinformatics algorithms including miRCODE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mircode.org/">http://www.mircode.org/</ext-link>) suggest that miRNAs can interact with lncRNAs. A series of studies indicate that lncRNAs serve as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) by sponging miRNAs, and modulate the targets of miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For instance, miR-190 suppresses the EMT of hepatoma cells by targeting lncRNA treRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. LncRNA SNHG16 promotes the glioma cell proliferation and suppresses cell apoptosis via sponging miR-4518 and upregulating its target RPMI5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. MEG3 inhibits human pancreatic endocrine tumor cell growth and metastasis through acting as a ceRNA of miR-183 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The pseudogene-derived lncRNA PTTG3P has been reported to act as an oncogene in gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], but the molecular mechanism how PTTG3P interacts with miRNAs in HCC remains poor.</p><p id="Par18">In this study, we found that PTTG3P was upregulated in HCC.

In this study, we found that pseudogene-derived LncRNA PTTG3P was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells, and high PTTG3P level was related to tumor size and metastasis. Knockdown of PTTG3P suppressed cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis, functioning as an oncogene. In line with some data obtained in our study, previous research shows that PTTG3P is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues, and promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo, functioning as an independent negative prognostic biomarker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Another study indicates that PTTG3P is upregulated in HCC tissues and promotes cell growth and metastasis through activating PI3K/Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the miRNA involved in PTTG3P-mediated HCC development is not revealed.</p><p id="Par43">As gene regulators, LncRNAs modulate gene expression via a variety of mechanism, and one of the main mechanism is to harbor miRNA to serve as a sponge to up or downregulate miRNA expression. In this study, the bioinformatics analysis indicated the potential interaction between miR-383 and PTTG3P. Luciferase assay validated that PTTG3P was a direct target of miR-383, together with the RNA pull-down and RIP assays, and miR-383 was downregulated in HCC tissues. MiR-383 modulated the functions of PTTG3P in tumor malignant phenotypes. LncRNA plays crucial roles partially via acting as a ceRNA and modulating the expression of miRNA targets as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Accordingly, as a sponge of miR-383, PTTG3P upregulated the mRNA and protein expressions of miR-383 targets, CCND1 and PARP2, while mutant PTTG3P (the binding sites between miR-383 and PTTG3P were mutated) did not affect CCND1 and PARP2 expression levels, as well as the luciferase intensity. CCND1 and PARP2 are reported to be involved in tumor development and act as oncogenes. For example, CCND1 promotes the colon cancer development via PI3K/Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

MiR-383 suppresses cervical cancer cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis by inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway via the downregulating of PARP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In line with the findings in the above stidues, our data showed that knockdown of CCND1 and PARP2 suppressed the phophorylation of PI3K and Akt, similar to that of PTTG3P knockdown, while miR-383 inhibition can restore the inhibitory effects of PTTG3P knockdown on OI3K/Akt pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">In summary, we identified a PTTG3P-miR-383-CCND1/PARP2 axis in HCC pathogenesis.
