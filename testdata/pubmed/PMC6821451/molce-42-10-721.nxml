The selected aptamers were able to inhibit the interaction of NS1 with tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), and suppression of NS1 enabled retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) to be ubiquitinated regularly by TRIM25. Additional luciferase reporter assay and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) experiments demonstrated that suppression of NS1 by the selected aptamers induced IFN production. It is noted that viral replication was also inhibited through IFN induction in the presence of the selected aptamers. These results suggest that the isolated aptamers are strongly expected to be new therapeutic agents against influenza infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aptamer</kwd><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>non-structural 1</kwd><kwd>systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Influenza is a serious health threat causing occasional pandemics and seasonal epidemics. The causative agents, influenza viruses, belong to the family of <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> and have single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome of 8 segments. Thus far, influenza is classified on the subtypes of 18 hemagglutinins and 11 neuraminidases (<xref rid="b22-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To prevent the amplification of influenza, the host cells initiate innate immune response by recognizing conserved motif or pathogen-associated molecule patterns of incoming pathogen. This innate immunity is accomplished by pattern-recognition receptors such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs) (<xref rid="b16-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Kaisho and Akira, 2006</xref>) or retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) of the host cells (<xref rid="b25-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2004</xref>), followed by production of antiviral cytokine interferons (IFNs). To evade host&#x02019;s innate immune response, influenza has evolved a few strategies for viral replication. Influenza NS1 is known to be one of the most important proteins to counteract the antiviral IFN production of the host.</p><p>NS1 is encoded by segment 8 of the influenza and range in size 217&#x02013;237 amino acids. NS1 is comprised of two functional domains, N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) and C-terminal effector domain (ED). RBD, amino acids 1&#x02013;73 of NS1, forms a six-helical homodimer, and its major role is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding, thereby blocking IFN induction on infection (<xref rid="b21-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Pichlmair et al., 2006</xref>). ED also dimerizes and binds several cellular proteins (<xref rid="b1-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Aramini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b13-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Hale et al., 2008</xref>), which is responsible for sequence variations of different virus strains. In fact, NS1 has multiple functions in infected cells. Of the various functions, the major role of NS1 is the disruption of host cell innate immune system, and inhibits the induction of IFN (<xref rid="b12-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="b17-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Kochs et al., 2007</xref>). Thus far, there have been many attempts to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which NS1 suppresses the IFN production. One explanation of the NS1 function is sequestration of viral RNA, which leads to inhibition of main viral RNA sensor RIG-I in the host cell (<xref rid="b6-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Chien et al., 2004</xref>). Strain-specific direct interaction between NS1 and RIG-I was also suggested. <xref rid="b15-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Jureka et al. (2015)</xref> demonstrated that RBD of 1918 H1N1 NS1 interacted directly with second caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of RIG-I, but no interaction was observed in case of Udorn H3N2 strain. In addition to direct interaction, NS1 has been shown to inhibit tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination, which suppresses the RIG-I signaling pathway (<xref rid="b9-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Gack et al., 2009</xref>). Regarding the RIG-I ubiquitination, two kinds of mechanism were suggested. After recognition of viral RNA harboring 5&#x02032;-triphosphate by RIG-I, CARD is activated by either TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination (<xref rid="b10-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Gack et al., 2008</xref>) or binding of polyubiquitin chains that are previously synthesized by TRIM25 (<xref rid="b26-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is not clear how NS1 antagonizes IFN induction exactly at present. Because of the important role of NS1 during viral infection, many attempts have been made to develop antiviral therapeutics targeting NS1. This involves antiviral compounds (<xref rid="b8-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Engel, 2013</xref>), antisense oligonucleotides (<xref rid="b24-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), nucleic acid aptamers (<xref rid="b23-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2013</xref>), and so on.</p><p>In the present study, we isolated RNA aptamers specific to influenza NS1 protein. Because nucleic acid aptamers have comparable binding affinities with corresponding antibodies, they are regarded as potential candidates for the development of therapeutic agents or diagnostic probes (<xref rid="b4-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Brody and Gold, 2000</xref>). The selected RNA aptamers bind to NS1 specifically and inhibit the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25. This leads to recover TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination and subsequent IFN induction. We also found that viral replication was suppressed in the presence of aptamers, which suggests that the selected RNA aptamers can be developed as a useful therapeutic agent in future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293T (human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line) and Raw264.7 (murine macrophage cell line) cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 U penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure</title><p>The RNA library was generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription using 109 bp DNA library containing two primer regions and 40 random nucleotides as described previously (<xref rid="b14-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al., 2008</xref>).

Lane 2 shows that TRIM25 interacts with NS1 in the absence of aptamer. However, the interaction between TRIM25 and NS1 was suppressed in the presence of aptamers (lanes 3&#x02013;6). Whereas we were not able to detect any band intensity in the presence of 2 &#x003bc;g R-1 aptamer (lane 3), band intensities decreased as the amount of R-2 aptamer increased (lanes 5 and 6).

It indicates that the selected aptamers inhibit the interaction of TRIM25 with NS1 in a dose-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Recovery of TRIM25 mediated RIG-I ubiquitination through inhibition of NS1 by the selected aptamers</title><p>We hypothesized that TRIM25 can ubiquitinate the RIG-I regularly if NS1 is not working properly through inhibition by the selected aptamers. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether the selected aptamers inhibit the function of the NS1 and lead to regular TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination by carrying out the <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay (<xref rid="f3-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). When RIG-I was incubated with TRIM25, RIG-I was ubiquitinated and not ubiquitinated in the absence (lane 2) and presence of NS1 (lane 3), respectively, which is consistent with previous report (<xref rid="b11-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Gack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b9-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). However, if we included the selected aptamers in the reaction mixtures, RIG-I was able to interact with TRIM25 and ubiquitinated without being interfered by NS1 (lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that the selected aptamers suppress the NS1 activity and TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination occurs regularly.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of IFN by the selected RNA aptamers</title><p>Because TRIM25 mediated RIG-I ubiquitination was observed by suppressing the NS1, we performed cell based NF-&#x003ba;B luciferase reporter assay to determine whether the selected aptamers promote the induction of IFN. <xref rid="f4-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> shows that NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity was increased as the amount of the aptamers increased. HEK293T cells transfected with an NS1 vector (MOCK) showed about 60% decrease of luciferase activity compared to positive control (Na&#x000ef;ve). However, dose-dependent increase of luciferase activity was observed after addition of the selected aptamers. Additional quantitative RT-PCR experiment showed that the induction of IFN was recovered by the selected aptamers. After HEK293T cells were transfected with an NS1 vector, various amounts of the selected aptamers were added and the total RNA was extracted. Then, qPCR was performed to quantify the cDNA using IFN-&#x003b2; and &#x003b2;-actin-specific primers. The result showed that mRNA expression level increased as the amount of the selected aptamers increased (<xref rid="f4-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), similar to the result of luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the selected RNA aptamers binds to NS1, and recovery of RIG-I ubiquitination by TRIM25 induces IFN production.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of influenza virus replication by the RNA aptamers</title><p>To determine whether the selected aptamers inhibit the viral replication, Raw264.7 cells harboring GFP were treated with the aptamers prior to viral infection, followed by measurement of fluorescence. <xref rid="f5-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows that the selected aptamers can suppress the viral replication dramatically even in the presence of 100 ng of aptamers (approximately less than half of fluorescence unit compared to 0 ng treated). When we added 200 ng of aptamers, the fluorescence level already reached to level of a positive control (IFN-&#x003b2;). The GFP relative unit decreased in a hyperbolic manner with increasing amount of aptamers providing a 50% inhibitory concentration of 48.20 &#x000b1; 6.47 ng/ml (R-1, equivalent to 1.66 &#x000b1; 0.22 nM) and 55.07 &#x000b1; 4.36 ng/ml (R-2, equivalent to 1.90 &#x000b1; 0.15 nM), respectively. However, we were not able to detect any cytotoxicity regardless of the amount of aptamer used (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To cope with invasion of incoming pathogens, host cells have a self-defense system, innate immune response, such as TLRs or RIG-I like receptors. One of the primary roles in innate immunity is induction of IFN, antiviral cytokine of the host cells. Most of viruses have evolved strategies to circumvent the host&#x02019;s innate immune response by inhibition of IFN production. Influenza also has such an IFN blocking system, NS1, which is able to antagonize IFN induction by preventing IRF-3 and NF-&#x003ba;B from activation. Therefore, NS1 is regarded as a good target for development of therapeutic agents such as small organic compounds and nucleic acids (<xref rid="b2-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Basu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b23-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2013</xref>). Regarding the molecular mechanism how NS1 suppresses the IFN production, as of yet, precise mechanism remains unclear even though many attempts have been made. However, of the suggested mechanisms relevant to RIG-I pathway, it is most likely that NS1 interferes with RIG-I signaling pathway by inhibiting the RIG-I ubiquitination by E3 ligase TRIM25 (<xref rid="b10-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Gack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b26-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we isolated two RNA aptamers that specifically bind to and inhibit the function of NS1. One hundred nine bases ssRNA pool containing 40 random sequences in the central region was constructed by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription using DNA library. When we analyzed binding affinities of the selected aptamers, about 1 nM <italic>K</italic><italic><sub>d</sub></italic> values were obtained. In addition, both aptamers showed 90% sequence identity each other. In fact, we performed similar experiments to select the ssDNA aptamers specific to NS1 and reported previously (<xref rid="b23-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2013</xref>). When we compared the binding affinities of RNA aptamers with DNA aptamer (18.91 &#x000b1; 3.95 nM in case of ssDNA aptamer), RNA aptamers showed almost ten times higher <italic>K</italic><italic><sub>d</sub></italic> value, indicating that RNA aptamer is better binding agent than DNA aptamer. This is consistent with the fact that RNA can accommodate more variable structures than DNA. When the two selected RNA aptamers were analyzed structurally using Mfold, the central 40 random sequences were shown to form a stem-loop-stem with a small hairpin. Because three-dimensional information is not available at present, further investigation will be necessary to determine exactly how the stem-loop-stem structure plays a role in NS1 binding. Determination of the binding region of the selected RNA aptamers to NS1 showed similar binding pattern with the case of ssDNA aptamer (<xref rid="s1-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), which was published previously (<xref rid="b23-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2013</xref>). RBD, not ED, of NS1 is the region to which the selected RNA aptamers were bound, and R38 amino acid is necessary for RNA aptamer binding. The reason why ssRNA and ssDNA aptamers showed similar binding to NS1 is not clear at present. According to the prediction of secondary structure by Mfold, the two kinds of nucleic acid aptamers do not show structural resemblance, although both of them inhibit the function of NS1. Thus far, crystal structure of each domain of NS1, RBD and ED, has been determined (<xref rid="b3-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Bornholdt and Prasad, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b18-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1997</xref>). However, considering the three-dimensional structure of full-length wild type NS1 is not available as of yet, further investigation will be necessary to understand the protein structure-aptamer binding relationship.</p><p>We carried out pull down assay to determine whether the selected RNA aptamers can inhibit the direct interaction between NS1 and TRIM25. NS1 is a multifunctional protein and known to interact with more than 50 proteins (<xref rid="b20-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Marc, 2014</xref>). Of many protein partners of the NS1, TRIM25 is involved in RIG-I signaling pathway, and sequestration of TRIM25 by NS1 leads to block the activation of RIG-I CARD. Although interaction mode is not clear in the present study, the selected aptamers were able to successfully inhibit the interaction of NS1 with TRIM25. This implies that the aptamers is effective in protecting the TRIM25 from NS1, thereby promoting the induction of IFN. We further investigated the effect of the selected aptamers on the RIG-I ubiquitination, which is necessary for RIG-I CARD to bind to a downstream protein partner, MAVS, of mitochondria (<xref rid="b7-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2008</xref>). It has been shown that NS1 blocks the RIG-I signaling pathway by inhibiting the TRIM25-mediated RIG-I CARD ubiquitination, which leads to suppression of IFN induction (<xref rid="b9-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Gack et al., 2009</xref>). Our results revealed that the selected aptamers specifically bind to and block the function of NS1, thereby recovering the regular function of TRIM25 and subsequent RIG-I ubiquitination (<xref rid="f3-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore, this is consistent with the result of previous report (<xref rid="b9-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Gack et al., 2009</xref>). After verification of successful introduction of the selected aptamers into HEK293T cells by confocal images (<xref rid="s1-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) and FACS analysis (<xref rid="s1-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>), further investigations also showed that the selected aptamers can induce IFN (<xref rid="f4-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and subsequent block the viral replication (<xref rid="f5-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Our results indicate that a blocking the NS1 function is one of the most promising strategies to inhibit the viral replication. In fact, in addition to nucleic acid aptamer, many attempts have been made to discover small molecule-based NS1 antagonists targeting the interaction of NS1-dsRNA or NS1-protein partners (<xref rid="b8-molce-42-10-721" ref-type="bibr">Engel, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we showed that the recovery of TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination is sufficient to induce IFN. Although it is not certain that the selected aptamers can inhibit the interaction of NS1 with dsRNA or protein partners of the host other than TRIM25 at present, we think that the binding of aptamers may cause a conformational change of NS1 and destroy the binding ability with binding partners, which will be the topic of our future study. Here, we simply focused on NS1-TRIM25 interaction and RIG-I ubiquitination. By selection of ssRNA aptamers specific to NS1, TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination was recovered, and subsequent IFN induction and inhibition of viral replication were observed. Therefore, based on our results, we expect that more elaborated aptamer-based therapeutic agent will be developed through further studies.</p></sec><sec
