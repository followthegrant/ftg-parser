Many forms of DR exist, including restriction of calories, specific macronutrients or micronutrients, and the timing of access to food <xref rid="bib132" ref-type="bibr">(Greer and Brunet, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Honjoh et al, 2009</xref>,). Along with extended longevity, DR increases resistance to stress and improves other parameters of health from yeast to mammals <xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">(Mair and Dillin, 2008)</xref>, indicating that physiological responses to DR are evolutionary conserved. It is not surprising, then, that much attention has focused on understanding how animals adapt to DR. Identifying genetic programs that control the health benefits of DR guides efforts to develop drug mimetics, which would replace extreme dietary interventions to increase healthy longevity. To support such efforts, investigators need to understand the genes involved in adapting to DR so they can determine which ones impart benefits associated with this regimen.</p><p>Several molecular pathways and cellular processes are important for the effects of DR, especially those involved in nutrient sensing and energy status <xref rid="bib134" ref-type="bibr">(Guarente, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr">Kapahi et al, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">Kenyon, 2005)</xref>. For example, energy sensing via AMP kinase and a greater role for energy production through aerobic respiration, along with changes to DNA and chromatin, are among the adaptive changes in response to DR (<xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">Vellai et al, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Apfeld, 2004</xref>). Highly conserved pathways shown to have roles in increased life span under DR include the insulin/insulin-like signaling (ILS) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways. In response to changes in nutrient availability, the ILS pathways modulate cellular processes and coordinate responses in different tissues through hormone signaling (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al, 2001</xref>), whereas the TOR pathway can modulate cellular responses by directly sensing nutrients within the cell (<xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Rohde et al, 2001</xref>). Changes in transcription associated with these pathways has been pivotal in resolving connections to biological processes and identifying new targets involved in increased life span (<xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Weindruch et al, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Han &#x00026; Hickey, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">Zeier et al, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Palgunow et al, 2012</xref>). However, studies have shown that these pathways also direct translation (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Kimball et al, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Long et al, 2002</xref>), including selective translation of specific mRNA species (<xref rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr">Zid et al, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">McColl et al, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Thoreen et al, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The need to account for different levels of gene regulation is exemplified in a number of high-profile studies showing that mRNA fluctuations, in general, account for less than half of the variability in corresponding proteins from yeast to humans (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ghaemmaghami et al, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">de Godoy et al, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Schwanh&#x000e4;usser et al, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelm et al, 2014</xref>). Thus, a comprehensive understanding of gene expression remodeling that takes place under DR requires an approach that accounts for transcript abundance and the efficiency with which individual transcripts are used to synthesize new protein. This approach provides the basis for development of hypotheses and tests of mechanisms that control gene expression at different levels. For example, it allows for the identification of putative sequence motifs within mRNA (i.e., <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements) and corresponding miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (i.e., <italic>trans-</italic>acting factors) targeting these motifs to ascertain their roles in translational control.</p><p>Today, methods involving polysome profiling (<xref rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr">Zong et al, 1999</xref>) and ribosome footprinting (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ingolia et al, 2009</xref>) provide information that can be used to help distinguish forms of posttranscriptional regulation. By isolating mRNA that is associated with actively translating ribosomes, polysome profiling allows the translation state of individual transcripts to be quantified between treatments. In comparison, ribosome footprinting allows for the distribution of the ribosome along mRNA to be quantified by sequencing only the regions of transcripts protected from nuclease digestion by bound ribosomes. These technologies have been applied in yeast to characterize the role of 5&#x02032; UTRs in transcript stability and translatability (<xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Ringn&#x000e9;r &#x00026; Krogh, 2005</xref>), to pinpoint exonic polymorphisms in mRNA that affect translation, and to analyze stress-induced changes in translation of specific transcripts (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Lackner et al, 2012</xref>). Polysome profiling and ribosome footprinting have also been used to consider isoform-specific translational regulation (<xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Sterne-Weiler et al, 2013</xref>) and to assess selective mRNA translation during mechanistic TOR inhibition in cell culture (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Olshen et al, 2013</xref>). These studies and others like them have started to resolve the importance of posttranscriptional mechanisms in regulating gene expression. However, there is still a paucity of information on the relationships that exist between genes controlled transcriptionally, translationally, or both in mediating the adaptive response to DR. Understanding these relationships is key to understanding how DR promotes healthy aging.</p><p>In the following study, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> adult nematodes were subjected to a form of DR involving food dilution that results in robust life span increase (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al, 2009</xref>). Subsequently, animals were assessed for gene expression changes according to total and polysome-associated mRNA to differentiate transcriptional and posttranscriptional inputs. mRNAs differentially associated with polysomes under DR were investigated in silico for characteristics that could explain changes in gene expression at this level. Genes transcriptionally and/or translationally down-regulated under DR were screened using RNAi for effects on life span under fully fed conditions. Results reveal novel genes and connections with forms of posttranscriptional regulation important for increased life span under DR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3"><title>Transcriptional responses to DR implicate muscle and metabolic adaptation</title><p>Using food dilution (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al, 2009</xref>) to impose DR starting at day 1 of adulthood extended median life span of <italic>C. elegans</italic> by &#x0223c;40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A</xref>).

Like age-related sarcopenia in humans, locomotion and the ability to transduce force generated by muscles is lost with age in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Hahm et al, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Rollins et al, 2017</xref>). Under DR, the genes encoding thick filaments (<italic>unc-54</italic> and <italic>myo-1</italic>) and movement-coordinating troponins (<italic>pat-10</italic>, <italic>tni-3</italic>, and <italic>tnt-4</italic>) of muscle sarcomeres were up-regulated (Table S2), suggesting that they may be involved in the maintenance of locomotion with age in DR restricted animals. In line with this, <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants with defective <italic>unc-54</italic> activity have reduced capacity to generate movement force (<xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">V&#x000e1;rkuti et al, 2012</xref>). In addition, overexpression of <italic>pat-10</italic> leads to increased actin filament stability, resistance to protein unfolding stress, and life span (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Baird et al, 2014</xref>). Among the genes with roles in oxidation reduction were members of the cytochrome P450 family (<italic>cyp-34A9</italic>, <italic>cyp-35A2</italic>, <italic>cyp-33C3</italic>, and <italic>cyp-34A4</italic>). Cytochrome P450 isozymes can serve in the metabolism of xenobiotics and other toxins (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ding &#x00026; Kaminsky, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Lindblom &#x00026; Dodd, 2006</xref>), which might otherwise impinge on longevity.</p><p>Defense response genes were down-regulated, including those encoding neuropeptide antimicrobials (e.g., <italic>npl-29</italic> and <italic>npl-31</italic>) in addition to <italic>tol-1</italic>, the only Toll-like receptor in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Although efficacy of defense responses is usually improved in DR animals, diminished expression of these genes may be because of reduced microbe sensing resulting from the form of DR itself, which involves dilution of their bacterial food source. The transcription factor GO term included regulators of embryonic development, which were expected to be decreased given the negative effect of DR on reproduction. These included nuclear hormone receptors (e.g., <italic>nhr-2</italic> and <italic>nhr-112</italic>), cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (<italic>cdk-8</italic>), a homeobox factor (<italic>ceh-40</italic>), and a HAND bHLH factor important for tissue differentiation (<italic>hnd-1</italic>), among others (Table S2). The heat shock transcription factor gene <italic>hsf-1</italic> was also down-regulated, presumably because of globally reduced protein synthesis, which requires <italic>hsf-1</italic>&#x02013;dependent chaperones to direct the folding of nascent proteins.</p><p>In a previous study, transcript levels were analyzed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> subjected to DR based on intermittent fasting (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Honjoh et al, 2009</xref>). We compared our list of differentially regulated genes from bacterial dilution with those obtained by <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Honjoh et al (2009)</xref> using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1B</xref>). This analysis demonstrated a significant (FDR &#x0003c; 0.001) enrichment of both up- and down-regulated genes between the two datasets despite differences in dietary regimes and quantification methods (i.e., next-generation sequencing versus microarray). To gain insight into the transcriptional differences between DR by food dilution and intermittent fasting, differentially expressed genes in common between DR methods and those unique to food dilution were subjected to GO analysis. Terms related to oxidation/reduction and muscle contraction were up-regulated in common among both forms of DR (Table S2). Among down-regulated genes, terms in common pertained to defense and immune response. However, the term &#x0201c;regulation of transcription&#x0201d; was unique to down-regulated genes in the food dilution DR dataset (Table S2). Together, results demonstrate that many of the same processes regulated transcriptionally by intermittent fasting are also regulated by food dilution in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of which responses to DR are species specific and which are conserved among different species, we compared our differential expression results with a meta-analysis performed by <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Han and Hickey (2005)</xref>. In the meta-analysis, they compared differently expressed genes in mouse, rat, pig, monkey, yeast, and fly subjected to DR. Interestingly, their study showed a lack of overlap in expression changes of specific genes in common to all these species. However, GO analysis did point to the conservation of biological processes involved in adaptive responses to DR like those observed in the present study. Specifically, the meta-analysis reported the enrichment of genes annotated with the term metabolism among all animals listed. In addition, there was a high level of overlap for terms related to stress/immune response and regulation of transcription that were the same or similar in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1F</xref>). These similarities imply evolutionary conservation of transcriptional responses to DR at the level of biological processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Translation frequently offsets transcriptional down-regulation under DR</title><p>To differentiate transcriptional and translational regulation of gene expression, we analyzed the relative abundance of the 8,301 quantified genes within the total and polysome-associated mRNA pools. Under AL conditions, 82% of genes had similar abundance between pools. The remaining 18% showed a twofold or greater difference between pools and were considered to be translationally regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>). Thus, genes with greater relative abundance among polysomes than total mRNA were considered to be translationally promoted, whereas those with reduced polysomal association were considered translationally suppressed. In contrast to AL conditions, 34% of genes were translationally regulated under DR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>). This is reflected by reduced correlation between total and translated mRNA pools (r = 0.88 for AL versus 0.83 for DR, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, <italic>t</italic> test of Fisher r-z transformed coefficients).

Partitioning around medoids was used to cluster genes into the optimal number of groups using the gap statistic <xref rid="bib135" ref-type="bibr">(Tibshirani et al, 2001)</xref>. These genes were optimally clustered into three groups as seen in a principle compoment analysis plot that explained 97.6% of the dataset variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2A</xref>). The relative expressions of all 1,665 genes for total and translated mRNA under AL and DR are shown for each of the three clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2B&#x02013;D</xref>. The first cluster consisted of 530 genes exhibiting down-regulated transcript levels under DR that were partly offset by positive selective translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2B</xref>). The second group contained 492 genes lacking transcriptional changes with modest negative translation changes under AL that became more negative under DR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2C</xref>). The third cluster contained 643 genes that were essentially unchanged transcriptionally under both conditions but that become translationally promoted under DR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig S2D</xref>). Although other modes of regulation exist under DR, these clusters account for the majority of expression changes. Thus, it appears that there are three fundamental roles of translational regulation that occur under this DR regimen: to oppose transcriptional down regulation (cluster 1), to reinforce translational suppression tendency observed under AL (cluster 2), and to increase expression during DR in the absence of transcriptional changes (cluster 3).</p><fig fig-type="supplementary-material" id="figS2" specific-use="collapsible" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure S2.</label><caption><title>Predominant modes of regulation under DR from unbiased clustering of genes that only exhibit translational regulation under DR.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Genes selectively translated under DR were optimally clustered into three groups and visualized in a 2D principle component analysis plot representing 97.6% of the variation in the dataset. <bold>(B&#x02013;D)</bold> The mean centered expression of genes in clusters 1 through 3, respectively.

To determine which genes exhibit net translation changes between conditions, we devised the Differential Polysome Association Ratio (DPAR). This is calculated by taking the ratio of translated to total mRNA under DR and dividing by the same ratio under AL for a given gene. It should be noted that, while global translation rates are lower under DR, DPAR is only influenced by relative changes in the distribution of specific mRNAs within polysomes and total mRNA. A significant (FDR &#x0003c; 0.5) twofold or greater change in translation was observed for 482 translationally promoted genes and 116 translationally suppressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref> and Table S3). A threshold of twofold change in polysome association was used to focus the analysis on genes experiencing large changes in translational regulation and comes with the tradeoff of potentially missing smaller but still biologically relevant regulation. Interestingly, the tendency for translationally changed genes to be up-regulated under DR was opposite of the tendency for transcriptionally changed genes, which were much more frequently down-regulated (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>). This led us to investigate how often translation offsets transcriptional regulation under DR. Of the genes that were translationally promoted under DR, 58% lacked significant transcript level changes and 40% had significantly decreased transcript level changes, leaving very few genes that were both transcriptionally and translationally promoted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E</xref>). Given that only 12.5% of quantifiable genes in our dataset displayed significant transcriptional regulation, the fact that 33% of translationally promoted genes were significantly down-regulated at the transcript level was, itself, significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>, Fisher's exact test). Conversely, 90% of translationally down-regulated genes showed no change in transcription. The frequent opposition between translation and transcription may help explain numerous studies showing disparate results between gene transcription and protein expression (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ghaemmaghami et al, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Schwanh&#x000e4;usser et al, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelm et al, 2014</xref>).</p><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM3"><p>Table S3 <inline-supplementary-material mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" mimetype="application" xlink:href="LSA-2018-00281_TableS3.xlsx" id="d35e757" content-type="local-data">List of quantifiable genes translationally promoted or repressed twofold or more under DR.

To address mechanisms governing translation, and a possible connection to transcriptional regulation, we investigated the roles of operons and <italic>trans</italic>-splicing. The genome of <italic>C. elegans</italic> contains operons consisting of two or more genes that are transcribed together but separated posttranscriptionally and translated individually (<xref rid="bib130" ref-type="bibr">Zorio et al, 1994</xref>). We hypothesized that expression of genes of the same operon may require compensatory translational regulation in response to changes in nutrient availability. Using previously established operon annotations (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al, 2011</xref>), we calculated the percent of genes in operons among all coding genes and compared this with the percent found among translationally promoted or suppressed DPAR genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>). Of the 482 promoted genes, a significantly smaller proportion (10%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, Fisher's exact test) were organized in operons compared with 8,301 coding genes (18%) with quantifiable expression in our dataset.

This observed enrichment suggested that the translational suppression observed under DR may serve to suppress the expression of one or more genes that are co-transcribed at levels higher than needed under DR. This pattern was inverted among the majority of translationally promoted genes, which tended not to be associated with operons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A</xref>) and which, instead, tended to be associated with transcriptionally suppressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E</xref>).

The average 3&#x02032; UTR length of coding genes quantified in this dataset was only 14.6% of average CDS length, indicating that RNA editing is enriched within this region. To address whether editing of 3&#x02032; UTRs influences translation rates, linear regression was performed for CDS-edited and 3&#x02032; UTR-edited genes with respect to translational regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4D</xref>).

No significant correlation was observed for genes CDS-edited messages (r = 0.195, <italic>P</italic> = 0.41).

In accordance with results for mean editing frequency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig S3A</xref>, the editing frequency at both sites was lower in the translated fraction under DR, suggesting that transcripts edited at these loci are translationally suppressed.

Conversely, the expression of <italic>adr-2</italic> was slightly increased under DR.

Predictions of conserved miRNA family targets within 3&#x02032; UTRs were taken from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://targetscanworm.org">targetscanworm.org</ext-link> (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Jan et al, 2011</xref>).

No significant enrichment of targets was found among repressed DPAR genes. The most commonly observed function of miRNAs is silencing gene expression either through degradation of the target or through translational suppression (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Catalanotto et al, 2016</xref>). Therefore, if these miRNAs are playing a role in promoting translation under DR, we predict that it is because their expression is down-regulated. To examine this, we quantified the expression of each miRNA in the enriched families under DR using qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref> and Table S9). In response to DR, <italic>mir-58</italic> and <italic>mir-80/81/82</italic> were significantly down-regulated as compared with AL. The other miRNA did not exhibit a significant change in expression.

AS can lead to transcripts with premature termination codons (PTCs) that are targeted for degradation by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), an mRNA quality control surveillance mechanism that degrades aberrant mRNA. However, the full range of NMD targets extends beyond aberrant gene products, and some studies suggest that AS and NMD are coupled (AS-NMD) to enable regulation of specific genes via translation (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Barberan-Soler et al, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ge &#x00026; Porse, 2014</xref>). Exactly how NMD targets non-aberrant mRNA is unknown, but these and other studies point to the existence of an underappreciated form of gene regulation.</p><p>To assess AS-NMD in the current study, we focused on a type of AS in which an intron is retained in the mature mRNA, which usually leads to out-of-frame translation and one or more PTCs. An average of 1.5% of reads aligned to introns under AL, which was increased to 2.2% under DR (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002, two-way <italic>t</italic> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref>). The change in intron retention under DR suggests either diminished NMD, increased AS, or both. Next, we quantified intron retention in the polysome-associated fraction. NMD takes place during a pioneering round of translation, so we expected mRNAs with retained introns to be depleted among polysomes. Indeed, intron retention was lower in the translated fraction than the total fraction under both AL (1.0%, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.002) and DR (1.2%, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.003). However, the presence of intronic reads in the polysomal fraction suggests that their associated transcripts escaped NMD. Furthermore, although more intron retention was detected in the translated fraction under DR than AL (two-way <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.017), the ratio was smaller than that observed between total and translated under AL (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006, two-way ANOVA). Thus, although there are more retained introns among both total and translated mRNA under DR, there is a decrease in the frequency with which intron-bearing mRNA makes it into the translated fraction.

Using a fold-change threshold of 2 and a FDR cutoff of 0.05, 1,029 genes showed increased intron retention and 36 genes exhibited decreased intron retention under DR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). There was a significant overlap in genes with intron retention in the current study with those determined to have intron retention in an <italic>eat-2</italic> genetic model of DR in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where increased retention of introns was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7C</xref>; Fisher's exact test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01; <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">Tabrez et al, 2017</xref>). In the translated fraction, 539 genes showed increased intron retention under DR, whereas 42 genes had decreased intron retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7B</xref>). This suggests that changes in intron retention were because of an increase in the number of genes with retained introns. This also suggests that the increased frequency of introns under DR shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7A</xref> was not simply because of increased frequency of introns within a set of genes common to both AL and DR conditions.</p><p>Comparison of genes with increased intron retention under DR in the total and translated fractions shows that most, but not all, of those in the translated pool are a minority subset of genes in the total fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7D</xref>). Interestingly, 97 genes exhibited a higher level of intron retention among translated mRNA than among total mRNA, suggesting that the retained introns promoted association with translation machinery in these instances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7D</xref>). Results indicated that intron retention was not always associated with exclusion from translation. This suggested that there was more than just nonsense associated with these transcripts, and we further investigated the connection between intron-bearing mRNAs and translation.</p><p>To identify dynamic changes in translation of intron-bearing genes between AL and DR, we used DPAR-type analysis similar to that carried out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref>. Seventy-four intron-retaining genes were associated more with polysomes under DR than AL and 139 were associated less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7E</xref> and Table S10). Those intron-bearing transcripts translationally promoted under DR were enriched for biological processes related to cell localization and signal transduction, whereas those translated less under DR were enriched for biological processes including cell cycle, stress response, and telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig 7F and G</xref> and Table S11). Enrichment of genes governing specific biological process suggests that NMD may be selective in a manner that regulates differential gene expression as opposed to just being a quality control process.</p><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM10"><p>Table S10 <inline-supplementary-material mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" mimetype="application" xlink:href="LSA-2018-00281_TableS10.xlsx" id="d35e2004" content-type="local-data">List of genes with intron retention levels that occur between total and translated fractions in a way dependent on DR.

The expression of several smg genes were altered in the DR mRNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig S4D</xref>). Given that the translation of NMD-prone transcripts seemed to be regulated by DR and that NMD has been shown to play a role in ILS-mediated longevity (<xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">Son et al, 2017</xref>), we hypothesized that NMD plays a role in DR-induced longevity. We tested the importance of NMD in longevity using mutants defective in <italic>smg-1/2/3/4/5/6/7</italic> subject to AL or DR starting at adulthood.

Low nutrient levels lead to low global translation. However, our understanding of how the stoichiometry of protein synthesis for specific individual gene products changes under DR through selective translation is limited. To elucidate this process, we sought to identify translationally regulated genes and potential mechanisms of posttranscriptional regulation that influence their translation. Using a combination of polysome profiling and mRNA sequencing, we generated diagnostics of the transcriptome and translateome. In silico analysis was used to assess the relationship between these diagnostics and how this relationship is changed when nutrients are restricted. It also provided a means by which to probe differentially expressed genes for annotated <italic>cis</italic>-elements and corresponding <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, generating a roadmap for future analyses testing mechanisms of posttranscriptional regulation that contribute to differential expression. The use of RNAi allowed us to determine which differentially expressed genes and cellular processes, like NMD, are important contributors to the increased life span associated with DR.</p><p>An important early step in trying to understand how somatic protection is conferred by a health-promoting intervention like DR is to understand how expressions of genes change to meet the requirements of adaptation. Three genes among the 100 showing the greatest transcript-level decrease in expression under DR increased life span when knocked down with RNAi under AL. <italic>fbxb-24</italic> and <italic>sdz-</italic>33 encode highly related F-box&#x02013;containing proteins. The F-box motif was first observed as a constituent of Skp, Cullin, F-box (SCF) ubiquitin&#x02013;ligase complexes and helped confer specificity to proteolytic substrates (<xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Skowyra et al, 1997</xref>). Since then, many other genes encoding F-box motifs have been identified. The motif is structured with about 50 amino acids that function in protein&#x02013;protein interactions, which are highly abundant in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Kipreos &#x00026; Pagano, 2000</xref>). The third gene was D1086.3, a gene of unknown function that was also the only one tested for life span that was also selectively down-regulated via translation.</p><p>Selective translation of stress responsive genes important for longevity has been previously described in <italic>C. elegans</italic> ILS mutants (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">McColl et al, 2010</xref>) and in a model of restricted nutrient-responsive translation (<xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al, 2011</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, selective translation enhanced synthesis of genes encoding mitochondrial components on a form of DR involving restriction of yeast extract (a primary source of protein; <xref rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr">Zid et al, 2009</xref>). Inhibition of the nutrient-responsive TOR complex in mouse embryonic fibroblasts selectively suppressed ribosomal genes and promoted translation of several transcription factors, including <italic>Foxo1</italic> (<xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Thoreen et al, 2012</xref>). We observed translational suppression of ribosomal genes in the current study and other genes involved in translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2G</xref> and Table S3). Two of these genes, <italic>iff-1</italic> and <italic>pab-1</italic>, are translation initiation factors that increased life span when knocked down in fully fed wild-type animals.</p><p>In addition to direct regulators of translation, other repressed DPAR genes involved in life span regulation encode chaperones. The largest increase in median life span was observed for <italic>daf-21</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of human HSP90. Although it has been previously reported to increase life span (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Horikawa et al, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">Sutphin et al, 2017</xref>), this is the first study to demonstrate its translational regulation in the context of DR. DAF-21/HSP90 serves to promote growth and reproduction by keeping growth-related kinases and transcription factors in a near-native conformation that facilitates their activation (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Mitra et al, 2016</xref>). HSP90 also sequesters the HSF-1 heat shock transcription factor, inhibiting its ability to trimerize and up-regulate expression of heat shock protein genes (<xref rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al, 1998</xref>). The translational down-regulation of <italic>daf-21</italic> under DR makes sense given that there should be less need for activation of growth-related kinases and transcription factors in low-energy conditions when nutrients are depleted. The chaperonin gene, <italic>cct-4</italic>, was translationally down-regulated under DR and increased life span upon knockdown despite the fact that loss of <italic>cct-4</italic> is associated with a reduction in <italic>skn-1</italic> transcriptional activity (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Kahn et al, 2008</xref>). <italic>skn-1</italic> is the only worm ortholog of mammalian nuclear factor-erythroid-related factor (Nrf) transcription factors and functions in the p38 MAPK pathway to regulate the oxidative stress response. Its transcriptional activity is inhibited by ILS (<xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Tullet et al, 2008</xref>), and it is considered to be a longevity factor by promoting somatic maintenance. It is unclear why low <italic>cct-4</italic> translation supports increased life span given its positive correlation with at least one <italic>skn-1</italic> target, <italic>gst-4</italic>. It is possible that other <italic>skn-1</italic> targets are not similarly affected by <italic>cct-4</italic> expression.</p><p>Translationally down-regulated genes D1086.3 and <italic>kbp-1</italic> were, for the first time, identified as life span regulators in our RNAi screen. Interestingly, we did not observe life span extension in our RNAi screen for certain repressed DPAR genes previously shown to regulate life span. For example, expression of <italic>skr-1</italic> and <italic>ncbp-2</italic> are positively associated with longevity, whereas expression of <italic>cyc-2.1</italic> is negatively associated with longevity but had no effect when knocked down using RNAi in the present study. The importance of <italic>skr-1</italic> for increased life span is specific to attenuated ILS in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant backgrounds of multiple alleles tested and does not regulate life span in an <italic>eat-2(ad1116)</italic> genetic model of DR (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ghazi et al, 2007</xref>). RNAi targeting the nuclear cap-binding protein gene <italic>ncbp-2</italic> was only shown to shorten life span when initiated during development, which can also result in severe defects and lethality (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000fc;ssing et al, 2010</xref>). <italic>cyc-2.1</italic> encodes a component of the electron transport chain, which only extends life span in N2 wild-type animals when it is knocked down during development. Thus, it is not surprising that these genes did not regulate life span in our longevity screen that began during adulthood.</p><sec id="s14"><title>A novel association between RNA editing and translation under DR</title><p>Although RNA editing frequencies were previously shown to be regulated by neuronal stimulation (<xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">Tariq et al, 2013</xref>), regeneration (<xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">Witman et al, 2013</xref>), and hypoxia (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Ben-Zvi et al, 2013</xref>), this is the first study to reveal widespread changes in editing because of nutrient limitation. A-to-I RNA editing increased under DR, especially within the 3&#x02032; UTRs, and such editing was associated with translational suppression. Conversely, although editing events occurred in the CDS, they were less frequent and were not associated with translational suppression. Together, these results indicate that RNA editing events are dynamic and likely to play a role in the adaptive response to DR.</p><p>Although a link between editing of individual genes and longevity remains to be established, polymorphisms in mRNA editing genes have been associated with longevity in humans (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Sebastiani et al, 2009</xref>). The same study also demonstrated that loss the orthologous editing genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> were required for longevity (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Sebastiani et al, 2009</xref>). This raises the possibility that mRNA editing regulates the selective translation of transcripts with inputs to longevity. A provocative example of this in the current dataset was the editing of the 3&#x02032; UTR of <italic>eif-2alpha.</italic> Furthermore, the enrichment of RNA editing sites within 3&#x02032; UTRs was shown to overlap frequently with miRNA binding sites (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al, 2012</xref>). Thus, RNA editing may influence expression by introducing or removing miRNA binding sites.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>RBPs and translation regulation under DR</title><p>Our screening of RBP motifs implicated <italic>pab-1</italic> in the regulation of translationally promoted genes under DR. This gene encodes for the cytoplasmic poly-A&#x02013;binding protein, referred to as PABPC1 in mammals. It has several molecular functions associated with it, the most prominent of which is its ability to bind to poly-adenosine stretches in the 3&#x02032; UTR of mRNA and then to associate with factors in the 5&#x02032; UTR to promote translation initiation. PABPC1 also regulates the expression of specific mRNA by binding to regions outside of the polyA tail (<xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al, 2014</xref>). This mRNA-specific regulation can be mediated by interactions with miRNA (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Flamand et al, 2016</xref>), participation in NMD (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Brook &#x00026; Gray, 2012</xref>), or through association with the 3&#x02032; UTR instead of the polyA tail (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Burgess &#x00026; Gray, 2010</xref>).

Under well-fed conditions, we found that <italic>trans</italic>-spliced mRNA was translated better than mRNA with the native 5&#x02032; UTR, supporting previous analysis (<xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al, 2017</xref>). Although this pattern was maintained under DR, it was modestly but significantly attenuated for SL1 spliced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, despite the preference for SL-containing mRNA to be translated under normal conditions, both SL1 and SL2 genes were underrepresented among promoted DPAR genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C and D</xref>). This was also true for polycistronic genes contained in operons, which represent a subpopulation of <italic>trans</italic>-spliced products that accounts for &#x0223c;17% of all protein-coding genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Blumenthal &#x00026; Gleason, 2003</xref>). Unlike bacterial operons, nematode polycistrons are separated posttranscriptionally and translated separately. The first gene within an operon is spliced to SL1, and subsequent genes are spliced to SL2. Interestingly, nearly half of the DPAR genes down-regulated in the transition from AL to DR conditions reside in operons. Although it is not clear how they are down-regulated, co-regulation of multiple genes by a single promoter could represent an optimization of gene expression for growth and reproduction under favorable conditions. Unfavorable conditions may then necessitate differential expression of genes under the same promoter, which could be achieved through translational regulation. However, because of the differences in the broader trend for translational regulation of trans-spliced genes from the subset of those in operons, we surmise that the presence of SLs, alone, cannot account for the differential translation of operonic genes under DR.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>DR increases intron retention products and differentially regulates NMD targets</title><p>We found evidence that DR increases the prevalence of intron retention and alters NMD. Furthermore, we found that certain NMD genes that play a role in target specificity and degradation are required for the benefits of DR. How AS-NMD is integrated to influence differential gene expression remains to be fully elucidated. With respect to splicing, there is a limited but growing body of evidence pointing to changes in AS according to dietary and metabolic conditions. For example, DR is associated with changes in AS for individual metabolic genes in mammals (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Gallardo et al, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Kaminska et al, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, hepatic transcripts in caloric restricted primates exhibited increased alternative exon use, including genes related to fatty acid metabolism (<xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Rhoads et al, 2018</xref>). Conversely, obesity is associated with diminished expression of several splicing factors in liver and skeletal muscle in a manner that contributes to increased lipogenesis (<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Pihlajam&#x000e4;ki et al, 2011</xref>). In a recent non-DR&#x02013;related study of splicing in the tea plant <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>, the predominant form of AS was intron retention, which occurred in genes related to the spliceosome and mRNA processing (<xref rid="bib127" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al, 2018</xref>). That regulators of splicing are, themselves, highly subject to alternative processing is conserved in animal studies. In mammals, AS is regulated by members of the SR protein family that alternatively splice a portion of their own transcripts (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Lareau et al, 2007</xref>). These splice variants are normally targeted by NMD to limit total SR protein expression. Our analysis of intron retention suggested that coupling of AS-NMD is modulated under DR, in part, by changing the selectivity toward which transcripts are detected and degraded. Observations are in line with those obtained from cell culture exposed to rapamycin, a drug that inhibits the DR-related TOR pathway, in which the selectivity of NMD toward transcripts was also modulated (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Nunez et al, 2016</xref>). Taken together, studies point to an adaptive mechanism of DR that functions by controlling productive splicing and turnover.</p><p>The idea of regulated AS-NMD was previously invoked to explain differential expression during development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Barberan-Soler et al, 2009</xref>).

The authors suggested that AS under DR is needed to diversify the proteome in a way that is conducive for longevity and additionally requires NMD to fine-tune gene expression. The same <italic>eat-2</italic> mutant was found to have increased splicing in the early, healthy part of life (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Heintz et al, 2016</xref>). Thus, although it is clear that AS and intron retention is modulated by DR in a way that may affect longevity, the roles of AS-NMD on differential gene expression are, as yet, unclear.</p><p>This study was designed to characterize the posttranscriptional landscape of gene expression in response to DR and then survey the mechanisms that may govern this regulation. Our data provide evidence that DR invokes selective translation by acting through miRNA, RBPs, 3&#x02032; UTR length, RNA editing, and intron retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Fig S5</xref>). One limitation to this approach was the use of whole worms as opposed to specific cell lines or tissues. Although the use of whole worms allows for the quantification systemic changes on translational regulation or effects occurring in large tissues like the intestine, tissue-specific effects, like RNA editing in the neurons, are likely lost by averaging the effect over all other tissues. The use of tagged RBPs, like poly-A&#x02013;binding protein, expressed by tissue-specific promoters has been used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to quantify tissue-specific gene expression in total mRNA pools (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Blazie et al, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).

Developmentally synchronous animals from a 4-h egg lay were transferred to AL (10<sup>11</sup> CFU/ml) or DR (10<sup>11</sup> CFU/ml) reaching day 1 of adulthood. To inhibit bacterial growth, AL and DR plates contained 25 mg/ml carbenicillin. Because the DR conditions used in this study inhibit reproduction, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml FUdR was used to inhibit egg production equally under DR and AL. Polysome profiling was performed as previously described (<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al, 2007</xref>) after 4 d under these culture conditions. 100 &#x003bc;l of pelleted worms were homogenized on ice in 350 &#x003bc;l of solubilization buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl [pH 8.0], 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 200 g heparin/ml, 400 U RNAsin/ml, 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg cycloheximide/ml, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate). After homogenation, an additional 700 &#x003bc;l of solubilization buffer was added and the sample was incubated on ice for 30 min. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000<italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Of the resulting supernatant, 900 &#x003bc;l was applied to the top of a 10&#x02013;50% sucrose gradient in high salt resolving buffer (140 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl [pH 8.0], and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor at 38,000 rpm for 90 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Gradients were fractionated using a Teledyne density gradient fractionator with continuous monitoring of absorbance at 252 nm.

TopHat was supplied with transcript annotations from ENSEMBL version 66 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Flicek et al, 2011</xref>), so that preference of aligning reads is given to the transcriptome first (remaining reads are converted to genomic mappings and merged with the final output). Default settings of Tophat were used with the following exceptions: the mean mate inner distance was set to 200 bp, microexon search was enabled, and the library type was set to &#x0201c;fr-unstranded&#x0201d; to indicate that unstranded paired end reads were used.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Differential expression</title><p>Aligned reads were counted per gene using the python script HTseq (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Anders et al, 2015</xref>). Differential expression and dataset normalization was performed using the Bioconductor package edgeR (<xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al, 2010</xref>). Normalization in edgeR adjusted for RNA composition to ensure that highly expressed genes which consume a large portion of the RNA pool did not result in the undersampling of other genes. In addition, as our data set contained multiple factors, dispersion of the gene counts were estimated tagwise using the Cox&#x02013;Reid profile-adjusted likelihood method (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Cox &#x00026; Reid, 1987</xref>). Only genes with average counts per million (CPM) of eight or greater across all conditions were considered reliably quantifiable for differential expression. A threshold of eight CPM was chosen as it was the point where the trend in the biological coefficient of variation approached the common variation. Differential expression was calculated pairwise between groups using a general linear model, and the resulting <italic>P</italic>-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg method (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Benjamini &#x00026; Hochberg, 1995</xref>).

Biological triplicates were performed for each treatment. Worms were washed off from NGM plates with 1 ml of M9 buffer and allowed to gravity settled. Settled worms were washed twice with M9 to remove bacterial contamination and flash frozen before storage at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. RNA extraction with Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions until phase separation.

All the miRNA members of families predicted to be enriched among DPAR genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>) were included as were their 5 prime (5p) or3 prime (3p) product partners. In addition, primers for both the 3p and 5p products of <italic>mir-2</italic>, <italic>mir-46</italic>, and <italic>mir-47</italic> were included as potential normalizers as they were previously accessed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to be stably expressed under stress (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Kagias et al, 2014</xref>). qPCR reactions consisted of 1&#x000d7; rAmp qPCR Green Master Mix (Denville Scientific/Thomas Scientific, 5 &#x003bc;m forward primer, 5 &#x003bc;m PerfeC<sub>T</sub>a Universal PCR Primer, and 3.16 ng RNA equivalents of cDNA all in a 10-&#x003bc;l reaction volume. qPCR data were collected using the LightCycler 480 (SW 1.5.1; Roche) equipped with a 384-well block. Thermal cycling was as follows: one step hold at 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 5 s/60&#x000b0;C for 20 s (data collection at 60&#x000b0;C), and one step melt with continuous data collection for melting curve analysis. Cycle threshold values from qPCR were analyzed with a modified version of Global Pattern Recognition (GPR) (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Akilesh, 2003</xref>), and threshold cutoff setting was set to 35. GPR generates aggregate <italic>P</italic>-values corresponding to the likelihood that the gene is changing between treatments based on all using other assays as normalizers. The reported fold change was calculated in GPR by using 10 normalizer assays. These normalizers were the 10 assays with the lowest average variation across all samples.

Before clustering, the expression of each gene among the four experimental groups in was centered around its mean expression in the dataset. Clustering was performed with the Partitioning around Medoids algorithm using the pam() function and evaluated using silhouettes widths (<xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Rousseeuw, 1987</xref>) with the silhouette() function, both contained in the R package &#x0201c;Cluster&#x0201d;.

A minimum of four reads aligning to introns within a gene was required to include in the analysis. The amount of global intron retention was expressed as the percent of reads aligning to introns over all aligned reads. Significant differences in global intron retention were determined using <italic>t</italic> test. To calculate intron retention occurring between diets in the total or translated fraction for individual genes, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used. To detect genes with intron retention differing between RNA fractions in a way dependent on DR, a linear model was used to determine significant interaction effects of diet and RNA fraction on intron retention. This was achieved using the lm() function in R to model the interaction effect of diet and RNA fraction on intron retention for each gene. Multiple testing was corrected for using the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg method.</p></sec><sec id="s28"><title>GO term enrichment</title><p>Enrichment of biological terms among gene lists was performed using DAVID (version 6.7) (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The category GOTERM_BP_FAT was used for annotations, and the list of quantifiable coding genes in our dataset was used as the background. For visualization, similar enriched GO terms based on the same subset of genes were manually removed to reduce redundancy; supplemental tables contain the full results.

Worms were scored as alive if movement was evident after gentle prodding of tail and head with a platinum worm pick. Worms with vulvar bursts or that had crawled off media were censored. Survival was plotted as Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival curves in GraphPad Prism (version 5) and analyzed by log-rank test using the &#x0201c;survival&#x0201d; package (version 2.44-1.1) in R. Three biological replicates were performed for each life span.

The processed data were reformatted for GSEA, and Affy IDs were replaced with the gene ID for their matching transcript using Ensembl's Biomart function. Of the 22,626 affy IDs, 21,459 had a gene name assigned to them; those Affy IDs without a corresponding gene ID were not included in the analysis. The GSEA was run with 10,000 permutations based on shuffling the gene set, using the &#x0201c;weighted&#x0201d; enrichment statistic and &#x0201c;signal to noise&#x0201d; metric for ranking genes.</p></sec><sec id="s34"><title>5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTR characterization</title><p>5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs were characterized separately based on length, GC content, and minimum free folding energy. Three groups of genes were considered: genes translationally promoted, genes translationally suppressed, and all quantifiable genes. Gene sequences from the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; ends were exported from ENSEMBL version 66 using the getSequence() function in the biomaRt R package. As genes often encode for multiple isoforms, 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; UTR sequences from the predominately expressed isoforms across the experiment was used for analysis. Quantification of isoform expression was performed using cuffdiff with default parameters (version 2.1.1), and the predominantly expressed isoform was defined as the one with the highest average FPKM in the dataset. Fractional GC content and sequence length were calculated using the alphabetFrequency() function from the biostrings package. The minimum free folding energy was calculated using the RNAfold function of the Vienna RNA package (version 2.4.8) with default settings. The characterized values for translationally promoted and suppressed genes were compared with all quantifiable genes using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s35"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The raw and processed high-throughput sequence data from this publication have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link> under accession <ext-link ext-link-type="geo" xlink:href="GSE119485">GSE119485</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e161"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="LSA-2018-00281_review_history.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Ben King, PhD, and Joel Graber, PhD, for bioinformatics advice and George Sutphin, PhD, for constructive criticism of the manuscript.
