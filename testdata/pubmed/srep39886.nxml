We aimed to compare the response to shading intensity of plants of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> grown throughout their life cycle from aerial seeds (ASP) and from subterranean seeds (SSP). We hypothesized that vegetative and reproductive growth of plants from ASP and SSP respond differently to light. Plants were grown from ASP and SSP under 0, 46, 71 and 90% shading intensities. With plant height as a covariate, vegetative biomass of ASP and SSP did not differ. Leaf area and seed production of SSP were greater and internode length less than they were for ASP in all shading intensities. Aerial and subterranean seed yield, seed mass and number for both ASP and SSP were highest in full light. Aerial seed yield was affected more than subterranean seed yield by shading intensity. The growth and reproductive responses of ASP and SSP of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> may be adaptive to the range of low to high light environments in which this species grows.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In natural habitats, the resources necessary for plant growth such as mineral nutrients, water and light are heterogeneously distributed in space and time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

This species produces both aerial and subterranean seeds that differ in morphology, physiology and ecology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.

Since aerial and subterranean seeds differs in morphology and ecophysiology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, we hypothesized that plants from the two morphs would differ in their vegetative and reproductive growth responses to light.

Since plants with high biomass have a competitive advantage over those with low biomass<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, SSP should have a competitive advantage over ASP, as demonstrated for other amphicarpic species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In both amphicarpic <italic>sensu stricto</italic> and amphicarpic <italic>sensu lato</italic> species, subterranean seeds generally are larger and have more mass than aerial seeds, e.g. <italic>Amphicarpaea bracteata</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. <italic>Cardamine chenopodifolia</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <italic>Catananche lutea</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <italic>Emex spinosa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and <italic>Gymnarrhena micrantha</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Thus, seedlings derived from subterranean seeds are supplied with more resources than those from aerial seeds, in which case seedlings of subterranean seeds often have a competitive advantage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and exhibit higher resistance to stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. For example, in <italic>Amphicarpum purshii</italic>, the larger subterranean seeds produce larger seedlings than the smaller aerial seeds, and large seedlings have a greater chance of survival than small ones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic>, individual aerial seed mass was 38.52&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.14&#x02009;mg, while individual subterranean seed mass was 456.32&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12.53&#x02009;mg<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. However, when plant height was used as a covariant ASP and SSP of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> did not differ significantly in biomass. Thus, the difference in untransformed biomass between ASP and SSP might be due to the different seed size. In <italic>Polygonum thunbergii,</italic> size of aerial and subterranean seeds was similar, and biomass allocation and total biomass of seedlings from aerial seeds and subterranean seeds did not differ with nutrient availability to the mother plant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p>When ASP and SSP of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> were shaded, internode length, leaf area, SLA and LMR increased. Low light severely limits photosynthesis per leaf area, and an increase in internode length, leaf area, SLA and LMR represents enhanced light interception. Thus, plants capture more light than they could have if these increases had not occurred<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. These characteristics are well-documented shade-avoidance responses, and they are similar to those of diaspore-monomorphic herbaceous plants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Internode length of ASP was significantly higher than that of SSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>), while leaf area of SSP was significantly higher than that of ASP in full light and in 71% shading intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>). SLA of plants of ASP and SSP grown in either full light or 46% shading intensity did not differ significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>) and neither did LMR of plants of ASP and SSP grown in full light and in 46% and 71% shading intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig.2E</xref>). This lack of significant differences may be due to the absence of stress in these growth environments. However, with the increase in shading intensity SLA of ASP was significantly higher than that of SSP under 71% and 90% shading intensity, while LMR of SSP was significantly higher than that of ASP under 90% shading intensity. Thus, light levels apparently had different effects on vegetative growth of ASP and SSP.</p><p>Growth conditions can influence the proportion of different morphs on an individual in amphicarpic species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> produced more aerial and more subterranean seeds in full light than in shade. ASP and SSP responded differently to light in aerial and subterranean reproduction. For SSP mother plants, yield and number of aerial and subterranean seeds decreased significantly with an increase in shading intensity. For ASP mother plants, yield and number of aerial seeds decreased significantly with an increase in shading intensity. However, yield of subterranean seeds did not change, and number of subterranean seeds decreased significantly although only slightly. Seed number and yield of aerial and subterranean seeds were higher for SSP than for ASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>In amphicarpic species, production of aerial seeds generally is more plastic in response to competition and abiotic stress than that of subterranean seeds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. For example, in <italic>Polygonum thunbergii</italic> allocation to subterranean reproduction was stable at 2% under different irradiances, while aerial reproduction varied from 2% in low light intensity to 10% in high light<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Similar patterns were reported for <italic>Amphicarpum purshii</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, <italic>Amphicarpaea bracteata</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and <italic>Cardamine chenopodifolia</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. However, in <italic>Emex spinosa</italic> allocation to aerial reproduction increased from 7 to 46% in low to high nitrogen levels, while allocation to subterranean reproduction decreased from 38 to 3%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Thus, both aerial and subterranean reproduction is quite plastic in <italic>E. spinosa</italic> and shows considerable adjustment to abiotic conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p><p>In <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> and other amphicarpic species, aerial seeds have relatively high dispersal ability, while subterranean seeds remain in the vicinity of the parental plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. ASP and SSP of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> produce relative more aerial seeds in full light than subterranean seeds, and aerial seeds have a greater chance of producing new plants away from parental microsites. However, with an increase in shading intensity relative more poorly-dispersed subterranean seeds are produced, which may be important in population maintenance <italic>in situ</italic>. In <italic>Amphicarpum purshii</italic>, aerial seeds were killed by fire, but subterranean seeds were not. Therefore, seedlings present after fire were produced from subterranean seeds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Thus, compared with aerial seeds the relative yield and number of subterranean seeds were higher in low than high light, and this provides an advantage to the offspring in (low light) environments that are similar to the maternal environment thereby making seedling survival more predictable. As such, production of subterranean seeds is a &#x0201c;timid&#x0201d; strategy of insuring reproduction, while production of aerial seeds is a &#x0201c;bold&#x0201d; strategy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>With an increase of shading intensity SSP produced a higher A/S seed yield ratio than ASP. In 90% shading intensity, the A/S seed yield ratio was 0.26 for ASP and 0.76 for SSP. Thus, ASP is more sensitive to shading intensity than SSP, and population maintenance is more reliant on subterranean seeds and SSP than on aerial seeds and ASP. This also is the case with the amphicarpic <italic>sensu lato</italic> species <italic>Emex spinosa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and the amphicarpic <italic>sensu stricto</italic> species <italic>Amphicarpum purshii</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and <italic>Cardmine chenopodifolia</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. At densities of 15, 5 and 1 plant per pot, plants of <italic>Amphicarpum purshii</italic> from aerial seeds produced 0, 43 and 100% aerial spikelets, respectively, while plants from subterranean seeds produced 43, 90 and 100% aerial spikelets respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. However, in <italic>Commelina benghalensis</italic> grown outdoor in pots, the aerial and subterranean seed number ratio was 547.0 in ASP but only 18.3 in SSP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In pots in the field, the aerial : subterranean seed number ratio for <italic>C. benghalensis</italic> was 81.1 in ASP and 38.7 in SSP, since ASP began tor produce seeds earlier than SSP. The high aerial and subterranean seed ratios may indicate a much greater reliance on reproduction from aerial seeds for population maintenance of <italic>C. benghalensis</italic> than is usual for most amphicarpic species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p><p>An increase in shading intensity resulted in an increase in individual mass of both aerial and subterranean seeds of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic>, but a smaller number of seeds was produced per plant. Life history theory suggests that plants cannot increase both size and number of seeds because of resource constraints. Thus, there is a trade-off between seed number and seed mass<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, and this trade-off affects many aspects of plant life history and even inter-specific relationships and community structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. The large amount of food stored in large seeds increases the probability of survival of progeny growing in a shaded environment, while small seeds have an advantage of dispersal to diverse habitats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p><p>In summary, the reproductive strategy of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> is comparable to that of other amphicarpic annuals in that it produces a few large subterranean seeds and many small aerial seeds under good growing conditions. Also, like other amphicarpic species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>
<italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> plants growing under highly adverse environmental conditions produce only subterranean seeds. For example, in 71% and 90% shading some replicates of both SSP and ASP produced subterranean seeds but no aerial seeds. Subterranean seeds remain in parental microsites, and plants resulting from them produce more aerial and subterranean seeds than plants resulting from aerial seeds in the same light environment in a mixed population of ASP and SSP under the same level of shading. This strategy may allow the species to &#x0201c;escape&#x0201d; from stressful deep shade environments via production of aerial seeds that can disperse to more favourable light microhabitats nearby. We conclude that the plasticity in the ratio of aerial and subterranean seeds produced by plants of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> grown from aerial and subterranean seeds contributes to its ability to inhabit a continuum of low to high light environments.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reproductive output and mass of field-collected plants from aerial and subterranean seeds</title><p>In October 2012, when all fruits were fully mature, 20 plants each of ASP and SSP were chosen randomly in a natural habitat of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> at Fragrant Hill [Beijing, China (see Zhang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> for description of site)]<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Germination of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> is hypogeal, and mature plants derived from ASP and SSP could be distinguished by the cotyledons that remained attached to them. Subterranean seed mass is 11.8 times greater than that of aerial seeds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, and thus the cotyledons of subterranean seeds are much larger than those of aerial seeds. In addition, the cotyledons of subterranean seeds usually are green, while those of aerial seeds are typically white, or absent due to decay. Roots were dug up and washed free of soil under running tap water. The number of aerial and subterranean seeds was determined for each of the 40 plants, after which whole plants were collected, put in brown paper bags and dried at 75&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 48&#x02009;h.

On 15 April 2013, 20 seedlings (cotyledon stage) each from ASP and SSP were transplanted (one plant per pot) to each of 40 pots (21&#x02009;cm in diameter and 18&#x02009;cm deep) filled with soil from Fragrant Hill. Only 3-day-old seedlings of the same size were transplanted. Transplanting time was coincident with that for emergence of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> seedlings in the natural habitat at Fragrant Hill. The pots were buried in full sun in the experimental garden, so that the top was even with the soil surface.</p><p>According to measurements made using an illumination meter (HT-1300, HCJYET, GuangZhou, China) at 13 : 00 on 3 July 2013, a sunny day, plants of <italic>A. edgeworthii</italic> were distributed over a range of light levels from full light (0% shading) in an opening to 75.32&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.87% shading under a forest canopy. Black shading-net (mesh size 2.5&#x02009;mm) was used to create four shading intensities: 0% (full light), 45.72&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.25% (one layer of shading-net), 71.59&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.25% (two layers of shading-net) and 90.10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.85% (three layers of shading-net). Shading intensity was measured using the illumination meter described above. The light treatments were started when the seedlings had three leaves (2 May 2013, 17 days after transplanting). Before the beginning of each treatment, the soil was watered to field capacity (21.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.5%). To prevent rainstorms from destroying the experiment, the pots were covered with transparent plastic sheeting on the rainy days of 2 July, 15 July and 12 August 2013, when the amount of precipitation was 51&#x02009;mm, 48&#x02009;mm and 71&#x02009;mm, respectively. During the experiment, soil in the pots in all treatments was kept moist (watered daily); signs of water stress (i.e. wilting of leaves) were not observed during the experiment. Temperature and relative humidity (RH) were recorded continuously throughout the study. Mean air minimum and maximum temperatures were 11&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 21.8&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, respectively, and RH was 16&#x02013;73%.</p><p>Plants were harvested on 15 October 2013, when all fruits were fully mature. Roots were dug up and washed free of soil under running tap water. Each plant was divided into stems, leaves, roots and reproductive organs (including aerial and subterranean fruits). Number of leaves, plant height, internode length and number of aerial and of subterranean seeds on each plant were determined. Leaf area was scanned and analyzed using the software (WinFOLIA Pro 2004a; Regent Instruments, Qu&#x000e9;bec, QC, Canada). Then, stems, leaves, roots and reproductive organs were put in brown paper bags, dried at 75&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 48&#x02009;h and then weighted. Vegetative biomass, leaf mass ratio (LMR, g/g) and specific leaf area (SLA, cm<sup>2</sup>/g) were determined. Twenty randomly-chosen aerial and subterranean seeds each were weighed using the Sartorius balance.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data analysis</title><p>T-tests were used to compare total biomass, biomass allocation and seed number and mass of field collected ASP and SSP. Seed morph, seed size and plant size are interdependent, and it is well known that larger seeds produce larger plants, which could impact reproductive traits due to ontogentic drift<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. To control for such possible ontogenetic effects, plant size (plant height) was used as a covariate. Thus, our null hypothesis was that there was no significant effect of plant size in the analyses caused by ontogenetic drift. A multivariate analyses (MANOVA) was used to compare the main effects of plant type, shading intensity and their interactions with vegetative biomass, internode length, leaf area, SLA, LMR and reproductive component i.e. seed yield, seed number, seed mass and A/S seed yield ratio. Wilks&#x02019; Lambda and its approximate F-values and P-values were extracted to examine the significance of seed morph and shading intensity on vegetative and reproductive traits. If MANOVA indicated significance in the data, Tukey&#x02019;s HSD test was used to determine the differences between treatments (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).
