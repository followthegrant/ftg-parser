Accumulating evidence suggests that ayahuasca may have therapeutic effects on ethanol abuse. It is not known, however, whether its effects are dependent on the presence of DMT or if non-DMT-containing components would have therapeutic effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the rewarding properties of ayahuasca (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg, orally), Bc (132, 440, and 1320 mg/kg, orally) and Pv (3.75, 12.5 and 37.5 mg/kg, i.p.) extracts and their effects on ethanol (1.8 g/kg, i.p.) reward using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in male mice. Animals were conditioned with ayahuasca, Bc or Pv extracts during 8 sessions. An intermediate, but not a high, dose of ayahuasca induced CPP in mice. Bc and Pv did not induce CPP. Subsequently, the effects of those extracts were tested on the development of ethanol-induced CPP. Ayahuasca, Bc or Pv were administered before ethanol injections during conditioning sessions. While Bc and Pv exerted no effects on ethanol-induced CPP, pretreatment with ayahuasca blocked the development of CPP to ethanol. Finally, the effects of a post-ethanol-conditioning treatment with ayahuasca, Bc or Pv on the expression of ethanol-induced CPP were tested. Animals were conditioned with ethanol, and subsequently treated with either ayahuasca, Bc or Pv in the CPP environment previously associated with saline or ethanol for 6 days. Animals were then reexposed to ethanol and ethanol-induced CPP was quantified on the following day. Treatment with all compounds in the ethanol-paired environment blocked the expression of ethanol-induced CPP. Administration of an intermediate, but not a high, dose of ayahuasca and Bc, as well as Pv administration, in the saline-paired compartment blocked the expression of ethanol-induced CPP. The present study sheds light into the components underlying the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca on ethanol abuse, indicating that ayahuasca and its plant components can decrease ethanol reward at doses that do not exert abuse liability. Importantly, the treatment environment seems to influence the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca and Bc, providing important insights into clinical practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ayahuasca</kwd><kwd>N</kwd><kwd>N-dimethyltryptamine</kwd><kwd>&#x003b2;-carboline alkaloids</kwd><kwd>ethanol</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>conditioned place preference</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100006181</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003593</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002322</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Alcohol (ethanol, Eth) use disorder (AUD) and its health consequences are a major public health problem. The World Health Organization estimated that the global prevalence of AUD in 2010 was 4.1%, including Eth dependence (2.3%) and harmful use of Eth (1.8%) (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization [WHO], 2014</xref>). Eth use is the third leading risk factor for poor health globally, and it is estimated that nearly 2.5 million deaths every year are attributable to Eth use (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization [WHO], 2010</xref>). Thus, despite the substantial amount of resources that governments and international organizations invest in programs to prevent substance use disorders, AUD is still high across the globe. Currently available treatments are only partially effective (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mason, 2017</xref>) and further research on new treatment approaches is needed.</p><p>Throughout the last two decades, accumulating evidence has suggested that ayahuasca (Aya) may have therapeutic properties on substance use disorders (for review, see <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Nunes et al., 2016</xref>). Aya is a brew frequently prepared by the decoction of <italic>Banisteriopsis caapi</italic> and <italic>Psychotria viridis</italic>, &#x003b2;-carboline- and <italic>N,N</italic>-dimethyltryptamine(DMT)-containing plants, respectively. Originally used for religious purposes by Amerindian populations of the Amazon Basin, the use of Aya has spread throughout the world (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Tupper, 2008</xref>), being currently used in syncretic religions such as Santo Daime and Uni&#x000e3;o do Vegetal and other contexts, such as Aya retreats (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Labate et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Goulart, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Luna, 2011</xref>). Case-control studies have found a lower prevalence of substance use and substance-related problems in Aya users from Uni&#x000e3;o do Vegetal and Santo Daime religions relative to control groups (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Grob et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Da Silveira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Doering-Silveira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Fabregas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa et al., 2016</xref>), and decreased substance use after joining those churches (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Halpern et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Labate et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, studies have shown that Aya-assisted therapy resulted in decreased drug use and craving in drug dependent individuals (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Loizaga-Velder and Verres, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although increasing evidence supports the effectiveness of Aya for the treatment of drug abuse, it remains unknown whether Aya has anti-addictive properties alone or if other factors, such as contextual and religious influences, play a major role in the results described above. In what seems to be the only study to date investigating the effects of Aya on an animal model of drug abuse, a previous study from our group investigated the effects of Aya on behaviors induces by acute and chronic Eth administration in mice (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira-Lima et al., 2015</xref>). Aya blocked the development and expression of acute and chronic Eth-induced hyperlocomotion and behavioral sensitization without affecting baseline locomotor activity (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira-Lima et al., 2015</xref>). Those findings suggest that Aya may have therapeutic effects <italic>per se</italic> that are not completely dependent on sociocultural religious variables.</p><p>Importantly, it is well known that DMT has no significant psychoactive effect when ingested orally due to its breakdown by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lanaro et al., 2015</xref>). According to the proposed pharmacokinetic model of Aya, &#x003b2;-carboline alkaloids present in <italic>B. caapi</italic> inhibit MAO-A, thereby allowing the entry of DMT from <italic>P. viridis</italic> to systemic circulation and central nervous system, and its subsequent psychoactive effects (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Holmstedt and Lindgren, 1967</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">McKenna, 2004</xref>). Thus, it was believed that the main psychoactive effects of Aya were attributable to DMT, with &#x003b2;-carboline alkaloids such as harmine and harmaline simply facilitating its effects. However, more recent evidence suggests that &#x003b2;-carboline alkaloids also have psychoactive properties and could exert therapeutic effects in drug abuse (for review, see <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brierley and Davidson, 2012</xref>). Studies have shown a decrease in morphine and cocaine intake after harmaline administration (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Glick et al., 1994</xref>), as well as harmine-induced attenuation of morphine withdrawal (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aricioglu-Kartal et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it remains unknown whether the effects of Aya are dependent on the presence of DMT or if non-DMT containing components, such as the plant <italic>Banisteriopsis caapi</italic>, would have therapeutic effects <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the rewarding properties of Aya (prepared by the decoction of the stems of the <italic>Banisteriopsis caapi</italic> vine combined with the leaves of the <italic>Psychotria viridis</italic> bush), <italic>Banisteriopsis caapi</italic> and <italic>Psychotria viridis</italic> extracts. We also investigated the effects of those compounds on the rewarding properties of Eth using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). We evaluated the effects of Aya, <italic>Banisteriopsis caapi</italic> or <italic>Psychotria viridis</italic> extracts alone on CPP as well as on the development of CPP to Eth. Additionally, we also investigated if the treatment environment could influence the effects of those extracts on the subsequent expression of Eth-induced CPP. Thus, we also tested the effects of treatments with Aya, <italic>Banisteriopsis caapi</italic> or <italic>Psychotria viridis</italic> extracts in the CPP environment previously associated with saline (unpaired) or Eth (paired) on the subsequent expression of CPP to Eth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Three-month-old Swiss male mice from our own colony were used. Animals weighing 35&#x02013;40 g were group housed (5&#x02013;7 per cage) in polypropylene cages (32 &#x000d7; 42 &#x000d7; 18 cm) under controlled temperature (22&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C) and light (12 h light, 12 h dark; lights on at 6 h 45) conditions. Rodent chow (Nuvilab, Quimtia SA, Colombo, PR, Brazil) and water were available <italic>ad libitum</italic> throughout the experiments. Animals were maintained according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition, revised 2011) and in accordance with the Brazilian Law for Procedures for Animal Scientific Use (#11794/2008). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UESC approved the experimental procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of Extracts and Compounds Analysis</title><p>A batch of Aya had been previously obtained from a member of the Santo Daime church, lyophilized and analyzed for the quantification of the amount DMT, tetrahydroharmine, harmine and harmaline, as previously described (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira-Lima et al., 2015</xref>). Samples of <italic>B. caapi</italic> and <italic>P. viridis</italic> were obtained from members of the Santo Daime church and submitted to extraction. The extracts were, then, lyophilized, rendering a freeze dried material that was analyzed as described below. The ratio of dry extract/volume of liquid (extract) was calculated to establish the doses to be administered in the experiments for all extracts.</p><p>In order to quantify the amount of the main compounds of <italic>B. caapi</italic> (tetrahydroharmine, harmine, and harmaline) and <italic>P. viridis</italic> (DMT) in our preparation, the extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) conducted on a high performance liquid chromatography equipment Prominence system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Harmine hydrochloride and harmaline hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. The synthesis of tetrahydroharmine was performed as previously described (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Callaway et al., 1996</xref>). DMT was synthesized according to a modified procedure based on the selective dimethylation method (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Giumanini and Casalini, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Pires et al., 2009</xref>). The stock solutions (1.0 mg/ml) of harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine and DMT were prepared in methanol and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until the performance of the LC-MS/MS.</p></sec><sec><title>Drugs</title><p>Eth (Merck<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), Aya, extract of <italic>B. caapi</italic> (EBc) and extract of <italic>P. viridis</italic> (EPv) were dissolved in 0.9% saline (Sal) solution, which was used as vehicle (Veh) solution for the Aya, EBc and EPv treatments. Eth and Sal solutions were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 10 ml/kg of body weight. Aya, EBc and Veh were orally administered by gavage at a volume of 10 ml/kg. Because DMT has no significant psychoactive effect when ingested orally due to its breakdown by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lanaro et al., 2015</xref>), oral administration of DMT would not allow us to evaluate the effects of this compound in the behavioral tests. Thus, EPv and its Veh were administered i.p. at 10 ml/kg of body weight. The selected dose range of Aya and Eth was based on previous studies from our group (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Marinho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira-Lima et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2017</xref>). Doses of Aya were chosen based on their ability to prevent acute Eth-induced hyperlocomotion and locomotor sensitization in mice (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira-Lima et al., 2015</xref>). For comparative purposes, the doses of EBc and EPv were calculated based on the concentration of harmine and DMT, respectively, in the Aya extract used in the present study, as previously described (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira-Lima et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conditioned Place Preference</title><p>The CPP apparatus consisted of 2 conditioning compartments of equal size (40 &#x000d7; 20 &#x000d7; 20 cm): 1 black with white vertical bands in the walls and a black wooden floor and 1 white with black horizontal bands in the walls and a green (red) smooth floor, both connected by a central choice compartment (40 &#x000d7; 10 &#x000d7; 15 cm) that was accessible by sliding doors. The CPP procedure consisted of the following phases: Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 4 &#x02013; habituation, pre-conditioning test, conditioning, post-conditioning test; Experiments 5, 6, 7, and 8 &#x02013; habituation, pre-conditioning test, conditioning, post-conditioning test, treatment, Eth reexposure and post-treatment test.</p><sec><title>Habituation and Pre-conditioning Test</title><p>In order to avoid a novelty effect and establish if animals showed a preference for either of the compartments, a habituation session and a pre-conditioning test were conducted (Days 1 and 2, respectively) in which animals were placed in the center of the apparatus with the door open with free access to each compartment for 15 min. No injection was administered on the habituation day or on the day of the pre-conditioning test.</p></sec><sec><title>Conditioning</title><p>An unbiased design was used because mice showed no preference for either of the compartments in the pre-conditioning test. Therefore, animals were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a &#x02018;drug-paired compartment&#x02019; in a counterbalanced fashion, with the &#x0201c;black&#x0201d; compartment as the drug-paired one for half of the animals and the &#x0201c;white&#x0201d; compartment for the other half. One &#x0201c;drug-paired compartment&#x0201d; and one &#x0201c;Sal-paired compartment&#x0201d; were defined for all animals. The conditioning trials were performed during 8 consecutive days (Days 3&#x02013;10). During the conditioning sessions, the doors remained closed so the animals would be confined to one of the conditioning compartments. Animals received Sal on even days. On odd days, animals received Aya (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg, Experiment 1a), EBc (132, 440, and 1320 mg/kg, Experiment 1b), EPv (3.75, 12.5, and 37.5 mg/kg, Experiment 1c) or Eth (1.8 g/kg, Experiments 2a,b,c, 3a,b, 4a,b, and 5a,b). Five (Eth), 30 (Aya, EBc) or 20 (EPv) min after treatments, mice were confined to the assigned drug- or Sal-paired compartment for 10 min. On Experiments 2a, 2b, and 2c, animals received Veh, Aya (100 or 300 mg/kg), EBc (440 or 1320 mg/kg) or EPv (12.5 or 37.5 mg/kg) 25 (Aya, EBc) or 15 (EPv) min before Eth injections.</p></sec><sec><title>Post-conditioning Test</title><p>Twenty four hours after the last conditioning session (Day 11), animals were placed in the center of the apparatus with the door open with free access to each compartment for 15 min.

Because several groups were ran concomitantly within a given experiment, the order of animals being submitted to the behavioral sessions in the CPP was randomized for each phase described above, so that all groups had animals being tested at the same time. The CPP apparatus was cleaned with Eth-water (5%) solution before each behavioral session/test to eliminate possible bias due to odors left by previous mice. During test sessions, the time spent in each compartment was registered. Movement was tracked using the ANY-maze software (version 5.1, Stoelting) and a webcam suspended overhead. Expression of drug-induced CPP was evidenced by the CPP score (difference between the time spent in the drug-paired and in the non-drug-paired compartments).

Our findings show that an intermediate, but not a high, dose of Aya exerted rewarding effects, inducing CPP in mice. Pretreatment with Aya also blocked the development of Eth-induced CPP at all doses tested. Both EBc and EPv had no effects on CPP alone or on Eth-induced CPP. Treatment with Aya, EBc and EPv in the environment previously paired to Eth blocked the subsequent expression of CPP induced by an Eth reexposure. Regarding treatments in the Sal-paired compartment, administration of an intermediate, but not a high, dose of Aya and EBc, as well as administration of EPv at both doses tested, blocked the subsequent expression of Eth-induced CPP. Statistical analysis of our findings showed a significant interaction effect between treatment environment (Eth- vs. Sal-paired compartment) and Aya or EBc, but not EPv, treatments, suggesting that the treatment environment seems to play an important role in the effects of Aya and EBc on Eth reward.</p><p>Compelling evidence indicates that the effects of Aya are mediated by serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. Firstly, DMT is a 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptor agonist, which has been proposed to mediate its psychoactive properties (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Glennon et al., 2000</xref>). Secondly, tetrahydroharmine is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977</xref>), and harmine binds to serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptors (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Grella et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Glennon et al., 2000</xref>). The effects of harmine at 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptors have been proposed to be an agonist mechanism (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brierley and Davidson, 2013</xref>); however, a 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist or antagonist action is yet to be confirmed. Importantly, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors play an important role in mediating the influence of serotonin in drug abuse and in the rewarding properties of drugs (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bubar and Cunningham, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Craige and Unterwald, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Howell and Cunningham, 2015</xref>). Because of the regional distribution of those receptors in the brain, they exert opposing effects on drug abuse through dopamine-dependent mechanisms (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Manvich et al., 2012a</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Murnane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Berro et al., 2017</xref>). Particularly, activation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and blockade of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors have been proposed to decrease dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Howell and Cunningham, 2015</xref>). Of note, the development and induction of CPP are dependent on drug-induced increases in NAcc dopamine levels (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Koob and Bloom, 1988</xref>).</p><p>Although DMT is a 5HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptor agonist, studies have shown that it has higher affinity for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> compared to 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Glennon et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, we propose that DMT-induced activation of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors would have distinct rewarding properties depending on the dose being administered. At low to intermediate doses, DMT would bind preferentially at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, which would then mediate its psychoactive properties. By activating 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, which are highly expressed in dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Howell and Cunningham, 2015</xref>), DMT would increase dopamine levels in the NAcc and exert rewarding effects. This mechanism would be responsible for the CPP induced by Aya at an intermediate dose in the present study. However, with increased dosage, DMT would then bind non-specifically at both 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. Activation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, which are highly expressed in GABAergic interneurons within the VTA (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Howell and Cunningham, 2015</xref>), would antagonize the effects of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor activation on NAcc dopamine neurochemistry and prevent the development of CPP to Aya at higher doses, as observed in the present study.</p><p>Based on the hypothesis that higher doses of DMT would exert higher 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor activation, EPv would also be expected to induce CPP at intermediate, but not high, doses. In the present study, however, EPv did not induce CPP at any of the doses tested. The lack of effects observed for EPv could be due to the administration route used for EPv in the present study. While Aya and EBc were administered orally, EPv was administered i.p. due to expected DMT breakdown by MAO-A in the gastrointestinal tract. Of note, previous studies in humans have suggested that &#x003b2;-carboline-induced MAO inhibition is mainly peripheral and short-lived, and only allows around 15% of the DMT to reach systemic circulation (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Riba, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Dom&#x000ed;nguez-Clav&#x000e9; et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, with oral administration of Aya, the proportion of DMT that reaches the brain would be much lower than that of i.p. EPv, even though the DMT concentration in both extracts was the same across doses. Based on this hypothesis, i.p. EPv would be expected to induce CPP at lower doses than those used in the present study, with the doses of EPv used herein being high enough to exert 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonist action, and thereby block DMT-induced CPP mediated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> activation. In fact, although not statistically significant, increased dosage of EPv seemed to have a trend in inducing conditioned place avoidance under our experimental conditions (<italic>p</italic> = 0.1), which corroborates a higher 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>-mediated decrease in NAcc dopamine levels induced by higher doses of i.p. EPv.</p><p>Conditioning with EBc was not effective in inducing CPP under our experimental conditions, suggesting that its effects at 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptors at the doses tested in the present study were not meaningful. EBc also had no effects on the development of Eth-induced CPP. Aya, on the other hand, decreased CPP to Eth when administered before conditioning sessions. Interestingly, pretreatment with EPv also had no effects on Eth-induced CPP. Thus, our findings suggest that Aya-induced modulation of the development of Eth reward is dependent on the presence of both EBc and EPv, and seems to be a 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub>, rather than 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, receptor-dependent mechanism. <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ishiguro et al. (2016)</xref> have previously shown that the reduction of serotonergic neurons induced by chronic prenatal Eth exposure was alleviated by concomitant administration of a 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptor agonist. In this scenario, our findings suggest that Aya-mediated activation of 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptors blocked the development of Eth-induced CPP by preventing Eth-induced changes in serotonergic neurotransmission. An optimum ratio of 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptor activation seems to be necessary in order to exert those effects, because higher DMT doses (EPv) did not prevent Eth-induced CPP. Importantly, because all three treatments were capable of decreasing the expression of Eth-induced CPP, one cannot rule out the possibility that Aya might also be exerting rewarding effects and affecting the development of Eth-induced CPP via other chemicals that are not present in the plant extracts but are present in the Aya concoction.</p><p>Our findings also show that chronic treatment with Aya after Eth conditioning blocked the subsequent expression of CPP to Eth. Thus, Aya-mediated activation of 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptors also seems to modulate previously established Eth reward. This effect seems to be mediated not only by the presence of DMT, but also by the presence of &#x003b2;-carbolines in the Aya preparation. When administered in the previously Eth-associated environment, a high dose of EBc, as well as both doses of EPv, also blocked the expression of CPP to Eth. Therefore, although 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> activation seems to be sufficient and more effective at blocking the expression of CPP to Eth, &#x003b2;-carboline-mediated mechanisms also appear to modulate behavioral responses induced by Eth-environment conditioning.</p><p>As previously mentioned, &#x003b2;-carbolines have been proposed to exert psychoactive effects through 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptors. However, those mechanisms do not seem to account for the results obtained in the present study because EBc did not induce CPP alone or exert effects on the development of Eth-induced CPP. Instead, we hypothesize that other &#x003b2;-carboline-mediated mechanisms are responsible for the effects of EBc on the expression of Eth-induced CPP. &#x003b2;-carbolines have been shown to exert several effects in brain neurotransmission, not only through MAO-A inhibition and serotonin receptor binding, but also through dual specificity tyrosine-dependent kinase 1A (DYRK1A) inhibition, dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibition, and imidazoline I<sub>2</sub> receptor binding (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brierley and Davidson, 2012</xref>). Thus, although the mechanisms underlying EBc-induced blockade of Eth-induced CPP remain unknown, this is the first study to show that EBc alone could exert therapeutic potential for the treatment of ethanol abuse without exerting addictive properties.</p><p>Finally, the effects observed with Aya treatment were context-dependent: when administered in the previously Eth-associated compartment, its effects were observed for both doses tested, while only the intermediate dose blocked the expression of Eth-induced CPP when Aya was administered in the Sal-paired compartment. Therefore, Aya&#x02019;s ability to induce rewarding effects predicted its ability to block the expression of CPP to Eth when Aya was administered in a neutral (Sal-paired) environment. By exerting rewarding properties when administered in a neutral compartment, a rewarding dose of Aya would modify the incentive salience of the CPP apparatus (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Valyear et al., 2017</xref>), and animals would no longer express CPP to Eth during the post-treatment test.</p><p>When given in the Sal-paired compartment, EPv also blocked the expression of Eth-induced CPP at all doses tested, suggesting that activation of 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptors mediates those effects of Aya. Corroborating our previous hypothesis, high doses of i.p. EPv would be expected to induce higher activation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, which would ultimately decrease NAcc dopamine levels and block the expression of CPP to Eth (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Pina and Cunningham, 2014</xref>). However, similarly to Aya, EBc blocked the expression of Eth-induced CPP when administered at an intermediate dose in the Sal-paired compartment. Thus, our findings suggest that increasing the dose of EBc in the Aya mixture seems to counteract some of the effects of EPv. Because this effect was only observed in an experimental condition associated with low brain dopamine levels (presentation to a neutral, previously habituated environment), EBc seems to modulate Eth-induced CPP through mechanism that are dependent on dopamine availability.</p><p>Finally, a parameter that could be influencing the effects observed herein is locomotor activity. Treatment with Aya and its components could have affected locomotor activity in animals conditioned to Eth, and therefore decreased time spent in the Eth-associated compartment during the post-treatment test by increasing locomotor activity and exploration (Experiments 3&#x02013;5). When looking into locomotor activity data in the present study, we observed that during the post-conditioning test, animals showed significantly higher levels of CPP score and locomotor activity score (difference between the distance traveled in the Eth- and Sal-paired compartments) compared to the pre-conditioning test (Experiments 3, data not shown). Those data suggest that animals spent more time and explored more the Eth-paired compartment compared to the Sal-paired compartment. During the post-treatment test, however, no statistically significant differences were observed for locomotor activity scores between groups (Experiments 3, data not shown). Animals no longer showed a difference between the distance traveled in the Sal- vs. Eth-paired compartments, suggesting a habituation factor resulting in lower levels of exploratory behavior. Those results corroborate previous findings from our laboratory showing that the same Aya extract used in the present study did not affect baseline locomotion or induce locomotor sensitization in mice, and instead decreased Eth-induced hyperlocomotion and locomotor sensitization (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira-Lima et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the results obtained for locomotor activity did not correlate to the results obtained for time score, as animals in the Vehicle control group, for instance, still expressed CPP do Eth during the post-conditioning test, an effect that was blocked by treatment with Aya. Thus, analysis of locomotor activity data does not support an influence of this parameter on the expression of CPP to Eth.</p><p>In summary, although we have not directly investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the present findings, our results suggest that the expression of the Aya reward is dependent on a specific 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> occupancy ratio that can be modulated by the quantity of EBc and EPv present in the Aya batch and by the route of administration. Of clinical importance, we propose that a proper 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> occupancy could engender therapeutic efficacy without exerting abuse liability. By showing that both EBc and EPv exerted therapeutic effects alone, our findings also indicate that the combination of EBc and EPv in the form of Aya beverage seems to have unique therapeutic utility. Importantly, under our experimental conditions, the treatment environment influenced the therapeutic effects of Aya and EBc, but not EPv, which could be relevant in the context of clinical and/or religious/ritual uses of Aya. The present study further emphasizes the complexity of the Aya formulation and its effects, and highlights the need for further investigations in the area. Future studies investigating the effects of varying EBc/EPv ratios on the therapeutic properties of Aya are needed in order to ensure the safety and best therapeutic strategy in using this beverage for the treatment of ethanol abuse.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>AO-L, LB, and EM were responsible for the study concept and design.
