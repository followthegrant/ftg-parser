method that can be
used for grafting anti-icing materials onto different surfaces is
highly desirable. Based on mussel-inspired chemistry, the anti-icing
coating with extremely low ice adhesion is enabled by constructing
a self-sustainable lubricating layer, achieved via modifying solid
substrates with a highly hydrophilic conjugate of poly(acrylic acid)&#x02013;dopamine.
Both unfreezable and freezable water remain liquidlike at subzero
conditions and synergistically fulfill the role of lubrication for
reducing the ice adhesion. The anti-icing coatings show excellent
stability in harsh environments and durability after the cross-linking.
More importantly, this coating can be applied to various substrates
and is of great promise for practical applications.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao7b00359</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao-2017-003593</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ice formation and accretion
on the surfaces pose severe consequences
in a wide spectrum of fields including airfoils, power transmission
lines, and wind turbines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Over the past decades, many strategies have been
proposed to alleviate and/or eliminate the adverse impact of icing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> The active strategies commonly used for combating icing, such as
chemical, thermal, and mechanical methods, suffer from high cost,
and detrimental environmental consequences, and are usually energy-intensive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> It is therefore desirable to engineer surfaces
for minimizing ice formation and/or reducing ice adhesion, which is
referred to as a passive anti-icing method, bearing the advantages
of low-energy consumption and limited environmental impact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> The surfaces with low ice adhesion preferably allow the formed ice
to be easily shed off by human assistance or natural forces, such
as wind and gravity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup></p><p>During the
past decade, lowering ice adhesion via superhydrophobic
surfaces has been of particular interest in the academic and commercial
communities and has commonly been proposed to mitigate icing problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> However, a large number of investigations have shown that frost
can build up within the micro/nanostructured features of superhydrophobic
surfaces under subzero conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> leading
to the anchoring of ice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> which in turn results in the
increase of ice adhesion during icing/deicing cycles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Kulinich et al. also demonstrated that alkyl- and fluoroalkyl-grafted
surfaces gradually deteriorated and lose their ice repellency after
repeated icing/deicing cycles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> To overcome
the above limitations, the continuous lubricating layer is explored
as a new concept to reduce ice adhesion. Kim and co-workers reported
that slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces have superior antifrosting
and anti-icing properties as compared to those of superhydrophobic
surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Dou et al. used polyurethane
as the main component for preparing anti-icing coating. The polymer
chain consists of hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, and the
hydrophilic hard component can absorb water, forming a lubricating
layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Chen designed self-lubricating
icephobic coatings by blends of poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#x02013;poly(ethylene
glycol) amphiphilic copolymer and poly(dimethylsiloxane), and low
ice adhesion was realized on smooth, hydrophobic surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> However, Ozbay suggested that porous surfaces
infused with the hydrophilic lubricants would be a promising candidate
for anti-icing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Recently, a proof-of-concept
has been proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of introducing an
aqueous lubricating layer between ice and the solid substrate for
reducing ice adhesion, which is formed by hygroscopic polymers due
to water absorption or condensation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> However,
it is not practical to prepare micropores and to graft cross-linked
hygroscopic polymers in the micropores on different types of solid
substrates. Moreover, the ice adhesion strength, &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub>, has not been greatly reduced to such an extent that the accreted
ice can be passively removed in the practical scenario without the
help of external energy, for which extremely low values of &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub> are required (about 20 kPa).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup></p><p>Herein, we design anti-icing coatings with extremely low ice
adhesion
by constructing a self-sustainable lubricating layer (SSLL), which
is achieved via modifying solid surfaces with highly water-absorbing,
hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). The strong association of water
molecules with the PAA chain leads to an overlayer of hydration water
that remains liquidlike down to low temperatures, serving as a lubricating
layer for reducing ice adhesion, which is termed as an SSLL that fulfills
its full potentiality through the uptake of water upon encountering
humid conditions. Compared with conceptually different types of anti-icing
coatings that function through maintaining a lubricating layer of
low surface-energy oil infused into micro/nanostructured substrates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> which are susceptible to malfunction due to
various possibilities, including the displacement and removal of oil
by water or frost,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> SSLL retains its potentiality as long as water is
present and thus maintains long-lasting anti-icing properties.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results
and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Synthesis of Self-Sustainable Lubricating
Anti-Icing Layer</title><p>To explore this conception, the inexpensive
PAA was first conjugated
with dopamine (DA) via carbodiimide coupling chemistry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>) (1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride/hydrochloric acid, EDC&#x000b7;HCl), and then the PAA&#x02013;DA
conjugates were deposited onto solid substrates by mussel-inspired
surface chemistry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> We propose that both
unfreezable and freezable water remain liquidlike at subzero conditions
and synergistically fulfill the role of lubrication for reducing ice
adhesion. By tailoring the conjugation efficiency of DA to PAA, the
ice adhesion strength on the substrates can be greatly reduced compared
to that of the as-received surfaces. Moreover, the stability of PAA&#x02013;DA
film can be greatly improved through NaIO<sub>4</sub>-induced cross-linking.
The outstanding stability under harsh conditions and the facile construction
of the PAA&#x02013;DA film make it attractive for fighting icing problems.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Synthesis

swell as they collect water in their vicinity. Thus, an aqueous lubricating
layer forms naturally as the icing occurs. Ice on the coated surface

that the ratio of nitrogen-to-carbon calculated by XPS for the PD25-coated

and substituted amines (R-NH-R, 399.8 eV), indicating the cross-linking
between PAA&#x02013;DA conjugates. The presence of a minor amount of
primary amine is because of the concurrent existence of noncovalently
self-assembled DA on the covalent coupling PAA&#x02013;DA. The effect
of cross-linking on the morphology of PAA&#x02013;DA film was investigated
by atomic force microscopy (AFM). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a,e shows that the cross-linking exerts an
indistinguishable effect on surface morphology, both presenting abundant
nanoprotuberances on the surfaces. The cross-linked film exhibits
a root-mean-square roughness of 5.60 nm, almost the same as that of
the un-cross-linked counterpart (5.19 nm). The virtually unchangeable
morphologies before and after cross-linking, presented to advantage,
demonstrate the gentleness characteristic of catechol chemistry, which
is superior to thermally induced cross-linking, usually leading to
microscale wavelike profiles, and which is consolidated by the cross-sectional
SEM images of PD25-coated silicon wafer before and after cross-linking.
To illustrate the outstanding stability of the cross-linked PAA&#x02013;DA
film, we conducted soak testing in three types of etching solutions.
The un-cross-linked films are obviously disintegrated after soaking
in the solutions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b&#x02013;d), whereas the cross-linked films maintain their
morphologies intact after treatment with the solutions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>f&#x02013;h). Moreover, the
values of &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub> for the cross-linked films after soaking
in the solutions indistinguishably vary, and are nearly same as that
of the counterpart without soaking. However, &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub> for the un-cross-linked films increases significantly after soaking
in the solutions, further substantiating the remarkable stability
of the cross-linked PAA&#x02013;DA film <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.7b00359/suppl_file/ao7b00359_si_001.pdf">(Figure S6</ext-link>).

that water in the matrix of hydrophilic polymer exists in two distinct
states, that is, nonfreezable water associated with the hydrophilic
groups along the polymer chain to the extent that the well-oriented
hydrogen bonding is in a locally favorable configuration to sufficiently
prevent this fractional water from freezing, and freezable water residing
within macromolecular interstices and/or with proximal occupancy around
the attached water molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> Moreover, the fractions of the
two types of water can be tailored via cross-linking the hydrophilic
polymer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> To explore this strategy, the
conjugation efficiency (<italic>f</italic>) of DA to PAA was varied
by changing the molar feed ratio of PAA to DA (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>) to investigate the effect of cross-linking
on the ice adhesion. Compared to the bare silicon wafer (&#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub> = 189 &#x000b1; 20 kPa), the presence of the PAA&#x02013;DA
film can greatly reduce the ice adhesion, and the increase in <italic>f</italic> gradually lowers the ice adhesion to values as low as
&#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub> = 25 &#x000b1; 7 kPa for PD25 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). However, the further increasing <italic>f</italic> significantly increases &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub> to 170 &#x000b1;
39 kPa (PD40). The cross-linked network between the PAA&#x02013;DA
conjugates swells upon hydration to such an extent that the threshold
of the degree of swelling is attained, that is, the critical concentration
of water, to open up the network, thus allowing more water molecules
to penetrate into the network up to the state of maximum water uptake
(MWU). Therefore, the increasing <italic>f</italic> leads to an increase
in the cross-linking which, in turn, reduces the swellability of the
network and consequently results in the decrease in its MWU from PD3
to PD40 (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.7b00359/suppl_file/ao7b00359_si_001.pdf">Table S1</ext-link>). Okoroafor et al. reported
that under the condition of full hydration, the quantity of unfreezable
water (<italic>C</italic><sub>unf</sub>) increased with the increase
of cross-linking, whereas the increase of cross-linking led to the
decrease in the quantity of freezable water (<italic>C</italic><sub>f</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> We propose that both the unfreezable
and freezable water remain liquidlike at subzero conditions, as discussed
later, and synergistically fulfill the role of the lubricating layer
for reducing the ice adhesion. The increasing <italic>f</italic> increases
the fraction of <italic>C</italic><sub>unf</sub> in the network from
PD3 to PD25, rendering the unfreezable water to realize the potentiality
of lubrication more sufficiently. Simultaneously, <italic>C</italic><sub>f</sub> progressively decreases with the increasing <italic>f</italic> from PD3 to PD25, but the freezing temperature of the
freezable water is gradually depressed from PD3 to PD25, as discussed
below. Then, we can expect that under conditions of measuring ice
adhesion (&#x02212;15 &#x000b0;C, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a), the fraction of the freezable water that would
freeze gradually decreases from PD3 to PD25. Therefore, the synergistic
effect between the unfreezable and freezable water lowers gradually
the ice adhesion from PD3 to PD25. However, the increase of cross-linking
up to a critical degree significantly reduces MWU to such an extent
that the network cannot accommodate sufficient water to play the role
of lubrication, thus resulting in the significant increase of ice
adhesion for PD40 and the substrate coated by highly cross-linked
DA alone. For the substrate coated by PAA alone, &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub> is higher than that of the least-cross-linked PD3. This can be explained
by the fact that the high hygroscopicity characteristic of PAA results
in nearly complete freezing of its hydration water, making it deficient
to serve as a lubricating layer.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(a) Ice adhesion strength measured at

to the gradual increase in &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub> from &#x02212;25 to

to the extent that the lubrication attributed to the freezable water
progressively malfunctions, and unfreezable water is concurrently
deficient to fulfill the lubrication. When temperature is further
lowered down to &#x02212;42 &#x000b0;C, the fractional freezable water
completely freezes resulting in the complete malfunction of lubrication
and the ensuing higher &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub>, which again remains
constant down to the lower temperature where the effect of mechanical
interlocking dominates.</p><p>The measurements of ice nucleation temperature
of single macroscopic
droplets located on the PD25-modified surface were performed in a
home-built setup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> Three to four droplets
of 0.1 &#x003bc;L ultrapure water were separately placed onto the substrate,
and each droplet froze independently without triggering/affecting
the freezing of the proximal one by maintaining enough distance between
the droplets. The surface was cooled at a rate of 2 &#x000b0;C min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> (the cooling rate is the same as that in the ice
adhesion test for PD25) to induce ice nucleation and the temperatures
of ice nucleation were recorded. The number of freezing events performed
is 207, and the statistical distribution of the freezing temperatures
on the PD25-modified surface are investigated. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c shows that the freezing temperature can
be well fitted with a Gaussian function. The average freezing temperature
of macroscopic droplets on the PD25-modified surface is &#x02212;27.2
&#x000b1; 1.7 &#x000b0;C. This is consistent with the change of ice adhesion
with the temperature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b). Moreover, the delayed ice nucleation in the droplets can
also be observed and quantified using DSC for the PD25 sample. As
shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>d,
as the sample is cooled below 0 &#x000b0;C, the water becomes supercooled
until ice formation occurs at &#x02212;27 &#x000b0;C, resulting in the
rising of the temperature due to the release of the latent heat of
freezing. Then, the sample is cooled again down to &#x02212;70 &#x000b0;C.
In the subsequent heating run, the formed ice melts at 0 &#x000b0;C.
The results of delayed ice nucleation consolidate the effect of temperature
on the ice adhesion and also provide the additional benefit of developing
icephobic coatings, if supercooled water can be shed from the surface
prior to freezing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup></p><p>The durability
of the anti-icing coating holds important significance
for its deployment under real-world scenarios to realize its full
potentiality. To characterize the durability of anti-icing coatings,
we conducted two simple tests: repeated icing/deicing and soaking
in the solution as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>a,b. It can be seen that the values of &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub> are nearly constant over 40 icing/deicing cycles, which
presents a noticeable advantage over the state-of-the-art anti-icing
coatings based on superhydrophobic surfaces, whose icephobicity left
much to be desired as embodied by the remarkable increase of &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub> over a few icing/deicing cycles due to the damage to mechanically
weak micro/nanostructures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> The availability
of the adhesive property imparted by DA endows the PAA&#x02013;DA coating
with strong adhesion to the substrate, preventing the coating from
delaminating from the substrate during icing/deicing cycles. Second,
the aqueous lubricating layer is self-sustainable and stimulus-responsive
to water, which can be reversibly formed during icing/deicing cycles.
Over soaking in PBS for 30 days, the anti-icing coatings remain icephobic
with low &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub>, indicating excellent stability and
exhibiting a promising potential for real-world applications (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>b). To illustrate
the versatility of the fabrication of the anti-icing coating from
a wide range of material systems, we investigated the ice adhesion
strength on a series of substrates with a wide range of surface energies
coated by the PAA&#x02013;DA conjugate. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>c, the values of &#x003c4;<sub>ice</sub> on a variety of substrates are dramatically reduced upon
the application of the cross-linked conjugate. The results clearly
demonstrate that the strategy of constructing the anti-icing coating
in this work can be extended to a wide range of material systems,
irrespective of material chemistry, which is rooted in the universal
substrate unspecificity exhibited by DA, of modifying virtually all
types of material surfaces.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(a) Variation in the ice adhesion strength measured

conclusion, we developed a strategy of constructing anti-icing
coatings, which can be extended to a wide range of material systems.
The anti-icing coatings show excellent stability after cross-linking
the PAA&#x02013;DA conjugate even under harsh conditions. We propose
that both unfreezable and freezable water remain liquidlike at subzero
conditions and synergistically fulfill the role of lubrication for
reducing the ice adhesion. By controlling conjugation efficiency,
low ice adhesion strength can be obtained, which can be maintained
at 25 kPa. The robustness and durability of the anti-icing coating
are verified by icing/deicing cycles and soaking tests. This coating
can be applied to various substrates, indicating that this anti-icing
coating is of great promise for practical applications.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Experimental

were incubated in the above solution for 6 h. Then the solid substrates
(including aluminum alloy, copper, glass, ceramic, polyethylene, poly(dimethylsiloxane),
polypropylene, and epoxy resin) were removed, rinsed with ultrapure
water, and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>Characterization</title><p>The FT-IR spectroscopy was obtained
using a Vertex 80 (Bruker, Germany) with an attenuated total reflectance

using 200 W monochromatic Al K&#x003b1; radiation. The base pressure

The pass energy is 30 eV. The number of scans used for the survey

over nine measurements. The setup for measuring the ice adhesion shear
strength consists of an <italic>XY</italic> motion stage, a force
transducer (Imada ZP-500N), a home-built cooling stage, and water-filled
cuvettes that were frozen onto the test surfaces. The cooling stage
could hold nine samples. Then, the cooling stage with the cuvettes
atop of it was placed in a closed box, which was purged with nitrogen
gas to minimize the frost formation outside the cuvettes. The test
was carried out after the water (Milli-Q) in the cuvette was kept
at &#x02212;15 &#x000b0;C for 5 h, which ensured that the water froze
completely. Then, we drive the probe of the force transducer to the
ice columns at a speed of 0.5 mm s<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, and the peak
force required to detach each ice column was recorded to give the
ice adhesion strength by dividing the peak force by the area between
the ice and a solid substrate. This method has been widely used in
the literature and gives a reproducible value of ice adhesion strength
on various surfaces.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.6"><title>Stability of PAA&#x02013;DA Films</title><p>To investigate the

0.1 M NaOH, 0.1 M HCl, and 5 M aqueous solution of NaCl for 2 h. Note
that in the following study, the un-cross-linked and cross-linked
films were prepared using the conjugate PD25, unless otherwise stated.
Furthermore, to test the long-term stability of the solid substrates
coated by PAA&#x02013;DA films, the substrates were immersed in PBS
for a variety of periods (from 0 to 30 days), and washed with deionized
water, and finally dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. The changes
in the morphology and anti-icing performance of the solid substrates
were characterized by using AFM and the ice adhesion test, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.7"><title>DSC Measurement</title><p>DSC was performed using a DSC Q2000

placed into an aluminum cup coated with a thin PD25 film and weighed
quickly to avoid evaporation. Next, the aluminum lid was put on the
pan and sealed hermetically. An empty pan was weighed and used as
a reference. The experiment consisted of two runs: the first cooling
step from 30 to &#x02212;70 &#x000b0;C to freeze the water and the second
step from &#x02212;70 to 30 &#x000b0;C to melt the ice. The experiments
