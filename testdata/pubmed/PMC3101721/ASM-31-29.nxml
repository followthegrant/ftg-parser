The ligand for OX40 (OX40L) is expressed on activated antigen-presenting cells, including B-cells, macrophages, endothelial cells and dendritic cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref></p><p>OX40-OX40L interaction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Engagement of OX40 on activated T-cells during antigen-specific T-cell stimulation can rescue effector T-cells from peripheral deletion. This results in a greater number of T-cells surviving the primary immune response and developing into memory T-cells, which may lead to the development of an autoimmune disease if they encounter their specific antigen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref></p><p>Furthermore, OX40L enhances B-cell proliferation and differentiation; thus its hyperexpression could augment the B-cell hyperactivity found in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The resulting autoantibodies and immune complexes can mediate pathology in multiple systems in individuals with lupus. OX40L also negatively regulates the generation and function of IL-10&#x02013;producing T-regulatory cells, which play a critical role in maintaining peripheral tolerance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref> Recent studies also found a region of OX40 that contains a risk haplotype for SLE, which is correlated with increased expression of cell-surface OX40.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref></p><p>Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most severe complications of SLE and is characterized by the production of nephritogenic autoantibodies and immune complex formation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref> Observations in a mouse model of LN demonstrated the involvement of interactions between OX40 and OX40L in the development of glomerulonephritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref> It was also reported that blockade of OX40 activation in animal models of autoimmune disease resulted in down-regulation of the inflammatory process. It was therefore proposed that the regulation of OX40-signaling may prove to be a beneficial and novel molecular target useful in the management of human inflammatory diseases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref> Studies on OX40 and OX40L in SLE in humans are rare. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of OX40/OX40L as markers of disease activity and nephritis in SLE patients.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>This case-control study was approved by the Review Board of the Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology departments, and was conducted on 40 patients with SLE attending the Rheumatology, Internal Medicine and Physical Medicine outpatient clinics of Ain Shams University Hospital, Egypt. All patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) revised criteria for diagnosis of SLE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref> Patients with other rheumatologic diseases and nephritis due to other causes were excluded. Assessment of disease activity of SLE patients was done by the University of Toronto SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref> The study also included 20 age-grouped apparently healthy volunteers as controls, with no history of autoimmune diseases. They were selected from among relatives of patients admitted without autoimmune diseases. All subjects gave informed consent for participation in the study.</p><p>Serum levels of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence (Euroimmun, L&#x000fc;beck, Germany). Anti&#x02013;double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA) were assessed by ELISA (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and were considered positive if the antibody titer was &#x02265;50 IU/mL. Complement C3 and C4 levels were measured by nephelometry (Dade-Behring, Marburg, Germany).</p><p>Renal functions were assessed by measuring serum levels of creatinine, blood urea, and creatinine clearance. Routine microscopic urinalysis and a 24-hour urine collection for protein assay were also performed. Nephritis was diagnosed if there was persistent proteinuria (more than 0.5 g/24 hours or more than 3+ by urine dipstick test) and/or cellular casts in urine (red blood cell, hemoglobin, granular, tubular or mixed). An ultrasound-guided renal biopsy was performed, after obtaining a written consent, for all SLE nephritis patients using a 16-gauge coaxial quick-core biopsy set. Light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemical staining were performed. Histopathological features of LN were classified by means of the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification of LN, 2003.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref></p><p>OX40 and OX40L were assessed in all patients and controls. Four milliliters of venous blood were collected. Promptly separated serum was used for direct assay of soluble OX40 ligand by ELISA using Quantikine human OX40 Ligand Kit (RandD systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), as recommended by the manufacturer. OX40L concentrations were expressed in pg/mL according to a standard curve. An additional 2 mL of blood was collected into tubes containing K-EDTA (1.2 mg/mL) for measurement of OX40 expression on peripheral blood CD4+ T-lymphocytes by flow-cytometry (Coulter EPICS XL). Samples were analyzed within 6 hours. Staining (triple-color surface staining) of 100 &#x000b5;L of each sample was done using 10 &#x000b5;L of each of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrincyanin (Pecy5)-conjugated mouse monoclonal antihuman OX40 antibodies (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse monoclonal antihuman CD4 (RandD Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The tubes were then incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes. Erythrocytes were lysed using ammonium chloride lysing solution (Al-Gomhoreyya CA, Egypt). After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were resuspended in PBS for flow-cytometric analysis. Negative isotype-matched controls were included with each sample to determine the nonspecific binding of the monoclonal antibodies. The results were expressed as percentage of the positive cells relative to the isotypic control.</p><p>Analysis of data was performed using the SPSS program, version 12. The t test was used to compare the means of two groups. The one-way ANOVA test was used to compare the means of more than two groups, followed by the Tukey test as a multiple comparison procedure to identify significant differences between means. Correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient r) assessing the strength of the relationship between two quantitative variables was performed. Correlations with anti-dsDNA were performed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, as anti-dsDNA levels were not normally distributed. Area under the curve (AUC) calculations of nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the sensitivity and specificity of OX40, OX40L and anti-dsDNA in diagnosing nephritis among patients with SLE. A P value of less than .05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>This study was conducted on 40 SLE patients who fulfilled the ACR revised criteria for diagnosis of SLE. The SLE patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of nephritis. Group I included 20 patients with nephritis (18 females, 2 males; mean [SD] age, 27.2 [6.3] years, with a range of 17-42 years). Their mean (SD) disease duration was 5.6 (3.2) years (range, 1-11 years). Group II included 20 patients without nephritis (all females; mean [SD] age, 26.8 [9.5] years, with a range of 15-46 years). Their mean (SD) disease duration was 3.9 (2.9) years (range, 0.5-10 years). Twenty healthy volunteers were also included as controls (all females; mean [SD] age, 26.1 [7.8] years, with a range of 19-40 years). No significant differences in age or gender were detected between the three groups.</p><p>All 40 patients with lupus were positive for ANAs.

A recent study also showed that anti-OX40 therapy controlled the extent of T-cell&#x02013;mediated damage in LN.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref> CD4+ T-cells expressing OX40 could mediate LN either by aiding B-cells to produce antibodies, including anti-dsDNA antibodies, that may contribute to the kidney lesions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref> ; or by directly infiltrating glomerular endothelial cells after ligation with OX40L, thereby causing direct damage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref></p><p>Serum-soluble OX40L was significantly higher in SLE patients than controls, although it did not correlate with disease activity. Furthermore, only patients with LN showed a significant increase in serum OX40L levels. Among patients with SLE, serum OX40L levels correlated positively with serum creatinine levels but did not vary greatly between the different classes of LN. A previous study reported an improvement in SLE after treatment with monoclonal antibodies against OX40L, with a decrease in the levels of IFN-gamma, IL-6 and anti-dsDNA antibody, which supports a role for OX40L in SLE pathogenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref> OX40L has been reported to be abundantly present in glomeruli in renal biopsies of almost all cases of proliferative LN, which supports a role for OX40L in LN.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref> On the other hand, Patschan et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref> did not find any significant difference in serum-soluble OX40L concentration between SLE patients and healthy controls. This could be partially explained by the smaller number (27) of patients studied and the smaller proportion (8/27) of patients with LN.</p><p>The need for a reliable marker for LN is highly important. While renal biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of nephritis in patients with lupus, it is an invasive procedure that cannot be performed serially for monitoring purposes. Anti-DNA antibodies and complement levels often correlate with the presence of nephritis, but they are not specific and do not have a high discriminatory power. Their utility in reflecting disease activity and LN remains controversial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref> Our results showed that OX40 expression had higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing LN than both OX40L and anti-dsDNA, indicating its promising role as a marker of nephritis. This issue should be investigated in a study with larger cohort of patients, with special emphasis on the role of these markers in predicting the occurrence and severity of nephritis in SLE patients.</p><p>In conclusion, both OX40 expression on CD4+ T-cells and serum levels of OX40L may serve as markers of LN. Furthermore, measurements of the percentage of CD4+ T-lymphocytes expressing OX40 may serve as an indicator of SLE disease activity. We recommend further studies for immunohistochemical detection of OX40 and OX40L in renal biopsies in larger numbers of patients with LN, for further clarification of the pathology of LN. Therapeutic approaches with drugs that target these molecules might be useful in treatment of SLE and LN.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p><italic>The authors thank Dr. Naglaa A.
