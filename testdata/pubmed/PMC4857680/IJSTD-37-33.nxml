Many studies have reported the prevalence of HBV/HCV coinfection in HIV.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] One of the major determinants of prevalence is geographical location and different HIV-infected population show marked variations in the prevalence of HBV/HCV coinfections depending on the endemicity.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Only few studies on the prevalence of HBV/HCV in HIV patients have been reported from India.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In our study, the prevalence of HBV in HIV patients was 3.6%, 6.4%, and 6.2% in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. Studies from Lucknow[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Chennai[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] have also reported similar prevalence (&#x0003c;10%) of HBV coinfection with HIV. However, one study from Nagpur[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported a very high prevalence (30.4%) of HBV-HIV coinfection. This data reveal that observations have been highly variable from different regions of the country. The HCV prevalence in HIV patients was very low in our study (1.56%). However, other studies in India have reported prevalence as high as 8.3%[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and 7.2%[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and as low as 1.6%[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and 2.3%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Studies from other countries like Nigeria[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have reported 0.4% HBV-HIV coinfection and 0% HIV-HCV coinfection and Iran[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have showed 14.5% HIV-HBV coinfection and 72% HIV-HCV coinfection. It is noticeable in our study that the high prevalence rate of HBV seropositivity in HIV patients in comparison with HCV seropositivity indicates poor immunization coverage because multiple vaccines are available for HBV in contrast to HCV which lacks a vaccine. One of the reasons could be that the sexual transmission of HCV is lower as compared to HBV and it is transmitted mostly via injections and in India the most common route of HIV transmission is sexual. It is recommended that all high-risk group persons should get vaccinated against HBV. In our study, majority of the HIV-positive patients and HBV/HCV seropositive patients among them were males in the age group 21&#x02013;40 years which is the active sexual stage. Saha <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Have also reported similar findings as regards to age and sex. We have also reported a high prevalence of HBV seropositivity in HIV patients in males (83.3%) and even the one case of HCV seropositive was also a male patient. Similar results have been found in other studies in relation to HBV and HCV infection in HIV patients which helps in explaining why more than 80% of coinfected individuals are males.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Although age and gender have no statistically significant association with HBV/HCV seropositivity in HIV patients, old age plus immunodeficiency does increase the risk of acquiring hepatic infection as observed in our study that HIV-positive patients who were &#x0003e;60 years of age were at increased risk of becoming HBV seropositive (OR = 3.3182; 95% CI: 0.3669&#x02013;30.005) as compared with other age groups.</p><p>The prevalence of HIV in India is quite high, and it has the second most number of people living with HIV.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, we observed that the number of HIV-positive cases decreased from 83 cases in 2012 to 64 cases in 2014. Despite this, there has been no significant change in the prevalence of HBV/HCV seropositivity in HIV patients over last 3 years in our study. This probably explains why an estimated one-third of deaths in HIV patients are directly or indirectly related to liver diseases.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Rising trends in the prevalence of HBV and HCV among HIV-infected patients for 1998&#x02013;2004 have been reported by a study in the USA.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] To the best of our knowledge and literature search, no studies have been reported from India so far regarding trends in HBV/HCV seropositivity in HIV patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Immunodeficiency by HIV leads to a high probability of acquiring HBV and HCV infection in HIV positive patients. Therefore, it is recommended that HIV patients should be screened routinely for concurrent HBV/HCV infection because the presence of hepatotropic viruses with HIV increases the risk of cirrhosis and other liver mortalities. Furthermore, it interferes with antiretroviral therapy. The findings of our study and other similar studies might be useful for surveillance agencies in India for better understanding and management of HBV/HCV coinfections with HIV. Such scientific findings should be interpreted into sustainable prevention programs to improve public health policies, not only in India but worldwide.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>we would like to acknowledge Dr. A S Puri, director professor and head of Gastroenterology, G B Pant hospital and his technical staff for their support.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chandra</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Joshi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Raju</surname><given-names>YS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Teja</surname><given-names>VD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hepatitis B and/or C co-infection in HIV infected patients: A study in a tertiary care centre from South India</article-title><source>Indian J Med Res</source><year>2013</year><volume>138</volume><fpage>950</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24521641</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alter</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology of viral hepatitis and HIV co-infection</article-title><source>J Hepatol</source><year>2006</year><volume>44</volume><issue>1 Suppl</issue><fpage>S6</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16352363</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mocroft</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Monforte</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kirk</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Friis-Moller</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Banhegyi</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Decline in AIDS and death rates in EUROSIDA study;
