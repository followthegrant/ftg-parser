To assess the functional consequences of changes to a genome, a variety of methods are needed to examine extinct DNA function. We isolated a transcriptional enhancer element from the genome of an extinct marsupial, the Tasmanian tiger (<italic>Thylacinus cynocephalus</italic> or thylacine), obtained from 100 year-old ethanol-fixed tissues from museum collections. We then examined the function of the enhancer <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using a transgenic approach, it was possible to resurrect DNA function in transgenic mice. The results demonstrate that the thylacine <italic>Col2A1</italic> enhancer directed chondrocyte-specific expression in this extinct mammalian species in the same way as its orthologue does in mice. While other studies have examined extinct coding DNA function <italic>in vitro,</italic> this is the first example of the restoration of extinct non-coding DNA and examination of its function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our method using transgenesis can be used to explore the function of regulatory and protein-coding sequences obtained from any extinct species in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model system, providing important insights into gene evolution and diversity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extant species represent less than 1&#x00025; of the genetic diversity that has existed in the animal kingdom <xref rid="pone.0002240-Rmpler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

Many efforts, such as that of the Frozen Zoo (San Diego Zoological Society Conservation and Research for Endangered Species) are working to cryo-archive cell and tissue resources from a diverse range of threatened species, to protect their genetic information. However, for those species that have already become extinct, access to their genetic biodiversity may not be completely lost.</p><p>The Tasmanian tiger or thylacine (<italic>Thylacinus cynocephalus</italic>) was a large, carnivorous Australian marsupial. Often described as the most striking example of convergent evolution in the mammalian lineage, the marsupial thylacine was morphologically almost indistinguishable from the eutherian canids, apart from the presence of a pouch where its young developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002240-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0002240-Paddle1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thylacines were hunted to extinction in the wild in the early 1900s and the last known animal died in captivity in the Hobart Zoo in 1936 <xref rid="pone.0002240-Paddle1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Fortunately, some thylacine pouch young and adult tissues were preserved in alcohol in several museum collections around the world (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002240-g001">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002240-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002240.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The thylacine, <italic>Thylacinus cynocephalus.</italic>

There have been several recent papers published examining the genomes from a diverse range of extinct species from plants and bacteria to mammoths and Neanderthals <xref rid="pone.0002240-Novacek1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002240-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002240-LaluezaFox1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. While most studies to date have examined the mitochondrial DNA of these species for phylogenetic purposes, the focus is now shifting to the analysis of genomic DNA. Recent advances in sequencing technologies, such as direct high-throughput parallel pyrosequencing, are expected to expand the ancient DNA data bank exponentially over the coming years <xref rid="pone.0002240-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Most studies have used the sequence data to examine divergence times and population structure of extinct species. However, more recently this information is being used to examine how the function of these genes may have evolved. The function of the <italic>Melanocortin 1 Receptor</italic> (<italic>MC1R</italic>) gene has recently been investigated from the extinct mammoth and Neanderthal <xref rid="pone.0002240-Rmpler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002240-LaluezaFox1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Isolated <italic>MC1R</italic> sequences from ancient DNA samples were cloned and transfected into cell lines to examine the function of the receptor in activation assays <italic>in vitro.</italic> The results of these experiments suggest that variation in skin and hair pigmentation may have occurred within these species <xref rid="pone.0002240-Rmpler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002240-LaluezaFox1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and describes a technical platform for examining extinct protein function <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>While many adaptive changes throughout evolution have been ascribed to changes within the proteins themselves <xref rid="pone.0002240-Coyne1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002240-Hoekstra1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, the high conservation of protein coding regions between mammalian genomes suggests that changes in the open reading frames are unlikely to be the primary cause of the vast differences observed in both form and function <xref rid="pone.0002240-King1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002240-Prudhomme1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. With the recent release of the ENCODE pilot study <xref rid="pone.0002240-The1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> it is clear that the majority of the non-coding mammalian genome is transcribed. It appears that rather than changes in the genes themselves, it is subtle differences in their non-coding regulatory elements that control their spatial, temporal and quantitative expression that underpins the variation in the animal kingdom <xref rid="pone.0002240-King1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002240-Prudhomme1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, the non-coding regions of extinct genomes are likely to hold the most important genetic information that defined a species. We have therefore developed a technique for examining the function of non-coding regions from extinct genomes <italic>in vivo</italic>. To gain a greater insight into the function of these elements we isolated a regulatory sequence from the genome of the extinct thylacine using transgenesis and examined its function in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Extinct DNA Isolation and Fragment Characterisation</title><p>To resurrect the function of non-coding DNA from an extinct mammal, we isolated genomic DNA using the technique described by P&#x000e4;&#x000e4;bo <xref rid="pone.0002240-Pbo1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. DNA was obtained from four 100-year-old specimens: three alcohol-fixed pouch young (one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002240-g001">Figure 1b</xref>) and one dried adult pelt, obtained from Museum Victoria (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). The isolated DNA was fragmented as expected <xref rid="pone.0002240-Willerslev1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and ranged from 300&#x02013;500 bp. We obtained 200 ng to 1 &#x003bc;g from each sample. We chose to isolate the well-characterised transcriptional enhancer element of the pro&#x003b1;1(II) collagen (<italic>Col2a1</italic>) gene <xref rid="pone.0002240-Lefebvre1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002240-Leung1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

Primers were designed to span the core enhancer from regions conserved across all described mammalian species using a Clustal-W alignment. Primers were engineered with <italic>Spe</italic>1 (forward primer) and <italic>Xba</italic>1 (reverse primer) restriction sites to allow for multimerisation of the resulting product (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We performed PCR amplification from each DNA sample independently to reduce the risk of cross contamination, and to ensure the sequence was identical across all individuals, confirming it was thylacine in origin. This approach was also used to ensure sequence obtained was not harbouring any genetic changes caused by spontaneous hydrolysis or oxidation of the preserved DNA <xref rid="pone.0002240-Willerslev1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The resulting 264-bp PCR product from each sample, encoding the enhancer was independently subcloned and sequenced.

While the intensity of the reporter gene expression seen in the transgenic fetuses varied, the sites of expression did not. Variations in transgene expression levels are common, and can be affected by the site of integration and by the effect of epigenetic silencing mechanisms on the transgene <xref rid="pone.0002240-Nagy1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Despite the level of variation, the expression of the thylacine <italic>Col2A1</italic> enhancer recapitulated that of the endogenous mouse <italic>Col2a1</italic> gene <xref rid="pone.0002240-Lefebvre1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002240-Leung1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and was restricted to the developing chondrocytes. This confirms that the thylacine <italic>Col2a1</italic> gene had a conserved developmental role in cartilage formation, and that its promoter directed expression in chondrocytes in this extinct marsupial mammal. It also suggests that the associated transcription factors and the minimal enhancer element required for inducing expression from this promoter have remained sufficiently conserved between mice and marsupials to direct expression <xref rid="pone.0002240-Lefebvre2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002240-Lefebvre3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> despite approximately 148 million years of divergent evolution between these species <xref rid="pone.0002240-BinindaEmonds1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002240-Wible1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>The minimal 18-bp element <xref rid="pone.0002240-Lefebvre1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> required for chondrocyte specific expression is only 17-bp in the thylacine and differs at 4 nucleotides positions compared with the mouse. Furthermore, the sequences of the inverted repeats thought be to essential for the function of this region that flank the minimal element are completely complementary in mouse, rat and human, <xref rid="pone.0002240-Lefebvre1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, in the thylacine, the outer repeat is highly conserved but the inner repeat differs by 2 nucleotides and is not complimentary. Despite these differences, the enhancer element was able to function in the developing mouse, suggesting that these differences are not critical for the function of this element. Therefore, the examination of extinct DNA can provide important information about gene function in extant species. Taken together, the results of this study confirm an ancestral role for the thylacine <italic>Col2A1</italic> gene in cartilage formation and demonstrate that it is possible to examine non-coding DNA function from extinct animals <italic>in vivo</italic> in the mouse.</p><p>These observations advance previous studies that have so for only examined extinct protein function and only in <italic>in vitro</italic> systems <xref rid="pone.0002240-Rmpler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002240-LaluezaFox1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, both systems (<italic>in vitro</italic> cell cultures and <italic>in vivo</italic> whole organism models) rely on the availability and compatibility of cofactors within the host cell or embryo in order to examine gene or regulatory sequence function. It is possible that the variations in receptor signalling strength seen in the mammoth and Neanderthal <italic>MC1R</italic> gene analyses <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0002240-Rmpler1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002240-LaluezaFox1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> did not occur or affect gene function in their native organisms. The native ligand in the mammoth and Neanderthal may have varied to the one used in culture, as could the downstream activation strength of the signalling pathway. Similarly it is possible that the thylacine <italic>Col2A1</italic> enhancer had a different pattern of expression in the developing thylacine embryo to that observed in the mouse, due to the different availability of cofactors required for its activation. The precise function of an extinct gene or regulatory element is impossible to determine without examining every part of the pathway in one system. Results from extinct DNA analyses therefore should be cautiously interpreted.</p><p>Thus extinct genomes can be examined by the <italic>in vivo</italic> method described here, in conjunction with <italic>in vitro</italic> techniques, to enable functional analyses of the genes and regulatory elements. This could provide important insights into genome evolution by defining functional features unique to each species. We have demonstrated that non-coding genetic information from an extinct species can be resurrected <italic>in vivo</italic> and in doing so, we have restored to life the genetic potential of a fragment of this extinct mammalian genome.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Tissues, DNA isolation, amplification, and transgene construction and analyses</title><p>Tissues were obtained from three 100-year-old thylacine pouch young specimens fixed in ethanol and one dried 100-year-old adult skin from Museum Victoria, Melbourne.
