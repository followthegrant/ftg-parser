Abnormal mitochondrial dynamics have been increasingly implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction in pathophysiological conditions. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of Cd on mitochondrial dynamics during hepatotoxicity. In the L02 liver cell lines, 12&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>) exposure induced excessive mitochondrial fragmentation as early as 3&#x02009;h post-treatment with Cd, which preceded the mitochondrial dysfunction such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;m) loss and ATP reduction. Concurrent to mitochondrial fragmentation, CdCl<sub>2</sub> treatment increased the protein levels of dynamin-related protein (Drp1) and promoted the recruitment of Drp1 into mitochondria. Strikingly, mitochondrial fragmentation also occurred in the liver tissue of rats exposed to CdCl<sub>2</sub>, accompanied by enhanced recruitment of Drp1 into mitochondria. Moreover, in L02 cells, Drp1 silencing could effectively reverse Cd-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the increased expression and mitochondrial recruitment of Drp1 were tightly related to the disturbance of calcium homeostasis, which could be prevented by both chelating [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and inhibiting [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub> uptake. Overall, our study indicated that Cd induced Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation by disturbing calcium homeostasis to promote hepatotoxicity. Manipulation of Drp1 may be the potential avenue for developing novel strategies to protect against cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cadmium</kwd><kwd>hepatotoxicity</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial fragmentation</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial dysfunction</kwd><kwd>dynamin-related protein (Drp1)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Cadmium (Cd) is a long-lived environmental and occupational pollutant.

Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that the mitochondria of L02 cells in the untreated control groups exhibited normal elongated-tubular structures. However, after L02 cells were exposed to 12&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M CdCl<sub>2</sub> for various time periods (0, 3, 6, 12 and 24&#x02009;h), the morphology of mitochondria gradually changed into significant punctuated structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To further confirm this morphological phenomenon, the mitochondria were tracked in real time by using time-lapse microscopy as soon as the L02 cells exposed to CdCl<sub>2</sub>.

As shown in figure, until 6&#x02009;h after exposure, CdCl<sub>2</sub> significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and reduced &#x00394;&#x003a8;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) in a time-dependent manner. Following this damage, the contents of ATP were clearly decreased beginning 12&#x02009;h after exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In addition to mitochondrial dysfunction, cell viability in the CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated L02 cells underwent a time-dependent reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

As to mitochondrial morphology, electron microscopy studies presented normal elongated-tubular structures in the livers of the control group, whereas the livers of the CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated rats had an increased number of smaller mitochondria with fragmented and spotted structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, the MDA levels were significantly increased in the livers of rats exposed to CdCl<sub>2</sub> compared with the control group (a 53 and 177&#x00025; elevation for 1 and 2&#x02009;mg/kg CdCl<sub>2</sub>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Western blot analysis revealed that 1 and 2&#x02009;mg/kg CdCl<sub>2</sub> significantly increased the protein levels of Drp1 by 35 and 70&#x00025;, respectively. Additionally, 2&#x02009;mg/kg CdCl<sub>2</sub> decreased the protein levels of Mfn1 by 56&#x00025;, whereas 1&#x02009;mg/kg CdCl<sub>2</sub> did not have any effect on Mfn1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a and b</xref>).

Furthermore, in isolated mitochondria from both rats liver tissue and L02 cells, CdCl<sub>2</sub> exposure increased the mitochondrial Drp1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a&#x02013;d</xref>). Consistent with the increase in mitochondrial Drp1 protein levels, confocal microscopy showed that CdCl<sub>2</sub> significantly promoted the translocation of Drp1 from the cytoplasm into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). These results indicated that Drp1 played critical roles in Cd-induced mitochondrial fragmentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Drp1 silencing attenuated CdCl<sub>2</sub>-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial dysfunction in L02 cells</title><p>The above <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results both demonstrated that Cd-induced mitochondrial fragmentation had a correlation with the Drp1. This correlation raised a possibility that Drp1 siRNA could protect against the hepatotoxicity of Cd.

Consistent with inducing excessive mitochondrial fragmentation, Cd exposure significantly increased protein levels of Drp1 and promoted the recruitment of Drp1 into mitochondria, which was tightly associated with the disturbance of calcium homeostasis. Furthermore, Drp1 silencing, as well as the use of agents that interfere with [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub>, were found to efficiently prevent mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction in Cd-treated L02 cells. Our study indicated that Cd exposure induced Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation by disturbing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis that contributed to mitochondrial dysfunction in its hepatotoxicity. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the mechanism of Cd hepatotoxicity focusing on the impairment of mitochondrial dynamics.</p><p>The accelerated applications of Cd in modern society raise the risk of causing adverse effects on human health. Both acute and chronic Cd exposures have numerous undesirable effects on liver tissue. It is well documented that mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the hepatotoxicity of Cd due to its unique structural and functional characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> The interactions between Cd and mitochondria have been emphasized as the critical events in Cd hepatotoxicity, however, it is unclear exactly how these interactions lead to mitochondrial damage to date. Recently, mitochondria were proved to be highly dynamic organelles that have a profound impact in mitochondrial and cellular function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> The disturbed mitochondrial dynamics have broad significance with respect to providing insight into novel mechanisms for several well-documented mitochondrial defects, such as in neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disorders and diabetes mellitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Thus, it is well worth investigating whether abnormal mitochondrial dynamics are related to Cd-induced mitochondrial damage.</p><p>Mitochondrial dynamics are regulated by the delicate balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission. Any disturbances in mitochondrial dynamics may be promptly reflected by changes in mitochondrial morphology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> In the present study, Cd exposure significantly induced the changes of mitochondrial morphology from elongated-tubular and filamentous networks to small and spherical structures both in L02 cells and in rat liver tissue. According to previous reports, these morphological changes indicated that mitochondrial fragmentation was involved in the hepatotoxicity of Cd, which may lead to mitochondrial damage through hampering the mixture and exchange of mitochondrial contents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> This damage could explain why Cd exposure disturbed mitochondrial structures, altered the mitochondrial permeability transition, inhibited the respiratory chain reaction pathway, induced oxidative stress and reduced ATP contents in others' studies and in ours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup></p><p>Mitochondrial fragmentation seems to be an early, upstream event in mitochondrial dysfunction in the hepatotoxicity of Cd. Real-time morphology analysis indicated that mitochondrial fragmentation occurred as early as 3&#x02009;h after L02 cells were exposed to CdCl<sub>2</sub>. Consistently, the protein levels of Drp1, the key mitochondrial fission mediator, were significantly increased, and Drp1 was recruited into mitochondria. These results indicated that Cd-induced mitochondrial fission occurred earlier than mitochondrial dysfunction, which only changed over a 6-h period in CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated L02 cells. Importantly, silencing of Drp1 inhibited the toxic effects of CdCl<sub>2</sub> on the overwhelming mitochondrial fission, followed by the turnover of mitochondrial dysfunction. The present results suggest that mitochondrial fragmentation not only precedes mitochondrial dysfunction but is also required for mitochondrial dysfunction in the hepatotoxicity of Cd. These data were consistent with recent reports, demonstrating that excessive mitochondrial fragmentation mediated by fission is essential for oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup></p><p>The dynamic balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission is usually mediated by five large dynamin-related GTPases. Fusion involves the Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 proteins, whereas fission requires the Drp1 and Fis1 proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> In Cd-treated L02 cells, only the protein levels of Drp1 significantly increased, while the levels of the other four dynamin-related proteins did not exhibit any changes. In addition, the increased Drp1 was found to largely translocated into mitochondria. This finding suggested that the increased Drp1 is recruited to punctuate spots on the mitochondrial surface to mediate mitochondrial fission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> The importance of Drp1 was also confirmed in the injured liver tissue of rats exposed to Cd. Importantly, manipulation Drp1 by siRNA efficiently blocked CdCl<sub>2</sub>-induced mitochondrial fragmentations, which profited for rescuing mitochondrial dysfunction and cell damage. In agreement with our study, other experimental models have shown that inhibition of Drp1 function and overexpression of dominant-negative Drp1 are effective in preventing mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial-dependent cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Thus, our study demonstrated that Drp1 plays a critical role in the mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hepatotoxicity of Cd.</p><p>It is likely that Cd exposure increased Drp1 expression and its mitochondrial recruitment through disturbing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis. In the present study, Cd exposure was found to initiate [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation coupled with [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub> uptake in L02 cells. Either chelating [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> or inhibiting [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub> uptake efficiently prevented the mitochondrial recruitment of Drp1, followed by a reduction of mitochondrial fragmentation. Based on previous studies, it could be speculated that Cd-induced [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation may activate the calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of Drp1 and regulate Drp1 translocation into mitochondria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> In addition, the increased [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub> also directly enhanced Drp1 recruitment to the mitochondria, possibly through structural changes in mitochondrial permeability transition proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> However, there is at least one difference in the way [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub> regulate Drp1 recruitment. We found that a [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> chelator could reverse the increase of Drp1 protein levels while a [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>m</sub> inhibitor had no effect. It suggested that except for regulating Drp1 mitochondrial recruitment, [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was also responsible for the increase in Drp1 expression, which may provide the molecular basis for Drp1 recruitment.</p><p>Taken together, the present data demonstrated that pronounced mitochondrial fragmentation is evident in Cd-induced hepatotoxicity. Given the temporal relationship between mitochondrial dynamics alteration and mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive mitochondrial fragmentation may provide a new perspective from which to understand the mechanisms that underlie Cd-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in liver injuries. In this regard, it is worth noting Drp1, a key mediator of mitochondrial fission, plays a critical role in mitochondrial fragmentation. Hence, the manipulation of Drp1 may offer new strategies to combat the hepatotoxicity induced by cadmium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><p>The human normal liver cell line L02 was purchased from the Cell Bank of the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (Shanghai, China).

For the experiments involving Cd exposure, randomly selected rats were intraperitoneally injected with 1&#x02009;mg/kg (<italic>n</italic>=6) or 2&#x02009;mg/kg (<italic>n</italic>=6) CdCl<sub>2</sub> for 14 days. The CdCl<sub>2</sub> was dissolved in 0.9&#x00025; physiological saline. An additional six randomly selected rats were intraperitoneally injected with 0.9&#x00025; physiological saline to serve as the controls. Rats were sacrificed by decapitation 24&#x02009;h after the final injection of Cd, and their livers were harvested for analysis. All of these procedures were approved by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technique for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.</p></sec><sec><title>Confocal laser microscopy</title><p>To measure changes in the mitochondrial morphology in L02 cells, the CdCl<sub>2</sub>-treated cells were reacted with 200&#x02009;nM MitoTracker Red CMXRos probe (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30&#x02009;min at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C according to the manufacturer's instructions. After being washed twice in cold PBS, the live cells were visualized under a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP2, Wetzlar, Germany). MitoTracker Red was monitored at 579&#x02009;nm for excitation and at 599&#x02009;nm for emission. In accordance with a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> the fragmented mitochondria were recognized as shortened, punctate and sometimes rounded organelles, whereas filamentous mitochondria had a thread-like tubular structure.</p><p>To analyze the translocation of Drp1 into mitochondria, after being incubated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos probe, cells were fixed with 4&#x00025; (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 20&#x02009;min. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.5&#x00025; Triton X-100 in PBS for 15&#x02009;min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS before being blocked with normal goat serum at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against human Drp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at a 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;50 dilution overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and then with an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H&#x0002b;L) (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) at a 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;100 dilution for 1&#x02009;h at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The cells were mounted in mounting medium and visualized under a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Time-Lapse microscopy</title><p>L02 cells were seeded on glass-bottomed dishes. After the mitochondria were labeled with the MitoTracker Red CMXRos probe, the cells were exposed to CdCl2. Individual mitochondria were tracked in real time by using a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope. As previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> images were acquired every 10&#x02009;min for 6&#x02009;h. During the experiment, the cells were placed in a well-equipped live imaging station with a controlled temperature at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, humidity and 95&#x00025; air/5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Oxidative stress determination</title><p>The level of oxidative stress in L02 cells was determined by measuring the oxidation of DCFH-DA (Beyotime Company, Shanghai, China) as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> The cellular fluorescence intensity was expressed as the fold change relative to the level observed in the control cells. The oxidative stress in rat liver tissue was measured using a Lipid Peroxidation MDA Assay Kit (Beyotime Company) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The experiment was repeated six times, and the MDA levels were expressed as nmol/mg protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;m)</title><p>A mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit with JC-1 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to measure the &#x00394;&#x003a8;m in L02 cells. Briefly, 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells were plated in a 96-well plate for incubation with 1 &#x000d7; JC-1 in growth medium at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 20&#x02009;min. The resulting green and red fluorescence intensities were detected using an Infinite M200 Microplate Reader (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland). The &#x00394;&#x003a8;m for each group was calculated as the fluorescence ratio of red to green and expressed as a multiple of the fluorescence ratio in the control groups. All experiments were repeated six times.</p></sec><sec><title>ATP content determination</title><p>ATP was measured with an ATP Determination Kit (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA).

After the solutions were gently mixed, intensity readings for the above mixtures were measured with an Infinite M200 Microplate Reader. The ATP content in the samples was calculated using an ATP standard curve. The ATP contents were expressed as the percentage of the level observed in the control groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>Cell viability was analyzed using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan).

The cells were then incubated at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;h. After incubation, the OD value at 450&#x02009;nm was determined with an Infinite M200 Microplate Reader. The results were expressed as a percentage of the values of the control set at 100&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec><title>Transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy</title><p>Frozen liver tissues were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 10&#x00025; buffered formaldehyde for 72&#x02009;h before being embedded in paraffin. The sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated with graded ethanol and quenched with PBS three times. Then, liver sections (5-mm thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for observation under a light microscope. For the transmission electron microscopy studies, the liver sections were washed with PBS and cut into small pieces (1&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup>). After fixation with 2.5&#x00025; glutaraldehyde, which was pre-cooled to 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, the livers were post-fixed with 2&#x00025; osmium tetroxide in 0.1&#x02009;M PBS, rinsed, dehydrated and embedded. Random thin sections (0.05&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m) were cut using glass knives, collected on naked copper-meshed grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were examined and viewed using a Hitachi-7500 electron microscope (Hitachi-7500, Hitachi Co., Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Protein samples that were isolated from rat liver tissues and L02 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE. After protein transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the membranes were blocked and incubated with various primary antibodies at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C overnight. We used the following primary antibodies for the western blots: rabbit anti-mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) (Cat. No ab104585, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit anti-mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) (Cat.

No sc-271583, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-fission 1 (Fis1) (Cat. No ab71498, Abcam) and mouse anti-actin (Cat. No sc-81178, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The special Odyssey secondary antibodies were IRDye680 or IRDye800 donkey anti-rabbit antibody, IRDye680 donkey anti-goat antibody and IRDye800 donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody. The fluorescent signals were detected and quantified using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). For the mitochondrial Drp1 protein level analysis, mitochondrial extracts were isolated from rat liver tissue and L02 cells with the Tissue and Cell Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Beyotime Company). Then, the mitochondrial Drp1 protein levels were determined as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Drp1 siRNA vector construction and transfection</title><p>An siRNA targeting human Drp1 was designed by Invitrogen Corporation (Shanghai, China) and cloned into the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFPmiR vector. Negative controls siRNA was also provided by Invitrogen Corporation. The constructed vectors were transfected into L02 cells using optimum-minimum essential medium with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD, USA). At 48&#x02009;h post-transfection, the L02 cells were treated with 12&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M CdCl<sub>2</sub> for 12&#x02009;h.
