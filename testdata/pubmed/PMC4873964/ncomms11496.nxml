It exists as a free molecule, intracellularly and extracellularly, and conjugated to target proteins. Studies in mice have demonstrated a role for Isg15 in antiviral immunity. By contrast, human ISG15 was shown to have critical immune functions, but not in antiviral immunity. Namely, free extracellular ISG15 is crucial in IFN-&#x003b3;-dependent antimycobacterial immunity, while free intracellular ISG15 is crucial for USP18-mediated downregulation of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signalling. Here we describe <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient patients who display no enhanced susceptibility to viruses <italic>in vivo</italic>, in stark contrast to <italic>Isg15</italic>-deficient mice. Furthermore, fibroblasts derived from <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient patients display enhanced antiviral protection, and expression of ISG15 attenuates viral resistance to WT control levels. The species-specific gain-of-function in antiviral immunity observed in ISG15 deficiency is explained by the requirement of ISG15 to sustain USP18 levels in humans, a mechanism not operating in mice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

It has two ubiquitin-like domains and is synthesized from an immature precursor by cleavage of a C-terminal extension peptide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Mature ISG15 has the LRLRGG sequence, which is also present at the C terminus of mature ubiquitin. ISG15 exists in two distinct states: as a free molecule (intracellular and extracellular) or conjugated to target protein lysine residues (ISGylation)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In a process similar to ubiquitin ligation, ISGylation involves a conjugation pathway including E1 (UBE1L), E2 (UBCH8) and E3 (HERC5, EFP, HHARI) enzymes. ISGylation is reversed by the action of the isopeptidase ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18; UBP43)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Accordingly, cells deficient in the conjugation machinery exhibit absent or reduced ISGylation, while <italic>Usp18</italic>-deficient cells exhibit high levels of Isg15 conjugates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. All of the enzymes involved in ISGylation/de-ISGylation are transcriptionally induced by IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;.</p><p>Numerous <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have ascribed an antiviral role to ISG15.

ISG15 small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown in human cells has also suggested an antiviral role for free and/or conjugated ISG15 during infection with numerous viruses, including IAV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, human immunodeficiency virus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, Ebola virus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, human papilloma virus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, VSV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, Japanese encephalitis virus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and Sendai virus (SeV)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. While these many studies have suggested an antiviral role for ISG15, others have suggested no role at all; the one clear exception is hepatitis C virus (HCV). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies of HCV infection suggest that ISG15 exhibits proviral activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The silencing of ISG15 in human hepatoma cells was found to lead to an inhibition of HCV replication, increases in cell sensitivity to IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and accumulation of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-stimulated gene products (ISGs).</p><p>Our studies on <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient individuals have demonstrated a critical role for free extracellular ISG15 in the induction of IFN-&#x003b3; and protection against mycobacterial disease. These findings were confirmed in <italic>Isg15</italic>-deficient mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Intriguingly, there is no evident overlap in viral susceptibility phenotype between mice and humans lacking ISG15. Despite being serologically positive for numerous childhood viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein Barr virus, measles virus, varicella-zoster virus, HSV-1 and -2, mumps virus, IAV and hepatitis A virus, <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient individuals exhibit no overt susceptibility to viral disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. We recently demonstrated that human free intracellular ISG15 binds USP18, a negative regulator of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signalling. This binding prevents the SKP2-mediated degradation of USP18, and thus is critical for the accumulation of USP18 and the appropriate regulation of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signalling. Indeed, patients lacking ISG15, and consequently having low USP18 levels, display higher steady-state levels of ISG transcripts in whole blood than controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p><p>We demonstrate that human cells deficient in ISG15 exhibit a persistent elevation in ISG expression. We find that, not only do humans deficient in ISG15 lack any overt susceptibility to viral infection, but cells derived from these individuals exhibit an enhancement of broad protection against viruses. Complementation of ISG15-deficient cells with the wild-type (WT) or conjugation-deficient &#x00394;GG <italic>ISG15</italic> alleles rescues both WT levels of ISG expression and viral susceptibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is a species-specific interaction between ISG15 and USP18. While humans require ISG15 for USP18 stability and appropriate negative regulation of the IFN response, mice lack this stable interaction and can regulate the IFN response in the absence of Isg15.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Persistent increase of ISG expression in cells lacking ISG15</title><p>The <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient individuals identified to date have been infected with numerous childhood viruses, against which they mounted a humoral immune response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. No overt viral illnesses were documented in these patients, suggesting that ISG15 may not be essential for immunity to these viruses. <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient patients may actually have a milder disease course than wild-type individuals. However, this is difficult to demonstrate, as information about subclinical illness is often not transmitted by patients to their doctors or noted by the doctors themselves. We tested this hypothesis <italic>in vitro</italic> using hTert-immortalized dermal fibroblasts derived from <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient patients and relevant WT controls. Human cells lacking ISG15 also have low USP18 levels (due to the lack of USP18 stabilization by ISG15) and high levels of ISG transcripts, as documented <italic>ex vivo</italic> with leukocytes from <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. We carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, monitoring the kinetics and persistence of ISG induction by quantitative real-time PCR in WT and <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient fibroblasts during and after IFN priming, in which the cells were pulsed with IFN-&#x003b1;2b for 12&#x02009;h and then allowed to rest for 36&#x02009;h. We determined mRNA levels for the IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) and myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1), from 12&#x02009;h to 6 days post-IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; priming. The expression levels of <italic>IFIT1</italic> and <italic>MX1</italic> transcripts during peak induction and early dampening were similar between <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, the time taken for <italic>IFIT1</italic> transcript levels to return to baseline after IFN priming differed between control and <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient cells. Specifically, <italic>IFIT1</italic> transcript levels remained significantly elevated for more than 5 days in <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient cells, whereas they returned to basal levels within 2 days in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient IFN-primed cells are resistant to viral infection</title><p><italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient patients had previously been infected with HSV-1, HCMV and IAV, as indicated by the results of serological tests<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, but did not develop severe disease. We, therefore, investigated whether the prolonged increase in ISG levels affected the susceptibility of the patients' cells to viral challenge. When IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-primed <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient fibroblasts were infected with HSV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), HCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>) or IAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>) levels of viral replication were significantly lower in <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient cells than in control cells. SeV, a murine paramyxovirus known to be highly sensitive to human ISGs, also replicated significantly less efficiently in IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-primed <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Finally, we investigated whether <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient cells were also resistant to highly pathogenic viruses affecting humans that our patients would have been unlikely to encounter, by infecting control and <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient fibroblasts with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Nipah virus (NiV). Both of these viruses also appeared to replicate less efficiently in IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-primed <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient cells than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>), although neither RVFV nor NiV reached statistical significance. Thus, the prolonged induction of ISGs observed in <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient human cells protects against viruses from multiple families, having both RNA and DNA genomes, and causing both low and highly pathogenic disease in normal healthy humans. These results further suggest that viral infections in <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient individuals may follow an attenuated course with milder symptoms. Thus, the <italic>in vivo</italic> clinical follow-up of <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient individuals, serological testing and the results of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of patient-derived cells all indicate a greater resistance to viral challenge, consistent with a proviral role of ISG15 in humans.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>WT or &#x00394;GG <italic>ISG15</italic> allele restores WT viral susceptibility</title><p>We verified that the observed phenotype was due solely to the lack of ISG15 by stably transducing <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient patient and control fibroblasts with lentiviral particles encoding <italic>ISG15</italic> or control luciferase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The cells were subsequently infected with VSV, another virus known to be sensitive to low levels of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;. Control fibroblasts displayed similar levels of VSV replication with and without IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; priming, suggesting that most of the ISG antiviral activity had declined during the post-priming rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). By contrast, IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-primed cells deficient in ISG15 displayed significantly lower levels of viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), indicating a protracted antiviral state, as confirmed with other viral challenges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b-g</xref>). The resistance phenotype was confirmed using fibroblasts from the three <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient patients and five controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Similar phenotypic differences in viral replication were observed between control and <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient fibroblasts infected with VSV-expressing GFP (VSV&#x02013;GFP), as assessed by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). Complementation of <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient patient fibroblasts with WT ISG15, but not with control luciferase, restored both ISG expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>) and viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>) to the levels observed in the control cells. We have previously shown that the conjugation-deficient mutant of ISG15 (ISG15&#x00394;GG) retains the ability to bind and stabilize USP18, and is thus a functional negative regulator of IFN signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Accordingly, we used <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient fibroblasts transduced with ISG15&#x00394;GG, which exhibit fully functional downregulation of IFN signalling but no ISGylation, to determine the relative role of each function during viral infection. As observed with WT ISG15, complementation with ISG15&#x00394;GG rescued both the ISG expression and VSV replication phenotypes in <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Similar results were obtained in A549 and Hela cells that were silenced with siRNA targeting ISG15 or a non-silencing control. In both cell lines, knockdown of ISG15 enhanced ISG expression and resistance to viral replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a-f</xref>). These data demonstrate the dependence of the <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotype on the <italic>ISG15</italic> allele and suggest that, in human epithelial cells, the dominant role of ISG15 during viral replication is the ISGylation-independent downregulation of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signalling.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Isg15</italic>-deficient mice do not exhibit elevated ISG expression</title><p>All of our observations, whether from the clinical history of <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient patients or from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient patient-derived cells, point to a lack of overt susceptibility to viruses, and suggest that ISG15 may exhibit a proviral role. We were unable to reconcile these data with the numerous reports ascribing a critical antiviral role to Isg15 during the infection of mice <italic>in vivo</italic> with multiple viruses (for example, chikungunya virus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), IAV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, influenza B virus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, Sindbis virus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, vaccinia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, HSV-1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) and murine norovirus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). We, therefore, analysed whole blood from <italic>Isg15</italic>-deficient mice, to determine whether these mice, like <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient humans, also displayed elevated levels of steady-state ISG expression in the absence of diagnosable infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In unstimulated conditions, <italic>Ifit1</italic> mRNA levels of <italic>Isg15</italic>-deficient animals were similar to those of their age-matched WT cagemates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).

As expected, the animals receiving IFN injections displayed a robust increase in ISG expression within 8&#x02009;h that was fully resolved within 24&#x02009;h. However, no difference in ISG expression levels between <italic>Isg15</italic>-deficient and WT mice was observed at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b&#x02013;d</xref>).

Furthermore, co-expression of USP18 with an unrelated protein (GFP) did not sustain USP18 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The ISG15:USP18 complex could be detected by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, lane 2) and was abolished in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which alkylates cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, lane 3). Yet, the ISG15:USP18 complex retained NEM sensitivity even when we used the USP18-C64S catalytic mutant, suggesting a role for cysteine residues outside of the catalytic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested whether murine Isg15:Usp18 complexes could be detected by co-IP.

However, USP18 is the cognate deISGylase both in humans and mice. To further examine this interaction we used a micropatterning approach to quantify the stability of the ISG15:USP18 complex in living cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In this experimental setup, the murine Usp18:Isg15 complex was observed, but it exhibited reduced stability when compared to the human complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 3 and 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).

Next, we tested whether transient co-expression of murine Isg15 and Usp18 influenced the levels of murine Usp18. Murine Isg15 failed to sustain the level of murine Usp18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f&#x02013;h</xref>), in contrast to the phenotype observed with the human orthologues. The inability of overexpressed murine Isg15 to sustain murine Usp18 is consistent with our functional data on the endogenous murine proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) and with the comparable downregulation of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; responses in WT and <italic>Isg15</italic>-deficient mice <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;d</xref>).

However, we have shown that these regulators are not sufficient, and that ISG15 is required for complete downregulation of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Humans lacking ISG15 consistently display high steady-state levels of ISGs in whole blood, and in patient-derived fibroblasts following priming with IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). We hypothesized that this dysregulation of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signalling would account for the lack of an overt viral susceptibility in humans, in contrast to what was observed in mice. We show here that, unlike the antiviral activity of Isg15 observed in mice, human ISG15 promotes a proviral state following IFN priming. The persistent ISG expression observed in human <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient cells imparts a resistance to infection with multiple families of viruses with both RNA and DNA genomes.</p><p>These findings contrast from previous reports that have ascribed an antiviral role to ISG15 in human cells. Shi <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> reported that, following silencing of ISG15 for 48&#x02009;h in HEK-293 cells, SeV titres increased by &#x0223c;0.5 and &#x0223c;1.0&#x02009;log at 6&#x02009;h and 12&#x02009;h post infection, respectively. Tang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> found that following ISG15 silencing, A549 cells became &#x0223c;fivefold more susceptible to infection by IAV (A/PR/8/1934). While these studies point to an antiviral role of ISG15 in human cells, our experiments with SeV and IAV do not capture the small observed difference in viral growth when comparing WT and <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient hTert-immortalized fibroblasts without IFN priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). These studies focused on early timepoints of the acute IFN response induced by the virus, and did not capture the more powerful role of ISG15 as a negative regulator of IFN signalling. Even if there may be a small antiviral role for ISG15 during the acute IFN response, it is clinically irrelevant <italic>in vivo</italic> and not readily captured <italic>in vitro.</italic></p><p>Interestingly, we observed that the conjugation-deficient ISG15&#x00394;GG was as efficient as WT ISG15 in rescuing viral replication in <italic>ISG15</italic>-deficient patient cells. One could have predicted an even better rescue of both the ISG expression and infection phenotypes by ISG15&#x00394;GG, since the latter should be more readily accessible to mediate USP18 stability than the conjugation-competent form of ISG15. However, this was not the case, suggesting the possibility that ISG15&#x00394;GG may have lower USP18-binding affinity or that only a small amount of ISG15 is required to stabilize USP18, and the increased availability of ISG15&#x00394;GG has no further effect. An additional possibility, albeit less likely given the depth of work demonstrating the antiviral role of ISGylation, is that ISG15 in the conjugated form may also exhibit some proviral properties.</p><p>We have shown that free ISG15 associates with higher affinity to USP18 in humans as compared with mice, although the species-specific structural determinants involved in complex formation have yet to be identified. Another species-restricted complex involving free ISG15 has been described. The NS1 protein of influenza B virus binds non-covalently to human and non-human primate ISG15, but not to murine Isg15 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Mutational and structural studies of the NS1:ISG15 complex have shown that the molecular determinant of the binding specificity (humans versus mice) lies in the small hinge region of ISG15 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Further work is required to identify the domain(s) responsible for the human ISG15:USP18 interactions that are required to enhance stability and properly regulate the IFN responses.</p><p>Unlike humans, mice can downregulate IFN signalling regardless of ISG15 competency and it is currently unknown whether murine Usp18 is stabilized by another protein, IFN-stimulated or otherwise. Individuals lacking ISG15 exhibit elevated ISG expression, which may confer an enhanced protection against viral infection, but do not exhibit any of the side-effects associated with IFN treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. As such, the USP18:ISG15 interaction is a potentially attractive target for small molecule-based short-term treatments to boost endogenous IFN activity.</p><p>Our findings raise interesting questions about the evolutionary role of ISG15. Given the detrimental effects that inflammation may cause in species with a longer lifespan, gain-of-function binding mutations in ISG15 and/or USP18 may reflect an evolutionary necessity in humans, and likely other mammals, to more stringent tuning of the IFN system. On the other hand, viruses have developed immune evasion strategies in parallel. Indeed, many human viral pathogens were shown to oppose ISGylation (influenza B virus NS1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and vaccinia virus E3L<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> proteins) or induce de-ISGylation (numerous viral L proteins containing ovarian tumour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> or papain-like protease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Much of the work characterizing these viral proteins has focused on the inhibition/removal of conjugated ISG15 from viral and host targets. However, in light of our data demonstrating that the primary role of human ISG15 is to stabilize USP18 and downregulate the IFN response, it may be that inhibition of ISGylation and removal of conjugated ISG15 is a novel mode of IFN antagonism. By enhancing the pool of free ISG15, these viral proteins may enhance USP18 levels, dampen IFN signalling and promote viral escape.</p><p>Based on current knowledge, murine Isg15 acts in an antiviral manner (largely <italic>via</italic> ISGylation), while murine Usp18 functions in a proviral manner (IFN negative regulation and de-ISGylation). By contrast, human ISG15 and USP18 both appear to function in an anti-inflammatory manner. Consequently, this makes them proviral, although the ISGylation of cellular or viral proteins may play a non-dominant antiviral role. However, if both ISGylation and de-ISGylation are proviral (through provision of the free ISG15 required for USP18 stabilization), this notion becomes somewhat paradoxical. In humans then, this process may serve as a mechanism for the temporal regulation of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-induced signalling. We suggest that one of the roles of ISGylation at early stages of viral infection in humans is to sequester free ISG15, thereby allowing IFN signalling to occur. At later stages, USP18-mediated de-ISGylation releases free ISG15, which in turn stabilizes USP18 and tunes down IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signalling and inflammation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cells</title><p>Icahn School of Medicine IRB board has approved the use of human subject cell lines.
