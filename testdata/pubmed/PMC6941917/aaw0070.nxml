As an altruistic trait, parental care is beneficial to the survival and development of offspring but is costly for the parents, while selfish parents favor their lifetime fecundity at the expense of their offspring&#x02019;s fitness (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Offspring are often tacitly regarded as passive recipients of parental care, but in reality, they actively demand care and influence their parents&#x02019; behavior and reproduction (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Evolutionary theory predicts a tension between selfishness and altruism and genetic conflict between parents and offspring over parental investment due to their incomplete relatedness (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Theoretical models predicted that natural selection should favor resolved conflict and coadapted parent and offspring (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), a state characterized by (i) a compromise between the evolutionary interests of parent and offspring, (ii) balanced altruistic and selfish genetic tendencies, and (iii) well-coordinated behavioral interactions between them (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). To date, studies on conflict resolution and coadaptation have focused on phenotypes rather than genes (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), and studies on the molecular basis of parenting focused on genes expressed merely in parents and lacked causal evidence (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>).</p><p>To identify genes underlying parent-offspring coadaptation and to study their altruistic and selfish function during social interaction, a combination of these former approaches is required. In addition, offspring should be regarded as active players. Genes expressed in offspring and affecting parental care, for example, through effects on solicitation behaviors, should be studied.</p><p>In this study, we used the European earwig, <italic>Forficula auricularia</italic>, as an experimental system. <italic>F. auricularia</italic> is a nonmodel insect species with facultative posthatching maternal care, enabling behavioral manipulations with and without mother-offspring contact, without detrimental effects on offspring. Females produce one or two clutches over their lifetime and provide food (see movie S1) and protection to their young nymphs (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Mothers influence the behavior, development, and survival of their nymphs, and the nymphs, in turn, influence the behavior and future reproduction of their mothers, for instance, by chemical communication (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>).</p><p>Our experimental approach was to first broadly quantify differential gene expression between manipulated treatments with or without parental care in both mother and offspring in an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We then identified candidate genes on the basis of these data and characterized their social function in an RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown experiment. As a criterion for selecting candidate genes, we used the differential coexpression of the same gene between experimental treatments in earwig mothers and nymphs in the RNA-seq data. Although coadaptation may occur between different sets of genes expressed in parents or offspring, it is of limited scope in the absence of physical linkage (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>). The same genes affecting different traits in parents and offspring, a form of pleiotropy, provide scope for much tighter coadaptation (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>). Mechanistically, this differential coexpression could be due to specific alleles in the cis-regulatory region of the pleiotropic gene reflecting a state of coadaptation.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design and expression heat map.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The transcriptomic screen for candidate genes underlying parent-offspring coadaptation was based on experimental manipulation of the presence and absence of egg attendance and posthatching parental care: No care (NC), eggs were removed upon the completion of oviposition. No nymph sample was used because of insufficient hatching success of untended eggs (fig. S1 and table S1). Egg care (EC), mothers tended their eggs for 20 days and were then sampled shortly before eggs hatched (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Nymphs were kept for 6 days without tending females before they were sampled. Full care (FC), mothers tended their eggs until hatching and cared for their nymphs until 6 days after hatching when both were sampled. Antennae, head, abdomen, and ovaries from mothers and the whole body of nymphs were sampled in each treatment. On the basis of this screen, the expression of candidate genes was manipulated using in vivo RNAi to assess their causal effects on behavior and components of evolutionary fitness.

FC samples are in yellow; EC samples are in light green, and NC samples are in dark green.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aaw0070-F1"/></fig><p>We hypothesized that candidate genes underlying coadaptation should have the following signatures: (i) Gene expression changes in the parent or offspring when they behaviorally interact, with the strongest candidates showing differential coexpression of the same gene, irrespective of the direction of expression difference being parallel or antagonistic. (ii) For these candidate genes to be biologically relevant, an experimentally manipulated change in the expression level in the parent or offspring should influence behavior or fitness of self and the other via direct and indirect genetic effects (DGE and IGE), respectively (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>). (iii) When expressed, a gene with a selfish function should be beneficial to self and potentially harmful to the other, and a gene with an altruistic function, when expressed, should be beneficial to the other and costly to self. Here, we found two genes fulfilling these criteria in <italic>F. auricularia</italic>, and we discuss their potential roles in the evolution of parent-offspring interaction and social evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Transcriptomic screen for candidate genes underlying coadaptation via RNA-seq</title><p>To screen for candidate genes, we experimentally manipulated whether mothers attended their eggs and whether they cared for and socially interacted with their hatched nymphs. To this end, we established three treatments, no care (NC), egg care (EC), and full care (FC) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The FC treatment differed from the EC treatment in the occurrence of social interaction between mothers and nymphs, and the EC and NC treatments differed in egg attendance. Ninety females with their clutches were randomly assigned to the three treatments, with 30 per treatment. To detect tissue-specific expression, we separately sequenced the transcriptome of four maternal tissues including antennae, head, abdomen, and ovaries and the whole body of nymphs with RNA-seq. All nymphs were sampled on day 6 after hatching to avoid confounding variation caused by age or developmental stage.</p><p>A total of 138 gigabytes of Illumina HiSeq data were generated from 84 libraries and mapped to a previously published earwig transcriptome (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). Each maternal library was a pool of the same tissue from five individuals. Each nymph library was a pool of five clutches with three individuals each. NC nymphs were not used because of low hatching success (fig. S1 and table S1).</p><p>A total of 1547 genes in at least one maternal tissue and 114 genes in nymphs were differentially expressed between the FC and EC treatments (<italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub> &#x0003c; 0.01) (data files S1 to S5). All of the FC samples were well clustered on the basis of the expression of these genes. Samples from NC and EC treatments were more similar to each other (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C to G</xref>). This pattern was true for all maternal tissues and nymphs, indicating consistently and broadly altered gene expression when mothers and their offspring behaviorally interacted.</p><sec disp-level="3"><title>Identification of candidate genes</title><p>As pointed out above, the most stringent condition for candidate genes underlying coadaptation in our transcriptomic data is the differential coexpression between FC and EC in mothers and nymphs during posthatching maternal care. The NC treatment was not used for candidate gene selection because its difference to the FC treatment could result from both posthatching maternal care and egg attendance, and no offspring data were available. Coadaptation theory predicts stronger coadaptation when the same genes alter their expression in parent and offspring during their social interaction, which may facilitate well-coordinated parenting by enhancing the phenotypic match between parent and offspring (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>).</p><p>At the significance level corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) &#x0003c; 0.01, we found no insect gene with differential coexpression between the FC and EC treatment in mothers and offspring. This was partly due to the fact that the transcriptome of nymphs was based on whole bodies, obscuring any potential tissue-specific expression. Thus, our measure of differential expression in nymphs was less precise, and our statistical power for their detection was lower. To expand the number of detected genes, we relaxed the significance threshold for nymphs to be less stringent with <italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub> &#x0003c; 0.1. We found 13 genes differentially expressed between FC and EC treatments in mothers with <italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub> &#x0003c; 0.01 and in offspring with <italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub> &#x0003c; 0.1. We then used five insect genomes to filter out genes with insect origin. These genomes were previously used to annotate a published earwig transcriptome (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). They comprise two eusocial species, the honey bee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) and the leaf-cutting ants (<italic>Acromyrmex echinatior</italic>), and three solitary species, the fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), the red flour beetle (<italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>), and the jewel wasp (<italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic>). Only two of the differentially coexpressed genes were present in at least one of the five insect genomes. We further checked the 11 remaining genes manually. Two had unknown origin and function, and nine were not from insects. Thus, the two genes, with confirmed insect origin and evidence of differential expression between the FC and EC treatment in both mothers and offspring during posthatching parental care, were selected as our candidates (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). One of them, Contig4258 in the published earwig transcriptome (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>), is homologous to the <italic>D. melanogaster Th</italic> gene. The other, Contig29301, is homologous to the <italic>PebIII</italic> gene. <italic>Th</italic> encodes tyrosine hydroxylase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the dopamine synthesis pathway (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). <italic>PebIII</italic> encodes ejaculatory bulb protein III, an odorant-binding protein (OBP) (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Th and other genes related to dopamine</title><p>Compared with the EC treatment, <italic>Th</italic> expression was higher in the FC mother&#x02019;s head (<italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub> &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and in her nymphs (<italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.056; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). In addition, we found higher expression of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) decarboxylase [AADC (aromatic <sc>l</sc>-amino acid decarboxylase); Contig5494; <italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.00018; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>], the downstream enzyme of tyrosine hydroxylase that catalyzes the last step of dopamine synthesis (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>), in the FC mothers&#x02019; head. Together, these results suggested enhanced dopamine activity in the head, where the central nervous system is located. Furthermore, <italic>Th</italic> showed a trend of reduced expression in the ovaries of FC mothers compared to EC mothers (<italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub> = 0.053; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). This was in agreement with an elevated expression of dopamine <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase (DNAT; Contig14038; <italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub> &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref>), an enzyme for dopamine degradation (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>), in the ovaries of FC mothers compared to EC mothers. These results suggested decreased activity of dopamine in the ovaries during posthatching care. Dopamine is a well-studied neurohormone with a conserved function as neurotransmitter in the reward system and for associative learning from insects to mammals (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Dopamine also functions as gonadotropin to stimulate reproduction in various insect species including fruit flies, bees, and ants (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). Thus, the fact that earwig mothers suppress their reproduction during parenting (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>) may be partly regulated by the antagonistic expression of <italic>Th</italic> and dopamine in the head and ovaries. Conversely, the enhanced expression of <italic>Th</italic> in the mother&#x02019;s heads and in her nymphs during posthatching care suggested a role of a mutual dopaminergic reward in maintaining the social bond between them.</p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Differential expression of <italic>Th</italic> and other dopamine-related genes in maternal tissues and in offspring.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of a known dopamine synthesis and degradation pathway catalyzed by tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) as the rate-limiting enzyme as well as DOPA decarboxylase (AADC) and DNAT (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>).

Neither <italic>Th</italic> nor <italic>PebIII</italic> was altruistic or selfish in a classical sense because both genes had a comparable function when expressed in mothers and offspring. These reciprocally altruistic and reciprocally selfish gene functions are peculiar because the gene&#x02019;s fitness loss or gain during one life stage may at least partly be offset by its gain or loss during the other life stage. We envision that differential coexpression and reciprocally altruistic or selfish function are signatures of genes underlying parent-offspring coadaptation and may reflect a mechanism of co-regulation potentially through allelic variation in their cis-regulatory region. We predict that genes with differential coexpression and reciprocally altruistic or selfish function may be typical among genes underlying the social bond between parents and offspring and possibly also among caregivers and care recipients in other social systems.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNA-seq experiment</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Experimental design and behavioral manipulation</title><p>The earwigs were maintained in the laboratory as previously described (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>).

Each maternal sample was a pool of the same tissue from five individuals to obtain sufficient RNA quantities. For nymphs, RNA was extracted from the whole body without dissection. Each nymph sample was a pool of five clutches with three nymphs per clutch to obtain sufficient RNA quantities. All samples were stored in RNAlater (QIAGEN) at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>A total of 84 samples were processed for RNA-seq, including six replicates of four female tissues across three treatments and nymph samples from two treatments: 6 &#x000d7; (4 &#x000d7; 3 + 2) = 84. NC nymphs were not used for sequencing because the hatching success of eggs without maternal care was too low (fig. S1 and table S1).</p><p>The RNA of each sample was extracted using the TRIzol protocol (Invitrogen), resulting in six replicates per tissue per treatment. The cDNA library was prepared and sequenced with paired-end 100-nucleotide reads on Illumina HiSeq. Each sample was indexed using an Illumina TruSeq kit. Samples from different treatments and tissues were evenly distributed among four multiplex lanes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Bioinformatic and statistical analysis</title><p>An average of 18 million RNA-seq reads per sample was generated. The reads of each sample were mapped to a previously published earwig transcriptome (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>) using the BWA-MEM algorithm in BWA version 0.7.8-r455 (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr"><italic>52</italic></xref>). SAMtools version 0.1.18 (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr"><italic>53</italic></xref>) was used to process sam files to bam format and to count mapped reads for each contig. Mapped reads with a mapping quality higher than MQ40 were processed for further analysis.</p><p>The initial statistical analysis of gene expression differences between experimental treatments was carried out using the edgeR package (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr"><italic>54</italic></xref>) in R. The RNA-seq data were TMM-normalized. Pairwise comparisons of each gene between the FC and EC treatment were performed for each female tissue and the nymph samples using exact negative binomial tests. To take into account multiple testing, we used an FDR correction as implemented in edgeR. Corresponding <italic>P</italic> values are denoted as <italic>P</italic><sub>FDR</sub>.</p><p>Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis were performed for differentially expressed genes with Blast2GO version 2.7.2 (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr"><italic>55</italic></xref>). A cutoff value was set at &#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> for the BLASTX search against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant nucleotide database and the SWISS-PROT database using the NCBI BLAST service.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNAi experiment</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>To test the effects of expression of the two candidate genes on females and nymphs, we carried out an RNAi experiment. To date, this is the first documented RNAi experiment performed on this nonmodel insect species. <italic>Th</italic> or <italic>PebIII</italic> was knocked down in separate treatments: knockdown in mothers (M&#x02212;/O+), nymphs (M+/O&#x02212;), and both (M&#x02212;/O&#x02212;). Three corresponding <italic>YFP</italic> treatments were used to control for the injection of exogenous double-stranded RNA. A total of 70 randomly mated female earwigs and their 1363 nymphs were randomly assigned to the experimental groups for behavioral and fitness assay. Clutch size was standardized to 20 nymphs in each family 1 day after hatching, except clutches that had less than 20 hatched nymphs. The sample size of each measured behavior and fitness trait was shown in table S5.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Synthesis of double-stranded RNA</title><p>The amplified sequences of each gene with a T7 promoter overhang at 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;, respectively, were cloned from earwig cDNA to plasmids for storage and large-scale yields (table S3). Cloning was confirmed by sequencing the PCR product of each target gene from the plasmids. Double-stranded RNA was synthesized using RiboMAX large-scale RNA synthesis system T7 (Promega). The final concentration of double-stranded RNA used for injection was 6 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l for each gene. The mothers were injected with 2 &#x003bc;l, and 20 nymphs from each family were injected with a total of 2 &#x003bc;l of double-stranded RNA on day 4 after the nymphs hatched. For RNAi injection, we used a CellTram air microinjector (Eppendorf) and borosilicate capillaries (Harvard) processed with a P-1000 Micropipette Puller (Sutter Instruments). Before injection, the earwigs were exposed to low concentrations of petroleum ether (Sigma-Aldrich, #77379) vapor for sedation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Validation of knockdown</title><p>The double-stranded RNA was injected in the abdomen of mothers and offspring on day 4 after the nymphs hatched. The knockdown effects were initially validated with RT-qPCR after injection using three technical replicates per gene per sample. Each maternal sample was the head of a female. Each nymph sample was a pool of the whole body of three nymphs from the same clutch. Maternal samples included three <italic>Th-</italic>injected mothers, four <italic>PebIII-</italic>injected mothers, and two <italic>YFP-</italic>injected mothers. Offspring samples include three <italic>Th-</italic>injected nymphs, three <italic>PebIII-</italic>injected nymphs, and four <italic>YFP-</italic>injected nymphs. Both maternal and nymph samples were collected 3 days after injection. RNA was extracted using the TRIzol-LS reagent (Ambion). The cDNA libraries were synthesized using the GoScript Reverse Transcriptase system (Promega). The qPCR was run in triplicates on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast platform using an EvaGreen 2X qPCR Master Mix reagent (Biotium). Expression levels were calculated using &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct. The calibration was done separately for mothers and offspring. Results are shown in fig. S2.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Behavior and fitness assays</title><p>The developmental and reproductive variables were quantified following the standard protocol used in a previous study in this species (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). The rate of offspring development was quantified as the number of days from hatching until the first nymph of a family reached the second juvenile instar and nymph survival as the proportion of surviving nymphs 3 days after injection divided by the number of nymphs hatched.</p><p>Food provisioning was recorded during observation sessions under red light (earwigs are nocturnal) of 1 hour each across three consecutive days after injection, which was on days 5, 6, and 7 after the nymphs hatched. Observations were started 15 min after setup to calm down the animals. The occurrence of mouth-to-mouth contact between the female and one of her nymphs was treated as a binomial trait (yes/no). The observer was blind to experimental treatments. For quantitative traits, the average values across the three consecutive observation sessions were used in the analysis. For binary traits, at least one event across the three sessions counted as &#x0201c;yes.&#x0201d; The future reproduction of females was assessed by (i) noting whether a second clutch was produced within 60 days of hatching of the first clutch and by (ii) counting the relative size of second clutches as the proportion of eggs in the second clutch over the sum of eggs in the first and second clutch.</p><p>The survival of 70 mothers and their 1363 offspring was quantified 3 days after injection (table S6). It was difficult to tell whether they died immediately after injection because both mothers and nymphs were sedated before injection. Seven females died during the 3 days and had to be excluded from the analysis because no behavior or future reproduction was measurable. Nymphs from all 70 families were used for the quantification of survival because the mortality due to injection of double-stranded RNA was captured in our <italic>YFP</italic> sham treatments to which target gene treatments were compared.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Statistical analysis for behavior and fitness assay</title><p>The effects of the RNAi treatments on measured traits were tested using GLMs (tables S1 and S2). In the GLMs, main effects consist of fixed factors [maternal treatment effect, offspring treatment effect, and gene effect (target gene versus <italic>YFP</italic>)] and covariate (&#x0201c;oviposition date&#x0201d;). Interactive effects comprise the maternal treatment&#x02013;by&#x02013;gene interaction and offspring treatment&#x02013;by&#x02013;gene interaction. We used a backward model simplification procedure, eliminating effects sequentially according to their <italic>P</italic> value when <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1, starting with the interaction terms and largest <italic>P</italic> values. When no interactive effect could be further removed, we continued with nonsignificant main effects, starting from the largest <italic>P</italic> value, provided that it was not part of an interactive effect still in the model. Continuous dependent variables were modeled using a Gaussian error distribution. Discrete or proportional dependent variables [food provisioning (yes/no), second clutch (yes/no), and relative size of second clutch and survival] were analyzed using a binomial error distribution and a logit link. Effects of the candidate gene are detectable as deviation from the <italic>YFP</italic> side effects as significant interactions between the factor gene and one of the treatment factors. Statistical analyses were carried out using R version 3.1.1; tests were two-tailed with a significance threshold of &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec></sec></sec>
