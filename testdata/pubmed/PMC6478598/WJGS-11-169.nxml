This multimodal program introduces a number of preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative measures aiming to minimize surgical stress responses and facilitate patient&#x02019;s recovery[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There have been several reports showing that improved adherence to the ERAS program is significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes after colorectal operations[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the effective implementation of ERAS requires close collaboration of multidisciplinary ERAS team comprising surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, nutritionists and physiotherapists. The initial stage of ERAS application into surgical practice could be a crucial phase of this patient-centered perioperative pathway because the workflow of heath care personals needs to be adopted and the guideline has to assimilate into a daily practice. A prospective study of early implementation of ERAS program in laparoscopic colorectal surgery has demonstrated that at least 30 patients and a period of 6 mo are required to achieve an ERAS compliance of 80% or more[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite increasing uptake of laparoscopic colorectal surgery worldwide, open surgery still remained the most common approach for colorectal resections[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. When comparing laparoscopy and open surgery within an ERAS program for colorectal surgery, the latter had a higher rate of complication and was more difficulty to implement an ERAS program[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There are several studies on the impact of ERAS compliance on surgical outcomes[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but little attention is drawn to the analysis of the early stage of ERAS implementation into colorectal operation especially in an open surgery - as a learning curve of a multidisciplinary ERAS team.</p><p>The primary objective of the study was to evaluate and establish the learning curve for the implementation of an ERAS program in &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; colorectal operations using defined criteria of optimal recovery (no major postoperative complication, <italic>i.e</italic>., Clavien-Dindo grade &#x02265; III, discharge by postoperative day 5, and no 30-d readmission)[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>A prospectively collected database has been maintained since the beginning of ERAS program in 2011 for elective colorectal surgery in our Colorectal Unit (Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University - the largest tertiary referral hospital in Thailand). All unselected patients undergoing open colectomy and/or proctectomy with this ERAS program from January 2011 to October 2017 were reviewed. Patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery were excluded because this study focused on the analysis of learning curve for ERAS program - not the that for laparoscopic surgery which may be influenced by surgeon&#x02019;s experience and operative complexity. Moreover, laparoscopy might be a key factor offering independent advantages beyond an ERAS program[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Patients undergoing non-resection surgery (<italic>e.g</italic>., loop colostomy and colonic bypass procedures) and those with clinical peritonitis or acute colonic obstruction were also excluded. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (Si 498/2017) and written informed consent was obtained from each patient.</p></sec><sec><title>The development and implementation of our ERAS protocol</title><p>The application of ERAS strategies into elective colorectal surgery in our unit was initiated by a board-certified colorectal surgeon (the author) who learnt the concept of this perioperative care pathway while studying a PhD degree in Gastrointestinal Surgery in the United Kingdom. In late 2010, a multidisciplinary ERAS team was formed by a colorectal surgeon, two anesthesiologists, a nutritionist, ostomy nurses, nursing staffs and surgical residents. At that time, our ERAS protocol for open colorectal operations had 17 core elements (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) which were adopted from the consensus review of ERAS society for elective colorectal surgery[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In early 2011, the protocol was routinely applied into a daily surgical practice with a regular audition. We set a targeted discharge by postoperative day 5 because in the literature review an ERAS protocol reduced the length of hospital stay by 2-3 d[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and hospital stay after open colorectal operations under a conventional pathway in our unit was about 7-8 d[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Patients would be discharged from the hospital if they met all criteria: no fever, satisfactory gastrointestinal recovery, adequate pain control with oral analgesics, and a good level of ambulation. All of the patients were scheduled for follow-up at 7-10 d and 30 d after an operation. Notably, all of the studied patients were operated on and treated by single surgeon (the author) and his multidisciplinary team. Since an ERAS program is a dynamic multimodal care pathway, some elements were added into the program later. These interventions were the administration of synthetic albumin in patients with persistent oliguria after the adequate infusion of crystalloid solution (from June 2015) and the routine postoperative administration of prokinetic agent (from April 2016).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Enhanced recovery after surgery protocol for open colorectal surgery</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody align="center"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Preadmission</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 Cessation of smoking and intake of alcohol; 2 Nutrition assessment and nutrition support as needed; 3 Medical optimization of chronic disease</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Preoperative</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 Structured preoperative counseling to patients and their relatives; 5 No mechanical bowel preparation; 6 Administration of appropriate prophylactic antibiotics; 7 Prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Intraoperative</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 Use of epidural anesthesia; 9 Use of atraumatic O-ring wound retractor/protector; 10 Avoid hypothermia; 11 Maintaining fluid balance and vasopressors to support blood pressure control; 12 No intraabdominal or pelvic drain</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Postoperative</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 Early intake of oral fluids and semi-solid foods (day of surgery); 14 Early ambulation (postoperative day 1); 15 Multimodal approach to opioid-sparing pain control; 16 Removal of urinary catheter by postoperative day 3; 17 Discontinuous intravenous fluid infusion by postoperative day 3</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Data including patient characteristics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were prospectively collected.

The introduction of ERAS in daily practice could be a learning-by-doing process relying on experiencing as a way for a multidisciplinary ERAS team to acquire skill and familiarize each ERAS element in order to get better surgical outcomes. The learning curve of ERAS implementation is somewhat different from that of a surgical intervention because an ERAS implementation requires both technical maneuvers and non-technical skills such as communication, collaboration and commitment from both patients and all members of multidisciplinary ERAS team.</p><p>The first step in determining the learning curve of ERAS program in colorectal surgery is the selection of an appropriate outcome measure. In this regard, we use a composite endpoint of three relevant clinical outcomes (no major postoperative complication, discharge by postoperative day 5, and no 30-d readmission) to determine an optimal recovery. These surgical outcomes have commonly been used as a proxy in the measurement of successful ERAS implementation in the literature[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Based on our prospectively collected database of colorectal surgery in a university hospital, this study demonstrated that a number of 76 colorectal operations are required for a multidisciplinary team to achieve a high rate of ERAS compliance and a high rate of optimal recovery following an open colorectal resection. It is worth noting that the 3<sup>rd</sup> quintile had the highest rate of 30-d readmission although it did not reach a statistical significance. There are several possible explanations on these findings such as the 3<sup>rd</sup> quintile had the highest percentage of patients with ASA classification &#x02265; 3. High ASA classification has been shown to be an independent predictor of readmission after major traumatic injury and general surgery[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>It would appear that the implementation of ERAS program in open colorectal surgery may have a longer learning curve (<italic>i.e</italic>., more patients and a longer period of time) to achieve an optimal recovery than that in laparoscopic surgery. Pedziwiatr et al[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed that at least 30 patients over a period of 6 mo were required before their multidisciplinary team can effectively integrate an ERAS protocol into laparoscopic colorectal surgery. In this European study, there was a significant increase in some ERAS elements implemented over the study period such as no drains, use of epidural analgesia, early feeding and early ambulation. In the Alberta Heath Services Canada, Gramlich et al[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported that the active phase of ERAS implementation took 9-12 mo and recommended to use data on a baseline cohort of 50 patients in pre- and post-implementation period to define compliance with ERAS program. A possible explanation for a longer learning curve of successful ERAS implementation in open colorectal surgery is the fact that open surgery is associated with a higher systemic stress response and more surgical trauma than laparoscopic surgery[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, patients undergoing open surgery could have a higher rate of postoperative complication and are more difficulty to follow an ERAS protocol[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], especially for postoperative compliance with an ERAS protocol[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although it may take more times to achieve a successful ERAS program in open colorectal surgery, a recent report from 15 academic hospitals in Canada has suggested that ERAS has more positive effect in patients undergoing open surgery than those with laparoscopic approach[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The introduction of the ERAS program required a closed collaboration and communication among surgical team members and other health care professionals as well as the continuous monitoring of its outcomes. Since not all elements could be introduced immediately, the ERAS compliance was lower than 70% in the early period of ERAS implementation in our institute. However, the rate of ERAS compliance significantly increased after our multidisciplinary ERAS team experienced the application of this program in 76 patients. A high ERAS compliance was then maintained thereafter at approximately 75%. Increasing ERAS compliance has been shown to be associated with a successful improved outcome including fewer complications, shorter hospital stay[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and better oncological outcomes[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Two large European studies have suggested a cut-off point at 70% compliance with ERAS protocol to be correlated with a significant improvement in short-term and long-term outcomes following colorectal surgery[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is arguable that full implementation of ERAS program may be not required to achieve better clinical outcomes.</p><p>Some components of our ERAS protocol encountered difficulties in their initial implementation, partly, due to the habit of conventional care and the lack of knowledge or instruments. Thanks to the cooperation of our multidisciplinary ERAS team and the support of hospital authorities, many components of our ERAS protocol increasingly implemented over the study period including preoperative detailed counseling, perioperative nutrition support, intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy, intraoperative use of atraumatic O-ring wound protector and postoperative scheduled mobilization. A recent multi-center observational study in Ontario suggested that postoperative ERAS interventions had the greatest impact on optimal recovery after colorectal surgery[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>This study has three major strengths. First, the data was extracted from a prospectively collected database of unselected patients undergoing open colectomy and/or proctectomy with an ERAS protocol. All patients were operated on and taken care of by the same surgeon and his multidisciplinary team thus resulting in minimizing bias. Second, to determine an optimal recovery, this study used a composite endpoint of three clinical outcomes (no major postoperative complication, discharge by postoperative day 5, and no 30-d readmission) which have commonly been used as a proxy in the measurement of successful ERAS implementation[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Third, this study provided detailed data on compliance with ERAS protocol and its individual elements.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the fact that it included only open colorectal operation. Whether the learning curve in this study is applicable to laparoscopic colorectal surgery or other intra-abdominal operations needs to be determined. Second, this study used only common clinical outcomes (<italic>i.e</italic>., major complication, hospital stay and readmission) as representatives for optimal recovery[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It did not assess any patient-reported outcomes such as time to return to normal activities and quality of life &#x02013; which could be other important outcome measures for optimal recovery in the future study. Last, we acknowledged that there are several methods to quantify learning curve such as a simple linear regression and various curve &#x0fb01;tting methods, a cumulative sum analysis and a chronological division of consecutive cases (data splitting method)[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] &#x02013; each has its pros and cons. We used the latter design because it was evident that data splitting method can be used to identify a change over time even in case of case-mix complexity[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As a result, it was the most common method used to measure the learning curve effect in health technology[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the cut-off point of consecutive cases is arbitrary and information derived from the underlying learning curve may be limited.</p><p>This study showed that a number of 76 colorectal operations are required for a multidisciplinary team to achieve a significantly higher rate of optimal recovery and compliance with an ERAS protocol for open colorectal operation. These findings could call surgical communities to find the best ways to shorten the learning curve of ERAS program &#x02013; especially in open laparotomy. It may include a structured program of education, training, cooperation and experience sharing between surgeons and non-surgical health care personals as an integrated ERAS team, or between a well-established ERAS center and a newly-implied ERAS hospital. The regular audition of relevant outcomes and closed collaboration between many different stakeholders, including patients and their family, are also required to achieve the best care and optimal recovery of surgical patients.</p></sec><sec><title>ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS</title><sec><title>Research background</title><p>Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) reduces hospitalization and complication following colorectal surgery.
