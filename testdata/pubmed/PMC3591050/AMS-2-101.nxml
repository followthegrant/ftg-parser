This journal, though in infancy, has received the attention of many of our learned peers in the International circle. The number of research articles submitted to the journal vouchsafe for this fact. I am thankful to all authors, reviewers, and readers, who have allocated their precious resources and time for <italic>Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery</italic>. Till writing this editorial, AMS has received as much as 61% of its last year's submission and we expect many more to follow. We are witnessing numerous research articles being submitted to AMS. In 2012 we had about 9352 visitors and 20,906 page views indicating huge access to the AMS website globally. About 40% of all downloads are from other countries, which indicates AMS&#x02019; huge global reach.</p><p><italic>Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery</italic> was conceived and born when India was witnessing a dental publication boom. Today, Indian dental fraternity publishes a lot. But what next? Logically the next step would be to increase the quality of the published content. The pursuit of selection criterion for quality of manuscript is too cumbersome with several factors.</p><p>The best bibliographic measure that is employed currently is the H-Index. This index is widely being followed by researchers and universities across the world to measure the impact of the scholarly works. The H-index is computed by accounting the number of manuscripts published as well as the number of times the work is cited in literature. The next step for the <italic>Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery</italic> would be to increase the H-index. For achieving so, from the editorial end, I ensure maximum international participation.</p><p>The Invited Review column introduced from this issue on is an attempt to bring in pioneers to write state-of-the-art reviews on the subject. Certainly, in future, this section will be widely cited in literature. The journal follows an open access policy, meaning the content is accessible and widely read. I expect that the authors would perform contemporary research so that their work will be cited and in the process AMS will be recognized. It is my duty to remind the authors that systematic review, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and original research are the highest form of evidences. Such works get often cited than case reports or series.</p><p>I thank Prof. Kurt Butow for his guest editorial in this issue and special thanks to Prof. Tony Pogrell for his excellent manuscript on craniofacial fibro-osseous lesions, as the AMS&#x02032; new initiative &#x02013; Invited Review.</p><p>I am happy to share with you that PubMed cataloguing process has begun and, by September 2012, AMS would submit itself for content evaluation. With active support of Wolters-Kluwer- Medknow, AMS iPad version is to be launched shortly. This would be first of its kind in the Asian Subcontinent. AMS has been added to Ovid&#x000ae; shortly, which would add immense value to our global reach, citation, and brand value creation. Exactly in a year, AMS plans to be subjected to Scopus Indexing. I am sure, with active support of all readers, reviewers, and publishers, AMS will achieve these goals.</p><p>I would be back with more interesting articles and happy news in the next issue.</p><p>With best regards</p></body></article>
