It is unknown whether this association is modified by dog characteristics such as sex, breed, number of dogs, and dog size. The aim of this study was to determine whether different dog characteristics modify the risk of asthma among children exposed to dogs during their first year of life. In the main analysis, we used national register data for all children born in Sweden from Jan 1st 2001 to Dec 31st 2004 with a registered dog in the household during their first year of life (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;23,585). We used logistic regression models to study the association between dog characteristics and the risk of asthma or allergy diagnosis and medication at age six. The prevalence of asthma at age six was 5.4%. Children exposed to female dogs had lower risk of asthma compared to those exposed to male dogs, odds ratio, OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.84 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.74 to 0.95). Children with two dogs or more had lower risk of asthma than those with one dog only, OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.79 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.95). Children whose parents had asthma and allergy had a higher frequency of exposure to dog breeds anecdotally described as &#x0201c;hypoallergenic&#x0201d; compared to those parents without asthma or allergy (11.7% vs 7.6%, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Exposure to these breeds were associated with higher risk of allergy OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.27 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.59) but not asthma. In conclusion, we found evidence of an association between the sex of dog and the number of dogs with a lower risk of childhood asthma in dog-exposed children.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Childhood asthma is a global public health concern. About 54% of affected patients are sensitized to mammalian allergens at age 19, compared to about 21% of non-asthmatic individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and many affected children suffer from asthma exacerbation after pet exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, increasing evidence shows that exposure to dogs during early childhood is associated with lower risk of asthma, for example, a 13% risk reduction in our recent study including 276,298 children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The reason for this inverse relationship is not clear, and several factors may come into play. Children in dog households are more exposed to microbial materials such as endotoxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, which could modulate the immune system and respiratory epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. They may also have a beneficial life-style such as spending more time outdoors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. There is also a risk of avoidance bias, where families with high predisposition to allergy do not acquire a furred pet to the same extent as those without<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, but are meanwhile exposed to pet allergen indirectly which may induce sensitization and symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The role of early exposure to antigens in the home environment for tolerance development is not clear.</p><p id="Par3">However, life-style or dog management varies also among dog-owning families. House dust levels of a major dog allergen, Can f 1, has been shown to vary with the time the dog is kept indoors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Sex of the dog and breed may also affect shedding of allergens and endotoxins. A recently reported major dog allergen, Can f 5, is excreted from prostate tissue into urine of male dogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and its expression is reduced in neutered males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In Sweden, only about 4&#x02013;7% of dogs were neutered in 1999<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, a rate that had increased to 22% in 2012<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, some dog breeds with a non-shedding coat are anecdotally described as being &#x0201c;hypoallergenic&#x0201d; and some of these are also enlisted by the American Kennel Club Association (AKC) as suitable for people with allergies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. There is however little scientific evidence that such breeds have lower allergen levels and two studies failed to show any difference among dog breed groups in allergen shedding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Further, neither number of dogs nor the weight of the dog was associated with the amount of Can f 1 allergen in the household<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, but these factors may affect other potentially protecting parameters. A previous prospective birth cohort showed that children exposed to two or more dogs or cats were less likely to have allergic sensitization at 6 to 7 years of age, while having only one pet was not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The impact of dog characteristics on future asthma in children exposed to dogs in early life is not previously reported. Here, we use national registers of dog ownership combined with child and parental health data to assess whether dog characteristics such as sex, breed, number of dogs or size of the dog modifies the future risk of asthma among children exposed to dogs during their first year of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population and study design</title><p id="Par5">We identified two cohorts of Swedish children by linking data from Register of the Total Population to the Medical Birth Register via individual personal identification numbers. The cohort used in the main analysis was born from January 1 2001 to December 31 2004 and was assessed for any asthma event at age six (during their 7th year of life). A second younger cohort used for sensitivity analysis was born from July 1 2005 to December 31 2010 and was followed from age 1 until first asthma diagnosis, death, emigration or December 31 2011, whichever occurred first.</p><p id="Par6">Dog ownership was defined by linking parental personal identity numbers with the Swedish Board of Agriculture National Dog Register and the Swedish Kennel Club&#x02019;s Register.

The information about dogs&#x02019; dates of death was incomplete and we therefore used a maximum age of 10 years for dogs with missing death date. If the same dog appeared in both registers we used the earliest registration date as date of owner registration and in case of contradicting information we used the Swedish Kennel Club&#x02019;s data. The registers do not contain information on castration status of the dog so only male/female categories were assessed. Breeds were categorized according to the F&#x000e9;d&#x000e9;ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI).

The register of dogs from the National Board of Agriculture had increasing number of newly registered dogs during the study period, while the Swedish Kennel Club had comparable number of new registrations each year.

Further, we found that children with two or more dogs in the home had less asthma than those with one dog only. Having a breed regarded as &#x0201c;hypoallergenic&#x0201d; was more common in families with parental allergy and was associated with allergy, but not asthma, in children at age six. These findings are novel and have not been previously reported.</p><p id="Par26">Childhood asthma is a heterogeneous disorder. In school age, the condition is associated with sensitization to airborne allergens in the majority of cases, such as to allergens from furred animals. It is debated if early exposure to antigens affects the risk later respiratory disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In our study, we found that children exposed to female dogs had about 16% lower risk of asthma. This is unlikely to be a result of a selection bias, supported by the fact that similar proportion of female dogs were reported among households with and without parental asthma and allergy phenotypes. We speculate that the differences in allergen excretion from intact male dogs to other dogs may come into play. The recently reported major dog allergen, Can f 5 (analogous to the human PSA), is excreted from prostate tissue into urine of male dogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In Sweden, relatively few dogs are castrated and it is not possible to generalize our results to children exposed to male dogs in countries where castration rates differ. To avoid overlap with our previous study in this data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, we focused on the group of children that all had dogs. However, we compared the risk of asthma in children exposed to male dogs to that of children not exposed to any dogs and found similar risks of asthma (OR 0.94, 0.87, 1.02), indicating that ownership of a male dog is not associated with increased risk of asthma compared to children without dogs.</p><p id="Par27">We found that children exposed to two dogs or more in the first year of life had approximately 21% lower risk of asthma than those with only one dog. In a previous study, we showed that dog exposure is associated with a 13% lower risk of asthma in the general child population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, which could be explained by differences in exposure to microbial material, or differences in lifestyle such as a more active outdoor lifestyle. These factors could be pronounced in a multiple-dog household. However, having two dogs or more could also be indicative of a family without any previous problems with allergic or asthmatic disease. We did not see any association of size of the dog with risk of asthma, although the point estimates were lower for each increasing size.</p><p id="Par28">To assess whether the breed affects the risk of asthma in the child, we performed two sets of analyses. The first compared different groups of breeds to the most common breed group, &#x0201c;Retrievers - Flushing Dogs - Water Dogs&#x0201d;. We found that the risk of prevalent asthma was about 29% higher in children exposed to &#x0201c;Companion and Toy Dogs&#x0201d; and about 20% lower in those exposed to &#x0201c;Sheepdogs and Cattledogs&#x0201d;. Although we adjusted for population density in the area of residence, there might be residual confounding explaining this association. Farmers often keep &#x0201c;Sheepdogs and Cattledogs&#x0201d;, and farm children are known to have a strongly reduced risk of asthma. Further, &#x0201c;Companion and Toy Dogs&#x0201d; are common in cities, where asthma is also more prevalent. It is also likely that farm dogs in general spend more time outdoors than a small companion dog, which may influence the amount of endotoxins and other microbial products in the household, further influencing influence the risk of asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">We categorized dogs with two previously proposed definitions for &#x0201c;hypoallergenic&#x0201d; breeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, one based on a web search, encompassing 45 breeds, and the other one based on 23 breeds enlisted by the AKC. We found that these types of breeds were more common in families where at least one parent fulfilled the criteria for allergy, with or without asthma, indicating that some families take into account these recommendations when choosing a dog. We did not see a clear association of exposure to &#x0201c;hypoallergenic&#x0201d; dogs with risk of asthma, but with an increased risk of allergy. Previous studies have not shown differences among dog breed groups in allergen shedding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and we speculate that the association is confounded by parental allergy to furry animals, which increases the risk of allergy in their children and thus the likelihood of acquiring a &#x0201c;hypoallergenic&#x0201d; dog<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We were only able to adjust for parental allergy medication, but not the type of allergy, which could explain the remaining association after accounting for parental allergy.</p><p id="Par30">The results from the younger cohort did not reveal association of any of the dog characteristics with incident asthma in preschool age. This discrepancy could be due to differences in the asthma phenotype, where wheezing in preschool children is more often transient or related to viral infections. It could also be explained be differences in dog registration patterns and the level of castration over time. Moreover, some of the identified associations was attenuated in the subgroup analysis of first-borns, although with overlapping confidence intervals to the main analysis. Whether this was caused by reduced power or by biological differences is not possible to say.</p><p id="Par31">The strengths of the study include the prospective design, the nation-wide coverage of the registers and the validated outcome measurement. However, some limitations of the study should be noted. Firstly, conclusions about causal directions is difficult to do as the choice of dog breed, sex and number of dogs is not random, and can sometimes be affected by disease history in the owner&#x02019;s family. Therefore, overemphasis of our results should be avoided when giving recommendations to families about dog ownership. However, as a clinical trial on these research questions is difficult or impossible to implement in the society, evidence from cohort studies such as this one may be the highest level of evidence that we will have. Secondly, children with family history of asthma and allergic disease who avoid direct dog exposure may still be exposed to ubiquitous pet allergens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This may result in increased risk of symptoms, which affects many children in the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, however in our main analysis we only included dog-exposed children. Of note is that the asthma definition was updated from our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and hence the prevalence was slightly higher in the present report. Lastly, we did not have information on the proportion of time the dog spent outdoor, the level of contact the dog had with the child, or whether or not cats or other furred pets were present in the household.</p><p id="Par32">We conclude that within a nation-wide cohort of children exposed to dogs in their home during first year of life, several dog characteristics such as having only female dogs and increased number of dogs, but not &#x0201c;hypoallergenic&#x0201d; breeds are associated with a lower risk of asthma at age six. We also found an association of exposure to &#x0201c;hypoallergenic&#x0201d; breeds with allergy, which might be caused by a selective behaviour in families with allergies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
