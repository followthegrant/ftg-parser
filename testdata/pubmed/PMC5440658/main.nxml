The significance of serum IgA against <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> remains unclear. The production of intrathecal IgA has been noted in patients with the late Lyme disease manifestation, neuroborreliosis, but production of antigen-specific IgA during early disease has not been evaluated. In the current study, we assessed serum IgA binding to the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> peptide antigens, C6, the target of the FDA-cleared C6 EIA, and FlaB(211-223)-modVlsE(275-291), a peptide containing a Borrelia flagellin epitope linked to a modified VlsE sequence, in patients with early and late Lyme disease. Specific IgA was detected in 59 of 152 serum samples (38.8%) from early Lyme disease patients. Approximately 50% of early Lyme disease patients who were seropositive for peptide-specific IgM and/or IgG were also seropositive for peptide-specific IgA. In a subpopulation of patients, high peptide-specific IgA could be correlated with disseminated disease, defined as multiple erythema migrans lesions, and neurological disease complications. These results suggest that there may be an association between elevated levels of antigen-specific IgA and particular disease manifestations in some patients with early Lyme disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Approximately one-third of all patients diagnosed with early Lyme disease have significant levels of antigen-specific IgA</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Approximately one-half of patients seropositive for IgM and/or IgG are also seropositive for IgA</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Antigen-specific IgA correlated with disseminated disease and neurological symptoms in patients with early Lyme disease</p></list-item></list></p><p>The significance of serum IgA production in patients with early Lyme disease has not been previously evaluated.

It is endemic in parts of North America and Europe. The skin lesion, <italic>erythema migrans</italic> (EM), is a classic marker of early infection and present in ~&#x000a0;80% of acutely diagnosed individuals (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Steere et al., 1998</xref>). It is the only specific clinical marker for LD (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Wormser et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Steere et al., 1998</xref>) and in regions endemic for LD, presentation with EM is considered diagnostic. Other clinical manifestations are nonspecific and are found in a wide variety of other illnesses. Unlike most bacterial infections where culture is the major diagnostic method, culture of Bb has proven to be ineffective for routine use (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1995</xref>). Therefore, the laboratory diagnosis of LD is based on indirect methods, primarily the serological detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against Bb (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Schriefer, 2015</xref>). In North America, seroreactivity is tested using the two-tier paradigm delineated by the CDC, consisting of a first-tier EIA and a second-tier immunoblot measuring IgM and IgG (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Craven et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The two-tier paradigm has excellent specificity; however, low sensitivity is a significant issue in early disease. The sensitivity of current IgM and IgG LD assays during early disease seldom exceeds 50% (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Stanek et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Nowakowski et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Gomes-Solecki et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Gomes-Solecki et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Wormser et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bacon et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Coulter et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2000</xref>). For those patients that either do not develop an EM, or present with an atypical EM that can be mistaken for a rash, there is a significant need for sensitive and accurate laboratory diagnostics for Borrelia infection (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Schutzer et al., 1999</xref>). Early intervention is paramount for ensuring good patient outcomes and preventing development of subsequent late stage disease that can result in permanent damage to neurological and musculoskeletal systems (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Aguero-Rosenfeld et al., 2005</xref>). That Bb induces the generation of specific IgM and IgG antibodies is well documented. However, the role of serum anti-Bb IgA in early LD patients has not been defined.</p><p>IgA is the second most common antibody isotype in human blood, after IgG. Unlike polymeric IgA produced at mucosal surfaces, human serum IgA is principally monomeric (subclass IgA1). Monomeric serum IgA is not secreted across the mucosal barrier and has a half-life of 4.5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;days in peripheral blood (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Schaller et al., 2008</xref>). The role of serum IgA in immunity has yet to be clearly defined. With respect to LD, one publication that focused on the development of Lyme arthritis and cryoglobulin IgM in 48 untreated EM patients had incidentally noted that circulating anti-Borrelia IgA and IgG tended to move conversely to IgM (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Steere et al., 1979</xref>). Other studies associating IgA and LD have concentrated on the intrathecal production of anti-Bb IgA in patients with neuroborreliosis (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Steere et al., 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jesse et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Schwenkenbecher et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Kowarik et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Roberg et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jesse et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Schwenkenbecher et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Kowarik et al., 2012</xref>). No study has specifically addressed the presence of circulating anti-Borrelia IgA in early LD. In the present study, we found that approximately one-third of patients presenting with early LD had circulating IgA antibodies specific for Borrelia peptide antigens. We utilized peptides that were highly specific to Bb to limit the detection of cross-reactive IgA induced by a response to a non-Borrelia infection. Our results suggest that there could be a potential role for serum IgA detection in the laboratory diagnosis of LD.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Serum Samples</title><p>We performed a retrospective analysis of Bb-specific IgA in serum from patients presenting with early LD (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;152) and in patients with Lyme arthritis (late LD) (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;19). Sera from patients with early LD were collected as a convenience series; that is, patients were recruited from populations presenting to seasonal LD clinics (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) typically with one or more EM lesions and receiving a clinical diagnosis of early LD. For patients included in this study that did not present with an EM, diagnosis was supported by clinical presentation and positive standard serology (Table S1 and S2). All collection sites (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) are in regions endemic for LD, and sera were obtained during LD season, which runs from mid-spring to mid-fall. Sera from Lyme arthritis patients were collected from patients upon first clinical presentation to the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center in LaCrosse, WI; diagnosis was made based on clinical presentation, all had joint swelling and a positive Lyme serology. All sera were collected at the time of initial diagnosis with consent and under institutional review board (IRB) approval from the relevant institutions listed in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. All of the samples were de-identified before being provided to us; experiments were conducted without prior knowledge of clinical symptoms beyond a diagnosis of early Lyme disease.

These sera were utilized as a separate negative healthy control. Sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), fibromyalgia, or syphilis were used as negative disease controls for specificity in this assay. RA sera are used as negative disease controls because joint destruction and large joint inflammation are also observed in LD, while syphilis sera serve as controls for an infectious disease caused by a related spirochete, <italic>Treponema pallidum</italic>. Fibromyalgia sera are used as controls because the disorder is marked by diffuse nonspecific symptoms that are sometimes misinterpreted as early LD. All sera were aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;&#x000a0;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. For the study, individual aliquots were moved to &#x02212;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, and freeze-thaw cycles were kept to a minimum.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Peptide ELISA</title><p>Peptide antigens, C6 (CMKKDDQIAAAIALRGMAKDGKFAVK) and FlaB(211-223)-modVlsE(275-291) (FlaB-mV) (CVQEGVQQEGAQQPGGGMKKNDQIVAAIALRGVA) were synthesized by LifeTein (Somerset, NJ).

As EM develops between 3 and 30&#x000a0;days after a tick bite (average of 7&#x000a0;days), the level of anti-Borrelia antibody within this patient population can vary greatly (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Berger, 1993</xref>). Depending upon when patients seek medical attention, they may present with IgM, IgG, or a mixture of both to Bb. In the present study, we report significant levels of antigen-specific serum IgA in approximately one-third of total patients diagnosed with early LD. When IgA seropositivity was evaluated in the context of existing IgM/IgG seropositivity, ~&#x000a0;50% of patients who were seropositive for anti-FlaB-mV or anti-C6 IgM or IgG were also seropositive for IgA. The lower rate of IgA binding in the total early LD population may simply be due to the fact that some of the patients had not seroconverted at the time of initial blood draw. We expect that this IgA is monomeric, as the majority of circulating serum IgA in humans is monomeric, and of the IgA1 subtype; however, we did not confirm this in our studies. We assessed IgA binding to two specific immunogenic peptides derived from Bb antigens, C6 and FlaB-mV. We chose to use these peptides rather than whole protein antigens to minimize the possibility of IgA binding to cross reactive epitopes. Concomitantly, very little cross-reactivity was observed in healthy and disease control patients in terms of anti-C6 and -FlaB-mV IgA levels. Sensitivity of IgA binding to FlaB-mV was slightly better than binding to C6, which is unsurprising considering that this peptide contains two epitopes from two different antigens, VlsE and flagellum, where C6 contains only one epitope from a single antigen, VlsE (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Gomes-Solecki et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The function of IgA in LD is unclear; however, the role of serum IgA in systemic immune responses in general is poorly understood in comparison to the roles of IgM and IgG. It is primarily regarded as a neutralizing antibody when produced in polymeric form at mucosal surfaces, where it is secreted across the mucosal barrier. The role of IgA in LD has been poorly studied, presumably because Bb is not associated with mucosal pathogenesis. We are aware of only one study, from 1979, that measured anti-Bb IgA levels in patients with early disease (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Steere et al., 1979</xref>); however, anti-Bb IgA was incidental to the focus of the study. It indicated that anti-Bb IgA was present and appeared to increase along with the level of anti-Bb IgG and that both IgA and IgG moved conversely to anti-Bb IgM. IgA production in LD has principally been studied in terms of the production of intrathecal IgA specific to Bb antigens during Lyme neuroborreliosis, a late stage form of the disease (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Steere et al., 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jesse et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Schwenkenbecher et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Kowarik et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Roberg et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Steere et al., 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jesse et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Schwenkenbecher et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Kowarik et al., 2012</xref>). High antigen-specific intrathecal IgA levels are also typical of tuberculosis meningitis, which is often included in the differential diagnosis with Lyme neuroborreliosis, as both diseases are marked by abnormal cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) changes in immunoglobulins that include elevated intrathecal IgM, elevated B-specific antibody indexes for IgG or IgM, lymphopleocytosis, severe blood-CSF barrier dysfunction, and intrathecal IgA (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Djukic et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, intrathecal synthesis of IgG is observed in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Reiber, 1998</xref>). This suggests a potential biological role for intrathecal IgA in infectious disease, and provides limited insight into a possible neurologic function of IgA.</p><p>The results of this study suggest an association between serum anti-Bb IgA and disseminated infection (multiple EM), and possibly neurologic manifestations or arthralgia. IgA-positive patients from the Northeast were significantly more likely to have multiple EM lesions, neurologic manifestations or migratory polyarthralgia when compared to IgA negative patients from the Northeast. In fact, all 10 IgA positive patients in this population, for which clinical data was available, presented with multiple EM. The rate of multiple EM in patients from the northeast was quite high (60.7%, 17/28); however, this could be the result of multiple EM patients preferentially seeking care at a specialty LD clinic rather than their primary care physician. Only one patient from the Upper Midwest presented with a defined neurological sign, and another with possible CNS involvement, but both were IgA positive. The remaining IgA positive patients from the Upper Midwest reported less-specific complaints including myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and fever. Similar to patients from the Northeast, these less-specific complaints were reported more often in IgA positive early LD patients; though these differences were not statistically significant compared to IgA negative early LD patients. The small number of IgA negative patients in this group may have contributed to the lack of statistical differences. The differences in IgA/neurological symptom association observed between IgA positive patients in the Northeast and Upper Midwest could be due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: regional differences in Bb strains, differences in reporting practices of diagnosing clinicians, differences in patient referral patterns, or regional differences in Lyme pathology, presentation, and progression. The sample size of the current study is not large enough to evaluate these various factors; a larger prospective study is being designed to further assess these results.</p><p>The rate of IgA seropositivity was significantly higher in patients from the Upper Midwest compared to the Northeast (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.005). However, the rate of seropositivity for IgM/IgG was also significantly higher in patients from the Upper Midwest (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), suggesting that the lower IgA seropositivity could be linked to a lower rate of seroconversion in early LD patients from the Northeast compared to the Upper Midwest. Concordantly, when IgA seropositivity was evaluated as a function of IgM/IgG seropositivity, the positive levels of IgA to either FlaB-mV or C6 was much closer in patients from the two regions. The difference in seroconversion between the two regions may lie in differences in the duration of illness prior to diagnosis. Though data was only obtained for some patients from the Upper Midwest, the available data suggests that duration of illness prior to diagnosis was far shorter in patients from the Northeast (4.6&#x000a0;days&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.4) compared to the Upper Midwest (16.8&#x000a0;days&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;12.0). It should be noted that Northeastern patient data reported duration of EM prior to diagnosis, while Midwestern patient data reported duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis, which could exist prior to development of EM; however, the data still imply a trend toward a longer time of infection prior to seeking medical care. On the other hand, the late LD patients from the Midwest had, as expected, a very high rate of IgG seropositivity (94.7% (18/19) with 5.3% equivocal (1/19) and no negative), but a lower rate of seropositive IgA individuals (31.6%, 6/19), compared to patients with early LD. Therefore, duration of illness does not seem to be a sole driving factor in IgA seropositivity in LD, suggesting that additional factors contribute to the induction of anti-Bb IgA, though at the current time these factors remain undefined. No specific associations between IgA positivity and reported clinical manifestations in the Lyme arthritis population were observed, and we unfortunately did not have access to a bank of serum from patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis. A larger prospective study, based upon our findings, is being designed to further assess the association of anti-Borrelia IgA with specific clinical disease manifestations.</p><p>Our data provides some evidence that suggests individuals with a high anti-Bb IgA index could be a subpopulation with unique characteristics that represents roughly half of all LD-seropositive patients; however, limitations within this study prevent drawing firm conclusions based upon our data. The limitations of this study are that we do not have access to detailed clinical information on all 152 of the patients. As this is a retrospective study using stored serum collected from multiple sites over many LD seasons, differences in reporting practices at different sites also limited the usefulness of available patient information. This resulted in a smaller overall number of IgA positive patients for which correlations could be drawn. We also did not have access to additional laboratory measurements (if any) such as lumbar puncture for neurological disease to definitively confirm disseminated LD, and draw comparisons between potential systemic and intrathecal IgA production. We also did not have access to a patient population with defined Lyme neuroborreliosis to draw comparisons. We are currently designing a prospective study to further analyze the production of Bb-specific IgA in patients during early LD at both acute and convalescent patient visits to assess the induction of anti-Bb IgA over the course of infection.</p><p>Here, we present evidence that a substantial population of individuals with early LD produce high levels of circulating anti-Bb IgA. Whether anti-Bb serum IgA can provide prognostic value for the development of disseminated disease or neurological symptoms, and whether the evaluation of anti-Bb IgA levels would provide a clinical benefit, are questions that deserve further study.</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><title>Funding Sources</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source id="gts0005">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Grants</funding-source>: AI102435, AI120364, and AI122399.
