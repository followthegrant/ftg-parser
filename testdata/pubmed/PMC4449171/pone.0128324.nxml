Rebamipide, an amino acid modified hydroxylquinoline, can alter the expression of key mediators of bone anabolism, cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2), BMP-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in diverse cell types such as mucosal and endothelial cells or chondrocytes. The present study investigates whether Rebamipide enhances proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts when delivered from brushite cement. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching ability of Rebampide was tested in macrophages as a measure of bioactivity following drug release incubation times, up to 14 days. Rebamipide release from brushite occurrs via non-fickian diffusion, with a rapid linear release of 9.70% &#x000b1;0.37% of drug per day for the first 5 days, and an average of 0.5%-1% per day thereafter for 30 days. Rebamipide slows the initial and final cement setting time by up to 3 and 1 minute, respectively, but does not significantly reduce the mechanical strength below 4% (weight percentage). Pre-osteoblast proliferation increases by 24% upon exposure to 0.4uM Rebamipide, and by up to 73% when Rebamipide is delivered via brushite cement. Low doses of Rebamipide do not adversely affect peak alkaline phosphatase activity in differentiating pre-osteoblasts. Rebamipide weakly stimulates proliferation in macrophages at low concentrations (118 &#x000b1;7.4% at 1uM), and quenches ROS by 40-60%. This is the first investigation of Rebamipide in osteoblasts.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Swedish research council GA 621-2011-3399 HE MP EU 7th framework project: Biodesign HE MP.

Out of all musculoskeletal surgical procedures in the US, half involve the graft of donor or cadaveric bone[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, graft treatments are limited by the availability of tissue, donor morbidity, and the potential for disease transmission associated with transplanted tissue. Injectable bone substitutes, such as calcium phosphate cements (CPC), offer many advantages compared to bone grafts. Perhaps the most important feature of CPC&#x02019;s is that they are very similar in composition to the mineral component of bone, and thus can precipitate new bone growth onto the cement surface (osteoconductive)[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The physical properties of CPC&#x02019;s are also easily tuned: the mechanical strength depends upon the particle size, final porosity or stoichiometric ratio of the reactants[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. and the porosity can be controlled by varying the liquid to powder ratio, amount of crystal growth retardants or adding porosity agents such as foams or porogens.[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In addition, CPC&#x02019;s are also effective drug delivery vehicles[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Delivery of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor agonist, or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from calcium phosphates, in vivo, has been shown to yield significant increase in bone mass, bone density, and new bone surface area compared to controls[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It should be noted that dicalcum phosphate dihydrate (DCPD also known as brushite) is acidic during and after the setting reaction and, thus may better suited for small molecule drugs and not labile biological agents [<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, inorganic calcium phosphate cements lack many of the bioactive factors that are found in normal and demineralized bone grafts, such as BMP-2 and collagen[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While many studies have successfully improved bone regrowth by delivering various therapeutic agents, only BMP-2 is widely used clinically. Most biological agents are expensive to purify, even in small quantities, and stimulation of new bone growth requires large amounts[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, it is difficult to deliver biological agents locally because the processing and sterilization procedures necessary for FDA approval of biomedical devices can reduce or destroy bioactivity[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therapeutic agents that stimulate bone anabolism may also exert unintended effects: if local concentration is higher than expected, in other cell types, or contradictory responses within a single cell type[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, there are four receptors for PGE2 (PGE2-R1, 2, 3, 4), each with distinct action. An agent that stimulates PGE-2 production via cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may increase proliferation by activating PGE receptors R1 or R2 in osteoblasts, or reduce proliferation and enhance differentiation while by activating PGE-R4[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Rebamipide is a modified hydroxyquinoline capable of reducing inflammation, enhancing regeneration, angiogenesis, mucin and proteoglycan production, and reducing cartilage degeneration, by altering the expression of genes such as COX-2, BMP-2, VEGF, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and PGE2-R1[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Osteoblasts are the main producer of VEGF and PGE2 during wound repair in bone, and a primary source of angiogenesis signaling following device implantation[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Since Rebamipide is an effective stimulator of COX-2 in other cell types, we hypothesized that Rebamipide may enhance the expression of therapeutic targets COX-2, BMP-2 and/or VEGF in osteoblasts. If Rebamipide stimulates BMP-2 or PGE-2 production in osteoblasts it may be a suitable alternative to avoid the short half-life, high cost and side effects associated with other biological agents. In the present study the effect of Rebamipide on brushite cement setting, drug release and on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts was investigated in the murine MC3T3 preosteoblastic cell line.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Phase Characterization</title><p>The chemical structure of Rebamipide is indicated in <xref rid="pone.0128324.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.

Rebamipide was a potent stimulator of proliferation at 0.4uM. The effective concentration in osteoblasts (0.4uM) and macrophages (1uM) that stimulated proliferation was quite similar. Leach containing Rebamipide exhibits an additive effect, resulting in a 73% increase in proliferation at low concentrations, but no additional enhancement in ALP activity compared to control composite leach (group 0). However, the leach from drug loaded composites appears to reduce proliferation with higher Rebamipide concentrations (Group 2&#x02013;4). This biphasic effect also occurs in models of prostaglandin (PGE-2) stimulation, providing indirect evidence that Rebamipide stimulates PGE production in osteoblasts[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The sigmoidal (non-linear) reduction in proliferation that approaches baseline (untreated), suggest that Rebamipide is not increasingly toxic at higher concentrations. Instead the trend suggests that at low concentrations Rebamipide acts in concert with cement leach to increase proliferation, but reduces proliferation at higher concentrations by interfering with the stimulatory effects of cement leach. Perhaps most interesting, Rebamipide concentrations in the range of 0.4-10uM stimulated ALP activity, though not when delivered via brushite. For all concentrations tested Rebamipide did not appear to reduce peak alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting it does not inhibit differentiation up to 75uM. Leach from control brushite cement stimulated proliferation and ALP, which was not surprising since calcium and phosphate ions found in the leach are well known inductors of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We propose that, much like in the case of proliferation, low concentrations of Rebamipide weakly stimulate ALP activity in MC3T3 osteoblasts while higher concentrations reduce the beneficial effects of cement leach on ALP activity. Brushite cement leach (no drug) increased ALP activity well above control and optimal Rebamipide treatments (0.4 uM). At low concentrations (group 1 composites) calcium and Rebamipide, both present in the leach, may stimulate COX-2 and PGE2 production leading to increased ALP activity. The primary bioactive component of brushite leach, calcium, is known to increase the same target of Rebamipide treatment, COX-2 and PGE2, in osteoblasts[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, at higher concentrations (composite groups 2&#x02013;4) Rebamipide may hinder differentiation in osteoblasts via a mechanism that is antagonistic to brushite leach. Work done by Ishihara has revealed that Rebamipide can block the activation of L-type voltage gated calcium channels, thereby affecting extracellular calcium entry[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. If Rebamipide blocks L-type calcium channels in osteoblasts it may prevent or reduce the influx of calcium from the leach, thus reducing the beneficial effects of calcium present in brushite leach [<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Though higher concentrations (10uM*, 75uM*) of Rebamipide (no leach) resulted in enhanced differentiation at 7 and 10 days, these latter treatment groups were lowered dosage regimens. By the second feeding (day 4) the delivered concentration was already 1/8 of the initial dose (i.e. the cells were treated with 75uM, 37.5uM two days and 9.375uM four days later).</p><p>Brushite is an attractive vehicle for osseous drug delivery because it is a metastable calcium phosphate, with a rapid resorption rate, that will eventually transform into either octacalcium phosphate or hydroxyapatite, in vivo[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Rebamipide slowed the average initial cement setting times by 1&#x02013;3 minutes, but did not significantly affect the final setting time, or reduce the mechanical strength of fresh or aged samples when it was added, up to 2% of the final composite weight. The observed in setting time suggests that Rebamipide does not significantly affect the setting reaction. The delay in initial setting time is within the deviation normally found for brushite cement setting times (1&#x02013;5 minutes)[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The initial setting strength of composites with Rebamipide were significantly stronger than the reported compressive strength (1&#x02013;10 MPa) of human cancellous bone, even at the highest amount of Rebamipide [<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The observed reduction in compressive strength (50%), after ageing in PBS for 30 days, is in agreement with other studies, as brushite undergoes dissolution in PBS[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The phase composition of set cements was comparable between all groups. Altogether these results suggest that the Rebamipide can be added to brushite cements with minimal impact on the physical characteristics of the cement, up to 2% by weight. Though there appears to be a trend of increased hydroxylapatite formation with increased Rebamipide incorporation, the observed values are at the limit of the author&#x02019;s Rietveld refinement accuracy (1&#x02013;5%). Future studies should be done to determine the hydroxylapatite content after longer ageing times, perhaps after 60 or 120 days.</p><p>A cement was selected as a drug carrier because localized delivery, only at the site of a bone defect, can avoid the potential side effects associated with systemic delivery. When Rebamipide is delivered by brushite two distinct phases of release occur. The initial release is rapid, linear and predictable though it occurs via a non-fickian mechanism (0.5 &#x0003c; n &#x0003c; 1.0)[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. During the later phase of release (after 14 days) composites with higher concentrations (group 3,4) release slightly less Rebamipide than expected, as indicated by the plot in <xref rid="pone.0128324.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>. Prior studies have reported that drug release occurs from brushite carriers via first-order kinetics for highly water soluble drugs[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, Rebamipide is poorly soluble in aqueous solutions, so drug diffusion is limited by the dissolution rate (the dissolution rate has not been reported)[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. As Rebamipide nearest to the composite surface is depleted and the diffusion layer moves further into the composite, dissolution and diffusion factors may no longer be equivalent between composite groups. Composites containing more poorly soluble Rebamipide will have less water volume, which may affect both diffusion and dissolution. In addition, while the initial amount of Rebamipide in all composites exceed the solubility, this may change after 14 days. Though the effect of Rebamipide on solution viscosity has not been investigated, as the diffusion layer extends millimeters into the composite high concentrations of Rebamipide in group 3 and 4 composites may cause small differences in viscosity that change the rate of diffusion[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is important to note that the later release phase is still linear and predictable, and thus the composite continues to function as an effective drug delivery device throughout the 30 day period. Our results are in agreement with prior studies that have reported that calcium phosphate cements can continually delivery therapeutic agents in vitro, and in vivo, for more than 30 days[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Rebamipide has already been described as a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant in human macrophages and neutrophils[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In bone tissue macrophages are an integral part of the initial inflammatory response after trauma, for example after a biomaterial such as brushite is implanted. Activated macrophages react to injury or infection by releasing ROS. While ROS is necessary for wound healing, it is also directly correlated with the development of fibrotic tissue, which hampers tissue-biomaterial integration and drug release from a biomaterial[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus we examined whether Rebamipide was toxic to macrophages at concentrations where it was an effective quencher of ROS in RAW macrophages. Rebamipide was not significantly toxic to macrophages up 1mM, or when delivered via 10-fold dilutions of leach from composites (up to 300uM). The leach products (diluted 4-fold in luminescence assays) from all composite groups were effective quenchers of ROS. However, despite an approximate 8-fold increase in concentration, there was only a minimal (10%) improvement in quenching ability with greater drug loading. The leach from group 1 composites reduced ROS by the same percentage as Rebamipide diluted from the powder stock, which suggests that the bioactivity of Rebamipide is not reduced by loading it into brushite cements. However, higher doses appear to be more effective at quenching ROS when dissolved directly into solution, than when they are released from cements.</p><p>The most interesting finding of this study is that 0.4uM Rebamipide can stimulate both proliferation and differentiation. Other studies have reported an increase in gastric cell proliferation, however the proliferative effects of Rebamipide in osteoblasts has not been investigated[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128324.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In the present study the leach containing Rebamipide was comparable in efficacy to other drugs that have been reported to stimulate osteoblast proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The optimal concentration of Rebamipide, when loaded into a brushite cement, occurs at lower loading amounts (0.5% by weight). However further testing is needed to identify whether bioactivity declines at longer elution times and, therefore, whether lower drug loading would be more effective for acute delivery. Future studies should investigate whether the increased proliferation observed at 0.4uM Rebamipide is due to an increase in PGE-2 or COX-2 production. Though Rebamipide is known to alter gene expression epithelial and chondrogenic cell types, reduce cytokine production in macrophages and neutrophils, and inhibit cancer cell proliferation, the mechanism behind each of these disparate actions is poorly understood[<xref rid="pone.0128324.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report for the first time that Rebamipide is an effective stimulator of osteoblast proliferation and can affect ALP activity in MC3T3 osteoblasts.

Brushite appears to be an effective vehicle for long term (30 days) Rebamipide delivery.

The typical concentration range of Rebamipide collected between day 3 and 10 was 120-200uM (group 1), 350-420uM (group 2), 650-800uM (group 3), and 1200-1400uM (group 4). Leach collected between day 10 and 20 were lower concentration: 50-90uM (group 1), 100-180uM (group 2), 200-400uM (group 3), and 750-1000uM (group 4).</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>In Vitro Tests</title><sec id="sec021"><title>Viability/Proliferation Test</title><p>Osteoblasts and macrophages are two of the most abundant and critical cell populations involved in osseous regeneration following surgical trauma, and thus were selected for bioactivity studies. Acute toxicity was determined by alamar blue reduction. Raw 264.7 cells were seeded at 8,000 cells cm<sup>-2</sup> into 96 well plates and allowed to proliferate for 3 days, until 80% confluent. MC3T3 cells were seeded at 10,000 cells cm<sup>-2</sup> and allowed to proliferate for 1 day before treating. At the time of treatment the media was replaced with known concentrations of Rebamipide dissolved in media, or neutralized leach from cement composites. The cement leach was diluted 10-fold for macrophage and osteoblast cultures to examine the bioactivity (proliferation) of Rebamipide after elution from a CPC. After 24 hours the media was replaced with a 5% solution of alamar blue, dissolved in proliferation media, and incubated for 1.5 hours at 37<sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C. The fluorescence of the reduced alamar blue product, Resorufin, was detected at 560 and 590nm (excitation/emission), background (no cells) was subtracted, and the values were normalized to the respective untreated controls and expressed as percent survival at each time point.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Antioxidant Capacity Test</title><p>The ability of Rebamipide to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Raw 264.7 macrophages was determined by a luminol amplified chemiluminescence assay. 200,000 cells were suspended in 150uL of luminol buffer containing 50mM luminol, 0.1M NaOH, 2ug ml<sup>-1</sup> of horse radish peroxidase, 100uM glucose and 3 parts of RPMI-1640 for every 1 part of PBS. A 50uL aliquot of PBS, a known concentration of Rebamipide, or leach solution from drug-loaded composites was added to bring the final solution volume to 200uM. All cells were activated with 1uM of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Cells were incubated in 96-well white optiplate (Perkin Elmer) at 37<sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C and luminescence readings (492nm) were recorded every two minutes, for 1 hour, on a Tecan plate reader. The total area under the curve was integrated and the total plotted to determine the effective quenching ability of Rebamipide. Each sample was run in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Osteoblast Differentiation (ALP activity)</title><p>MC3T3 were seeded at 30,000 cells cm<sup>-2</sup> for differentiation studies, in 96 well plates. After 1 day, the growth media was replaced with differentiation media and known concentrations of Rebamipide or neutralized cement leach. In vitro and in vivo the amount of drug release from composites decreases with time. Consequently, differentiating osteoblasts were treated with either a descending, or constant (indicated on the X axis of <xref rid="pone.0128324.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c</xref> by a *, i.e. 0.4uM*) treatment regimen. In the constant dose regimen cells were treated with the same concentration of Rebamipide every time the media was replaced. The descending dose group received the indicated initial dose, however treatment was diluted by a factor of 2, 4, 16 and 32-fold when the media was replaced on day 2, 4, 6 and day 8&#x02013;12 (i.e. the 0.4uM group was treated with 400, 200, 100, and 25nM on day 0, 2, 4 and 6 respectively, and 12.5nM on day 8, 10 and 12). The descending dose regimen mimicked the observed drug release rate in vitro. Unfortunately, because of the limited solubility of Rebamipide, the concentration of Rebamipide obtained from in vitro leach was too low to allow for further dilution into cell culture. For this reason a concentrated stock was necessary. At 5, 7 or 10 days cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 200uL of lysis buffer (20mM Tris, 1mM MgCl, 0.1mM ZnCl, 0.1% Triton-X 100) and immediately frozen at -20<sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C for later analysis. The lysates were freeze/thawed three times at 37<sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C and a 25uL aliquot was taken from each well and combined with 50uL of alkaline phosphatase substrate for 20 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 25uL of 3M NaOH, and the conversion of substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate into free 4-nitrophenol was determined by spectrophotometer (Tekan plate reader) at 405nm. A 50uL aliquot was taken from each well and combined with an equal volume of micro-BCA working solution, per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, incubated at 37<sup>&#x000b0;</sup>C for 1 hour, and the absorbance was read at 562nm on a Tekan plate reader. ALP and BCA readings were compared to a standard curve of 4NP and BSA respectively, and the calculated alkaline phosphatase activity was normalized to the protein content for each well. Experiments were replicated twice, with 5 samples per group in each experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results of phase composition, mechanical strength, drug release and setting time experiments were analyzed with ANOVA (IMB SPSS Software) and Tukey HSD post-hoc analysis.
