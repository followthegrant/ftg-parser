Homocysteine not only can be remethylated to methionine by enzymes that require folic acid but also can be catabolized to form cysteine by cystathionine-&#x003b2;-synthetase (CBS). Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that homocysteine is toxic to neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. One explanation for the mechanism of homocysteine neurotoxicity is that auto-oxidation of homocysteine leads to the formation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The causative link between hyperhomocysteinemia and neurodegeneration has been known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Elevated brain homocysteine has been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is now established that elevated plasma homocysteine is a strong, independent risk factor of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the potential role of homocysteine is regarded as a novel therapeutic target for AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), a well-known toxic gas with the smell of rotten eggs, is formed naturally in mammalian tissues and exhibits a series of biological and physiological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It has been recognized as an important endogenous neuromodulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the central nervous system, endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S is synthesized from L-cysteine and this process is predominantly catalyzed by CBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The roles of H<sub>2</sub>S in neuroprotection have been extensively reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub>S protects primary rat cortical neurons from oxytosis induced by glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] as well as SHSY-5Y cells against the neurotoxicity of peroxynitite (ONOO<bold><sup>&#x000af;</sup></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We also have reported that H<sub>2</sub>S produces neuroprotective effects when it is used to treat beta-amyloid- and 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridium ion (MPP<sup>+</sup>)-induced neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Most recent study by our group have demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub>S protects neurons from damage caused by homocysteine to neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], suggesting a promising role of H<sub>2</sub>S supplement as a novel therapeutic strategy for AD associated with homocysteine.</p><p>The pharmacological profile of a new, safe and effective H<sub>2</sub>S-releasing sildenafil (ACS6) was described recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Muzaffar et al. reported that ACS6 is a potent inhibitor of superoxide formation and that H<sub>2</sub>S release from ACS6 is crucial for its biological actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus, it is logical to test the role of ACS6 in homocysteine-induced neurotoxicity.</p><p>The purpose of this study therefore is to investigate the effects of ACS6 on homocysteine-induced neurotoxicity to PC12 cells, a clonal rat pheochromocytoma cell line, which is widely used for studying the cellular biology of neurons (33-35). We demonstrated for the first time that ACS6, a putative H<sub>2</sub>S-donating derivative of sildenafil, significantly protected PC12 cells against homocysteine-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis by inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003c8;) and up-regulation of bcl-2 expression. Our findings suggest that ACS6, acting as an H<sub>2</sub>S donor, is able to act as a neuroprotectant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Hoechst 33258, Rhodamine 123 (Rh123), 2',7'-dichlorfluorescein- diacetate (DCFH-DA) and homocysteine were purchased from Sigma Chemical CO (st.Louis, MO, USA).

Our previous results have demonstrated that homocysteine inhibits the activity and expression of CBS and the endogenous production of H<sub>2</sub>S in PC12 cells and this inhibitory effect contribute to the neurotoxicity of homocysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We also found that H<sub>2</sub>S acts as a neuroprotectant counteracting an oxidative insult to neurons induced by homocysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It has been shown that ACS6 inhibits the formation of superoxide by releasing H<sub>2</sub>S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether ACS6 has the ability to attenuate the neurotoxicity of homocysteine.</p><p>PC12 cells, originally derived from a transplantable rat pheochromocytoma, are accepted as a model system for primary neuronal cells because of their ability to respond to nerve growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In the present study, we determined the neuroprotective effects of ACS6 on homocysteine neurotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms by studying PC12 cells. Similar to the findings by Linnebank <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we found that exposure of PC12 cells to homocysteine resulted in decrease of viability as well as increase of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, Cyt-c release and caspase-3 activation occurred in response to homocysteine in PC12 cells. These results indicated that homocysteine induces significant neurotoxicity and apoptosis in PC12 cell. Of important, the present work demonstrated that ACS6 not only attenuated the cytotoxicity and the apoptotic cells induced by homocysteine but also inhibited homocysteine-triggered Cyt-c release and caspase-3 activation in PC12 cells. This study is therefore the first to conclude that treatment with ACS6 blunts the apoptosis induced by homocysteine in PC12 cells.</p><p>It is well known that mitochondrial dysfunction is an important feature in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] as well as a prominent factor associated with cell death and some models of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Mitochondrial damage is consistent with intracellular ROS production and changes in &#x00394;&#x003c8; during apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. &#x00394;&#x003c8; has been shown to be involved in a variety of pathophysiological conditions, in particular for apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. ROS is responsible for the homocysteine-induced neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Overproduction of ROS may result in mitochondrial dysfunction, causing &#x00394;&#x003c8; loss and promoting Cyt-c release and caspase-3 activation, which ultimately cause cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. To investigate the mechanisms of the cytoprotective effect of ACS6 on homocysteine-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells, we examined its effects on the homocysteine-mediated changes in ROS and &#x00394;&#x003c8;. The overproduction of ROS and dissipation of &#x00394;&#x003c8; were significantly induced in homocysteine-exposed PC12 cells, while pretreatment with ACS6 prevented both phenomena. Our results suggested that the anti-apoptotic effect of ACS6 is associated with the preservation of mitochondrial function by blocking the dissipation of &#x00394;&#x003c8; and the increase in ROS level.</p><p>It has been shown that Bcl-2 prevents apoptosis by regulating an antioxidant pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Kane, <italic>et al. </italic>reported that bcl-2 inhibits neural death by reducing the generation of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Additionally, over-expression of bcl-2 increases stability of &#x00394;&#x003c8; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and blocks cytochrome C release from mitochondria prior to mitochondrial membrane depolarization by preventing mitochondrial pore opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. It is therefore established that the cytoprotective effects associated with decrease in ROS generation and stability of &#x00394;&#x003c8; may be the results of over-expressed bcl-2. In the present study, we revealed that ACS6 blocked the down-regulation of bcl-2 induced by homocysteine. This finding implied that ACS6-induced up-regulation of bcl-2 expression may be involved in the protective actions of ACS6 against homocysteine-induced apoptosis and neurotoxicity.</p><p>In summary, our data for the first time demonstrated that ACS6 significantly limits the decrease in viability as well as the increase in apoptotic cells induced by homocysteine and prevents homocysteine-triggered Cyt-c release and caspase-3 activation. ACS6 not only blocks the loss of &#x00394;&#x003c8; and overproduction of ROS caused by homocysteine but also upregulates the down-expression of Bcl-2 occurred in response to homocysteine. The findings support that ACS6 protects PC12 cells against homocysteine induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis and the underlying mechanism may involve preservation of mitochondrial function by inhibiting both loss of &#x00394;&#x003c8; and accumulation of ROS as well as up-regulating the expression of bcl-2.</p><p>ACS6 is a putative H<sub>2</sub>S-donating derivative of sildenafil. It has been reported that H<sub>2</sub>S release from ACS6 is crucial for its biological action that inhibits the formation of superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In recent years, it has become clear that protects neurons from oxidative stress by increasing the levels of GSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by preserving mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. It is worthy to note that a previous study reported that H<sub>2</sub>S was detrimental in cerebral ischemia in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. This finding suggested that H<sub>2</sub>S is protective at concentrations that are equivalent to normal physiological concentrations, but is deleterious at supraphysiological concentrations in the brain. This is also supported by the data that excessive inhibition of H<sub>2</sub>S by AOAA led to detrimental effects in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Therefore, the ability of H<sub>2</sub>S to regulate cell viability may be concentration and time dependent. At low concentrations, as may occur in physiological conditions, cells remain unscathed by H<sub>2</sub>S, but, at high concentrations, as may occur in pathological states, a cytotoxic/proapoptotic effect becomes evident. To date, H<sub>2</sub>S-releasing "drugs" used in biological experiments has been largely restricted to simple sulfide salts, most commonly sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), which releases H<sub>2</sub>S instantaneously in aqueous solution. However, the release of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S from cells is likely to occur in lesser amounts and at a much slower rate than that from sulfide salts, and therefore NaHS may not mimic the biological effects of naturally produced H<sub>2</sub>S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Muzaffar et al. reported that once taken up by cells, ACS6 would release H<sub>2</sub>S intracellularly and in a long-lasting controlled way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Large amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S released over a short time frame by NaHS may trigger signaling pathways resulting in cell death, whereas this does not occur with the slower but sustained release of lower amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S from ACS6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the present findings clearly identify that ACS6, a novel H<sub>2</sub>S-releasing derivative, provides significant protection against homocysteine-induced neurotoxicity to PC12 cells by inhibiting both loss of &#x00394;&#x003c8; and accumulation of ROS and up-regulating the expression of bcl-2. Based on the notion that elevated plasma homocysteine is a strong, independent risk factor of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], our present study indicates that ASC6, or perhaps alternative related H<sub>2</sub>S-releasing compounds, could be worth to be further investigated in the study for their therapeutic uses as novel neuroprotectants for AD associated with homocysteine.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AD: Alzheimer's disease; CBS: cystathionine-&#x003b2;-synthetase; Cyt-c: cytochrome c; DCFH-DA 2',7':-dichlorfluorescein- diacetate; DCF 2',7':-dichlorfluorescein; FCM: flow cytometric; H<sub>2</sub>S: Hydrogen sulfide; MFI: mean fluorescent intensity; &#x00394;&#x003c8;: mitochondrial membrane potential; PI: propidium iodide; Rh123: Rhodamine 123; ROS: reactive oxygen species</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr P Del Soldato is a shareholder of CTG Pharma, Milan, Italy.
