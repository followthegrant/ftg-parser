Therefore, we investigated the possible changes in the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and AQPs in the intestines of mice with 5-FU-induced diarrhea. In the present study, the expressions of mRNAs that encode inflammatory cytokines, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, Il-17A and IL-22, were significantly increased throughout the entire colon of mice that exhibited diarrhea following 5-FU administration. In contrast, the gene expression of IFN&#x003b3; was upregulated only in the distal colon. These increases were significantly reduced by the administration of etanercept. However, 5-FU-induced diarrhea was not recovered by etanercept. On the other hand, the genes for AQPs 4 and 8 were markedly present in the colon, and these expressions in the intestines were significantly decreased by treatment with 5-FU. These decreases were not reversed by etanercept. These findings suggest TNF-&#x003b1; neutralization had no effect on the acutely 5-FU-induced diarrhea and impaired AQPs but reduced dramatically several inflammatory cytokines.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>KAKENHI (24790582) and by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jsps.go.jp/j-grantsinaid/">http://www.jsps.go.jp/j-grantsinaid/</ext-link>).

Gastrointestinal (GI) mucositis is a common side effect of cancer chemotherapy for which there is no efficient treatment.

On average, the intestines absorb about 9.0 L/day <xref rid="pone.0054788-Laforenza1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Therefore, the absorption of water is one of the key functions of the intestines. The regulation of transepithelial fluid transport in the GI tract is based on ion transport and water transport by aquaporins (AQPs) <xref rid="pone.0054788-Kunzelmann1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. AQPs constitute a family of small integral membrane proteins that are selectively permeable to water and driven by osmotic gradients <xref rid="pone.0054788-King1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054788-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054788-Takata1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054788-Verkman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

It is widely thought that AQPs are involved in diseases that are characterized by alterations in water transport. It has been reported that a defect in the expression and/or function of AQPs underlies renal diabetes insipidus <xref rid="pone.0054788-Deen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, brain edema <xref rid="pone.0054788-King1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054788-Saadoun1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, dry eye <xref rid="pone.0054788-Ohashi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and food allergy-induced diarrhea <xref rid="pone.0054788-Yamamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Diarrhea is a common symptom of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and a reduction in the expression of AQPs appears to be correlated with increased disease activity in patients with ulcerative and Crohn&#x02019;s colitis <xref rid="pone.0054788-Hardin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The GI tract is capable of secreting large amounts of water, and the transepithelial hypersecretion of fluid is the basis of secretory diarrhea. However, defects in water absorption in the intestine are also important factors in the pathogenesis of diarrhea. The changes in AQP expression in diseases of the digestive system have been useful for understanding the functions of AQPs. However, little, if any, is known about the possible changes in the tissue levels of AQP expression in 5-FU-induced diarrhea.</p><p>To investigate the pathophysiological role of inflammatory cytokines and AQPs in 5-FU-induced diarrhea, we examined the possible changes in the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and AQPs in the small and large intestines of mice under treatment with 5-FU.

In brief, the samples (10 &#x000b5;g of total protein per lane) were subjected to 10&#x02013;20% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane. After being blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, transferred PVDF membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies. Rabbit anti-AQP4 (1&#x02236;1000 dilution; Millipore) or mouse anti-AQP8 (1&#x02236;1000; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a primary antibody.

In the present study, we found that the expression of mRNAs encoding TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 IL-17A and IL-22 was dramatically increased in the proximal, transverse and distal colons of mice that exhibited severe diarrhea following the administration of 5-FU. In contrast, the gene expression of IFN&#x003b3;, which has been classified as a T helper 1 (Th1)-type cytokine, was significantly increased only in the colon of mice treated with 5-FU.</p><p>Several treatments, such as the use of TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors, seek to suppress these immune regulators in IBD, which is characterized as the chronic relapse of inflammatory disorders of the GI tract associated with an increased expression of IFN&#x003b3;, IL-17A and IL-22 in inflamed mucosa <xref rid="pone.0054788-SanchezMunoz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054788-Hundorfean1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore, we examined the effect of etanercept, which is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human 75 kDa (p75) TNF-&#x003b1; R linked to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), and which can bind to two TNF-&#x003b1; molecules to block their interaction with cell-surface TNF-&#x003b1; Rs and render TNF-&#x003b1; biologically inactive, on the 5-FU-induced upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, etanercept significantly reduced the 5-FU-induced increase in gene expression levels of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IFN&#x003b3;, IL-17A and IL-22 in the colon, which suggests that a TNF-&#x003b1; pathway modulates the subsequent expression of these inflammatory cytokines. These findings are consistent with previous studies in uveoretinitis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis vulgaris <xref rid="pone.0054788-Busch1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054788-Notley1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054788-Antiga1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, the 5-FU-induced loss of body weight was not recovered by the administration of etanercept. Furthermore, 5-FU-induced diarrhea was slightly, but not significantly, exacerbated by etanercept, indicating that an increase in inflammatory cytokines in different parts of the colon may not be directly associated with 5-FU-induced diarrhea. Therefore, we next examined the gene expression of AQPs in the intestines of mice that were treated with 5-FU.</p><p>In the present study, we found that the genes for AQPs 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 11 were expressed in the intestines of mice. At least seven AQP subtypes (AQPs 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 11) have been reported to be expressed in the GI tract and play an important role in several physiological and pathological processes <xref rid="pone.0054788-Laforenza1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054788-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054788-Matsuzaki1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In particular, the colon is a major site for the expression of AQPs 1, 3, 4 and 8 <xref rid="pone.0054788-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054788-Matsuzaki1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and there is some evidence regarding the physiological roles and functions of AQPs 1, 3, 4 and 8 in the colon. The water content of defecated stool is higher in AQP 4 knockout mice <xref rid="pone.0054788-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and the inhibition of AQP 8 expression by small interfering RNA decreases osmotic water permeability <xref rid="pone.0054788-Laforenza1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. On the other hand, AQP1 null mice exhibit only defective processing of dietary fat. In addition, both AQP1 null mice and AQP3 null mice do not appear to have a deficiency in colonic fluid transport <xref rid="pone.0054788-Ma2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0054788-Ma3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. There is little information available on the function of other AQP subtypes in the intestine. There have been some reports on the physiological roles of AQPs in water absorption by the colon. Yang et al. <xref rid="pone.0054788-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> observed only minor phenotypic differences between wild-type and AQP8 null mice with regard to intestinal fluid transport, suggesting that compensatory changes in the expression of other water or solute transporters in AQP 8 null mice might account for their unremarkable phenotype. In contrast, AQP 4 null mice have been found to excrete feces with an elevated water content <xref rid="pone.0054788-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The transepithelial water permeability of the proximal colon of wild-type mice is higher than that of the distal colon of wild-type mice, and is also higher than that of the proximal colon of AQP 4 null mice. AQP 4 deletion does not affect water permeability in the distal colon, which results in an increase in the water content of defecated stool. These findings imply that AQP4 plays a role in transcellular movement of water across surface colonocytes <xref rid="pone.0054788-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, the inhibition of AQP 8 expression by small interfering RNA significantly decreased water absorption in the rat proximal colon <xref rid="pone.0054788-Laforenza2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Thus, AQP 4 and AQP8 may play important roles in water absorption in the colon, particularly in the proximal colon, and decreased AQP expression might lead to an insufficiency of water absorption in this region of the GI tract. Changes in intestinal tissue levels of various AQPs have been reported in animal models and human diseases <xref rid="pone.0054788-Hardin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The expression of AQP 4 and AQP 8 mRNA is significantly decreased immediately after exposure to dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) in a C57BL/6 mouse model of colitis. Protein expression followed a pattern similar to that observed for AQPs mRNA. The rapid decrease in AQP 4 and AQP 8 expression is associated with changes in colonic water transport, leading to a shift in fluid flux from an absorptive state to a secretory state. Furthermore, colonic fluid transport returns to an absorptive state with an increase in AQP 4 and AQP 8 expression following the cessation of DSS, which suggests that there may be a functional correlation between fluid transport and AQP expression in the colon. These results from a model of DSS colitis in the mouse correlate with data from clinical investigations of human IBD. On the other hand, patients with active ulcerative colitis, Crohn&#x02019;s colitis or infectious colitis who develop severe diarrhea show similar reductions in AQP 8 expression. To investigate whether the development of 5-FU-induced diarrhea is associated with an altered gene expression of AQPs in the intestines, we examined the changes in the gene expression of AQPs in the small and large intestines of mice with 5-FU-induced diarrhea. In the present study, the expression of mRNAs encoding AQPs 1, 4, 8 and 11 was decreased in the proximal, transverse and distal colons of mice that exhibited diarrhea following the administration of 5-FU. To further investigate the changes in AQP expression associated with inflammation along with changes in cytokines, and the possible correlation between altered AQP expression and diarrhea, we examined the effect of etanercept on the 5-FU-induced decrease in AQP gene expression in the intestine. As a result, the 5-FU-induced downregulation of AQP 1, 4, 8 and 11 was not recovered by the administration of etanercept, suggesting that altered AQP expression might be independent of TNF-&#x003b1; pathway-related inflammation in the intestines following the administration of 5-FU. These findings support the idea that the reduction of AQP by the administration of 5-FU may result in the dysfunction of water absorption in different regions of the colon, which in turn causes diarrhea. Especially, our findings regarding the altered expression of AQP 4 and AQP 8, both of which are considered to play important roles in water absorption in the colon, could, at least in part, explain the induction of diarrhea following the administration of 5-FU. Smith et al. <xref rid="pone.0054788-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of 5-FU increased myeloperoxidase in the intestine and suggested that the neutrophil could play an important role in the 5-FU-induced intestional inflammation. Taken together, we speculate that neutorophilic inflammation, but not Th1/Th17-type inflammations, may cause the impaired AQPs expression. Although further studies need to resolve this point, application of neutrophil elastase inhibitor such as sivelestat sodium may have effect on the impaired AQPs in the colon of the 5-FU treated mouse, (Page 16, lines 3&#x02013;10).</p><p>In conclusion, in vivo administration of 5-FU caused increases in the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (such as, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IFN&#x003b3;, IL-17A and IL-22) and decreases in the expression of AQPs 1, 4, 8 and 11 in the colons of mice. Furthermore, the increased expression of cytokines was significantly reduced by s.c. administration of the TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitor etanercept, which did not counteract 5-FU-induced diarrhea, whereas etanercept did not restore the 5-FU-induced reduction in AQPs 1, 4, 8 and 11. The present study provides evidences that 5-FU administration develops both TNF-&#x003b1; modulating inflammation and decreased AQP expression in the intestine. However these pathophysiological conditions may be independent events. More importantly, intestional inflammation may not be directly associated with the pathological state of the 5-FU-induced diarrhea. Although further experiments are still needed, our findings raise the concept of a &#x0201c;TNF-&#x003b1; modulating cytokine-independent mechanism&#x0201d; for the diarrhea caused by 5-FU. We finally hypothesize here that impaired AQP expressions may predispose to intestional abnormality, such as severe diarrhea in response to 5-FU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0054788.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
