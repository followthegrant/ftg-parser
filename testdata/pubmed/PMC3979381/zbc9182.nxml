In aerobic tissues the fraction of glycolytic ATP synthesis is relatively modest (&#x0003c;10%), and mitochondria are, therefore, crucial to maintain a high ATP/ADP P<sub>i</sub> ratio (phosphorylation potential) to drive energy consuming cellular processes. An increased energy demand, as observed during stimulation of a cell, enhances ATP hydrolysis that must be compensated for by accelerated ATP synthesis. For example in the heart, mitochondrial respiration can adjust over a wide range matching the enhanced work load associated with an increase in beating frequency. Interestingly, energy intermediates such as ATP, ADP, and phosphocreatine remain unchanged even when the heart frequency is augmented severalfold (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Similarly, activation of specific brain areas augments their demand for ATP. This extra energy need is covered almost exclusively by elevated mitochondrial ATP synthesis with little contribution of glycolysis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Likewise, in the insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cell, energy demand and mitochondrial activation are closely intertwined. In response to glucose, beta cell mitochondria are able to augment their oxidative metabolism (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), respiration (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and mitochondrial ATP synthesis rates (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) to match cytosolic energy consuming processes. As a consequence, nutrient stimulation raises the cytosolic ATP/ADP P<sub>i</sub> ratio (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This increase is maintained despite enhanced ATP consumption due to beta cell electrical activity, insulin secretion, biosynthesis, and transport. These examples illustrate the potential of mitochondria to adjust their activity to energy demand without any prior energy stress such as a drop of the phosphorylation potential.</p><p>In pancreatic beta cells, the rise in the cytosolic ATP/ADP P<sub>i</sub> ratio after nutrient stimulation is necessary to initiate plasma membrane electrical activity. ATP promotes closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (<italic>K</italic><sub>ATP</sub>),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>3</sup></xref> which will depolarize the beta cell plasma membrane. As a result, voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open, and associated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises trigger insulin granule exocytosis.</p><p>Mitochondrial ATP synthesis is driven by the electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is established by the proton extruding activity of complex I, III, and IV of the respiratory chain. Re-entry of protons through complex V (ATP synthase) is coupled to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>). Both the electrical and the chemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane are elevated after stimulation of beta cells with nutrients (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This increase in driving force in part explains accelerated mitochondrial ATP synthesis. In addition, specific signals inside the mitochondrial matrix control the kinetics of ATP synthesis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> is an important activator of mitochondrial energy metabolism (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Stimulation of oxidative metabolism by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required to maintain a normal NAD(P)H/NAD(P)<sup>+</sup> ratio as demonstrated in neurons and cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In beta cells the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals closely follow cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in beta cells reduces glucose-induced respiration (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), whereas hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential is normal (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Specific buffering or suppression of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises lowers glucose-induced respiration and ATP synthesis and impairs second phase insulin secretion (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These data have established mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a critical signal for the activation of mitochondrial energy metabolism.</p><p>This Ca<sup>2+</sup> effect has been proposed to be the result of activating matrix dehydrogenases such as &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenases, and pyruvate dehydrogenase (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These dehydrogenases form the NADH, which provides electrons to complex I of the respiratory chain. Whether the activation of dehydrogenases by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is relevant for beta cell function is not clear. Preventing glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx does not appear to reduce the NAD(P)H response to glucose in this cell type (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In addition, regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not affect insulin secretion (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). It is likely that alternative mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> targets are able to activate mitochondrial energy metabolism. Several such additional mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> targets have been proposed (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), but for most part they remain elusive.</p><p>Here we have studied the mechanism resulting in enhanced energy metabolism in pancreatic beta cells during glucose stimulation. We observe a pronounced glucose-induced activation of ATP synthase-dependent respiration in INS-1E insulinoma cells and human islets. Activation of ATP synthase-dependent respiration but not the NAD(P)H response is potentiated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We propose that coordinated activation of oxidative metabolism and respiration allows Ca<sup>2+</sup> to accelerate mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis without significantly affecting steady-state NAD(P)H levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Chemicals were from Sigma, Invitrogen, or VWR unless otherwise indicated.

The excitation power of the laser was set to avoid cellular photo-damage. Data were processed with LAS AF software (Leica) and analyzed in Excel (Microsoft) and GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad). To normalize the NAD(P)H responses experiments were concluded by hydrogen peroxide addition, resulting in the almost complete loss of autofluorescence (minimal value). Data were normalized to both base line = 1 and a minimal value (hydrogen peroxide) = 0. Alternatively, rotenone was used for standardization. The complex I inhibitor increases the NAD(P)H signal to the point where autofluorescence is likely close to maximal. NAD(P)H responses were normalized as a fraction between basal (set to 0) and maximal signal after rotenone (set to 1).

In INS-1E cells the glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise was preceded by a transient reduction of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> followed by an initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overshoot before the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations reached an apparent new steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). At the single-cell levels the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to glucose were quite complex and variable (for examples see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>C&#x02013;E</italic>). At basal glucose concentrations, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were usually absent or of small amplitude.

Complex I mediates the transfer of electrons from NADH, which oxidizes the co-factor to NAD<sup>+</sup>. Blocking complex I, therefore, leads to the accumulation of reduced NADH explaining the increased autofluorescence. A similar response was observed when blocking ATP synthase with oligomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>H</italic>). Inhibition of ATP synthase slows upstream respiration and thereby NAD(P)H oxidation.

Removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> under basal glucose conditions (2.5 m<sc>m</sc>) caused an immediate small reduction of the NAD(P)H signal in INS-1E cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>). Although cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are weak under resting conditions, completely blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx appears to affect the NAD(P)H steady-state levels consistent with an impact of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Surprisingly, when raising glucose in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, NAD(P)H levels increased as rapidly as under control conditions (23.6 &#x000b1; 4.7 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>). Furthermore, although the starting level of the NAD(P)H signal was lower, the final steady-state NAD(P)H levels were not significantly different when Ca<sup>2+</sup> was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic>). Furthermore, re-addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> after glucose stimulation in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium did not further increase the NAD(P)H steady-state level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>G</italic>). This lack of calcium dependence was surprising especially given the striking Ca<sup>2+</sup> effect on respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). To better quantify the observed NAD(P)H responses to glucose, we used an alternative calibration strategy. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>E</italic>, rotenone, which blocks complex I, increased the NAD(P)H signal to the point where autofluorescence was likely close to maximal. Rotenone was chosen over other inhibitors of the respiratory chain (oligomycin or cyanide) as it gave the most robust and reproducible increase of NAD(P)H signals in INS-1E cells (data not shown). Using this calibration, NAD(P)H responses were expressed as a fraction between basal (set to 0) and maximal signal after rotenone (set to 1). Glucose stimulation of INS-1E cells raised the NAD(P)H signal to 0.53 of maximal. When removing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> the NAD(P)H signal decreased below basal but reached levels not significantly different from the control after glucose stimulation (0.56). We conclude that steady-state NAD(P)H levels are mainly determined by the prevailing stimulatory glucose concentration with little further influence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p>In human islets we failed to assess the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal by EGTA. Islets NAD(P)H signals became unstable possibly due to altered binding of the islet to the matrix-coated glass coverslips when Ca<sup>2+</sup> was chelated. We, therefore, used a combination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers isradipine, &#x003c9;-agatoxin. and NNC 55-0396, which were shown previously to almost completely prevent voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in human beta cells (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The efficacy of these inhibitors to block Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was tested in human islets expressing the calcium probe YC3.6 specifically in beta cells. In combination, isradipine, &#x003c9;-agatoxin, and NNC 55-0396 ended glucose-induced transients and lowered the cytosolic calcium to basal concentrations before glucose stimulation within 1&#x02013;5 min after their addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>D</italic>). By blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx the three inhibitors also prevented glucose-induced insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>F</italic>). In addition, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers reduced the NAD(P)H signal in human islets when incubated under resting glucose conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>), similar to the effect of removing extracellular calcium from INS-1E cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>). After stimulation with 16.7 m<sc>m</sc> glucose, NAD(P)H levels increased rapidly whether or not the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inhibitors were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>). Furthermore, the steady-state NAD(P)H signals reached after glucose (16.7 m<sc>m</sc>) stimulation were similar when the islets were pretreated with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C</italic>). We cannot, however, exclude possible smaller differences as net NAD(P)H increases varied strongly between individual islets. To address this issue, we stimulated human islets with glucose first to add the inhibitors of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels once the NAD(P)H signal had already reached a new steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>E</italic>). Under these conditions, blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx had little or no effect on the NAD(P)H signal. We conclude that the glucose-induced NAD(P)H levels in beta cells in contrast to the respiratory rate is not strongly influenced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Mitochondria are able to adjust their ATP synthesis to the energy requirement of the cell. Depending on the biological process, such adjustments must be rapid to avoid a drop of the phosphorylation potential. The mechanisms underlying such control of oxidative phosphorylation remain poorly understood. Early work with isolated mitochondria suggested that mitochondria mainly work on demand, enhancing respiration as a response to an increase in extramitochondrial ADP. In several cell types this control mechanism is not likely of relevance as it was shown that during physiological cell activation the phosphorylation potential does not decrease, and ADP levels are not elevated (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In the pancreatic beta cell, after nutrient stimulation the phosphorylation potential is even elevated despite an augmented energy demand (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). We have obtained similar results measuring ATP and ADP after glucose stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Glucose causes a small increase of cellular ATP associated with a marked reduction of ADP. This decrease in ADP was measured after 30 min of glucose stimulation, a time when respiration rates are clearly stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). It is, therefore, unlikely that the ADP concentration is the sole regulator of mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis in INS-1E cells.</p><p>The observed changes in ATP and ADP are essential for the beta cell to inhibit the <italic>K</italic><sub>ATP</sub> channel, which initiates the downstream events leading to insulin secretion. This may be accomplished through the increased provision of nutrient-derived metabolites for mitochondrial metabolism. The term &#x0201c;glucose push&#x0201d; has been coined to describe this initial activation of beta cell mitochondria by glycolysis-derived pyruvate (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Glucose push provides more pyruvate for oxidative metabolism and may augment the concentration of TCA cycle intermediates via anaplerosis (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). This push mechanism is likely also responsible for the close relationship between NAD(P)H and the glucose concentration. Both raising and lowering the glucose concentration was followed within seconds by respective changes in NAD(P)H autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>B</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, and <italic>F</italic>). These results point to a special characteristic of beta cell energy metabolism. Rapid NADH provision for respiration is able to accelerate respiration over a very short time-course, which is achieved despite decreasing ADP levels. This tight link between glucose concentration and NAD(P)H may allow the beta cell to rapidly increase the ATP/ADP ratio necessary to induce electrical activity. Here we have studied the activation of beta cell mitochondria during glucose stimulation focusing on oxidative metabolism (following the NAD(P)H autofluorescence signal) and ATP synthase (oligomycin)-dependent respiration. Respiration is essential to maintain beta cell secretory activity. Inhibiting respiratory chain complexes blocks glucose-induced insulin secretion (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we observe that inhibition of respiration either with a combination of rotenone plus antimycin A or specifically by inhibiting ATP synthase with oligomycin rapidly ended cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in INS-1E cells and human islets. Unlike rotenone and antimycin A, oligomycin hyperpolarizes the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and only partially inhibits respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Nevertheless, oligomycin was able to end cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients over a very short time-frame (2&#x02013;3 min) similar to the combination of the complex I and III inhibitor. Glucose-induced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were also suppressed when blocking ATP synthesis in INS-1E cells. The driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into mitochondria is normal or even elevated as inhibition of ATP synthase by oligomycin hyperpolarizes the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Likely, the loss of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is the secondary consequence of impaired cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p>Our results underline the importance of continuous mitochondrial ATP synthesis to maintain beta cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. This close correlation suggests that short-lasting fluctuations in mitochondrial activity may contribute to the formation of calcium oscillations and thereby pulsatile insulin secretion.</p><p>Respiration is required to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix to maintain the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient. Proton entry through the ATP synthase drives ATP synthesis. In most cell types the fraction of ATP synthase-dependent (oligomycin-sensitive) respiration is the main component of mitochondrial respiration (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Our dissection of total mitochondrial respiration in an oligomycin-dependent and -independent component reveals that under resting glucose conditions ATP synthase-dependent respiration is low. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that under resting conditions mitochondrial ATP synthesis must be prevented to avoid a rise in the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio that would otherwise result in inappropriate insulin secretion (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with our data, prominent uncoupling has previously been observed in INS-1E cells (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) as well as mouse and human islets (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Both studies conclude that there is a large proton leak in beta cell mitochondria. This interpretation is consistent with the current literature where uncoupling has become close to synonymous with the futile cycle of protons such as observed during thermogenesis. We would like to stress, however, that the here-observed respiration occurring uncoupled from ATP synthesis is likely to drive other energy consuming processes that are as important to mitochondrial function as ATP synthesis itself. ATP synthase-independent respiration is required to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix to maintain the electrochemical gradient balancing the continuous activity of electrogenic transport processes across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Such energy-consuming transport steps are for instance the net export of negatively charged metabolites or the uptake of positively charged ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The high rates of uncoupling (depolarizing) may also help beta cells to maintain a normal membrane potential despite inhibition of ATP synthase (hyperpolarizing effect) under resting glucose conditions. Uncoupling slows ATP synthesis and, therefore, helps to prevent electrical activity in resting beta cells. Why this is mechanism is further exaggerated in INS-1E cells is not clear.</p><p>Glucose stimulation caused a marked acceleration of respiration in INS-1E cells consistent with earlier reports (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). We show that this increase is almost exclusively due to the activation of ATP synthase-dependent respiration. In contrast, oligomycin-insensitive respiration was only slightly increased after glucose stimulation. Qualitatively similar results were observed in human islets. Glucose caused a 2.1-fold increase of ATP synthase-dependent respiration without affecting oligomycin-insensitive respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>After the stimulation of beta cells, both the electrical and chemical component of the mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing the driving force on the ATP synthase (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). This may explain the observed accelerated respiration. Alternatively, mitochondrial respiration may be under kinetic control. The latter mechanism plays an important role for instance in cardiomyocytes by enhancing ATP synthase activity during cell stimulation (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). We speculate that the prevailing glucose concentration affects mitochondrial respiration by a similar mechanism controlling ATP synthase activity or another rate-limiting step of mitochondrial respiration.</p><p>Mitochondrial activation depends on mitochondrial matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>signals have been proposed to act mainly through the stimulation of matrix dehydrogenases (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). To address this, we have studied the kinetics of oxidative metabolism via NAD(P)H autofluorescence in INS-1E cells and human islets. Glucose stimulation results in a rapid increase in total NAD(P)H fluorescence. Interestingly, removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which prevents glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, did not affect the rate of the glucose-induced NAD(P)H rise. To block Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in human islets, we used a combination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In the presence of L-, P/Q-, and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers, depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in human islets beta cells was completely suppressed. In contrast, the rapid glucose-induced rise of NAD(P)H was unaffected. These results are further supported by kinetic data, which show that the NAD(P)H rise precedes the glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) consistent with earlier findings (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We propose that the observed increase of the NAD(P)H signal is principally due to the increased provision of glucose-derived pyruvate for mitochondrial metabolism. Preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling did, however, cause a small reduction of the steady-state levels of NAD(P)H in resting beta cells consistent with the possibility that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals do have an impact on the NAD(P)H redox balance when substrate levels are limiting. Taken together our findings demonstrate that the initial activation of beta cell mitochondria by glucose drives NAD(P)H formation without a need for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p>In contrast, the glucose-induced respiratory response was almost completely suppressed when Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were prevented both in INS-1E cells and human islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref><italic>C</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref><italic>B</italic>). Also, from a kinetic point of view, NAD(P)H and respiratory responses were clearly distinct. After the rapid glucose-induced response, the NAD(P)H signal remained elevated as long as the stimulatory glucose concentrations was maintained. Respiration augments rapidly early after glucose stimulation and continues to increase at later time points when NAD(P)H has already reached a new steady state.</p><p>Based on these kinetic data we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>) of coordinated regulation of oxidative metabolism (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dehydrogenases) and respiration (rate-limiting complex of the respiratory chain or ATP synthase). The initial rapid NAD(P)H increase depends on glucose push. After this early response, Ca<sup>2+</sup> continuously activates dehydrogenases to maintain NAD(P)H at this elevated level. Although the dehydrogenases produce more NADH per time during this second phase, no further net increase of the NAD(P)H signal was observed. This is due to the accelerated respiratory chain activity, which assures rapid re-oxidation. Such coordinated activation of dehydrogenases and oxidative phosphorylation allows a net increase in respiration without further affecting the NAD(P)H/NAD(P)<sup>+</sup> ratio. Our population experiments do not exclude the possibility that at the single cell level there are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent NAD(P)H transients as observed in a number of cell types previously (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In our hands the NAD(P)H signal was not sufficiently strong to perform such single cell analysis.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed model for the coordinated regulation of oxidative metabolism and ATP synthase dependent respiration by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in pancreatic beta cells.</bold> After glucose stimulation NAD(P)H levels rapidly increase (<italic>1</italic>). Continued selective activation of oxidative metabolism would further increase the NAD(P)H/NAD(P)<sup>+</sup> ratio (<italic>3</italic>). Activation of ATP synthase-dependent respiration without stimulation of oxidative metabolism should lower the NAD(P)H levels (<italic>2</italic>). Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals cause a coordinated activation of oxidative metabolism and ATP synthase-dependent respiration. Rapid establishment of a new NAD(P)H steady state despite continued Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of mitochondrial respiration/energy metabolism (experimentally observed in this study) is shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0181480960008"/></fig><p>Fitting with our working model, the NAD(P)H levels observed after glucose stimulation were in an equilibrium that could be shifted to a more oxidized or reduced state. Removal of substrate rapidly lowered the NAD(P)H signal, whereas inhibition of respiration with either rotenone or oligomycin caused a rapid increase of the NAD(P)H autofluorescence. Coordinated regulation of NAD(P)H formation and oxidation implies that Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates oxidative metabolism as well as respiration. This is in agreement with earlier studies using isolated mitochondria that observed pronounced activation of respiration by Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent of its effect on oxidative metabolism (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).</p><p>The present study finds that ATP synthase-dependent respiration is small in resting beta cells and increases markedly after glucose stimulation. In addition, glucose increases NAD(P)H levels by providing elevated concentrations of the mitochondrial substrate pyruvate. Subsequently, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling linked to cell activation is required to increase ATP synthase-dependent respiration for full activation of beta cell mitochondria. This activation occurs gradually over 12&#x02013;18 min in human islets during which oxidative metabolism and respiration are increased in a coordinated manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). As a result, ATP synthase-dependent respiration accelerated markedly without any further change in NAD(P)H. The molecular mechanisms allowing mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to stimulate respiration and ATP synthase activity remain to be identified.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="FN2"><label>3</label><p>The abbreviations used are:
