<bold><italic>2</italic></bold>: <italic>323&#x02013;31</italic>&#x02014;In table 1 of this Article (published Online First on March 10, 2015), values for the number of individuals of different genders have been corrected for schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and mixed depression. In the last paragraph of the Results, the third sentence should have read &#x0201c;We detected no significant associations between gender and subgroup, and only three codes were significantly associated: paranoia was more likely in men (p=0&#x000b7;036), while childhood onset (p=0&#x000b7;001) and structured longitudinal change (p=0&#x000b7;039) was more likely in women.&#x0201d; Additionally, the fourth sentence of the ninth paragraph in the Discussion should have read &#x0201c;When we analysed gender effects in our data, we detected differences for only three codes: paranoia (which was more likely in men), childhood onset, and structured longitudinal change (which were both more likely in women than in men).&#x0201d; The online version has been corrected as of April 2, 2015.</p></body></article>
