Due to increasing environmental endocrine interfering agents in food and food package, the number of patients referred to pediatric endocrinology clinics for the evaluation of early pubertal signs is rising in recent years in China.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The disease is heterogeneous; it may take the form of central precocious puberty (CPP), premature thelarge, premature puberche, or premature menarche. The latter 3 forms are isolated precocious puberty (IPP). CPP is associated with premature activation of the hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> It can lead to a compromised final adult height because of accelerated bone maturation.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Therefore timely treatment with GnRH agonist to suppress the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;ovarian axis is important.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> IPPs on the other hand are not associated with early epiphyseal closure and do not require therapy, but may mimic the early symptoms of CPPs and cause diagnostic difficulties.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Although GnRH-stimulation test is considered the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; for differentiating IPP from CPP, and despite its high specificity, its sensitivity is relatively low, because occasionally IPP will progress into CPP in later times.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Moreover, there is disagreement as to the criteria for interpretation.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Considering pelvic ultrasound examination of the internal genitalia is rapid and non-invasive, it is important to explore its role in diagnosis and differentiation of various precocity forms. Although similar studies have been performed in western countries,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> a few are reported about Chinese girls. This study aims to investigate the distribution of pelvic ultrasound parameters among Chinese girls and to assess the diagnostic and discriminating ability about precocity, and to establish reliable cutoff limits.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Cases and controls</title><p>Our study invited girls visiting the Pediatric Endocrine Outpatient Clinic of the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University between January 2008 and December 2010 for examination of signs of precocious puberty, which include appearance or history of appearance of breast development and/or pubic hair before 8 years, or menarche before 10 years. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Hebei Medical University. A written informed parental consent was obtained in all cases. All the girls were physically assessed with regard to their breast and pubic hair development according to Tanner staging<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> by HF Zhang. Briefly, Tanner staging for breast is, stage I: no glandular tissue, areola follows the skin contours of the chest (prepubertal); stage II: breast bud forms, with small area of surrounding glandular tissue, areola begins to widen; stage III: breast begins to become more elevated, and extends beyond the borders of the areola, which continues to widen but remains in contour with surrounding breast; stage IV: increased breast size and elevation, areola and papilla form a secondary mound projecting from the contour of the surrounding breast; stage V: breast reaches final adult size, areola returns to contour of the surrounding breast, with a projecting central papilla. For pubic hair, stage I: no pubic hair at all (prepubertal); stage II: small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation on the labia majora (females); stage III: hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally (11.5&#x02013;13); stage IV: adult&#x02013;like hair quality, extending across pubis but sparing medial thighs; stage V: hair extends to medial surface of the thighs. Height measurements were made with the use of a commercial stadiometer and height velocity, evaluated on a minimum of a 6-month period, was calculated. Bone age was assessed by radiographs of the left hand and wrist as described by Greulich and Pyle.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Basal levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol, and GnRH-stimulated LH and FSH levels were evaluated using commercial radio-immuno assays. The GnRH-stimulation test was performed by injecting GnRH at a dose of 2.5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg intravenously before measuring LH and FSH 30 and 60&#x0200a;minutes later. The result of the test was considered &#x02018;pubertal&#x02019; if the ratio of peak LH versus peak FSH was &#x02265;0.6 or peak LH was &#x02265;3.3 to 5.0&#x0200a;IU/L.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>Premature thelarche was diagnosed by the appearance of breast development before 8 years old, bone age within mean chronological age &#x000b1; 2 standard deviation (SD), prepubertal height velocity &#x0003c;6&#x0200a;cm/year and prepubertal response to the GnRH test. Premature pubarche was diagnosed by the appearance of pubic hair and/or axillary hair before 8 years old, bone age within mean chronological age &#x000b1; 2 SD, prepubertal height velocity &#x0003c;6&#x0200a;cm/year and prepubertal response to the GnRH test. Premature menarche was diagnosed by the appearance of menarche before 10 years old, bone age within mean chronological age &#x000b1; 2 SD, prepubertal height velocity &#x0003c;6&#x0200a;cm/year and prepubertal response to the GnRH test. Lastly, CPP was diagnosed by the appearance of breast buds before 8 years old, and accompanied by 1 or more in below: accelerated bone age (&#x02265;mean chronological age&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;2 SD), accelerated height velocity (&#x02265;6&#x0200a;cm/year), pubic and/or axillary hair or menses, and was confirmed by pubertal response to GnRH testing. Magnetic resonance imaging of the hypophyseal&#x02013; hypothalamic area was done in every so diagnosed CPP patient to exclude central nervous system abnormality. All patients diagnosed with isolated premature pubarche accepted adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test to exclude congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</p><p>Transabdominal pelvic ultrasound scans were performed by XW and HZ in all girls before the commencement of any kind of hormonal therapy. A Philips P700 ultrasound set (Philips Medical Systems Inc., Bothell, WA) equipped with a 5-MHz convex-array broad-band transducer and a 7.5-MHz linear-array small parts transducer was used. Drinking water was prescribed to all girls to produce a full bladder to serve as an acoustic window through which the pelvic internal genitalia were examined. Parameters of the uterine, cervix, and ovaries include length, width, thickness, volume (ellipsoid volume: V (cm<sup>3</sup>)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;length (cm)&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;width (cm)&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;thickness (cm)&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;0.5236), and fundal/cervical thickness ratio, endometrial thickness, and averaged maximal diameter of the largest follicle.</p><p>One hundred and thirty-one girls with different forms of precocious puberty (59 with premature thelarche/ pubarche, 25 with premature menarche, and 47 with CPP) were enrolled in the study. All cases were followed-up for at least 2-years to confirm the diagnosis. Girls with non-idiopathic sexual precocity were excluded from the study. Additionally, 177 normal prepubertal girls aged 0 to 10 years were recruited from primary schools in Shijiazhuang city. This control group were examined concurrently by the same physician and ultrasound doctors, and served as a control group. The age range (minimum-maximum) for CPP, IPP, and controls was 1.7 to 9.9, 2.8 to 9.7, and 4.2 to 10.0 years, respectively. To control the cofounding effect of age, comparison of ultrasound measurements between CPP, IPP, and normal girls were restricted within 0 to 6, &#x0003e;6 to 8, and &#x0003e;8 to 10 years intervals (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Age and height of the studied groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e0092-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis and graphic presentation were performed using the statistics package for social studies (SPSS) for Windows software (IBM SPSS Software V20.0 statistical package).

The maximum diameter of the largest follicle was measurable in both ovaries in 74.03% (228/308). Endometrial echo was visualized in 37.33% (115/308), and the endometrial thickness was measured in 33.12% (102/308). Measurability of the internal genitalia increases with increasing age. In the 0 to 6 years age interval, only 3 CPP cases were available, and cervix and endometrial echo was identified in only 1 case, therefore evaluation of the role of pelvic examination in this age interval was impossible. In the &#x0003e;6 to 8 years and &#x0003e;8 to 10 years age intervals, all sonographic parameters were evaluated.</p><p>As measurements of length, width, thickness, and volumes of the right and the left ovary did not differ significantly in individual subjects [eg, the mean disparity&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;SD for ovarian volume was 0.315&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;2.02&#x0200a;cm<sup>3</sup>; 95% confidence interval (CI) was &#x02212;0.514 to +0.681], the average value of both ovaries (right ovary + left ovary)/2 was calculated and used in analysis.</p><p>Because all comparison of sonographic parameters between various groups were made in an age-restricted manner, premature thelarge, premature pubarche, and premature menarche cases were combined into 1 IPP group in the final analysis to overcome sample size scarcity.</p><p>There was no significant difference in height between either 2 among IPP, CPP, and normal controls, in any age intervals, except in the &#x0003e;6 to 8 years age interval, in which CPP cases were significantly higher than either IPP or the normal controls (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.01) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>The pelvic ultrasonographic measurements of the length, width, thickness, and volume of uterine/cervix/ovary all increase as the chronological age increases, but the increase is slow and small until the age of 8 years old. After that, all the parameters increase significantly. As a result, none of the pelvic sonographic parameters was significantly different between 0-6 years and &#x0003e;6 to 8 years, but all parameters in the &#x0003e;8 to 10 years interval were significantly higher than either the 0 to 6 years or &#x0003e;6 to 8 years old (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of length, width, thickness, and volume of the uterine, uterine cervix, ovary, and thickness of the endometrium between patient with central precocious puberty, premature thelarge/pubache/menarche, and normal controls by the age groups of 0&#x02013;6 years, &#x02265;6&#x02013;8 years, and &#x02265;8&#x02013;10 years.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e0092-g002"/></table-wrap></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Significant parameters found between CPP, IPP, and normal girls and the best discriminating parameter according to ROC curve analysis</title><p>Of the totally 15 ultrasound parameters, 10 and 12 were significantly elevated in CPP cases as compared to normal controls in the &#x0003e;6 to 8 or the &#x0003e;8 to 10 age interval, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). These parameters were potentially valuable for differentiating between CPP and normal controls. The number of significantly different variables between IPP and normal controls in the 0 to 6, &#x0003e;6 to 8, and &#x0003e;8 to 10 years age intervals was 4, 7, and 5, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>To diagnose CPP from normal controls in the &#x0003e;6 to 8 years age interval, significant variables consist of ovarian width, thickness, volume, cervical width, thickness, volume, and uterine length, width, thickness, volume (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

For instance, though measurements of the ovary are significantly higher in either IPP or CPP cases as compared to normal controls, these parameters are not significantly higher in CPP than in IPP, and do not discriminate between them [Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> (G&#x02013;I) and 2]. As the exact opposite, cervix length, width, uterine length, endometrial thickness, and the averaged maximal diameter of largest follicle are significantly higher in CPP than in both IPP and normal controls, but these parameters are not significantly higher in IPP than in normal controls.

As reflected in the results of ROC analyses, the best discriminating parameter between IPP and normal controls in the 0 to 6, &#x0003e;6 to 8, and &#x0003e;8 to 10 years age interval was ovarian thickness, width, and cervical thickness, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>), but that between CPP and normal control in the &#x0003e;6 to 8 and &#x0003e;8 to 10 years age interval was cervical thickness and endometrial thickness (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Since IPP can be occasionally regarded as an early stage of CPP, it may be postulated that ovarian measurements are more sensitive to estrogen stimulation and may have increased significantly at IPP stage, and remained at the high level thereafter, whereas cervical thickness or endometrial thickness may have increased significantly only when IPP progresses into CPP. This assumption is supported by the fact that although both CPP and IPP exhibit statistically significantly elevated ultrasound parameters than normal controls, the significantly elevated parameters are different. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> depicts these significantly increased parameters: from between IPP and normal control to between CPP and normal control, as the age interval increases, more and more parameters of internal genitalia become significantly different: firstly between IPP and normal, in the 0 to 6 years age interval, significantly difference was observed only with ovarian parameters (width, thickness, volume) and uterine thickness, but in the &#x0003e;6 to 8 age interval, uterine width, volume, cervical thickness were added as significant parameters; secondly between CPP and normal control, significant differences were found in 10 measurements of ovaries/uterine/cervix in the &#x0003e;6 to 8 years age interval, and in the &#x0003e;8 to 10 years age interval, endometrial thickness and the averaged maximal diameter of largest follicle also became significantly different. All these seem to suggest enlargement of internal genitalia occurs gradually in the order of ovary, uterine and cervix in CPP development. In IPP cases, ovarian width, thickness, volume, uterine wide, thickness, volume, and cervical thickness may be significantly elevated, but cervical length, width, uterine length, endometrial thickness, and the averaged maximal diameter of largest follicle are not significantly higher yet, these second group of parameters become significantly higher only with CPP cases, and these parameters are significantly different between CPP and IPP cases.</p><p>The variables of endometrial thickness and the averaged maximal diameter of largest follicle are measurable only in the &#x0003e;8 to 10 age interval and they are significantly different between CPP and control or between CPP and IPP, but not between IPP and normal controls. Therefore they are candidate parameters for discrimination between CPP and normal or between CPP and IPP only in the &#x0003e;8 to 10 age interval [Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> (D, E) and 2].</p><p>In summary of the value of separate best parameters as shown in red color in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, cervix thickness was the best parameter for discriminating CPP from controls in the &#x0003e;6 to 8 years age interval, a cutoff of 0.73&#x0200a;cm had a sensitivity of 93.30% and a specificity of 85.70% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In the &#x0003e;8 to 10 year interval, it was the second most efficient parameter (next only to endometrial thickness), a cutoff of 1.11&#x0200a;cm had a sensitivity of 68.75% and a specificity of 92.63% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In addition, cervix thickness was also the most efficient parameter to identify IPP from normal controls in the &#x0003e;8 to 10 years age interval, a cutoff of 0.75&#x0200a;cm had a sensitivity of 90.48% and a specificity of 64.21% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).</p><p>Endometrial thickness was the best parameter for discriminating CPP from normal girls and the second best parameter for discriminating CPP from IPP, both in the 8 to 10 years interval. In the first case, a cutoff of 0.26&#x0200a;cm had a sensitivity of 76.92% and specificity of 100% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), and in the second case, a cutoff of 0.26&#x0200a;cm had a sensitivity of 76.92% and a specificity of 94.44% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>).</p><p>Cervix length was the best parameter for discriminating CPP from IPP cases in both &#x0003e;6 to 8 years and &#x0003e;8 to 10 years age intervals, the cutoff, sensitivity and specificity was 1.49&#x0200a;cm, 93.33%, 55.17% and 1.88&#x0200a;cm, 100%, 71.43%, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>).</p><p>The averaged ovarian thickness and width was the best parameter for differentiating between IPP and normal controls in the 0 to 6, &#x0003e;6 to 8 years interval respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). But for the differentiation between CPP and controls, ovarian measurements are inferior to cervix thickness in the &#x0003e;6 to 8 years interval, or are inferior to endometrial thickness in the &#x0003e;8 to 10 years interval. Because no ovarian measurement was significant different between CPP and IPP cases, these parameters could not be used to differentiate between CPP and IPP cases.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Criteria for the diagnosis of CPP by GnRH stimulation test have been non-consistent; an LH peak &#x02265;25&#x0200a;IU/L or an LH peak/FSH peak &#x02265;1 is considered to be a pubertal response to GnRH stimulation by Palmert et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> whereas the criteria set by the Chinese Ministry of Health, possibly to cover ethnic variation, was an LH peak &#x02265;3.3 to 5.0&#x0200a;IU/L or an LH peak/FSH peak &#x02265;0.6.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> In present study, we used the relatively looser criteria by the Chinese Ministry of Health to reduce the rate of false negativity, and we followed IPP cases for at least 2 years to reclassify the 4 cases who had showed a prepubertal response to the GnRH stimulation test at diagnosis but progressed to CPP during follow-up.</p><p>Because ultrasonographic measurements of internal genitalia increase with age, to facilitate comparisons, we analyzed the difference in ultrasound parameters between CPP, IPP, and controls according to age range, and calculated cutoff limits for each subgroup separately.</p><p>Previous studies in western countries often found ovary volume having the highest discriminating power for the identification of CPP patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> In present study of Chinese girls, ovary volume was one of the significant parameters in discriminating between CPP and control, but was not the best parameter. Instead we found cervical thickness, volume, uterine volume were the most 3 efficient parameters for the &#x0003e;6 to 8 years, and endometrial thickness, uterine volume, and cervical thickness were the 3 most powerful parameters for the &#x0003e;8 to 10 years old (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). These results suggest the best sonographic parameter and its &#x02018;optimal cutoff value may change according to populations. However, a similar study with a larger sample size performed in Israel reported a similar finding as us. They found that uterine volume is one of the most efficient parameter for both predicting CPP and distinguishing between CPP and premature thelarche.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>Early studies reported fundal/cervical ratio is significantly higher in CPP than in normal controls and is a significant discriminating parameter,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> but in our study, because CPP cases had both significantly increased fundal and cervical thickness than the normal controls, and the increase in cervical thickness is even larger, therefore the CPP cases had a somehow identical or even lower fundal/cervical ratio than the controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, J).</p><p>Badouraki et al<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> reported uterine length was the best parameter for distinguishing between CPP and premature thelarche cases, a cutoff of 3.19&#x0200a;cm and of 3.83&#x0200a;cm gave sensitivities of 85.7 and 82.4% and specificities of 91.7 and 90.9% for the 0 to 6 and <italic>&#x0003e;</italic>6 to 8 years age intervals, respectively. In our study, uterine length is the third most efficient parameter for distinguishing between CPP and IPP for the &#x0003e;8 to 10 years age interval, a cutoff of 2.45&#x0200a;cm gave a sensitivity of 84.21 and specificity of 88.00%. Instead of uterine length, we found cervix length is the best parameter for discriminating between CPP and IPP in both &#x0003e;6 to 8 and &#x0003e;8 to 10 years age intervals, a cutoff of 1.49&#x0200a;cm had a sensitivity of 93.33% and a specificity of 55.17%, and a cutoff of 1.88&#x0200a;cm carried a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 71.43%, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). In addition to cervix length, cervix width was also a useful parameter in the &#x0003e;6 to 8 years age interval, and uterine length, volume, endometrial thickness, and averaged maximal diameter of largest follicle were significant parameters in the &#x0003e;8 to 10 years age interval (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). Because early discrimination between CPP and IPP is imperative before GnRH agonist treatment, and satisfactory treatment depends upon early differentiation, these new differentiating sonographic parameters found in Chinese girls deserve to be further explored.</p><p>In present study, we performed pelvic sonographic examination at the time of clinical examinations and gonadotropin-releasing hormone-stimulation test by which the diagnosis of IPP or CPP was established. At this moment, measurements of the internal genitalia actually provide cross-sectional information on ovary, uterine, cervix associated with IPP and CPP in the natural history of CPP. Comparison of such sonographic data provides a glimpse of sex organs development in the course of CPP. In this way, we found ovarian measurements are significantly higher in IPP than in normal controls, but are not significantly higher in CPP than in IPP cases. As the exact opposite, cervical length, width, uterine length, endometrial thickness, and average maximum diameter of largest follicle are significantly elevated only in CPP cases. These parameters are significantly higher in CPP than in IPP cases, and can be utilized to distinguish between CPP and IPP cases. From these, we postulate that ovarian parameters are sensitive to hormonal stimulation and increase significantly at the early (isolated) stage, whereas cervical length, width, uterine length, endometrial thickness, and average maximum diameter of largest follicle do not increase significantly until at the CPP stage.</p><p>Our study is limited by a relative small sample size. There were only 47 CPP cases participated in the study. The number of CPP patient at age range 0 to 6 years (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3) is too small for any meaningful analysis. Another limitation may be related to the retrospective nature of study design. The significant differences in ultrasonographic parameters found between CPP, IPP, and normal controls may be caused by some confounding factors than precocious puberty. Therefore the diagnostic value is limited. However, this does not prevent ultrasound from being considered as a complimentary noninvasive method.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our results suggest ultrasound pelvic examination could serve as a complementary tool for the differentiation of CPP, IPP, and normal Chinese girls, but the efficacy changes according to disease stage and age intervals. Our study is the first to note the significant discriminating power associated with cervical parameters in Chinese girls, but need to be confirmed by others.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval, CPP = central precocious puberty, FSH = follicle-stimulating hormone, GnRH = gonadotropin-releasing hormone, IPP = isolated precocious puberty, LH = luteinizing hormone, ROC = receiver operating characteristic, SD = standard deviation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>XDW and DGW contributed equally to the work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work is supported by Subject of Medical Technology Follow-up in Hebei Province: Pelvic Ultrasound in Surveillance of the Function of Musculi of Pelvic Base (No. G2015039).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>XD</given-names></name><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>LH</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
