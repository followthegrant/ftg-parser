To guide eye movements, often information from the visual periphery is used. Crowding is known to deteriorate the quality of peripheral information. In four search experiments, we studied the role of crowding, by accompanying individual search elements by flankers. Varying the difference between target and flankers allowed us to manipulate crowding strength throughout the stimulus. We found that eye movements are biased toward areas with little crowding for conditions where a target could be discriminated peripherally. Interestingly, for conditions in which the target could not be discriminated peripherally, this bias reversed to areas with strong crowding. This led to shorter search times for a target presented in areas with stronger crowding, compared to a target presented in areas with less crowding. These findings suggest a dual role for crowding in visual search. The presence of flankers similar to the target deteriorates the quality of the peripheral target signal but can also attract eye movements, as more potential targets are present over the area.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Visual search</kwd><kwd>Crowding</kwd><kwd>Saccadic selection</kwd><kwd>Potential targets</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>A visual scene often consists of multiple objects. Finding an object in such a scene can vary in difficulty. When the object we are looking for is conspicuous, it can be discriminated peripherally without making a saccade (e.g., Wertheim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>). However, the limited resolution of our visual periphery often requires us to make eye movements to locate and inspect the objects (e.g., Yarbus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1967</xref>). Even though visual information from the periphery is often too sparse to identify targets, it is generally good enough to select candidates resembling the target for further inspection (saccadic selection). We refer to these candidates as <italic>potential targets</italic> for eye movements. After selection, a saccade to the next element is made, and foveal inspection may reveal a target. This process continues until the target is found or, when no target is present, the whole display has been inspected. Throughout many different saccadic search tasks where eye movements were measured, the nature of potential targets was studied (e.g., Findlay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1997</xref>; Hooge and Erkelens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1999</xref>; Motter and Belky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>; McSorley and Findlay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>). It was shown for example that color and shape are potent in limiting the set of potential targets (Luria and Strauss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1975</xref>). This results in more efficient search, as fewer elements have to be inspected. A large body of research has been devoted to guidance in search, relating stimulus properties to search efficiency. We now know that search for a target defined by a combination of two features is inefficient, as these features are not automatically combined in the periphery (Treisman and Gelade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1980</xref>). Also, decreasing target-distractor dissimilarity slows search (Duncan and Humphreys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1989</xref>). Emphasizing the ability to guide search, Bacon and Egeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1997</xref>) showed observers informed on the frequency of different distractor types could weigh selection toward particular target features. A comprehensive overview of many stimulus properties influencing search efficiency can be found in <italic>Guided Search 4.0</italic> by Wolfe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>).</p><p>Many models of visual search assume that features of elements in the periphery are available (e.g., Avraham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>; Wolfe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>). However, elements near each other in the periphery impair the ability to detect properties of those elements, a phenomenon known as crowding (e.g., Bouma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1970</xref>; Toet and Levi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1992</xref>). In saccadic search, the presence of flankers around search elements deteriorates search performance (Vlaskamp and Hooge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>). These authors suggest that crowding rather than decreasing retinal resolution is the bottleneck in visual search. However, from this study, it is not clear whether crowding affected saccadic selection or peripheral target discrimination. Recent studies on eye movements in complex search tasks find saliency to be an important factor in saccadic selection, regardless of the properties of the target. Neider and Zelinsky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>) varied target-background similarity and found a bias in saccadic selection. Salient patterns segmented from the background were fixated more frequently than target-similar unsegmented regions of the background. Furthermore, in a study using rhesus monkeys, Shen and Pare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>) found an inverse relation between the proportion of target-colored elements in the stimulus and the proportion of initial eye movements landing on them. Hence, initial eye movements were biased to elements of the color least present in the stimulus, those most likely to be salient. These findings are in contrast to saccadic selection being biased toward elements sharing features of the target, which has been found in eye movement studies with elements placed on a blank background. However, the inverse relation found in Shen and Pare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>) concerns the initial eye movement, which is more likely to be captured by a salient element than subsequent eye movements (Findlay and Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2006</xref>). Also, in daily life, the distinction between objects and background is often not as clear as in Neider and Zelinsky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>), and scenes can be cluttered with elements similar and dissimilar to the target. The target might be found among either of these. How is the search for the target executed in such complex scenes? In the present study, we investigate how different crowding conditions affect eye movement strategies. The crowding conditions were achieved by manipulating both target and flankers.</p><p>Before hypothesizing about the effect of crowding on saccadic selection, it is important to know the properties of crowding. Crowding has extensively been studied in many psychophysical experiments. Its main properties can be summarized in three empirical laws. Most important to us is that flankers more similar to the target increase crowding (Nazir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1992</xref>; Kooi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1994</xref>). Furthermore, crowding also increases when flankers are closer to the peripheral target (e.g., Toet and Levi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1992</xref>). Finally, crowding is stronger when a target, together with flankers, is located further in the visual periphery (see e.g., Bouma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1970</xref>; Butler and Currie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1986</xref>; Polat and Sagi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1993</xref>; Huckauf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>).</p><p>To generalize the effects of crowding from peripheral identification tasks to saccadic search is potentially problematic because both peripheral target discrimination and saccadic selection may be affected by crowding. Observers may adopt different eye movement strategies depending on the quality of peripheral visual information. Imagine a stimulus consisting of one target and many search elements, some of the search elements resemble the target and some do not. Throughout this stimulus, search elements are non-uniformly distributed over the display, resulting in a display with areas over which crowding varies. As stated above, the target can be found by: (1) peripheral target discrimination or (2) saccadic selection followed by foveal discrimination. We start by focusing on peripheral target discrimination. How is a target found in an area containing many elements not resembling the target? In such an area, a target can often be discriminated peripherally (target fixation is not required for target discrimination), because here peripheral discrimination does not suffer from crowding. In contrast, in an area where different distractors resemble the target, peripheral target discrimination is often not possible and the efficiency of search depends on saccadic selection. Even though crowding deteriorates the quality of peripheral information in this situation, crowding is not taken into account into current models of visual search. Furthermore, much of the guidance literature investigates search efficiency, rather than saccadic selection. Therefore, it cannot show what attracts eye movements, while eye movements can reveal search processes that are not clear from manual reaction times analysis (Zelinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>). Many theories on crowding exist (for a review see Levi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>) making it difficult to predict what eye movement strategy observers may adopt. The important question is: does the oculomotor system prefer areas containing many potential targets and strong crowding or does it prefer areas containing less potential targets and less crowding, as might be expected from recent findings in complex search tasks (Neider and Zelinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>; Shen and Pare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>; Torralba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2006</xref>)?</p><p>To investigate this question, we constructed a stimulus containing search elements, each accompanied by flankers, which had no predictive power over the location of the target. By manipulating the properties of these flankers, we influenced the strength of crowding, as flankers more similar to the target cause stronger crowding. In this way, we varied the strength of crowding for different areas in the display.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experiment 1A</title><p>Any strategy employed to find a target is likely to depend on whether a target can or cannot be discriminated peripherally; therefore, we varied the properties of the target over two conditions.</p><p>In the visual periphery, sensitivity for high spatial frequencies decreases. Crowding further deteriorates the ability to discriminate elements in the periphery. Therefore, high spatial frequency elements are more likely to become indiscriminable as a result of crowding. We used spatial frequency to vary the discriminability of the target. In the low spatial frequency (<italic>lsf</italic>) condition, the target is an <italic>lsf</italic> Gabor patch (2.6&#x000a0;cycles/&#x000b0;) and can likely be discriminated despite crowding. In the high spatial frequency (<italic>hsf</italic>) condition, the target is an <italic>hsf</italic> Gabor patch (5.2&#x000a0;cycles/&#x000b0;) and is more likely to become indiscriminable due to crowding.</p><p>To investigate the influence of crowding, throughout both conditions, in different trials, the target can be found either among flankers of the same spatial frequency or among flankers of a different spatial frequency. In the <italic>lsf</italic> condition, we expect to find a preference for locations where the target is accompanied by flankers of a different spatial frequency, as these do not require fixation in order to be discriminated. However, the most interesting case is the <italic>hsf</italic> condition. The oculomotor system might again prefer areas with little crowding. However, locations with strong crowding might also be preferred, as they reveal many potential targets.</p><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Observers</title><p>Each condition included six observers, three of which participated in both conditions.

Observers either worked or studied at Utrecht University and participated on a voluntary basis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Apparatus and stimuli</title><p>All stimuli consisted of 12 search elements on an invisible 4 by 3 hexagonal grid on a gray background (6.0&#x000a0;cd/m<sup>2</sup>). These search elements, Gabors, consisted of one target and 11 distractors. To distinguish target from distractors, the sinusoidal carrier was rotated and modulated to change the orientation and spatial frequency, respectively. Elements were placed at a spacing of 8.1&#x000b0; (center-to-center) and were of either high spatial frequency (5.2&#x000a0;cycles/&#x000b0;, 12.5&#x000a0;cd/m<sup>2</sup>, 85% contrast) or low spatial frequency (2.6&#x000a0;cycles/&#x000b0;, 13.0&#x000a0;cd/m<sup>2</sup>, 80% contrast). The Gabors had a diameter of 0.92&#x000b0; on screen; however, perceived radius was slightly smaller at approximately 0.8&#x000b0; (see Fredericksen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1997</xref>). The target had a vertical orientation, while other elements were rotated away from the vertical orientation (randomly chosen from a range of 10&#x000b0;&#x02013;20&#x000b0;), either clockwise or counterclockwise.</p><p>Target and distractors were, each individually, surrounded by four flankers, creating a display containing 12 clusters. A cluster subtended 2.3&#x000b0; by 2.3&#x000b0;. Flankers were Gabors of either high spatial frequency (<italic>hsf</italic>) or low spatial frequency (<italic>lsf</italic>), resulting in four types of clusters (clusters composed of an <italic>lsf</italic> center with <italic>lsf</italic> flankers, an <italic>lsf</italic> center with <italic>hsf</italic> flankers, an <italic>hsf</italic> center with <italic>lsf</italic> flankers, and an <italic>hsf</italic> center with <italic>hsf</italic> flankers). For each cluster, they were rotated either 45&#x000b0; clockwise (upper left and lower right flankers) or 45&#x000b0; counterclockwise (upper right and lower left flankers). An example of the stimulus can be found in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

Next, observers were set up with the Eyelink and instructed on the proceedings of a trial. Before each trial, a small fixation cross was displayed and observers started a trial by pressing the space bar. Observers indicated having located the target pressing the &#x0201c;zero key&#x0201d; on the numerical keypad. Each condition lasted approximately 15&#x000a0;min and a break of at least 5&#x000a0;min between conditions was included.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Eye movement analysis</title><p>Eye movements were recorded using an SMI Eyelink II system at a frequency of 500&#x000a0;Hz, while the observer&#x02019;s head was placed in a chinrest at a distance of 64&#x000a0;cm to the screen. Images were viewed binocularly, but eye movements were recorded from the left eye only. Eye movement data were collected for off-line analysis. Saccades were detected at a velocity of 20&#x000b0;/s, after which start and endpoint were found by searching back and forth until the velocity was two standard deviations higher than the velocity during fixations (as in Van der Steen and Bruno <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1995</xref>). Saccades with amplitudes under 1.5&#x000b0; were removed from the analysis. If a small saccade was removed, fixations before and after this saccade were added together. Finally, fixation durations shorter than 50&#x000a0;ms were discarded from further analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Saccade amplitudes</title><p>The goal of the experiment was to evaluate the outcome of the selection process. To draw any conclusions from the results of our experiments on the selection process, it is important that selection is based on a similar choice for each eye movement. A possible confounding factor for these displays was that eye movements targeting one type of cluster originated from far away, while another type of cluster was only targeted when it was a direct neighbor. The distance between clusters and the properties of the Gabors were chosen such that observers could only evaluate one cluster per fixation and saccade to neighboring clusters.</p><p>Saccade amplitudes are generally acknowledged to be a good indication of the number of stimulus elements that can be evaluated in a single fixation (e.g. Jacobs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1986</xref>). In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we plot the median saccade amplitudes to verify that they are in accordance with the intention of saccades targeting neighboring clusters. Here, we see that the median saccade amplitudes are similar for all clusters, indicating that different types of clusters are not selected from different distances.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Median saccade amplitudes set out against each cluster type. <bold>a</bold> The different types of clusters in the low spatial frequency target condition. <bold>b</bold> Saccade amplitudes toward the different types of clusters in the high spatial frequency target condition. <italic>Letters</italic> represent cluster compositions.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Search time</title><p>In order to evaluate the influence of flankers on selection for each condition, we divided the trials into two subsets of which we averaged search times individually. The subsets are based on the type of flanker, either <italic>hsf</italic> or <italic>lsf</italic>, surrounding the target. Note that only two of the four cluster types, those with the correct spatial frequency, could hold the target. This allows us to distinguish search times for a target surrounded by similar flankers from a target surrounded by dissimilar flankers. A bias in eye movements toward one type of cluster should result in shorter search times when the target is found in such a cluster, as it then has a higher chance of being fixated. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, search times are plotted for the <italic>lsf</italic> condition. In this condition, finding a target among similar flankers requires longer search times than finding a target among dissimilar flankers (<italic>t</italic>(5)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.389; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01). This is contrasted by the results for the <italic>hsf</italic> condition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Here, we see longer search times when the flankers of the target are dissimilar in comparison with shorter search times for a target placed among similar flankers (<italic>t</italic>(5)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.121; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Search times for the first experiment. <bold>a</bold> Average search times for low spatial frequency target.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Selection of clusters</title><p>If the difference in search times is indeed due to a bias in selection based on the type of flankers, a difference in the number of fixations per cluster type should be at the basis of this variation in search times. That is, we reason a target to be found quicker in a cluster type, if this cluster is more likely to be fixated. Therefore, we analyzed which clusters were fixated throughout a search. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the proportion of the total number of fixations is plotted for each of the four types of clusters. When a target is not found in the clusters that attract eye movements, naturally the rest of the clusters will also be scanned. As our interest lies with the initial preference and not the systematic scanning of the entire image, this analysis was limited to the endpoints of the first three saccades.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Number of fixations set out for the four cluster types. <bold>a</bold> The results for the low spatial frequency target condition. <bold>b</bold> The results for the high spatial frequency target condition. <italic>Letters</italic> represent cluster compositions.

However, as we are interested in saccadic selection, we focus on <italic>where</italic> in the display the target is found quickest, rather than in <italic>what</italic> condition. In the <italic>lsf</italic> condition, we see that search times are shorter when an <italic>lsf</italic> target is flanked by <italic>hsf</italic> Gabors, than when it is flanked by <italic>lsf</italic> Gabors. This can be explained as flankers less similar to the target form weaker masks (Nazir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1992</xref>; Kooi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1994</xref>). However, ordinary masking cannot explain why a target is found fastest when surrounded by <italic>similar</italic> flankers in the <italic>hsf</italic> target condition. To explain this counterintuitive result, we need to move beyond the idea of just masking of the target. In this case, it seems that surroundings can no longer be distinguished from the target, and saccadic targeting seems to be attracted by the properties of the central and flanking Gabors combined. Locations where more of the target property is present over a greater area are now more likely to be selected by saccadic targeting. These results suggest that when a target is peripherally indiscriminable, areas with more potential targets and stronger crowding are preferred over those with less potential targets and less crowding. This is in contrast to saccadic selection being guided by saliency, as clusters with irregularities (those with a combination of <italic>hsf</italic> and <italic>lsf</italic> Gabors) are selected less frequently than the homogenous clusters with elements similar to the target. However, one remaining issue is that this result can also be explained in terms of the type of flanker, rather than the similarity it has to its center. We will address this issue in Experiment 2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Experiment 1B</title><p>On the basis of literature, we assumed that in our experiment flankers more similar to the target always form the strongest mask. Considering the many other factors, apart from spatial frequency, that can be of influence in masking, such as luminance and contrast, we performed a small control experiment in order to check the validity of our assumption for the stimuli used. The measurements were taken using a method based on the conspicuity meter, as introduced by Wertheim et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>). This procedure is subjective, as observers are asked to indicate at what eccentricity they can no longer recognize the target.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion: Experiment 1B</title><p>This control experiment shows that the presence of flankers decreases the eccentricity at which observers can still recognize the target. In line with earlier studies, we see that this eccentricity is smaller for flankers that are more similar to the target.</p><p>As the decreasing resolution of peripheral vision allows for relatively better discrimination of lower spatial frequencies, it seems counterintuitive that conspicuity angles for the <italic>hsf</italic> target and the <italic>lsf</italic> target are close to equal. However, this is explained by the difference in the task in the control experiment and what is likely to happen in saccadic selection. In the control experiment, the task is to distinguish the vertical orientation of the central Gabor. As discrimination thresholds are higher for lower spatial frequencies (Burr and Wijesundra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR500">1991</xref>), the discrimination of the orientation of an <italic>lsf</italic> Gabor is less accurate at any eccentricity. In the results of Experiment 1A, we evaluate selection by looking at contrast between spatial frequencies of target and flankers, not by the distinction of the orientation of the central Gabor. However, in this experiment, we purely intended to show the difference in masking strength, rather than to provide an absolute conspicuity angle that explains what happens in the search experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Experiment 2</title><p>The results of the first experiment show saccadic selection is dependent on the peripheral discrimination of the target. In the <italic>lsf</italic> condition, search times are longer when the target is placed among similar flankers opposed to dissimilar flankers, an effect that reverses in the <italic>hsf</italic> condition. Even though we explain this result in terms of a contrast between similar and dissimilar flankers, one could argue that in both conditions clusters with <italic>hsf</italic> flankers are simply fixated more frequently. We wanted to verify that the preference for clusters with similar flankers did not stem from a preference for clusters with a specific type of flankers.</p><p>Therefore, in this second experiment, a comparison is made between two conditions where the spatial frequency of target and flankers are equal. We now define the target in a feature space that should not influence its peripheral discriminability. Depending on the condition, the target is now either a green or a red vertical Gabor.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion: Experiment 2</title><p>In line with the findings from Experiment 1A, flankers have an effect on selection. In this experiment, targets were not peripherally discriminable. Here, we found search times to be shorter when a target is placed among flankers of the same color. As both targets are equally prone to crowding, the only difference that explains the results is a preference for clusters where flankers are similar to the target. The difference is more pronounced in the green condition than in the red condition. A likely reason for this anisotropy is that the red and green Gabors do not have the same onscreen luminance. However, even though red Gabors have a lower onscreen luminance than green Gabors, the general fixation patterns are similar.</p><p>The fixation patterns found in the second experiment show that selection is biased toward clusters with target-colored flankers. Even though those clusters are fixated most frequently when they have a target-colored element at their center, when this is not the case, they are still fixated frequently. This gives rise to the question whether there is a continuous relation between the likelihood of selecting a cluster and the number of elements that hold the target property. Furthermore, as the results are consistent over targets defined by spatial frequency and color, we ask whether they also extend to a class of stimuli more frequently found in everyday life, such as letters. We investigated these two questions in the third and fourth experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Experiment 3</title><p>A preference for clusters with many elements similar to the target can be seen in the fixation patterns from the previous experiment. However, the displays used only include a choice between clusters with strong crowding or very little. It is therefore not possible to conclude how sensitive the oculomotor system is if crowding was to vary more widely throughout the stimulus. The preference for clusters with strong crowding might be a very coarse one, only distinguishing between clusters with strong crowding and little crowding. However, it is also possible that saccadic selection is sensitive to a broad range of variations and that locations are compared on the basis of how strong the crowding is in a continuous relation. To test this, the composition of the clusters has been adapted. No longer are all flankers either similar or dissimilar, but their color is varied individually. The experiment was limited to just one condition with a red vertical target, as Experiment 2 demonstrated that a search for a red as well as a green target resulted in the same behavior.</p><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec28"><title>Observers</title><p>Four observers of ages 25&#x02013;28 participated in the third experiment.

A single display contains three clusters of each type, making for a total of 18 clusters in each display. The target, the only red vertical Gabor, is always presented at the center of a cluster. However, a red Gabor was not always presented at the center of a cluster not containing the target. There were 375 trials, balanced to be able to compare five subsets. These subsets were based on the number of red Gabors in the cluster containing the target. Each subset included all trials in which the target was found in a cluster with one, two, three, four, or five red Gabors, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Search times are set out against the number of red Gabors contained in a cluster and are found in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Discussion: Experiment 3</title><p>The results again emphasize that the proportion of target-colored Gabors over an area larger than that of just the target can attract saccades.

However, this is only due to the artificial nature of the task, the target location is limited to the center of an isolated cluster, a restriction not common in everyday life.

</p><p>These results show that flankers affect saccadic selection in a similar fashion when the object of the search is more complex than a Gabor. As in Experiment 1A and 2, when crowding prevents the peripheral discrimination of the target, a bias toward areas with more of the target property is found.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>General discussion</title><p>To investigate saccadic selection in relation to crowding, in four search experiments, we accompanied all individual search elements by flankers. To vary the strength of crowding on the search elements, these flankers could be either similar or dissimilar to their respective search element. In all experiments crowding influenced saccadic selection, however, not always in the same way. The oculomotor system preferred search elements in areas with little crowding for peripherally discriminable targets. However, interestingly, the oculomotor system preferred search elements with strong crowding, when looking for a peripherally indiscriminable target. We see this duality in Experiment 1A, where a low spatial frequency (<italic>lsf</italic>) target is found fastest when surrounded by flankers of a high spatial frequency (<italic>hsf)</italic>, while an <italic>hsf</italic> target, peripherally indiscriminable, is found fastest among flankers of the same spatial frequency. The second experiment confirms the preference for areas with strong crowding when looking for a peripherally indiscriminable target. Here, looking for a red or green <italic>hsf</italic> target, flankers of the target color attract the most eye movements. Vlaskamp and Hooge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>) have shown that performance in visual search deteriorates with crowding. Interestingly, our findings show that crowding not just deteriorates peripheral target discrimination but also has an effect on the nature of potential targets in visual search. We see that when a target is peripherally indiscriminable, selection is biased toward areas with strong crowding. Even though adding flankers in a search task decreases overall search performance (Vlaskamp and Hooge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>), surprisingly, the target is not necessarily found slowest in an area where crowding is the strongest. It appears similar flankers not only mask the signal of the target but can also attract eye movements as they raise the presence of target signal throughout the area.</p><p>The current experiments provide insight into the crowding phenomenon in general. There is still a lively debate on the mechanism behind crowding. Pelli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>), for instance, assume that crowding is due to a lack of feature-binding of individual elements (attributing features to corresponding elements correctly). Strasburger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>) provides support for this theory, showing that observers often report a flanker instead of the target in letter identification tasks. Cavanagh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>), on the other hand, advocates that averaging to the benefit of peripheral texture detection might be the underlying cause. In line with this thought, Saarela et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>) show that when flankers group with other flankers, their masking strength decreases. As peripheral visual information can be used for saccadic selection, what is selected by eye movements cannot reveal the mechanism behind crowding, but can bring us more insight into what information is available in a <italic>crowded region</italic> (a region made up of a target and masking flankers). That is, finding that one type of cluster is preferred over another type also implies there is sufficient information on the visual aspects of these clusters to be able to distinguish between them. The results from Experiment 3, showing that there is a continuous relation between the number of fixations on a cluster type and the number of target-colored Gabors, not just emphasize that eye movements are attracted by areas with more target-colored elements. They also demonstrate that even though individual elements cannot be distinguished, information on the composition of the cluster is available as selection discriminates between clusters containing either more or less potential targets. This is interesting, as most suggestions on how crowding influences the percept are based on indirect measures. Saccadic targeting, however, reveals that enough information is present to be able to distinguish between different clusters. Even though peripheral target discrimination of an individual element fails, the clusters&#x02019; contents can be evaluated.</p><p>A preference for one type of cluster does not lead to any benefits in the present experiments. The target can be found just as likely in each type of cluster. However, in everyday life, items we try to locate are generally not limited to a specific position within an arrangement, and selecting areas with more elements holding target properties allows for evaluation of more potential targets upon foveation. We expect that the bias found is likely part of a search strategy, which includes two types of saccades that can be characterized as <italic>target directed</italic> and <italic>explorative</italic>. <italic>Target directed</italic> saccades occur when a target can be discriminated peripherally. These saccades target individual elements that could potentially be the target. <italic>Explorative</italic> saccades arise when a target is masked and saccades are directed toward areas with more potential targets and also stronger crowding. Together, these two types of saccades may provide for an efficient strategy to visual search in everyday life. When the target of a search stands out from its surroundings, it is selected directly. When the target does not sufficiently stand out from its surroundings, as a second best solution, saccades are directed toward areas with more of the target property present.</p><p>For instance, imagine you are looking for one of your books in your office, without any recollection of where you left it. This scene is likely to contain a bookcase, a location with lots of books and strong crowding. There might also be some books on your desk where there is less crowding, but also fewer books. To quickly find your book, an efficient strategy could be to make an eye movement to your bookcase, rather than one toward your desk.</p><p>Of course, to make the claim that this strategy is beneficial in everyday life, it is important that these results also hold for stimuli found in daily life. To a certain extent, our fourth experiment demonstrates that. The findings do not just hold for displays containing Gabors, but for letters as well.</p><p>Many studies evaluating the nature of potential targets have shown that features of peripheral elements play an important role in saccadic selection (e.g. Findlay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1997</xref>; Hooge and Erkelens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1999</xref>; Motter and Belky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>; McSorley and Findlay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>). These studies evaluate saccadic selection on the basis of single elements on a sparse grid and show target similarity to be an important factor in guiding eye movements. In studies using more complex scenes, area composition has been taken into account (e.g., Neider and Zelinsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>; Torralba et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2006</xref>; Shen and Pare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>). However, emphasis lies on saccadic selection guided by salience, rather than by target similarity. The current study evaluates the nature of potential targets on the basis of the combination of elements near each other in the periphery, in a complex search task. When a target can be discriminated peripherally, target similarity is highest when crowding is weak. However, when a target cannot be discriminated peripherally, due to crowding, target similarity seems to be estimated over a larger area. Therefore, the role of flankers similar to the target in visual search is two-fold.
