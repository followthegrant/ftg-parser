It is believed to start many years prior to symptoms and is reflected by reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the peptide A&#x003b2;1&#x02013;42 (A&#x003b2;42). Here we tested the hypothesis that baseline levels of CSF proteins involved in microglia activity, synaptic function and A&#x003b2; metabolism predict the development of A&#x003b2; plaques, assessed by longitudinal CSF A&#x003b2;42 decrease in cognitively healthy people. Forty-six healthy people with three to four serial CSF samples were included (mean follow-up 3 years, range 2&#x02013;4 years). There was an overall reduction in A&#x003b2;42 from a mean concentration of 211&#x02013;195&#x02009;pg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> after 4 years. Linear mixed-effects models using longitudinal A&#x003b2;42 as the response variable, and baseline proteins as explanatory variables (<italic>n</italic>=69 proteins potentially relevant for A&#x003b2; metabolism, microglia or synaptic/neuronal function), identified 10 proteins with significant effects on longitudinal A&#x003b2;42. The most significant proteins were angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, <italic>P</italic>=0.009), Chromogranin A (CgA, <italic>P</italic>=0.009) and Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL, <italic>P</italic>=0.009). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis identified 11 proteins with significant effects on longitudinal A&#x003b2;42 (largely overlapping with the proteins identified by linear mixed-effects models). Several proteins (including ACE, CgA and AXL) were associated with A&#x003b2;42 reduction only in subjects with normal baseline A&#x003b2;42, and not in subjects with reduced baseline A&#x003b2;42. We conclude that baseline CSF proteins related to A&#x003b2; metabolism, microglia activity or synapses predict longitudinal A&#x003b2;42 reduction in cognitively healthy elders. The finding that some proteins only predict A&#x003b2;42 reduction in subjects with normal baseline A&#x003b2;42 suggest that they predict future development of the brain A&#x003b2; pathology at the earliest stages of AD, prior to widespread development of A&#x003b2; plaques.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>beta-amyloid</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd><kwd>cerebrospinal fluid</kwd><kwd>longitudinal</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>&#x003b2;-amyloid (A&#x003b2;) plaques is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are reflected by reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A&#x003b2;42.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Reduced CSF A&#x003b2;42 has high diagnostic accuracy for AD as determined by autopsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> and agrees well with the results of positron emission tomography (PET) using A&#x003b2; tracers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Although somewhat controversial, many believe that biomarkers reflecting the accumulation of brain A&#x003b2; in plaques are the earliest detectable biomarker signs of AD in elders, reaching pathological levels several years before the development of cognitive symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Other hallmarks of AD are axonal degeneration and tangle pathology, which are reflected by increased CSF tau (total-tau, T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau), respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Reports on both autosomal-dominant AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> and late-onset AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> suggest that increased CSF T-tau and P-tau levels occur first after widespread amyloid plaque deposition, evidenced by reduced CSF A&#x003b2;42 and amyloid imaging.

Therefore, the main goals of this study were to investigate the following <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses using proteins measured in normal controls in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): (1) baseline levels of CSF proteins involved in A&#x003b2; metabolism, microglia activity, synaptic/neuronal function or other AD-related processes predict longitudinal CSF A&#x003b2;42 decrease in cognitively healthy people; (2) baseline levels of some of these proteins may predict CSF A&#x003b2;42 decrease even in subjects without A&#x003b2; plaque pathology at baseline (reflected by CSF A&#x003b2;42 levels below an AD-related cutoff<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup>) and (3) These proteins are less predictive of P-tau and T-tau changes, according to a model in which P-tau and T-tau become abnormal downstream of A&#x003b2; pathology and associated biomarkers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a longitudinal study on the associations between CSF proteins at baseline and longitudinal changes in CSF A&#x003b2;42, T-tau and P-tau. Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/">http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/</ext-link>). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public&#x02013;private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California&#x02013;San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date, these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, aged 55&#x02013;90 years, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI and people with early AD. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.

Briefly, all the control subjects included in ADNI-1 were between the ages of 55 and 90 years, had completed at least 6 years of education, were fluent in Spanish or English, were free of any significant neurologic disease and had CDR scores of 0. <italic>APOE</italic> genotypes were determined for all subjects.

In brief, the kit included 159 analytes, selected for analytes believed to be relevant for a number of different diseases including cancer, autoimmune disorders and AD. Previous versions of the kit had been used to explore CSF or plasma proteins in AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Seventy-six analytes were adequately quantifiable in the CSF samples in this study (the other analytes were mostly below the assay-detection limit or had other assay limitations as outlined in the assay documentation found online at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/">http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/</ext-link>). For these, we did a systematic literature review to find previous evidence of associations with A&#x003b2; metabolism, microglial activity, synaptic function or other aspects of AD (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for results, including references). We identified 67 analytes of interest that were included in this study. Some analytes were used after log transformation as described in the assay documentation. Together with A&#x003b2;42, T-tau and P-tau, this resulted in 69 analytes available for each test described below (baseline A&#x003b2;42, T-tau or P-tau were excluded in tests of trajectories of A&#x003b2;42, T-tau and P-tau, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Potentially confounding effects by age, sex, education and <italic>APOE</italic> on explanatory proteins were evaluated by linear regression. Logistic regression was used to test whether any demographic parameter was associated with study drop-out.</p><p>Effects of explanatory proteins on longitudinal A&#x003b2;42, T-tau and P-tau were tested by using linear mixed-effects models, in which A&#x003b2;42, T-tau or P-tau was used as a response variable, and the time from the baseline visit in years, explanatory protein, the interaction between time and explanatory protein, age, sex, education and <italic>APOE &#x0025b;4</italic> status were included as fixed effects (rates of change of A&#x003b2;42, T-tau and P-tau were tested separately with each explanatory protein). All models included a random intercept and slope (except some models that would not converge with a random slope, and therefore only included a random intercept). After inspection of the correlation within subjects, a compound symmetry structure was assumed. We assessed the applicability of the linear mixed-effect model by evaluating (1) linearity of biomarker concentration over time within subjects, (2) the normality of the model residuals and (3) the difference between models with and without time as a random effect. Owing to the large number of proteins tested, we corrected for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate correction.</p><p>Prognostic discrimination of explanatory proteins for longitudinal A&#x003b2;42 reduction was also tested by ROC statistics. For this, CSF A&#x003b2;42 change was calculated as the relative change over 4 years, estimated using individual intercepts and slopes from a mixed effect model, adjusted for age, sex, education and <italic>APOE</italic>. The cutoff defining A&#x003b2;42 reduction was determined by the 25th percentile, and the cutoff for A&#x003b2;42 stability by the 75th percentile. Dichotomous A&#x003b2;42 reduction status was then regressed on each significant protein separately, using logistic regression. Predicted probabilities from these models were then used to calculate each protein's ability to discriminate A&#x003b2; decliners from those with stable A&#x003b2;. This predictive accuracy was estimated as the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Each accuracy was cross-validated using a leave-one-out design. Confidence intervals (CIs) for cross-validated accuracies were calculated using variance estimates from 200 bootstrap resamples. To evaluate the proteins' collective ability to discriminate A&#x003b2; decliners from nondecliners, we used logistic regression with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalty on the coefficients of the proteins. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalty was used to simultaneously estimate the effects of a large number of correlated protein concentrations on A&#x003b2; reduction. Results were summarized with predictive accuracy (AUC) and 95&#x00025; CIs estimated from 200 bootstrap resamples.</p><p>Significance was determined at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate correction. All statistics were performed using R (v. 2.15.2, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

The most significant proteins were angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), CgA, AXL, Log TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor, CD40 and MCSF.

Note that the 11.5&#x00025; cutoff for A&#x003b2;42 reduction exceeds the within-run measurement variability of the xMAP AlzBio3 A&#x003b2;42 assay and thereby very likely reflects a biological change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> By these definitions, 12 subjects had A&#x003b2;42 reduction (four <italic>APOE</italic> &#x0025b;4&#x0002b;, six female subjects, mean age 80 years (range 73&#x02013;88, mini mental state examination 29.3 (28&#x02013;30), ADAS-Cog 5.7 (1.7&#x02013;15), ADAS-MOD 8.9 (1.7&#x02013;18)) and 12 subjects had stable A&#x003b2;42 (one <italic>APOE</italic> &#x0025b;4&#x0002b;, six female subjects, aged 78 years (72&#x02013;87), mini mental state examination 29.6 (20&#x02013;30), ADAS-Cog 6.8 (2.3&#x02013;10), ADAS-MOD 10 (4.0&#x02013;15)).

As expected and as shown previously in the ADNI cohort,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> these subjects had reduced baseline CSF A&#x003b2;42 (mean 133 (s.d. 19)&#x02009;ng&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and elevated baseline CSF T-tau (131 (64)&#x02009;ng&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and CSF P-tau (42 (13)&#x02009;ng&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

The finding that the predictive effects of baseline proteins on the subsequent decline of A&#x003b2;42 were different in subjects with normal and reduced baseline CSF A&#x003b2;42 levels suggests that some proteins predict brain A&#x003b2; plaque accumulation at a very early stage of AD, prior to widespread plaque accumulation. The failure of baseline proteins to predict longitudinal changes of T-tau and P-tau suggests that these proteins are specifically predictive of A&#x003b2; pathology. Taken together, the evidence suggest that changes of CSF proteins primarily related to A&#x003b2; metabolism, microglial regulation or synaptic functions most likely reflect pathological alterations at very early stages of AD, and for some proteins even prior to widespread neuritic plaque formation.</p><p>The first major finding was that cognitively healthy elderly showed longitudinal changes in A&#x003b2;42, P-tau and T-tau, partly replicating a previous report using 3-year follow-up data from ADNI-1 (the same subjects in this study) showing that healthy controls manifested longitudinal decreases in A&#x003b2;42 and increases in P-tau.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> Cross-sectional studies have shown that cognitively healthy subjects (or MCI subjects) at risk for future development of AD dementia have altered A&#x003b2;42, P-tau and T-tau several years prior to symptoms, with reduced A&#x003b2;42 appearing first.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> A few previous studies have reported longitudinal measurements of A&#x003b2;42, P-tau and T-tau in cognitively healthy subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> Most of these have found no or only small changes of CSF A&#x003b2;42, P-tau and T-tau levels in cognitively healthy subjects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> but these have had fewer participants, shorter follow-up or fewer serial samples than the present study. Our finding supports the use of A&#x003b2;42, T-tau and P-tau to track the development of AD-like pathology prior to clinical symptoms.</p><p>Our second major finding was that 10 CSF proteins measured at baseline significantly predicted longitudinal decrease in CSF A&#x003b2;42 as determined using linear mixed effect models, and 11 proteins as determined using ROC analysis (these sets of proteins largely overlapped). There has been no published previous analysis demonstrating the predictive effect of some CSF proteins on longitudinal changes of CSF A&#x003b2;42, T-tau or P-tau. The finding that these CSF proteins predicted longitudinal decrease in CSF A&#x003b2;42 indicate that they may be used as very early biomarkers of A&#x003b2; pathology and thereby possibly also of AD.</p><p>Furthermore, the findings that these proteins predict the decrease in CSF A&#x003b2;42 provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that biological pathways related to the A&#x003b2; metabolism, microglia activity and synaptic/neuronal function are involved in early A&#x003b2; pathology (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for references for the proteins described in this paragraph). Several of the identified proteins are associated with A&#x003b2; metabolism in different ways. For example, CLU and Cystatin C may bind A&#x003b2; peptides and influence their aggregation, ACE may degrade A&#x003b2; peptides, and Stem Cell Factor and IL-3 may protect against A&#x003b2; deposits and toxicity. Several of the proteins (including AXL, CD40, CgA, CLU, Cystatin C, MCSF and TIMP1) may modulate microglial activity or have their expression promoted by microglia, and some of the proteins (including ACE, B2M, CgA, IL-3 and TIMP1) have been described to be involved in synaptic or other neuronal functions. For example, CgA has been proposed as an indicator of presynaptic structures, and B2M and TIMP1 are involved in synaptic plasticity. Several of the identified proteins also have other associations with AD. For example, <italic>CLU</italic> is a major AD risk gene. Some of the proteins have been reported to have altered CSF levels in AD, with increased levels of MCSF and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, and decreased levels of TIMP1, CgA and stem cell factor. Taken together, the evidence linking these proteins with A&#x003b2;, microglia and synaptic function, and other evidence of their association with AD, provides additional support for the view that these proteins are closely involved, and may reflect causal events, in the pathophysiological events resulting in AD pathology.</p><p>The third major finding was that several of the identified proteins (CgA, CD40, AXL, ACE, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor and IL-3) were associated with the future decrease in CSF A&#x003b2;42 only in subjects without any signs of A&#x003b2; pathology at baseline; however, only one tested protein (TIMP1) was associated with further A&#x003b2;42 accumulation in subjects in whom A&#x003b2; pathology was already present. This suggests that these proteins reflect biochemical processes occuring prior to widespread plaque deposition because widespread plaques are reflected by low CSF A&#x003b2;42.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Therefore, we interpret these results to suggest that some of the identified proteins reflect pathophysiological alternations that occur at the very earliest stages of AD. We also tested 16 patients with AD dementia, in whom we found no associations between baseline protein levels and change of CSF A&#x003b2;42, T-tau or P-tau. Although this result is difficult to interpret because of the small number of subjects, it may support the notion that the identified proteins mainly reflect brain processes involved in the early stages of AD.</p><p>The fourth finding of this study was that there were no significant associations between the baseline proteins and longitudinal T-tau/P-tau. This fits with the dynamic biomarker model, in which changes in A&#x003b2;42 (and thereby associated processes) are more likely to be detected in early stages of the disease than changes in T-tau and P-tau.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> One intriguing finding was that several proteins were associated with baseline T-tau levels. Among them were CgA, AXL and ACE, which themselves were strong predictors of longitudinal CSF A&#x003b2;42 reduction. One possible explanation for the association between baseline T-tau and these proteins is that they may share metabolic pathways unrelated to A&#x003b2; pathology. This view is supported by the fact that, although CgA, ACE and AXL were strong predictors of longitudinal CSF A&#x003b2;42 reduction, baseline T-tau did not predict longitudinal CSF A&#x003b2;42 reduction.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is the relatively low sample size, but this was balanced by the long follow-up time and multiple samples from each subject. Our results may be biased by the selection of proteins studied, included mainly because of known associations with A&#x003b2; metabolism, microglia activity or synaptic function. It is possible that another set of proteins would have shown stronger predictive effects on longitudinal change of T-tau and P-tau. It is not known whether these proteins may help identify patients at risk for future cognitive decline or AD. When comparing protein levels between the 41 cognitively stable controls and the 5 controls who progressed to MCI, the only protein that was differently expressed between the groups was MMP2, which was reduced in participants who developed MCI. This is in agreement with previous studies, showing reduced CSF MMP2 levels in AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> However, the small number of participants who developed MCI in this study makes the negative results for the other proteins difficult to interpret.</p><p>In sum, we found that baseline CSF proteins involved in the A&#x003b2; metabolism, microglial regulation and synaptic function predicted longitudinal change in CSF A&#x003b2;42 in cognitively healthy people. Some of the proteins were only predictive in people with normal CSF A&#x003b2;42, suggesting that they may be used as biomarkers predicting future development of A&#x003b2; pathology in persons without A&#x003b2; pathology at testing. No proteins predicted increases in CSF T-tau or P-tau, consistent with the view that these protein changes occur prior to widespread plaque accumulation and downstream axonal loss and tangle pathology. The results provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for pathological mechanisms related to early A&#x003b2;42 accumulation, and especially point to a role for early alterations of the A&#x003b2; metabolism and microglia activity. These proteins may be useful tools to identify cognitively normal subjects at risk for future A&#x003b2;42 pathology, and subsequently AD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Data collection and sharing for this project were funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health Grant U01 AG024904).
