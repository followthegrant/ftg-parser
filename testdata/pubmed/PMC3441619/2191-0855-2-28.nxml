The influence of the C:N ratio was evaluated over the range of 24 to 96. Glucose was used as carbon source and its concentration was altered while nitrogen concentration was kept constant. Growth kinetics and mycotoxin production parameters were studied depending on different C:N ratios. With increasing initial glucose concentration fungal biomass did increase but the maximum specific growth rate was not influenced. The optimal initial C:N ratio for attaining highest mycotoxin concentrations was 72.

Black moulds of the genus <italic>Alternaria</italic> are able to form several mycotoxins of different chemical classes whereas the polyketide mycotoxins alternariol (AOH) and its methylated derivative alternariol monomethylether (AME) as well as the tetramic acid tenuazonic acid (TA) are best studied ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Coombe et al. 1970</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Logrieco et al. 2009</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Patriarca et al. 2007</xref>], Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These compounds have been identified in food products contaminated with <italic>Alternaria</italic> species: wheat ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Li and Yoshizawa, 2000</xref>]) and other grains ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Broggi et al. 2007</xref>]), sunflower seeds ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Nawaz et al. 1997</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Pozzi et al. 2005</xref>]), oilseed rape ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Nawaz et al. 1997</xref>]), pecans ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Schroeder and Cole 1976</xref>]), fruit and fruit juices ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Delgado et al. 1996</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Lau et al. 2003</xref>]), tomato products ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Andersen and Frisvad 2004</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Motta and Valente Soares 2001</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Ozcelik et al. 1990</xref>]) and olives ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Visconti et al. 1986</xref>]).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Chemical structure of the best studied</bold><bold><italic>Alternaria</italic></bold><bold>mycotoxins: alternariol (A), alternariol monomethylether (B) and tenuazonic acid (C).</bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2191-0855-2-28-1"/></fig><p>While the acute toxicity of <italic>Alternaria</italic> toxins is low compared to other mycotoxins as e.g. aflatoxins, low-level exposure over long terms can be a serious problem. AOH posses an oncogenic potential and was connected to an incidence of oesophageal cancer in Lixian, China ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Dong et al. 1987</xref>]). Although <italic>Alternaria</italic> toxins received increased attention over the last years, e.g. the multidisciplinary project &#x0201c;Safe organic vegetables and vegetable products by reducing risk factors and sources of fungal contaminants throughout the production chain: the carrot - <italic>Alternaria</italic> model&#x0201d; carried out by the European Union from 2000 to 2004, a risk assessment based on the current data is still not possible. In addition to the insufficient toxicological data not much is known about biosynthesis and regulation of the mycotoxins either. Hypothetical biosynthesis pathways for AOH/AME and TA have been suggested ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Gatenbeck and Hermodsson 1965</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Gatenbeck and Sierankiewicz 1973</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hiltunen and S&#x000f6;derh&#x000e4;ll 1992</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Light 1970</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Stinson 1985</xref>]) but the genes are not known. Environmental factors have a great impact on <italic>Alternaria</italic> toxin production. Mycotoxin production varies with fungal strain, substrate and other growth conditions. While TA production seems to be connected to fungal growth ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Brzonkalik et al. 2011a</xref>]), production of AOH and AME is not coupled with fungal growth and starts in the late exponential phase ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">S&#x000f6;derh&#x000e4;ll et al. 1978</xref>]). As shown by ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Magan and Lacey 1984</xref>]), ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Oviedo et al. 2010</xref>]) ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">and Pose et al. 2010</xref>]) temperature and water activity are important factors influencing AOH/AME and TA production in <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>. Furthermore light exerts a great influence on AOH production and can reduce mycotoxin formation significantly compared to yields obtained in the dark ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">H&#x000e4;ggblom and Niehaus 1986</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">H&#x000e4;ggblom and Unestam 1979</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">S&#x000f6;derh&#x000e4;ll et al. 1978</xref>]). ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Brzonkalik et al. 2011b</xref>]) studied the influence of different carbon and nitrogen sources in a semi-synthetic medium in static and shaking culture on mycotoxin production in <italic>A. alternata</italic>. They revealed that AOH and AME production is regulated by nitrogen and starts after total nitrogen consumption. The influence of the nitrogen source is higher than of the carbon source. Choice of cultivation condition, carbon and nitrogen source can change mycotoxin composition and determines mycotoxin amount. As shown for different mycotoxins the pH of the medium has an important influence on the expression of the respective biosynthesis genes; In the case of ochratoxin the genes responsible for mycotoxin formation in <italic>Penicillium verrucosum</italic> are highly expressed at pH 8 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2008</xref>]) whereas aflatoxin production in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. is increased at acidic pH values of the growth medium ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Keller et al. 1997</xref>]). The effect of pH on <italic>Alternaria</italic> toxin production has not been studied yet.</p><p>The best way to avoid health risks due to ingestion of contaminated food is the prevention of food spoilage by <italic>Alternaria</italic> toxins. Detailed information of influencing factors and regulatory mechanisms may additionally be helpful for enhanced production of mycotoxins for further toxicological studies. Therefore, profound knowledge about mycotoxin formation is absolutely essential. A robust and highly reproducible platform process in a bioreactor system was developed recently ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Brzonkalik et al. 2011a</xref>]) which enables easily the investigation of the influence of different process parameters on <italic>Alternaria</italic> mycotoxin production.

In shaking flasks pH cannot be controlled and it varies over cultivation time but biomass formation can be monitored because each sample consists of a completely harvested shaking flask. In contrast to this, experiments in a bioreactor are highly reproducible with very low standard deviations between single experiments but biomass formation cannot be monitored due to inhomogeneous dispersion of fungal mycelium in the culture broth. The pH was kept constant in bioreactor fermentations due to titration with NaOH and H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.</p><p>In shaking flask experiments a pH range between 3.5 and 7.5 was studied. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows variation of pH during cultivation time and maximum produced mycotoxin concentrations. The pH varied considerably up to 2 pH units between day 3 and 4 of cultivation. During this time highest increase in biomass was observed. In all experiments nearly the same total biodrymass of approx. 5.3&#x02009;g/L was reached. At an initial pH of 3.5 the course of pH and accordingly biomass increase were delayed compared to the other initial pH values. A clear raise in biomass formation was observed from 120&#x02009;h cultivation time. At the end of cultivation at 168&#x02009;h growth was not fully completed. At this initial pH fungal growth was possible after a pH change by the fungus. In the bioreactor conidia did not germinate at pH 3.5, therefore pH 4.0 was tested additionally. In shaking flask experiments detected mycotoxin concentrations raised with dropping initial pH-values. Lowest TA and AOH concentrations were observed at pH 7.5 (1.087&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.014&#x02009;mg/L TA, 0.038&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.027&#x02009;mg/L AOH), highest TA concentration were detected at pH 3.5 (19.121&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.159&#x02009;mg/L), whereas a maximum AOH concentration was measured at pH 4.5 (0.677&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.014&#x02009;mg/L). AOH was not detected at pH 3.5, AME could not be observed in any shaking flask experiment. In bioreactor experiments the same pH values were tested as in shaking flask experiments. As mentioned above, instead of pH 3.5 pH 4.0 was tested because fungal conidia did not germinate at pH 3.5. The pH was kept constant in bioreactor experiments. The total mycotoxin concentrations were higher as in shaking flasks but less biomass was formed. AME production was observed during fermentation. As in shaking flask experiments highest mycotoxin concentrations were produced at acidic pH values (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Highest AOH concentrations (5.7&#x02009;mg/L) were detected at pH 4.0 which corresponds to an increase of 63% compared to the platform process at pH 5.5. A considerable increase in TA production was observed at pH 4.5: TA concentration rose to 54.58&#x02009;mg/L which corresponds to a 43% enhancement. Highest AME concentrations were also detected at pH 4.5, but the production was only slightly enhanced to 1.73&#x02009;mg/L. At pH values higher than 5.5 mycotoxin production was significantly reduced. At pH 6.5 AOH (0.73&#x02009;mg/L) and TA (16.28&#x02009;mg/L) were detected, at pH 7.5 only AOH formation was observed (0.61&#x02009;mg/L) and at pH 8.0 mycotoxin production was totally inhibited.

Although total mycotoxin concentration and biomass formation in shaking flask experiments are lower than in bioreactor cultivations, they are very suitable to determine tendencies of both parameters and are therefore used for a first screening. To elucidate the influence of the C:N ratio on mycotoxin formation in <italic>A. alternata</italic> 4 different glucose concentrations at constant nitrogen concentrations (167.8&#x02009;mg/L) were tested in shaking flask experiments: 10&#x02009;g/L, 20&#x02009;g/L, 30&#x02009;g/L and 40&#x02009;g/L which corresponds to a C:N ratio of 24, 48, 72 and 96, respectively. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows glucose consumption, biomass formation and maximum mycotoxin concentration at the respective C:N ratios. The red dashed line in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and 3B represents the total exhaustion of nitrogen. In all experiments nitrogen was the limiting nutrient and was consumed after 5&#x02009;days (data not shown). Glucose consumption and biomass formation can be sufficiently fitted by a logistic equation with 4 parameters (1). With an initial glucose concentration of 10&#x02009;g/L glucose was completely consumed after 5&#x02009;days.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Glucose consumption (A), biomass production (B) and mycotoxin formation (C) during shaking flask cultivation of</bold><bold><italic>A. alternata</italic></bold><bold>DSM 12633 in modified Czapek-Dox medium depending on C:N ratio.</bold> Data is given as an average of 3 independent samples.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2191-0855-2-28-3"/></fig><p>Therefore, biomass increased only until day 7 to 5.2&#x02009;g/L and kept constant from then on. It can be assumed that glucose given at an initial concentration of 10&#x02009;g/L was also a limiting factor in these experiments. In all other experiments independent on initial glucose concentration approximately 20&#x02009;g/L glucose were consumed over the observed 14&#x02009;days and glucose consumption curves were quite similar. According to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B the logistic growth phase can be located between day 3 and 5. After nitrogen consumption at day 7 the stationary growth phase was reached and only slight increases in biomass were observed. Highest biomass yields (11.62&#x02009;g/L) were achieved with initial glucose concentration of 40&#x02009;g/L after 14&#x02009;days. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> summarizes the effect of initial glucose concentration on fungal growth (by maximum dry weight). Independent on the glucose concentration the maximum specific growth rate &#x003bc;<sub>max</sub> and the maximum growth rate are almost the same in all experiments and were calculated to be 0.029 - 0.045&#x02009;h<sup>-1</sup> and 0.079 - 0.095&#x02009;g/h, respectively. As for the growth kinetics mycotoxin production was observed depending on different C:N ratios. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C shows maximum TA and AOH concentrations. AOH was initially detected at day 5 when nitrogen was depleted. A maximum AOH concentration can be observed at day 7. For the initial glucose concentrations of 10&#x02009;g/L, 20&#x02009;g/L and 40&#x02009;g/L nearly the same AOH concentrations were detected: 0.25&#x02009;mg/L&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.003, 0.12 mgL/&#x000b1; 0.07 and 0.33&#x02009;mg/L&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.29, respectively. AOH production was noticeably enhanced at an initial glucose concentration of 30&#x02009;g/L, 1.95&#x02009;mg/L&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.03 AOH could be achieved. TA was formed in the early growth phase as it was already detected at day 3. TA concentration courses followed biomass increase. The maximum TA concentrations were 16.95&#x02009;mg/L&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.78, 16.18&#x02009;mg/L&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.34, 22.25&#x02009;mg/L&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.17 and 18.97&#x02009;mg/L&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.58 at initial glucose concentrations of 10&#x02009;g/L, 20&#x02009;g/L, 30&#x02009;g/L and 40&#x02009;g/L, respectively. As with AOH production the initial glucose concentration of 30&#x02009;g/L seemed to favor TA production, but the enhancement appeared not to be significant and may be explained by higher biomass production. Additionally, cultivation with 30&#x02009;g/L glucose was performed in the bioreactor. Compared to the platform process with 10&#x02009;g/L glucose ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Brzonkalik et al. 2011a</xref>]) AOH and AME production was enhanced considerably to 11.47&#x02009;mg/L and 6.82&#x02009;mg/L (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) which corresponds to a 3-fold and 4-fold increase, respectively.

In this study the effects of the two important factors, pH-value and C:N ratio, were elucidated for the first time and it was shown that mycotoxin production was highly affected by these factors.</p><p>In general, the regulation of most of fungal toxins is very complex and one special regulator does not exist. As shown by many studies before, pH value exerts a great influence on the production of different mycotoxins. Although the optimal pH value has to be determined individually for each mycotoxin, the production of most of the mycotoxins is increased at acidic pH values. ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Keller et al. 1997</xref>]) reported highest sterigmatocystin production in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> and highest aflatoxin production in <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> at pH 4.0. By buffering ammonium growth media in a range from pH 4 to 8, they observed an approximately 5-fold decrease in mycotoxin production in both <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. with increasing pH. According to the detected mycotoxin concentrations they observed that the transcript levels of the aflatoxin/sterigmatocystin pathway genes <italic>ver-1</italic> and <italic>stc-U</italic> first appeared at acidic pH values and only later or not at all in neutral or alkali conditions. Similarly, much higher levels of ochratoxin are produced by <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> in the lower pH range, with a 4-fold reduction in levels being observed when the pH of the growth medium was increased from pH 4 to pH 10 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">O'Callaghan et al. 2006</xref>]). Likewise, a low pH regulates deoxynivalenol production in <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Gardiner et al. 2009</xref>]). ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Gardiner et al. 2009</xref>]) observed that a decrease of the initial pH from pH 4.0 to 3.5 led to a 2-fold increase in deoxynivalenol concentration. They also showed that an initial pH between 2.4 and 3.1 was required to induce deoxynivalenol production when <italic>F. graminearum</italic> was previously grown in non-producing medium.</p><p>In agreement with our shaking flask results they reported a rapid acidification of the growth medium due to ammonium consumption ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Morton and Macmillan 1954</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Jernejc and Legi&#x00161;a 2001</xref>]) followed by a increase to pH 8. They suggested that the drop in pH prior to the start of deoxynivalenol biosynthesis may be required to release a possible inhibition by the global pH regulatory system mainly mediated by the transcription factor PacC. PacC homologues play a role in the regulation of many mycotoxins, e.g. fumonisin production of <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Flaherty et al. 2003</xref>]) and sterigmacystin biosynthesis in <italic>A. nidulans</italic> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Delgado-Virgen and Guzman-de-Pe&#x000f1;a 2009</xref>]). Consequently, it is possible that alternariol production is regulated by a PacC homologue as well. Applying a blast search of PacC of <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (GenBank: CAA67063.1) against the sequenced and annotated genome of the close relative <italic>Alternaria brassicicola</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Altbr1/Altbr1.home.html">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Altbr1/Altbr1.home.html</ext-link>) revealed that <italic>A. brassicicola</italic> harbors a PacC homologue as well (jgi|Altbr1|4090|AB04090.1, E-Value: 3.25E-97). To clarify whether alternariol biosynthesis is regulated by a PacC homologue the identification of the biosynthesis cluster is necessary. Nevertheless, our results from the bioreactor studies showed that in contrast to ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Gardiner et al. 2009</xref>]) a drop in pH is not necessary to induce alternariol production because the pH was kept constant in the bioreactor. Furthermore, alternariol production in shaking flasks started after the end of growth phase when the pH of the medium was already increased. So, in <italic>A. alternata</italic> mycotoxin production is induced by low pH values, but a change in pH is not necessary.</p><p>With respect to the C:N ratio experiments it was already shown before that this ratio is important for the production of secondary metabolites. ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Casas Lop&#x000e9;z et al. 2003</xref>]) studied the influence of different C:N ratios on lovastatin production. They found that the presence of excess carbon under nitrogen limitation greatly enhanced the rate of production of lovastatin and determined an optimal C:N ratio of ~40. They stated that lovastatin production is associated with the nitrogen limited stationary growth phase when excess carbon can be channeled into secondary metabolism. The same can be applied to alternariol production. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Brzonkalik et al. (2011a</xref>]) showed clearly the secondary metabolite character of alternariol which is produced in the stationary growth phase after nitrogen depletion. An excess of carbon has a positive impact on alternariol production but does not affect growth rate or yield. In contrast to alternariol tenuazonic acid is formed growth associated and contains nitrogen. Therefore, an increase in carbon concentration does not alter TA production. These results clearly emphasize the different regulatory mechanisms for both mycotoxins and were supported by the results of the bioreactor cultivation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This work was founded by the state of Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg, Germany.
