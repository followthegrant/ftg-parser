The aim of our study is to document trends in the AEFI reporting ratio globally and across the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. We describe the number of AEFI reports communicated each year through the World Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund Joint Reporting Form on Immunization from 2000 to 2015. The AEFI reporting ratios (annual AEFI reports per 100,000 surviving infants) were calculated to identify WHO countries (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;191 in 2000 and n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;194 by 2015) that met a minimal reporting ratio of 10, a target set by the Global Vaccine Action Plan for vaccine safety monitoring as a proxy measure for a functional AEFI reporting system. The number of countries reporting any AEFI fluctuated over time but with progress from 32 (17%) in 2000 to 124 (64%) in 2015. In 2015, the global average AEFI reporting ratio was 549 AEFI reports per 100,000 surviving infants. The number of countries with AEFI reporting ratios&#x0202f;greater than&#x0202f;10 increased from 8 (4%) in 2000 to 81 (42%) in 2015. In 2015, 60% of countries in the WHO Region of the Americas reported at least 10 AEFI per 100,000 surviving infants, followed by 55% in European Region, 43% in Eastern Mediterranean Region, 33% in Western Pacific Region, 27% in South-East Asia Region and 21% in African Region. Overall, AEFI reporting has increased over the past sixteen years worldwide, but requires strengthening in a majority of low- and middle- income countries. The AEFI reporting ratio is useful for benchmarking and following trends over time; but does not provide information on the quality of the reporting system and does not guarantee capacity to detect and manage a vaccine safety problem at a national level. Additional efforts are required to ensure and improve data quality, AEFI reporting and surveillance of immunization safety in every country.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Global vaccine safety blueprint</kwd><kwd>Global vaccine action plan</kwd><kwd>Adverse events following immunization</kwd><kwd>AEFI reporting</kwd><kwd>Vaccine safety surveillance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Background</title><p id="p0005">The benefits of vaccination in saving lives and promoting health through reducing preventable diseases has been recognized worldwide, and vaccines currently prevent more than 2.5 million child deaths each year <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

These peaks corresponded to high numbers of AEFI cases reported by single countries in the European Region during 2004 (Ukraine) and the Eastern Mediterranean Region during 2009 (Lebanon), 2013 (Egypt) and 2015 (Egypt). Individual annual peaks can reflect time-limited increases in AEFI reports because of mass vaccination campaigns or media attention. In the African Region, Region of the Americas, and South-East Asia Region the number of AEFI cases reported between 2000 and 2015 were consistently low with a very small increase in later years. Reported AEFI cases steadily increased in the Western Pacific Region from 2008 to 2015. AEFI cases reported in the European Region varied over time with low numbers of AEFI cases reported before 2004, but large number of AEFI cases reported in 2004 (Ukraine reported 119957 AEFI cases) and in 2013 (Uzbekistan reported 110951 AEFI cases), followed by a decrease in 2014 and 2015. Continuously low numbers of AEFI were reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region before 2009. The first peak of AEFI cases in the Eastern Mediterranean Region occurred in 2009 (Lebanon reported 14628 AEFI cases), followed by a decrease in 2010, and another peak again in 2013 (Egypt reported 354043 AEFI cases), followed by a lower number in 2014 (Egypt reported 57 AEFI cases) and a new peak in 2015 (Egypt reported 414243 AEFI cases).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trends in number of AEFI cases reported through the WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form on Immunization, by WHO region, 2000&#x02013;2015.

AEFI reporting ratios calculated for the 2015 data from the African Region (total 47 countries), shows considerable variation by country. Burkina Faso (2407 cases per 100,000 surviving infants) had the highest AEFI reporting ratio in 2015, followed by Cameroon (229 cases per 100,000 surviving infants), while 35 countries reported AEFI reporting ratios lower than 10 per 100,000 surviving infants, including 23 countries with no AEFI data reported at all. In Burkina Faso, AEFI cases were reported during only 6 of the 16&#x0202f;years studied: and in the years 2014 and 2015, the number of AEFI reports was in significant excess (9529 and 16,192 cases, respectively) compared to any other year (1796, 16, 2 and 2216 cases in year 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2013).</p><p id="p0065">Trends in the number of countries in each region with AEFI reporting of at least 10 per 100,000 surviving infants in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 is presented in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.

AEFI reporting, however, remains non-existent or irregular in a majority of countries and large differences exist among regions. This report also illustrates the use of an AEFI reporting ratio and provides important information about the potential significance and limitations of such an indicator. As the first evaluation of the new GVAP target for AEFI monitoring (i.e., 10 AEFI reports per 100,000 surviving infants) <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, we found that in 2015, only 42% of countries achieved this minimal reporting ratio. This indicator will provide a useful initial milestone and if sustained over time, can reflect if a country has a basic system in place for reporting of safety concerns.</p><p id="p0075">This analysis also documents important regional variations in AEFI reporting. The South-East Asia, Americas and European Regions have the largest proportion of countries that are reporting AEFI data to the JRF. Yet, large differences can still be observed in the numbers and ratios of AEFI reports across regions. For example, only three of eight countries from the South-East Asia Region provided AEFI information to the JRF meet the GVAP AEFI reporting ratio target. As a result, in countries with low or absent AEFI reporting, even increases in the number of vaccine doses administered will have no or limited effect on the reporting ratio. Variations in AEFI reporting requirements might in part explain this difference, for example, in some countries minor and serious AEFI cases are collected, although others only report serious AEFI cases. Regardless of the differences in reporting requirements among countries, spontaneous AEFI surveillance is always characterized by a large degree of under-reporting <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition, in many places, the culture of safety monitoring as a quality process for the programme is not in place. Instead, a &#x0201c;culture of fear&#x0201d; may be present in some countries, in which health staffs are afraid of being blamed or punished if they report AEFI <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This has been documented especially in LMIC, illustrating a lack of political commitment and insufficient training of health care workers <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p id="p0080">In many countries, AEFI reporting has been observed to be irregular over time. One explanation for occasional peaks in reporting is supplemental immunization activities conducted in countries following AEFI emphasis and training sessions for a limited period of time. In other instances, new vaccine introductions have led to increased attention to safety monitoring and, on occasion, increased reporting might be due to a sense of insecurity towards a new vaccine. As occasional annual peaks in AEFI reports from individual countries can affect the global and regional totals, progress with vaccine safety capacity needs to be evaluated based on consistency in AEFI reports over time. The most consistent increase in AEFI reporting has been observed in China, reflecting a concerted effort by national authorities to improve their vaccine safety monitoring system. China&#x02019;s current AEFI surveillance system was initiated in 2005, and from 2008 an online system has been used to collect nationwide data regarding vaccine safety. A national AEFI surveillance guideline was issued in 2010 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, at least partly because the Ministry of Health acknowledged the key role AEFI surveillance played during the large influenza vaccination campaign in the 2009 A (H1N1) influenza pandemic <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Since then, Chinese authorities have continuously improved their processes for investigating serious AEFI, monitoring safety signals and analysing the safety profile of their manufactured vaccines, including monitoring products used outside of the country such as the live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine against Japanese encephalitis <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p id="p0085">In our analysis, although not all countries that reported AEFI data reached the proposed minimum reporting ratio, it appears that in the two regions with established AEFI reporting (Region of the Americas and European Region), the proportion of countries that met this indicator was also the highest.</p><p id="p0090">There are some limitations to our study. The AEFI reporting ratio indicator in itself is not a direct measure to assess if there is a functioning vaccine safety monitoring system in place in a country. Rather, this indicator indicates the capacity of AEFI reporting, not necessarily the quality of the system. It also does not allow for direct comparisons between countries, mainly because of varying country reporting requirements and definitions for AEFI. Variations in national immunization schedules and vaccine coverage make it difficult to select one denominator that would be applicable to all countries to allow comparisons. Moreover, we used the surviving infants obtained from UNDP as the denominator in calculating the AEFI reporting ratio, which implies that the focus of AEFI reporting is on vaccines administered during the first year of life. In many countries, however, vaccines are now used beyond that age group and AEFI reports may come from additional age groups. Although JRF data rely on information collected directly from countries, the consistency of reporting might vary. Vaccine safety data are collected by various units (e.g. immunization programs, regulatory authority, pharmacovigilance centres) within a country, yet not all of these units report AEFI cases through the JRF. As the JRF represents aggregate data, it is also impossible to verify the quality and completeness of the data.</p><p id="p0095">AEFI reporting, examination of reports, investigation of serious cases and adequate response to AEFI cases are essential to ensure the quality and safety of immunization services <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Distinguishing serious AEFI cases from other AEFI cases would help to better understand the type of events for which safety monitoring is conducted. According to WHO, serious AEFI or clusters of AEFIs also require prompt investigation and, therefore, could lend themselves to further evaluation, in particular for completeness and timeliness.</p><p id="p0100">Passive AEFI surveillance is one of the most basic components of a vaccine safety monitoring system. The ratio of number of AEFI reports to surviving infants provides an indication of reporting magnitude. Several more advanced indicators are required for monitoring specific AEFI reports, the quality of those reports and the quality of the response to serious AEFIs <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. For specific known vaccine reactions, the sensitivity and specificity of safety surveillance systems could also be monitored <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In considering enhancements to current JRF variables, inclusion of the source of safety surveillance data could provide valuable information on the level of information exchange between immunization programs and National Regulatory Authorities. With rapid advancement and progress in health information technologies, new information technology solutions that help to collate, transmit, analyse and process vaccine safety information will lead to more robust, consistent and timely vaccine safety monitoring systems in improving AEFI detection and reporting <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0105">AEFI reporting has increased over the past sixteen years in all parts of the world but remains non-existent or irregular in a majority of LMIC. The AEFI reporting ratio is useful for benchmarking and following trends over time; however, this ratio does not provide information on the quality of the reporting system and does not guarantee capacity to detect and manage a vaccine safety problem at a national level. Additional efforts are required to ensure and improve data quality, AEFI reporting and surveillance of immunization safety in every country.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="h0005">WHO, UNICEF, World Bank.
