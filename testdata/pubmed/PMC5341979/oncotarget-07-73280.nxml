Blood-vessel-embolic agents were essential in transarterial embolization (TAE). In this work, thermo-sensitive composite hydrogels based on poloxamer 407, sodium alginate, hydroxymethyl cellulose and iodixanol (PSHI), together with Ca2+ (PSHI-Ca2+) were prepared as liquid embolic agents for TAE therapy to liver cancer. With increasing temperature, PSHI exhibited two phase states: a flowing sol and a shrunken gel. Rheology tests showed good fluidity and excellent viscoelastic behavior with a gelation temperature (GT) of 26.5&#x000b0;C. The studies of erosion indicated that PSHI had calcium ion-related erosion characteristics and showed a slow erosion rate in an aqueous environment. When incubated with L929 cells, the thermo-sensitive composite hydrogels had low cytotoxicity <italic>in vitro</italic>. The results of analyzing the digital subtraction angiography and computed tomography images obtained from <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays indicated a good embolic effect in the renal arteries of normal rabbits.

Recently, the development of minimally invasive procedures including radiofrequency ablation (RFA) [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], transarterial embolization (TAE) [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] have played increasingly important roles in unresectable liver tumors. Interventional embolization therapy is an effective, first-line method for inoperable liver tumors and plays an important role in various diseases, including AVMs [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], hemorrhages [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], uterine fibroids [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and lung cancer [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Industrial advances have led to the clinical application of many materials for the occlusion of blood vessels. Granular embolic particles such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) are a type of permanent embolic agent due to their high effectiveness for interventional therapy. Due to their large size, mircoparticles were difficult to pass through a mircocatheter and enter the peripheral arteries [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Cyanoacrylates and Onyx have been widely used for many years as clipping and effective liquid embolic agents [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, these materials must be dissolved in organic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, which is toxic to normal tissues [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, a successful embolic agent for embolization therapy should meet the requirements of entering the peripheral blood vessels, where it develops high strength and provides drug loading abilities, especially in liver cancer.</p><p>Thermo-sensitive hydrogels are polymer materials that respond to small temperature changes to form a physically cross-linked hydrogel via a sol-gel phase transition. Hydrogels are easy to inject because they are free-flowing liquids with a lower critical solution and are transformed into a gel at body temperature. Some studies have also found that copolymers such as injectable hydrogels can be used as subcutaneous implants that are applied via minimally invasive procedures [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These copolymers are three-dimensional hydrophilic polymer networks that contain considerable water, which is nontoxic, and have rapidly reversible sol-gel transition behavior with changes in temperature [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Raymond studied poloxamer 407 as a temporary temperature-sensitive embolic agent in the arteries of several animals because of its fast erosion [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Adding macromolecules to a poloxamer gel has been proposed for the construction of composite hydrogels to improve their sustained release properties [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The copolymers can reinforce the poloxamer network by scaffolding or the interaction between the micelles and the network. Previous reports have shown that adding carrageenan, dextran and chitosan macromolecules to poloxamer 407 decreased its <italic>in vitro</italic> erosion and increased the intravaginal residence time [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, studies reported calcium ion cloud formed hydrogels with alginate via intramolecular bridges [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For these reasons, we added alginate into poloxamer 407 to increase the residence by calcium ions. In this study, we prepared a thermo-sensitive embolization delivery system based on sodium alginate and hydroxymethyl cellulose (HPMC) loaded with poloxamer 407 for the treatment of liver cancer. These composite hydrogels should be injectable at ambient temperature (&#x0003c;25&#x000b0;C) and transformed into a gel at body temperature (37&#x000b0;C). To optimize and demonstrate the potential of the composite hydrogels, we investigated the <italic>in vitro</italic> effect of the iodixanol and poloxamer 407 concentrations on the hydrogel behavior, rheology and erosion. Furthermore, the <italic>in vivo</italic> potential embolic efficiency of the thermo-sensitive composite hydrogels was studied in the renal arteries of normal rabbits and in VX2 tumors by angiography, computed tomography, and histological methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Sol-Gel transition of a PSHI aqueous solution</title><p>A solution with a high poloxamer 407 (P407) concentration (17%-22% w/v) was clear at 4&#x000b0;C. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> shows an example of a thermo-sensitive composite hydrogel set in an inverted tube. When the composite copolymer concentration reached the critical gelation concentration, the PSHI assumed transitioned from an aqueous solution to a gel as the temperature was increased from 4&#x000b0;C to 37&#x000b0;C. Solutions containing 0.5% sodium alginate (SA) had a shorter gelation time as the P407 concentration was increased from 18% w/v (gelation time = 110 s) to 22% w/v (gelation time = 80 s) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). When HPMC was added to the P407 solution for increasing the tightness of three-dimensional hydrophilic polymer networks, the same phenomenon occurred [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For visualization, a non-toxic x-ray contrast agent (Iodixanol) was added to the solution. When the iodixanol (23% v/v) was added, the gelation time decreased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), possibly because the hydrophilic iodixanol led to an increase in the overall hydrophilicity of the system. However, the incorporation of the iodixanol into a P407/alginate/HPMC solution did not change the trend of the gelation time curve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The Sol-Gel transition characteristics of a thermo-sensitive gel</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Phase changes with a temperature increase. <bold>B.</bold> The gelation time of different formulations with increasing concentrations of P407. &#x0201c;SA&#x0201d; indicates alginate, &#x0201c;I+SA&#x0201d; indicates alginate and iodixanol, &#x0201c;HPMC&#x0201d; indicates hydroxymethyl cellulose, &#x0201c;I+HPMC&#x0201d; indicates iodixanol and hydroxymethyl cellulose, &#x0201c;I+HPMC+SA&#x0201d; indicates iodixanol, hydroxymethyl cellulose and alignate. <bold>C.</bold> The gelation time of a thermo-sensitive gel influenced by different temperature differences (&#x00394;T).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-07-73280-g001"/></fig><p>The difference between the temperature of the PSHI before injection and the body temperature changed the sol&#x02013;gel transition, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>.

These results allowed the sol-gel transition phase characteristics to be adjusted by altering the temperature difference and the formulation for TAE therapy with an embolic agent.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Rheological analysis of PSHI aqueous solution</title><p>The formation of the thermo-sensitive composite hydrogels was examined using rheometry. The viscosity of PSHI was evaluated at a fixed frequency of 1Hz and a heating rate of 1&#x000b0;C/min. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> shows the effect of a temperature increase from 15&#x000b0;C-40&#x000b0;C on the shear stress. The shear stress of the PSHI samples increased from 0.5 Pa to 200Pa as the temperature was increased and reached equilibrium at 32&#x000b0;C. The viscosity increased from approximately 0.2 to 3000 Pa s as the temperature was increased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> shows the viscosity data for an 18% P407 PSHI solution with a gelation temperature (GT) of 26.5&#x000b0;C. The storage modulus (G&#x02019;) and viscosity (&#x003b7;) of the PSHI samples increased with temperature from 15&#x000b0;C to 26.5&#x000b0;C. Above the gelation temperature, the storage modulus (G&#x02019;) and the viscosity (&#x003b7;) stabilized as the temperature increased. These results demonstrated that the composite hydrogel had a thermo-sensitive response and that the structure of the copolymers was stable. In this study, PSHI solution showed better flowability at room temperature and was suitable for TAE treatment.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>A.</bold> The shear stress of PSHI with a temperature increase. <bold>B.</bold> The total viscoelasticity of 18% PSHI.

Poloxamer 407 exhibited a thermo-reversible sol-gel transition as the temperature changed [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C-2D</xref>, G&#x02019; and &#x003b7; increased as the P407 concentration increased.

These results indicated that P407 was essential to the thermo-sensitive characteristics of PSHI. A liquid embolic agent must have a high strength, but PSHI had a low strength. As previous study showed that a calcium cloud formed a gel in the presence of alginate [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The addition of calcium to the poloxamer gel was proposed to improve the strength of the PSHI in further studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Influence of calcium ion on erosion of PSHI</title><p>The erosion behavior of 18% PSHI was investigated. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the presence of calcium ions notably influenced the hydrogel erosion rate of PSHI. Results showed that approximately 50% PSHI dissolved within 150 min when incubated in PBS. When calcium was added, the weight of hydrogel remained unchanged for 5 h. As we tested, the maximum calcium loading capacity was 8.08&#x000b1;0.08 mg/ml PSHI solution. Obviously, PSHI was an interesting hydrogel of which the erosion was controlled by the calcium ion in aqueous environment. This phenomenon might be a result of interactions of the calcium, P407, alginate and HPMC.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>A.</bold> Erosion of PSHI-Ca2<sup>+</sup> incubated with PBS compared to PSHI alone. <bold>B.</bold>

DSA images at various times are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Before embolization, the contrast agent iodixanol was injected to fill the blood vessel for superselection. As the DSA images in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A1-4A3</xref> showed, the blood vessels were clearly evident before embolization. After embolization, the iodixanol solution was injected again to evaluate the embolic efficacy. The solution did not diffuse into the embolized kidney but refluxed to other unembolized blood vessels, as treated by PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B2</xref>). No obvious difference in the DSA images was found before (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A1</xref>) and after embolization with saline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B1-4C1</xref>). Five minutes after embolization with PSHI, the renal arteries were gray, which indicated that they were successfully occluded (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B3</xref>). However, 30 min after embolization, the renal arteries were visible again, which suggested that the arteries were recanalized (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C3</xref>). In contrast, the renal arteries remained gray with PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> after 30 minutes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B2-4C2</xref>), suggesting that the arteries were successfully embolized. These results demonstrated that PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> had an excellent embolic efficacy for the peripheral arteries.</p><p>The embolization efficacy was subsequently assessed by CT.

After occlusion for 2 h, the medulla of the right kidney became white, clearly because the iodixoanol solution had not completely dissipated, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A1</xref>. The same phenomenon occurred after a rabbit was treated with PSHI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A3</xref>), implying that the renal arteries were recanalized. The contour of the kidney was clearly apparent after embolization with PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A2</xref>), suggesting that the renal arteries had been successfully embolized. The medullary white zone completely disappeared 12 h after embolization with saline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B1</xref>) and PSHI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B3</xref>), indicating that the iodixanol was fully dissipated and that the renal arteries were unembolized. The white zone of the kidney cortex is still evident in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B2</xref> due to the embolic efficacy of PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Karyolysis, pyknosis and karyorrhexis were observed in the PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> group, implying tumor necrosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A2</xref>). In the PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B2</xref>), the endometrial structure of the embolized hepatic arteries surrounding the tumor was deformed in comparison to the saline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B1</xref>) and PSHI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B3</xref>) groups.

Previous studies indicated that an appropriate gelation temperature for a thermo-sensitive hydrogel allowed the hydrogel to be in the liquid phase at room temperature and transformed to the gel phase at body temperature [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Rheological studies indicated that PSHI had a lower viscosity and exhibited flowable-sol phases as the temperature changed. Viscosity results confirmed that PSHI solutions were suitable for injecting through catheters with a GT of 26.5&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Compared with PSHI, PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> showed a slow erosion rate in an aqueous environment. A possibly mechanism of the effect of calcium on PSHI erosion is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Scheme 1</xref>. A calcium ion cloud forms intermolecular bridges via ionic bonds with the carboxyl group in alginate, resulting in the gelification of the alginate [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A similar process occurs when a PSHI solution comes into contact with calcium. Before the PSHI comes into contact with the calcium, the alginate exists as a network that is seemingly absorbed on the poloxamer 407 micelles. As the temperature increases, the poloxamer 407 micelles form a close three-dimensional hydrophilic polymer networks, leading to a sol-to-gel phase transition. In the presence of calcium, the packed poloxamer 407 micelles allow the Ca<sup>2+</sup> to diffuse, and a network gradually forms. This hypothesis helps explain the gradual erosion in the presence of calcium, but it still must be experimentally verified.</p><fig id="F9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><title>Scheme 1: Proposed schematic illustration for possible embolization mechanisms of PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> thermo-sensitive composite hydrogels.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-07-73280-g009"/></fig><p>P407, SA and HPMC are biocompatible polymers, and cytotoxicity was not expected from mixing these polymers. The results of this study demonstrated that PSHI had low cytotoxicity. However, conventional liquid embolic agents such as Onyx were toxic [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Overall, the composite hydrogel is suitable candidates for embolic delivery due to their low cytotoxicity.</p><p>The aim of this study was to demonstrate the ability of PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> to occlude a blood vessel <italic>in vivo</italic> and thus confirm its potential as a liquid embolic agent intransarterial embolization therapy. In this work, PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> was shown to successfully occlude rabbit normal renal artery and tumor. Moreover, the necrosis level and gel distribution indicated that the composite hydrogel had occluded the peripheral blood vessels during TAE therapy. In addition, an <italic>ex vivo</italic> histological analysis of the major organs after treatment showed no noticeable damage to the organs and a low toxicity of localized treatment. While, the percutaneous ethanol injection could damage the liver and cause serious painful to patients [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, TAE therapy with thermo-sensitive composite PSHI-Ca2+ hydrogels could be a promising embolic agent for liver tumor treatment. PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exhibited excellent embolism efficacy, the injection method was complicated. The injection method should be improved in future studies. The duration and stability of the embolization and the post-embolization drawback should be optimized. Further researches should be taken to explore the characteristics of drug loading PSHI-Ca<sup>2+</sup> for chemoembolic-based tumor treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Materials</title><p>Poloxamer 407 (P407) and hydroxymethyl cellulose (HPMC-100M) were purchased from BASF Co., Ltd.
