Group 1 Aperfix implant were used which can be able to perform non anatomical femoral tunnel and intra tunnel fixation with transtibial technique. In Group 2 Endobutton CL implant were used which can make fixation from outside the cortex with anatomic femoral tunnel in use of anteromedial portal techniques. 27 patients (average age 29,33, range 18 to 55 years) in group 1 and 27 patients (average age 27,51, range 16 to 45 years) in group 2 totally 54 patients were performed surgery. All patients were assessed using the IKDC (International knee documentation committee), Tegner Activity Scala and Lysholm II Functional Scores. Muscle strength measurements in both groups compared to intact knee was measured with an isokinetic dynamometer Biodex System 3 Pro. The location of the femoral tunnel aperture and tunnel widening were imaged with 3D reconstructive computed tomography. All measurements were performed using the same software application by the same radiologist.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The two groups were similar with respect to age and sex distribution, operated side, the size of the tunnel created, and follow-up period (p&#x0003e;0.05). After surgery in both groups, the clinical scores showed significant improvement compared to preoperative (p=0,0001). However, postoperative clinical outcomes in the two groups did not show a difference significantly (p&#x0003e;0,005). Isokinetic muscle strength study showed significant differences between the two groups (p=0,0001). Location of femoral tunnel aperture on the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle showed a significant differences in the two groups (p=0,0001). The expansion of proximal and distal femoral tunnel in two groups showed significant differences (p=0,0001). There was relationship between distal femoral tunnel widening and location of femoral tunnel aperture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Although there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups clinically, difference noticed in terms of isokinetic muscle strength may be due to differences in the degree of shift as a result of multiple loading depending on the biomechanical properties of materials. We thought that the difference seen in the widening of tunnel in the proximal or distal may be due to, the technique of graft fixation, the distance between the fixation point and the joint, and to the location of the femoral tunnel aperture on medial wall of lateral condyle from anatomical or non anatomical region. There is no golden standard in neither surgical technique nor material of fixation. Proper theoretical knowledge and extensive clinical experience are important in the light of an accurate surgical technique applied. We thought that information we have reached in our study should be supported by biomechanical studies</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front></article>
