Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) with urine loss occurring during periods of increased abdominal pressure such as sneezing, coughing or exercise resulting from incompetent closure of the urethra and bladder neck has been reported in as many as 40% of women after menopause. It is often associated in pure form or as mixed incontinence (urge with stress incontinence) in women with utero-vaginal prolapse when it usually does not respond well to medications or physiotherapy alone. The minimally invasive option of trans-vaginal tape (TVT) introduction with utero-vaginal prolapse surgery has satisfactory results in this group of women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>This pilot study attempted to assess the safety and efficacy of inside-out technique of TVT-obturator (TVT-O) for treatment of SUI in women with utero-vaginal prolapse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 30 subjects with genuine SUI (diagnosed subjectively on the basis of history of SUI and objectively on demonstration of urinary spurt on coughing with a comfortably full bladder after reposition of cystocoele) with varying degree of utero-vaginal prolapse that were to be taken for surgical management of prolapse were enrolled after counseling. Menstrual, obstetric, past, personal and medical history was elicited and detailed examination including study of vitals, general examination, systemic examination, per speculum examination and per vaginum examination was done. A post-void residual urine volume assessment was done. Urge incontinence was excluded by history and urinary tract infection (UTI) was excluded by urine analysis. Subjects with senile vaginitis were advised pre-operative local estriol application for a minimum of 2 weeks to improve the condition of the vaginal mucosa.</p><p>The subjects were posted for TVT-O surgery along with the necessary concomitant surgery for utero-vaginal prolapse. Prophylactic antibiotics (broad spectrum) were given. The indwelling Foley's catheter was removed on the 5<sup>th</sup> post-operative day if associated anterior colporrhaphy was performed and on 2<sup>nd</sup> post-operative day if no anterior colporrhaphy was performed. The post-void residual urinary volume was measured. A post-void residual value of less than 100 ml was considered as normal and the subjects were discharged with the advice of follow-up visit at 14 days after surgery, 3 months and 12 months after surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The mean age of our subjects was 48.8 years while the mean parity was 3.8.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> presents the baseline characteristics of our subjects - 50% of the subjects were post-menopausal, 83.3% had third degree utero-vaginal prolapse while 96.7% had associated cystocoele, with the majority (46.6%) having second degree cystocoele.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JMH-4-221-g001"/></table-wrap><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows the average time taken for the procedure was 7.8 min.

A total of five subjects had UTI (three who had urinary retention also), one had vaginal wound sepsis with pyrexia and dehiscence while the other had only UTI.

Our de-novo urgency rates (11.5%) were similar to those noted by Teo[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] (11.3%) (range being 2% by Lim and Quinlan[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] to 13.9% by Biggs <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]).

The short and medium term objective and subjective success rates appear comparable with the traditional Burch colposuspension and the retropubic TVT (tension free vaginal tape) procedure. The overall complication rate is low, satisfaction is high and quality-of-life improved after treatment. The TVT-O appears to have performed favorably as a safe and effective alternative to the other traditional treatments for SUI associated with utero-vaginal prolapse.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
