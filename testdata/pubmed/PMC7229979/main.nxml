A novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) was identified as the cause of the infections (<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>) and has since spread worldwide. As of May 7, 2020, more than 3.6 million cases of COVID-19 (illness caused by SARS-COV-2) have been reported in 184 countries and territories, including &#x0223c;250,000 deaths (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>). The pandemic has overwhelmed both national and local healthcare capacity in several countries (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Kissler et al., 2020</xref>), and is projected to do so in many others. Low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable (<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2020</xref>), since financial and logistical challenges may hinder their ability to augment treatment capacity. As such, many countries have resorted to societal-wide social distancing interventions in the hopes of reducing morbidity and delaying the demand for healthcare resources, to gain time to increase treatment capacity.</p><p id="par0035">Numerous modeling efforts have forecast the spread of the outbreak and examined the potential benefits of social-distancing interventions (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Flaxman et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Kissler et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2020</xref>). While informative, these efforts have been limited to specific nations and snapshots in time; public health officials are reliant on the authors for updated estimates as the pandemic evolves. Other internet-based tools offer public health users the ability to generate estimates on their own; however, these are limited in their practical utility because their assumptions and desired results may not match the specific needs of jurisdictions and public health decision-makers, or they require coding knowledge to access or modify the calculations (<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Penn Healthcare, 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Henderson, 2020</xref>). These considerations are more critical in low and middle-income countries, which may not have the resources to complete or modify such analyses on their own.</p><p id="par0040">Therefore, we developed a modeling tool for use by practicing public health officials to estimate the future impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on demand for healthcare resources in their jurisdictions and to examine the costs and benefits of various intervention strategies. Once downloaded, the model can be used without an internet connection to assist public health officials in choosing locally appropriate intervention strategies and by how much to increase hospital treatment capacity. For illustration, we apply the model to Chile, a Southern Hemisphere country where the virus is generating local transmission and compare various intervention options in the three most affected regions of the country.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec0015"><title>Tool overview</title><p id="par0045">We created a spreadsheet-based tool (Supplementary Material S1) that uses a Susceptible-Latent-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) Compartmental Model to project the future impact of a COVID-19 epidemic among any population of interest. The model requires information that is typically available to public health officials, including the number of cases in their jurisdiction, the size and demographics of their at-risk population, healthcare capacity, expectations for healthcare use, and societal-wide choices of social-distancing mitigation strategies that users wish to evaluate. Model outputs reflect the potential demand on the healthcare system due to severely ill individuals with and without user-specified mitigation strategies, as well as deaths averted through treatment and excess deaths due to healthcare demand exceeding capacity. The demand for healthcare resources is measured as the estimated number of COVID-19 patients requiring critical-care or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, hospital beds (non-ICU), and mechanical ventilators throughout the outbreak and the maximum occupancy at the outbreak's peak. The tool offers users the ability to evaluate various intervention strategies currently under consideration or in use worldwide (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Kissler et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Willem et al., 2020</xref>).

The initial number of susceptible individuals is set as the population minus the cumulative number infected since the outbreak&#x02019;s start. Transmission occurs through contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals, and we assume an equal probability any one person has contact with another (&#x0201c;homogenous mixing&#x0201d;). We also assume transmission chains generated by infected travelers entering the population are minimal compared to existing transmission in the community. As a result, the number of new infections each day is the product of the proportion of the population that is susceptible, the number of infectious persons on a given day, and the average number of new infections each infected person causes over the course of their illness (the reproduction number; hereafter, "R") divided by the duration (in days) of the average infectious period. Infectiousness is assumed to occur five days after infection (<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Lauer et al., 2020</xref>) and lasts 11 days (<xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">You et al., 2020</xref>). Upon recovery from infection, individuals are assumed immune to re-infection during the timespan modeled (through December 2020). In the absence of intervention R is 2.0 (low estimate) and 2.8 (high estimate), approximately spanning the middle 50% of the gamma distribution of R (95% intervals: 1.4-3.8) estimated from the initial growth rate of the epidemic in Wuhan (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Riou and Althaus, 2020</xref>). To account for uncertainty in R, all results are depicted as a range based on these low and high estimates for R. During periods when interventions are applied, we reduce R's low and high estimates by the values in <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Upon mitigation concluding, R returns to pre-mitigation levels to illustrate the potential consequences of shorter duration interventions. However, advanced users can alter the tool so that when one mitigation strategy concludes, another begins. Finally, we do not account for any vaccine, as it is only likely to be available beyond the modeled time frame (<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Li and De Clercq, 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Nature, 2020</xref>).

We implemented the following three intervention strategies (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) in each region, beginning April 1: Strategy 1) Closure of schools and universities and telework for eight months; Strategy 2) Case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals &#x0003e;70 years, and telework for eight months; and Strategy 3) Lockdown for two months (six months shorter duration than the other strategies because the social and economic costs of this suppression strategy are not considered sustainable for the long-term).

Next, we evaluated the impact of combining the Lockdown strategy with all other strategies, so that when the Lockdown strategy ends, another mitigation strategy begins and lasts six months.

The benefit of this approach is an additional one to two months delay in peak demand timing beyond delays afforded by each of the mitigation strategies on their own. This approach, however, has no effect on the amount of demand (i.e., peak demand is similar to the mitigation strategy without lockdown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0070"><title>Discussion</title><p id="par0140">In the absence of immunization, our illustrative results suggest the number of severely ill patients could overwhelm treatment capacity as early as late May to mid-June in all three regions of Chile we evaluated. Our projections also suggest that with immediate aggressive action to implement several combinations of interventions, the current number of hospital beds and critical care beds may be sufficient. In specific circumstances, regional authorities may find it easier to augment their current capacity (e.g., ventilators in &#x000d1;uble) along with some mitigation strategies to meet demand versus strictly burdening society with disruptive mitigations. However, policymakers should be aware that our results indicate that more effective intervention strategies at temporarily suppressing transmission can also result in more massive epidemics upon lifting the strategies, compared to less effective, longer-lasting strategies (in the absence of vaccine and changes in individual behavior). As such, it may be necessary to keep societal-wide interventions in place, or intermittently start and stop them again based on active monitoring of cases counts and treatment capacity, or until a vaccine, or a treatment that can be administered outside of the hospital setting are available.</p><p id="par0145">While our projections are reasonable estimates for how the pandemic may play out given our current understanding of SARS-CoV-2, they should not be considered as forecasts of what will occur. This is due to the uncertainty in our knowledge of an outbreak that is still unfolding, the application of experiences of other countries to Chile (such as case severity, resource use by non-COVID patients, intervention effectiveness, compliance over time), simplifying assumptions (such as homogenous mixing), and case surveillance uncertainty. We assumed homogenous mixing to make implementing our model in a spreadsheet more tractable, but as a result, do not reflect potentially significant variations in contact patterns stemming from population social and spatial structures or behavioral differences that can affect disease dynamics. Because obtaining accurate data regarding contact patterns during an ongoing outbreak is challenging, and because these patterns may evolve along with the outbreak, we chose to focus on producing the simplest useful model. To address case surveillance uncertainty, users can scale upwards or downwards their case count inputs occurring over the prior two weeks based on perceived underreporting or overreporting and examine the influence on outputs (as we did in our illustrative scenario). Similarly, all assumptions and sources are explicitly presented in the tool, and all can be readily modified by users to reflect their interests, and as new information comes to light. Therefore, users should consider that the value of this tool is its ability to support the evaluation of relative differences in results associated with "what-if" scenarios.</p><p id="par0150">Our COVID model has other limitations worth noting. Our estimates of beds and ventilators needed and the number of deaths averted also depends on associated resources not modeled here. Such resources include trained staff (respiratory therapists, nurses, and physicians) for the successful clinical management of hospitalized and ventilated patients and ancillary supplies associated with a bed or ventilator (e.g., electric circuits, oxygen, etc.). Furthermore, these resources may be impacted by the pandemic itself, e.g. staff absenteeism due to illnesses (<xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Wu and McGoogan, 2020</xref>) and supply-chain disruptions in personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare personnel may further exacerbate the situation. The effects of seasonality on the transmission dynamics of COVID19 remains unclear, but the transmission of similar respiratory illnesses (e.g., influenza, syncytial virus) peaks in the wintertime (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Lipsitch and Viboud, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Shaman and Kohn, 2009</xref>). If COVID19 exhibits similar seasonality, or patients with these other illnesses place additional demands on the healthcare system, there may be even fewer resources available to treat COVID19 patients at the epidemic&#x02019;s peak. Finally, we do not differentiate between specialized pediatric and non-pediatric resources. While this is justifiable because the current pandemic does not appear to pose a high enough risk to children to overwhelm pediatric healthcare capacity (<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Riou et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Verity et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), users of the tool should take note of this meaningful difference when inputting resource amounts.</p><sec id="sec0075"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="par0155">Our model allows decision-makers to examine the impacts of the current COVID-19 pandemic in their jurisdictions and evaluate the effects of various social-distancing mitigation strategies and augmenting treatment capacity on morbidity and mortality. Our illustrative scenario demonstrates the need for policymakers to take immediate and aggressive actions, and if they do so, substantial morbidity and mortality may be averted. As more data become available (e.g., new treatments or healthcare capacity is augmented) and the pandemic evolves (e.g., COVID case counts), our tool permits rapid updating of results applicable for making decisions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="sec0080"><title>Declaration of interest</title><p id="par0160">All authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec0085"><title>Funding</title><p id="par0165">Eduardo A.
