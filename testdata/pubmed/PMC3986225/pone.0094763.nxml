The aim of this study is to explore the role of vaspin in the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in humans through a longitudinal process. This was a 2-year follow-up study that included 132 patients with T2DM and 170 non-diabetic subjects. The serum vaspin and adiponectin levels were determined with ELISA. Anthropometric measurements, circulating glucose, hemoglobin A1c, insulin level, liver function, kidney function, and lipid profile were measured for each participant. The new onset of T2DM was counted in non-diabetic subjects and the glycemic control was analyzed in T2DM patients at follow-up. At enrollment, the serum vaspin and adiponectin levels were lower in T2DM patients compared with non-diabetic subjects. Significant positive correlation between serum vaspin and HDL-C levels (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.23, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.006) was observed in non-diabetic controls. The serum vaspin concentration was also significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.19, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.028), waist-hip ratio (WHR) (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.17, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.035) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.14, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.029) in T2DM patients. In cohort analyses, it was found that lower serum vaspin [odds ratio (OR)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.10&#x02013;0.87, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.015] and adiponectin (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.35, 95% CI: 0.20&#x02013;0.72, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.015) levels at baseline were risk factors for new onset of T2DM at follow-up. The percentage of insulin treatment in T2DM patients was higher in the sub-group with lower serum vaspin level than that in the sub-group with higher vaspin level at follow-up (55.3% vs. 44.7%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.020). Our study indicates that low serum concentration of vaspin is a risk factor for the progression of T2DM.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grant from National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30900699).

Some adipocytokines are involved in the development of insulin resistance, which is an important pathological link among various metabolic dysfunctions, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases <xref rid="pone.0094763-Kershaw1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Among the adipocytokines, adiponectin is one of the most-studied and proved to have beneficial effects on insulin resistance. Adiponectin ameliorates insulin sensitivity and stimulates fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and also has anti-inflammatory effects in blood vessels <xref rid="pone.0094763-Cnop1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094763-Lindsay1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Lower serum concentration of adiponectin also predicts higher risk of diabetes in human, suggesting an important role of adiponectin that links obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) <xref rid="pone.0094763-Berg1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094763-Yamauchi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Vaspin (visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor), a novel adipocytokine, was firstly identified in obese OLETF rats. It has been suggested that vaspin has potential insulin-sensitizing effects <xref rid="pone.0094763-Hida1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Vaspin significantly improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice. In db/db mice, vaspin treatment is associated with sustained glucose-lowering effects for at least 6 days after the injection <xref rid="pone.0094763-Kloting1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In humans, vaspin expression in terms of mRNA was detected in human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue <xref rid="pone.0094763-Kloting2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Recent studies also found that vaspin gene expression in human adipose tissue and circulating vaspin levels were positively associated with obesity-associated diseases and T2DM <xref rid="pone.0094763-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094763-Choi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, it is indicated that vaspin plays a role in adipoinsular axis, and may be associated with insulin resistance in obese subjects, including patients with T2DM and polycystic ovary syndrome <xref rid="pone.0094763-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, all these data suggest that vaspin may be involved in the glucose metabolism and the development of T2DM in human. Vaspin has been shown to significantly improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in murine and to be positively associated with obesity-related diseases in human <xref rid="pone.0094763-Aktas1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which seems to be conflicting with each other. Hida K's study demonstrated that vaspin was barely detectable in OLETF rat at 6 weeks and was highly expressed in adipocytes of visceral white adipose tissues at 30 weeks, the age when obesity, body weight, and insulin levels peak in OLETF rats. The tissue expression of vaspin and its serum levels decreased with worsening of diabetes and body weight loss at 50 wk <xref rid="pone.0094763-Hida1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These results indicate that the levels of serum vaspin may change with the progression of diabetes. Vaspin may increase at the beginning and decrease with worsening of diabetes in human. A significant correlation between serum vaspin and leptin concentrations supports previous human studies that serum vaspin concentration reflects body fat mass in human <xref rid="pone.0094763-Aust1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Vaspin may have a compensatory role in insulin resistance in human obesity-associated diseases. Up to date, all studies on roles of vaspin in human metabolic diseases were cross-sectional, but not cohort studies. Therefore, it is still unclear what the real role of vaspin is in the progression of diabetes in a longitudinal process.</p><p>Hypothetically, just like adiponectin, low vaspin level might be concomitant with poor glycemic control in diabetic patients because of its impact on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. To our knowledge, the role of vaspin in glycemic control in diabetic patients has not been addressed in previous studies. In this 2.0-year follow-up study, our aims were to examine 1) whether serum vaspin levels are associated with adiposity and insulin-resistance; 2) whether non-diabetic subjects with lower serum vaspin levels are more susceptible to developing T2DM; 3) whether lower vaspin levels are concomitant with poorer glycemic control in T2DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>All subjects were local residents of Han ethnicity in Shanghai and consecutively recruited in Department of Endocrinology, Xinhua hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine from Oct 2009 to Mar 2010. T2DM was diagnosed according to 1999 WHO diagnostic criteria <xref rid="pone.0094763-Grimaldi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The non-diabetic subjects were recruited from those in-patients admitted to hospital due to hypertension or other mild cardiovascular symptoms. Subjects with mild cardiovascular symptoms were those with chief complaints including mild chest distress or chest pain, excluding acute coronary syndrome or acute myocardial infarction by simultaneous coronary angiography, electrocardiogram, and tests of myocardial enzymes. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) was confirmed by c peptide level and presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody. Patients with T1DM, severe kidney or liver diseases, severe cardiovascular diseases, chronic viral or bacterial infection, asthma, tumors, and connective tissue diseases were excluded. Non-diabetic subjects in our study were those simultaneously match the following three criteria: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration less than 6.1 mmol/L; 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2h-PG) concentration less than 7.8 mmmol/L and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) less than 6.0%.

FPG, 2h-PG, serum liver and renal function and lipid profile were measured by using standard laboratory techniques on a Hitachi 7104 Analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). HbA1c was determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography (Hi-AUTO HA-8150, ARKRAY, Kyoto, Japan) method. Serum insulin concentrations were determined by commercially available radioimmunoassay in non-diabetic subjects and insulin-naive T2DM patients (Linco Res., St. Charles, MO, USA). Insulin sensitivity index: homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated by the formula as reported before <xref rid="pone.0094763-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Serum vaspin and adiponectin levels were determined in all subjects at baseline.

The degree of precision of the ELISA system in terms of coefficient of variance (percent) of intra-assay was between 1.31% and 1.74%, and that of inter-assays was between 5.9% and 8.3%.

However, the real role of vaspin on glucose dysregulation in humans is not well understood. Our longitudinal study analyzed the independent roles of vaspin and adiponectin in the incidence of T2DM in non-diabetic subjects and long-time glycemic control in patients with T2DM. We herein present novel evidence that decreased baseline serum vaspin is an independent risk factor for subsequent occurrence of diabetes in non-diabetic subjects and higher percentage of insulin treatment in diabetic patients.</p><p>Although results of animal studies indicate that vaspin is an insulin-sensitizing adipocytokine, the real role of vaspin in human insulin resistance is still unclear <xref rid="pone.0094763-Seeger1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094763-Youn1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. A study performed in adolescents found that the serum vaspin concentration increased with worsening insulin resistance and was acutely down-regulated following glucose provocation in insulin-resistant adolescents <xref rid="pone.0094763-Korner1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In overweight women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, vaspin was found to be positively associated with BMI and WHR. Furthermore, the expression of vaspin in omental adipose tissue was reduced by metformin treatment in accordance with the decrease in insulin resistance <xref rid="pone.0094763-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In another study performed in the morbidly obese women, the vaspin mRNA expression was significantly higher in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue than lean controls <xref rid="pone.0094763-Auguet1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, inconsistent results were also found in other studies. In Youn's study, no difference was found in circulating vaspin levels between individuals with normal glucose tolerance and T2DM. T2DM seems to abrogate the correlation between circulating vaspin, BMI, and insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0094763-Youn1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In another cross-sectional study performed in normal volunteers, glucose tolerance status and insulin sensitivity measured using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and HOMA-IR were not found to be associated with serum vaspin levels <xref rid="pone.0094763-vonLoeffelholz1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In our study, obese diabetic patients had a tendency of having increased serum vaspin, and increased HOMA-IR was found in diabetic patients with higher vaspin levels. In the correlation analysis, we have observed a significant positive association of vaspin with HOMA-IR in diabetic group and HDL-C in control group, which was consistent with the results from some other studies <xref rid="pone.0094763-Seeger1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094763-Giomisi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The latter studies found that circulating vaspin level was positively correlated with HDL-C in healthy subjects and negatively correlated with detrimental lipid parameters (TC, TG and LDL-C) in pregnant women. Results from the present and previous studies suggest that vaspin plays a role in human insulin resistance and lipid metabolism <xref rid="pone.0094763-Genc1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Vaspin may be a compensatory molecule in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and obesity associated diseases <xref rid="pone.0094763-Wada1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It can be postulated that vaspin, as a serine protease inhibitor, inhibits a protease which plays a role in the degradation of a hormone or molecule with direct or indirect glucose and lipid lowering effects <xref rid="pone.0094763-Kloting1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094763-Shaker1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In our study, lower vaspin levels were found in T2DM patients than those in control subjects. This result may be due to the long mean diabetes duration of our T2DM patients (10.5 years). The long diabetes duration and insulin treatment may affect the vaspin levels and thus induce the decrease of vaspin in our T2DM group than in non-diabetic group <xref rid="pone.0094763-Hida1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094763-Seeger1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Gulcelik's research found that serum vaspin levels in diabetic patients with chronic complications including neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy were lower than those without above complications <xref rid="pone.0094763-Gulcelik1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Another study detected lower serum concentrations of vaspin in patients with carotid stenosis who experienced an ischemic event compared with asymptomatic patients <xref rid="pone.0094763-Aust1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The above results indicate that diabetic patients with lower vaspin levels may have poor outcomes and higher prevalence of micro- or macro-vascular complications during a long time. In our T2DM patients at follow-up, there were no significant associations between serum vaspin levels and glycemic controls. This result may be due to the confounding effects of drug administration during the follow-up. However, higher percentage of insulin administration at follow-up in diabetic patients was found in those with lower vaspin levels. In non-diabetic group, it was also found that lower vaspin level was associated with elevated glycemic levels and higher incidence of T2DM at follow-up. From above results, it could be speculated that low vaspin levels might be involved in poor glycemic control and other detrimental metabolic effects, and thus play a role in development of chronic diabetic complications in T2DM patients.</p><p>In our study, it was found that adiponectin was an independent risk factor for new onset of T2DM in non-diabetic subjects at follow-up, which was accordant with some other studies <xref rid="pone.0094763-Fagerberg1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094763-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Even though adiponectin and vaspin may both play beneficial roles in insulin resistance, the reported relationships between serum vaspin and adiponectin were controversial. In Giomisi's investigation, significant positive association between serum vaspin and adiponectin levels was detected in women of child-bearing age <xref rid="pone.0094763-Giomisi1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, in a study performed in pubertal obese children and adolescents, vaspin levels were negatively correlated with adiponectin levels <xref rid="pone.0094763-Suleymanoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In another study performed in mice, it was found that increased expression of adiponectin was detected in high fat high sucrose chow ICR mice treated with vaspin <xref rid="pone.0094763-Hida1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the correlation analysis of our study, the serum vaspin levels did not correlate with serum adiponectin levels. These results indicate that the relationship between serum adiponectin and vaspin levels can be affected by age, body weight and other metabolic status.</p><p>Several limitations should be considered before results interpretation. First, the control subjects were not normal people, but inpatients with hypertension or other mild cardiovascular diseases. This inclusion method can not exclude some confounding effects, including the effects of diseases itself and drugs treatment. However, people with high risk of T2DM constituted the control group, which might be partially responsible for the high occurrence of T2DM at follow-up and higher statistical power in small sample size. Second, the T2DM patients were not enrolled at the onset of the disease. The different duration of T2DM and different treatment in each patient may incorporate a possible source of selection bias. Third, the relatively small sample size in this study will decrease the statistical power, and further studies with larger sample size should be performed in the future to validate our results. Fourth, the relatively short follow-up period will weaken the effects of vaspin on glucose levels and chronic complications in T2DM group. Nevertheless, this cohort study provides support to the role of vaspin in glycemic control in non-diabetic people.</p><p>In conclusion, low circulating vaspin level, as well as adiponectin level can be used as risk factors for the progression of T2DM. Further prospective observational studies are required to explain how a decrease in circulating vaspin level may be involved in the progression of T2DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0094763.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
