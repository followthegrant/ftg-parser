Although neutralizing antibodies are considered to represent an important mechanism of protective immunity, anti-PRRSV antibodies, in particular at subneutralizing concentrations, have also been reported to exacerbate PRRSV infection, probably through Fc&#x003b3;R-mediated uptake of antibody-opsonized PRRSV, resulting in enhanced infection of, and replication in, target cells. Therefore, we investigated this pathway using sera from an animal experiment in which vaccine-mediated enhancement of clinical symptoms was observed. Three groups of six pigs were vaccinated with an inactivated PRRSV vaccine based on the PRRSV-1 subtype 3 strain Lena and challenged after a single or a prime-boost immunization protocol, or injected with PBS. We specifically tested if sera obtained from these animals can enhance macrophage infections, viral shedding, or cytokine release at different dilutions. Neither the presence of neutralizing antibodies nor general anti-PRRSV antibodies, mediated an enhanced infection, increased viral release or cytokine production by macrophages. Taken together, our data indicate that the exacerbated disease was not caused by antibodies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PRRSV-1</kwd><kwd>inactivated vaccine</kwd><kwd>homologous challenge</kwd><kwd><italic>in vivo</italic></kwd><kwd>antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease</kwd><kwd>monocyte-derived macrophages</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-11-00829"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is a phenomenon that has been associated with many different viruses, such as lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], HIV-1 [<xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], dengue virus [<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and FMDV [<xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For some of these infections, this in vitro phenomenon has been associated with immunity-enhanced disease. A typical example of this is Dengue [<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the other hand, for other infections, even closely related ones such as JEV, no association of ADE antibodies with adverse vaccine effects or pre-existing immunity have been reported [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Typically, ADE was found at subneutralizing concentrations, at which antibodies are binding to the virus but are not sufficiently numerous to mediate neutralization. This binding facilitates viral uptake through FcRs, typically for IgG isotype antibodies. Alternatively, the antibodies can be specific for viral epitopes that are non-neutralizing. Theoretically, if the virus can replicate in FcR-expressing cells such as monocytes and macrophages, this would increase the viral replication and viral load, leading to more severe symptoms. Alternatively, or in addition, immune complexes can trigger an increased release of cytokines, which could potentially exacerbate symptoms [<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or indirectly downregulate an antiviral response [<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This depends on the predominant antibody isotype and its preferential binding to either inhibitory or stimulatory FcRs.</p><p>ADE of disease in PRRSV was first described by Yoon et al., who investigated the enhancement of infection of alveolar macrophages and also found increased viremia and shedding of virus in vivo, after serum transfer to reach subneutralizing antibody titers [<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. They found that neutralizing antibodies with titers of 4 log<sub>2</sub> were protective, but titers of 1 log<sub>2</sub> increased viremia. In this study, the prototype PRRSV-2 strain VR-2332 was used. The same authors subsequently tested antibodies against this strain also for their ability to enhance the infection with heterologous strains and found a strain-dependent enhancement [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Further in vitro studies indicated the involvement of all three Fc&#x003b3; receptors [<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Using monoclonal antibodies, the Gp5/M complex was identified as a possible target for ADE antibodies [<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Despite these studies, it is important to note that to our knowledge, enhanced disease after experimental vaccination with live attenuated vaccines (LAV) has not been observed, although the challenge infections were frequently performed in absence of neutralizing antibodies. There is also no indication that re-exposure with an antigenically distinct PRRSV strain that is not neutralized can result in enhanced disease [<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>However, in a vaccination challenge experiment, we found evidence for vaccine-induced enhanced disease for PRRSV. The pigs were vaccinated with an inactivated, homologous vaccine, followed by a challenge with the Lena strain. Lena represents a subtype 3 PRRSV-1 that emerged in Eastern Europe and stands out as a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain [<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Following PRRSV challenge, some of the vaccinated animals developed more severe clinical symptoms and pneumonia, compared to mock-vaccinated animals. We, therefore, tested the sera from such animals for their ability to enhance infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and increase the amount of virus that would be released from the MDMs as well as to induce cytokine release. We used MDMs because they are a well-established cell culture model in PRRSV research, and allowed us to perform this research without having to sacrifice an unnecessarily large number of animals.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-11-00829"><title>2.

The piglets were randomly divided into three groups of six animals. The groups were either vaccinated once (&#x0201c;Lena 1x&#x0201d;), four weeks before the challenge, or twice (&#x0201c;Lena 2x&#x0201d;) at eight and four weeks before challenge (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00829">Appendix A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00829-f0A1">Figure A1</xref>). The age of the pigs at the time of the first immunization was six and ten weeks old. For the vaccination, binary ethyleneimine (BEI, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)-inactivated Lena, grown on MARC-145 cells, formulated in commercial oil-in-water adjuvant (Suvaxyn, Zoetis Animal Health [<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; 1 mL/1 mL; 10<sup>8</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/dose), was used.

All animals were challenged by intranasal inoculation of 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> PRRSV Lena at 14 weeks of age. The challenge virus had been passaged three times on alveolar macrophages.

The serum of pig 3 served as &#x0201c;positive control serum&#x0201d; in the presented experiments (Figures 5 and 6).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-11-00829"><title>3.2. Vaccination with an Inactivated Virus and Homologous Challenge</title><p>We have recently developed a novel inactivated vaccine against PRRSV-1, subtype 1 strains, that showed promising protective results [<xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. At the time of these experiments, no vaccine was yet available against the highly pathogenic strain Lena and, consequently, we tested the efficacy of a similarly prepared vaccine against Lena. Conventionally raised pigs were vaccinated once (Lena 1x) or twice (Lena 2x) with inactivated Lena virus and subsequently challenged with PAM-grown Lena. All of the animals in the vaccination trial developed viremia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00829-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The pigs from the Lena 1x group developed a significantly higher viremia than the control group early during the infection (at 3dpc), but never peaked as high as the other groups. Meanwhile, the animals that had been vaccinated twice were able to reduce their viral titers one week before the control group, but they also peaked significantly higher in viremia than the Lena 1x pigs, and one pig had to be euthanized due to the severity of clinical symptoms. Nevertheless, after 10 dpc, both vaccinated groups had a significantly reduced viremia compared to the unvaccinated pigs; the Lena 2x group even already at 7 dpc. All surviving pigs were able to eliminate the virus from their blood, though each group had at least one animal that experienced a rebound of viremia.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-11-00829"><title>3.3.

Even more unexpectedly, four piglets in the vaccinated groups showed severe symptoms (fever up to 41.8 &#x000b0;C, hypothermia down to 37.6 &#x000b0;C, tremor, convulsions, diarrhea). These symptoms were so severe in the case of one pig in the &#x0201c;Lena 2x&#x0201d; group (pig #1453) that it had to be euthanized at 7 dpc.</p><p>The respiratory symptoms were scored as follows: 0 = normal breathing (20&#x02013;40 breaths per minute); 1 = mild dyspnea and/or tachypnea (40&#x02013;60 breaths per minute) when stressed by holding the pig for 45 s; 2 = mild dyspnea and/or tachypnea (40&#x02013;60 breaths per minute) at rest; 3 = moderate dyspnea and/or tachypnea (60&#x02013;80 breaths per minute) when stressed; 4 = moderate dyspnea and/or tachypnea (60&#x02013;80 breaths per minute) at rest; 5 = severe dyspnea and/or tachypnea (&#x0003e;80 breaths per minute) when stressed; 6 = severe dyspnea and/or tachypnea (&#x0003e;80 breaths per minute) at rest.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-11-00829"><title>3.4.

After the challenge, all animals in this group developed neutralizing antibodies. The animals in the Lena 2x group developed high titers of neutralizing antibodies after the booster, but the titer of one of these animals (pig #1453) declined before the challenge. This pig had to be euthanized because of the severity of its symptoms upon challenge.</p><p>Over the entire course of the experiment, the titers of neutralizing antibodies in the booster-vaccinated group remained high. Nonetheless, the presence of these neutralizing antibodies did not appear to have a beneficial effect on the level of the viremia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00829-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-11-00829"><title>3.5. ADE of Macrophage Infection</title><p>In the next step, we tested whether the sera would influence the infection of MDMs. To this end, we chose an infectious dose of Lena that would yield between 25% and 50% infected cells after 16 h of incubation. To avoid the impact of inter-experiment variation, all sera of one pig, including the pre-vaccination time point, were tested together with a defined negative control (serum from an SPF pig) and a selected potentially &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d; control (Lena-infected pigs with neutralizing antibodies). Virus pre-incubated with the positive control serum resulted in more infected cells at a dilution of 1:150 in 7/7 experiments run in triplicate. In some, but not all, experiments with the same serum, ADE was also found at the 1:750 dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00829-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This constitutes a dilution of factor 13 to 68 beyond the neutralizing titer. The dilution of 1:30 was enhancing the macrophage infection in two of the three shown experiments, and once acting in a neutralizing manner. While these experiments indicate that ADE could be happening with PRRSV immune sera, the effect was mild and varied considerably between experiments.</p><p>In the sera from the randomly selected control animal #1445, we occasionally found evidence of ADE, but this was also observed before challenge and was not consistently found at particular dilutions nor did it appear to be titratable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00829-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In the two sera from the randomly selected Lena 1x group, we did not find any consistent evidence for ADE. The serum with neutralizing antibodies at 10 dpc had a neutralizing activity also on MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00829-f005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>From the Lena 2x group, we selected four sera randomly to test in the ADE assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00829-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Pig #1453 appeared to have developed detectable ADE activity at very high serum dilutions after the first vaccination, but this was not found with the sera from the other pigs nor with the sera from the Lena 1x group. Furthermore, with the sera collected later, apparent ADE was again found at the two time points post-challenge. However, this activity did not follow a titration-dependent increase and decline, indicating that it was not solely dependent on one factor. The observation that this was not found with the other sera from this group led us to the conclusion that no ADE activity was found in the Lena 2x group. However, with the other three pigs in this group, we found that sera with neutralizing activity reduced the infectivity of MDMs in most cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00829-f005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, these tests did not permit us to identify ADE as a possible cause of enhanced disease. Furthermore, the MDM assay system based on nucleoprotein measurement of infectivity was not robust in terms of its reproducibility. We, therefore, tested if viral progeny from these cultures was influenced by the different sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00829-f006">Figure 6</xref>). In three independent cultures, the positive control serum induced only once increased viral shedding at a 1:30 dilution. Curiously, we found that, indeed, the serum of pig #1445 of 0dpv2 led to increased shedding of virus. It is the same serum and dilution that had also led to a higher percentage of infected MDMs, while the pig had not been exposed to any vaccine or virus, yet. We also observed two small, yet statistically significant, increases for pig #1457 with the sera 0dpv2, 1:30, and 0dpc, 1:3750, and a reduced titer for 10dpc, 1:18,750, all of which did not correspond to any increase or reduction in infection of MDMs. None of the SNs of the sera tested for pig #1458 differed significantly from the control. For pig #1454 from the Lena 2x group, we saw a clear reduction in the viral titers at 1:30 10 dpc.</p><p>We also checked the presence of cytokines in the supernatants that were derived with the sera of 0 dpc and 5 dpc, dilutions 1:30 to 1:750, of the pigs #1445, #1458, #1453, and #1454; but were unable to detect any induction of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, or TNF (data not shown).</p><p>In summary, neither the neutralizing effect of the sera nor the slight enhancement of MDM-infection translated into consistently strong effects regarding the viral shedding or any effect on cytokine release.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-11-00829"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>PRRSV mutates frequently, and because of a generally restricted heterologous protection, quick development of protective vaccines is of great importance to the pig production community. Immunization with an inactivated field strain could, in principle, serve that purpose; by employing a high antigen payload and a potent adjuvant, we previously demonstrated that such vaccines can have a protective value [<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This was the basis for employing such a vaccine approach for Lena, which is a particularly highly pathogenic (HP) PRRSV strain that emerged recently in Eastern Europe [<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and has afflicted it since. Therefore, we vaccinated two groups of pigs either once or twice with BEI-inactivated Lena. While the vaccination was found to be successful in terms of the ability to induce anti-PRRSV antibodies after a single injection or even to induce neutralizing antibodies after the prime/boost vaccination, the vaccinations were disappointing for their protective capacity. In fact, there were even signs of enhanced disease in some of the vaccinated animals. This lack of protection in the presence of neutralizing antibodies is in direct conflict with several previous reports, where the adoptive transfer to reach neutralizing antibody serum levels was protective [<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It also contradicts many studies which observed a positive correlation between neutralizing antibodies and control of viremia [<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This discrepancy may be due to strain-specific characteristics or unknown environmental factors affecting the vaccinated pigs. Nevertheless, it is not possible to attribute this to the inactivated vaccine as this has been previously found to be efficacious with other strains of PRRSV [<xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Due to this unexpected outcome, we investigated the possible involvement of ADE antibodies in the deteriorative clinical outcome of this vaccination trial. We tested the sera for the capacity to mediate ADE in porcine MDMs, a natural target cell of PRRSV, which constitutively expresses CD16 and CD64. The results demonstrate that immune sera that neutralized virions on a cell line assay also neutralized the infection of the MDMs. This neutralizing effect was only lost at a dilution of 1:150/1:750. Beyond this dilution, we only rarely observed a very slight enhancement of MDM infection. We did, however, also detect the occasional statistical significance in enhancement or neutralization of infection for sera that were still na&#x000ef;ve or had no detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Nevertheless, the enhancing effects were mild and often did not titrate. It is important to bear in mind that PRRSV infectivity is influenced by many factors in the serum, not only by antibodies. Furthermore, statistical significance and biological significance are not synonymous.</p><p>Alternative explanations for the enhanced disease observed in the vaccinated groups could be that FcRs on other cells, such as monocytes and dendritic cells, could be targeted by the immune complexes, resulting in infection and possibly inflammatory reactions. Furthermore, an involvement of the complement system or vaccine-primed T cells needs to be considered. Complement has been proposed to play a role for ADE of West Nile virus (WNV) [<xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and HIV [<xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our setup, the heat-inactivation of the sera prevented us from testing such effects. Recently, Bordet et al. showed a strain-specific increased secretion of IFN&#x003b3; by polarized T helper 1 (Th1) cells in response to the Lena strain [<xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is possible that the vaccination(s) in our experiment primed these T cells, leading to enhanced inflammatory responses, which exacerbated the clinical symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-viruses-11-00829"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that ADE of macrophage infection mediated solely by antibodies is not a feature in this vaccination challenge experiment and cannot explain the lack of protection or even enhanced disease following the homologous challenge with the subtype 3 PRRSV-1 strain Lena. Also, sera from naturally infected pigs with the same strain of PRRSV had no or only a weak ADE activity. Furthermore, there are now a total of four experimental studies demonstrating the protective role of antibodies against PRRSV, and that this effect is correlated to neutralizing activity [<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, future vaccine design should continue to focus on the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies. With respect to the employment of inactivated vaccines, the present work also demonstrates that extrapolations from one PRRSV-1 strain to another can be risky. While such vaccines, if prepared appropriately, can be protective [<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00829" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the outcome with the Lena strain was detrimental despite induction of neutralizing antibodies. This is adding one more piece to the puzzling immunology of PRRS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Nicolas Ruggli and Obdulio Garc&#x000ed;a Nicol&#x000e1;s for the work regarding the animal experiment for producing the control sera.
