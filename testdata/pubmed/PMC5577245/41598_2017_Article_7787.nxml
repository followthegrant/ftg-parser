HuR inhibition has profound anticancer activity. Pharmacologic inhibitors can overcome the limitations of genetic inhibition. In this study, we examined the antitumor activity of CMLD-2, a small-molecule inhibitor directed against HuR, using non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as a model. CMLD-2 efficacy was tested <italic>in vitro</italic> using H1299, A549, HCC827, and H1975 NSCLC cells and MRC-9 and CCD-16 normal human fibroblasts. Treatment of NSCLC cells with CMLD-2 produced dose-dependent cytotoxicity, caused a G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and induced apoptosis. CMLD-2 decreased HuR mRNA and the mRNAs of HuR-regulated proteins (Bcl2 and p27) in tumor cells. Additionally, reduction in the expression of HuR, Bcl2, cyclin E, and Bcl-XL with increased expression of Bax and p27 in CMLD-2-treated NSCLC cells were observed. CMLD-2-treated normal cells, HuR-regulated mRNAs and proteins albeit showed some reduction were less compared to tumor cells. Finally, CMLD-2 treatment resulted in greater mitochondrial perturbation, activation of caspase-9 and -3 and cleavage of PARP in tumor cells compared to normal cells. Our proof-of concept study results demonstrate CMLD-2 represents a promising HuR-targeted therapeutic class that with further development could lead to advanced preclinical studied and ultimately for lung cancer treatment.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">HuR is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the stability and transcription of numerous mRNAs whose protein products function as oncoproteins and are frequently overexpressed in several human cancers, including lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. HuR overexpression has been correlated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that HuR promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Further, HuR overexpression has been reported to contribute to drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Results from these preclinical and clinical studies suggest that HuR may be a molecular target for cancer therapy and that suppression of HuR will likely result in tumor growth inhibition and anticancer activity.</p><p id="Par3">Studies from our laboratory and others have previously shown that inhibition of HuR expression by gene silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in a broad spectrum of human cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. These studies utilized anti-sense oligonucleotide or small interfering (si) RNA to inhibit HuR. While these results established proof-of-concept, there are several barriers, such as poor cell uptake and low serum stability, to siRNA-based therapy. Another challenge is the availability of a delivery vehicle that can efficiently deliver the HuR-targeted si/shRNA, oligonucleotide, or plasmid DNA to tumor depots and produce considerable anticancer activity. While several formulations for siRNA delivery have been developed and tested, each of the formulations has its limitations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, approaches that utilize genetic inhibition for cancer treatment often suffer from issues related to inefficient drug delivery to tumor tissues, thus limiting their clinical translation.</p><p id="Par4">More recently, we developed and tested tumor-targeted nanoparticle delivery of HuRsiRNA (HuR-NP) in lung cancer, and showed significant antitumor activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The combination of HuR-NP with a CXCR4 inhibitor produced enhanced inhibition of lung tumor cell migration and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Similarly, HuR siRNA therapy combined with ionizing radiation resulted in significant radiosensitization of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Consistent with our results, other laboratories have reported similar treatment outcomes with HuR siRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. While all of these studies are promising, advancing siRNA-based therapy to the clinic remains a challenge. The availability of a pharmacologic inhibitor directed against HuR, however, offers advantages over siRNA based therapies and can be rapidly tested and advanced for clinical studies. Blanco <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, using MS-444, an HuR-targeted inhibitor, showed antitumor activity against colorectal cancer both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Concurring with these findings, Romeo <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, showed MS-444 treatment reverted TRAIL resistance in pancreatic cancer. Both studies provide evidence that small molecule inhibitors can successfully disrupt HuR and produce anticancer activity. More recently, Wu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, reported the development of a small molecule inhibitor (CMLD-2) that disrupts the interaction between HuR protein and its target mRNA.</p><p id="Par5">CMLD-2 is a coumarin-derived molecule that was identified through fluorescence polarization (FP) assay-based high throughput screening (HTS) of a library of 6,000 compounds developed by the Kansas University Chemical Methodologies and Library Development (CMLD) center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cmld.ku.edu">www.cmld.ku.edu</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The coumarin and dihydrocouramin-scaffold containing compounds (such as CMLD-2 and ita analogues) were developed by Tunge and co-workers using TFA-mediated hydroarylation chemistry and added to the in-house CMLD library for subsequent screening against various therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. CMLD-2 was demonstrated to efficiently disrupt the interaction between HuR protein and adenine and uridine-rich elements (ARE) oligo from Musashi RNA binding protein 1 (Msi1) at nanomolar concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Musashi is a known target of HuR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. CMLD-2 exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity towards HCT-116 colon and MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cancer cells and had an IC50 of 28.9&#x02009;&#x000b5;M and 18.2&#x02009;&#x000b5;M respectively. Accompanied with the cytotoxicity in HCT-116 cells was the reduction in mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2, Msi1 and XIAP with concomitant increase in capase-3 and PARP cleavage and LC3I/II conversion indicating involvement of both autophagy and apoptosis-mediated death. In contrast, CMLD-2 exhibited reduced cytotoxicity towards normal fibroblast (WI-38; IC50 63.7&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) and normal human colon epithelial (CCD 841 CoN IC50 63.7&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) cells. The IC50 values for normal cells were approximately two-fold higher than for cancer cells. While HuR-targeted small molecule inhibitors such as CMLD-2 have been developed and tested in pancreatic and colon cancers, their efficacy against human lung cancer cells is not known.</p><p id="Par6">In the present study, we examined whether pharmacologic inhibition of HuR using the small-molecule inhibitor, CMLD-2, would produce antitumor activity in human lung cancer cells.

Earlier studies from our laboratory and others have shown that siRNA-/shRNA-based genetic silencing of HuR in a variety of cancer cells resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, reduced cell migration and invasion, and suppression of metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. While these studies have established the proof-of-concept, advancing HuR siRNA/shRNA gene-based cancer therapy has limitations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. An alternate approach is pharmacologic inhibition, which can have sustained inhibitory activity and effective anticancer activity. Therefore, in the present study, we tested the efficacy of a small-molecule HuR inhibitor, CMLD-2, against human lung cancer cells compared with normal lung fibroblasts.</p><p id="Par24">Our initial studies focused on determining the effective drug concentration, and identified that 30&#x02009;&#x000b5;M CMLD-2 produced the maximum inhibitory effect on human lung cancer cells. Using this concentration in subsequent studies, CMLD-2 exhibited preferential cytotoxicity towards non-small cell lung cancer cells (H1299, A549, H1975, and HCC827) compared to the normal human fibroblasts (MRC-9 and CCD16). CMLD-2-mediated inhibition was accompanied by a G1 phase cell cycle arrest that subsequently led to apoptosis. Molecular studies demonstrated that CMLD-2 treatment significantly reduced HuR mRNA and protein expression and HuR-regulated oncogenic proteins in tumor cells compared with normal cells. While our results clearly and convincingly demonstrate that CMLD-2 is effective against lung cancer cells, the question of how CMLD-2 targets HuR and exhibits selectivity to cancer cells compared to normal cells, when HuR is expressed in both cell types, is unclear. Although, Wu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, showed that CMLD-2 exerts its antitumor activity by disrupting the interaction between HuR protein and its target mRNAs, the binding affinity to HuR in tumor cells versus normal cells have not been studied. While in the present study we have not investigated the mechanism for tumor selectivity, we believe that the binding of CMLD-2 to HuR is likely greater in tumor cells, since they express relatively higher levels of HuR than do normal cells. Further, tumor cells may be addicted to the survival signals provided by HuR-regulated oncoproteins. Thus, CMLD-2-mediated suppression of HuR results in reduced expression of HuR-regulated oncoproteins, leading to enhanced tumor cell killing compared to normal cells.</p><p id="Par25">In a recent study, we showed the siRNA-mediated HuR inhibition combined with radiation produced radiosensitization of breast cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In that study, we demonstrated that radiosensitization involved mitochondrial perturbation and free-radical production that was accompanied by DNA damage. Similar to our previous observations, CMLD-2 treatment also resulted in mitochondrial perturbation that was significantly higher in H1299 and A549 tumor cells than in normal MRC-9 cells. Our results show that although CMLD-2 and HuR specific siRNA operate at two different levels upstream to inhibit HuR, they appear to converge on common death signaling pathways downstream resulting in tumor cell killing. While our study indicates apoptotic cell death, the report by Wu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, described CMLD-2 treatment induced both autophagy and apoptosis in colon and pancreatic cancer cells. Thus, it is will be of interest to investigate whether autophagy occurs in CMLD-2-treated lung cancer cells also. Further, determining whether autophagy in CMLD-2 treated lung cells provide survival or death signal will not only increase our understanding of the modus operandi of CMLD-2 but likely offer an opportunity to combine CMLD-2 with autophagy inducers to produce enhanced anticancer activity.</p><p id="Par26">The ability of CMLD-2 to exhibit profound antitumor activity supports further development of the inhibitor that is efficacious at lower drug concentrations in the nanomolar range and that will have clinical relevance. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> results, while promising, warrant testing the <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and toxicity of CMLD-2. Results from <italic>in vivo</italic> studies will provide an opportunity to develop structure-activity relationship (SAR)-based CMLD-2 inhibitors and a strong rationale to <italic>develop</italic> HuR-targeted small molecule therapeutics for treating lung cancer and other solid tumors.</p><p id="Par27">In conclusion, we have established proof-of-concept and shown that CMLD-2 represents a promising HuR-targeted therapeutic class for cancer treatment. However, further improvements in CMLD-2 and its analogues that exhibit efficacy at nanomolar concentrations are warranted. The availability of such HuR-targeted small molecule therapeutics that highly efficacious at clinically relevant doses will make a significant impact not only in lung cancer treatment but also in the treatment of other HuR overexpressing solid tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
