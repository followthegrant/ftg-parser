In the present study, to identify novel prognostic markers or therapeutic targets for ESCC, we reviewed a list of genes with upregulated expression in ESCC compared with normal esophagus, as identified by our serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) analysis. We focused on the <italic>NRD1</italic> gene, which encodes the nardilysin protein. Quantitative reverse transcription&#x02013;polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in 34 ESCC tissue samples revealed that mRNA expression of <italic>NRD1</italic> was upregulated in 56% of ESCC tissue samples. Immunohistochemical analysis of nardilysin in 109 ESCC tissue samples demonstrated that 43 (39%) ESCC cases were positive for nardilysin. Nardilysin-positive ESCC cases were more advanced in terms of T classification (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;0.0007), N classification (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=&#x000a0;0.0164), and tumor stage (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) than nardilysin-negative ESCC cases. Furthermore, nardilysin expression was significantly associated with poorer prognosis (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0258). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that nardilysin expression is an independent prognostic classifier of patients with ESCC. The invasiveness of <italic>NRD1</italic>-knockdown TE1 and TE5 esophageal cancer cell lines was less than that of the negative control siRNA-transfected cell lines. Expression of <italic>MMP2</italic> and <italic>MMP3</italic> mRNA was significantly lower in <italic>NRD1</italic>-knockdown TE5 cells than in negative control siRNA-transfected cells. These results suggest that nardilysin is involved in tumor progression, and is an independent prognostic classifier in patients with ESCC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Esophageal cancer</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd><kwd>nardilysin</kwd><kwd>NRD1</kwd><kwd>prognosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>According to the World Health Organization, esophageal cancer is the sixth most common malignancy world wide.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The two predominant forms of esophageal cancer are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Globally, squamous cell carcinoma accounts for more than 90% of esophageal cancer. Most esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is diagnosed at an advanced stage, and even superficial ESCC that appears to extend no further than the submucosa metastasizes to the lymph nodes in 50% of cases.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> For localized ESCC, surgery is the primary therapeutic option. However, the prognosis is unsatisfactory, even in curatively resected patients where the 5-year survival rate is &#x0003c;50% after surgery.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Several prognostic markers, such as nodal status and tumor stage, are currently accepted for clinical use, and we have previously reported several ESCC-associated genes related to tumor progression.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, these genes cannot completely identify which patients are at low or high risk for disease recurrence. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for ESCC.</p><p>Better knowledge of changes in gene expression that occur during carcinogenesis may lead to improvements in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of ESCC. Among the comprehensive methods used to analyze transcript expression levels, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) is a useful approach.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Previously, we performed SAGE analysis on one ESCC case, and identified several genes whose expression was upregulated or downregulated in ESCC. Of these genes, <italic>ADAMTS16</italic> is frequently overexpressed in ESCC.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, expression of many genes remain unconfirmed, and their role in ESCC remain unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we reviewed a list of genes with upregulated expression in ESCC as identified by our SAGE analysis. We focused on the <italic>NRD1</italic> gene, which encodes the nardilysin protein, because nardilysin expression has not been investigated in ESCC. <italic>NRD1</italic> was initially cloned as a zinc metalloendopeptidase of the M16 family, which can selectively cleave the dibasic site <italic>in vitro</italic>.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In normal tissue, <italic>NRD1</italic> mRNA is expressed mainly in adult heart, skeletal muscle, and testis and at much lower levels in other tissues including thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine, and leukocytes.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> It has been reported that nardilysin enhances TNF-&#x003b1; shedding through activation of TNF-&#x003b1; converting enzyme (TACE) and a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10).<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In human breast cancer, it has been reported that nardilysin protein expression is correlated with tumor size, grade, and lymph node metastasis, but not prognosis.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Here, we examined the correlation between expression of nardilysin and prognosis in patients with ESCC. We also revealed the biological function of nardilysin in esophageal cancer cell lines.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue samples and cell lines</title><p>In total, 149 primary tumor samples were collected from patients diagnosed with ESCC. Patients were treated at the Hiroshima University Hospital. All patients underwent curative resection involving right transthoracic esophagectomy with extensive lymph node dissection. Reconstruction was performed with a gastric tube positioned in the posterior mediastinum. Only patients without preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy and without clinical evidence of distant metastasis were enrolled in the study. Operative mortality was defined as death within 30&#x000a0;days of patients leaving the hospital, and these patients were removed from the analysis. Postoperative follow-up was scheduled every 1, 2 or 3&#x000a0;months during the first 2&#x000a0;years after surgery and every 6&#x000a0;months thereafter unless more frequent follow-up was deemed necessary. Chest X-ray, chest computed tomography scan and serum chemistries were performed at every follow-up visit. Patients were followed by the patients&#x02019; physician until their death or the date of the last documented contact. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee for Human Genome Research of Hiroshima University.</p><p>For quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), 40 ESCC tissue samples were used. Samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until use. Noncancerous samples of heart, lung, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, pancreas, kidney, bone marrow, peripheral leukocytes, spleen, skeletal muscle, brain, and spinal cord were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA, USA).</p><p>For Western blot analysis, four ESCC tissue samples and corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa samples were used. Samples were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until use.</p><p>For immunohistochemical analysis, we used archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 109 patients who had undergone surgical excision for ESCC. Histological classification was based on the World Health Organization system. Tumor staging was performed according to the TNM stage grouping system.</p><p>Human esophageal cancer-derived cell lines, TE1, TE5, TE8, TE9, TE10, TE11 were purchased from RIKEN BioResource Center (Tsukuba, Japan). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Whittaker, Walkersville, MD, USA) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and qRT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of total RNA was converted to cDNA with a First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).

Real-time detection of the emission intensity of SYBR green bound to double-stranded DNA was performed with an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as described previously.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<italic>ACTB</italic>-specific PCR products were amplified from the same RNA samples and served as internal controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>For Western blot analysis, tissue samples or cells were lysed as described previously.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The lysates (40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer by boiling and then subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electrotransfer onto a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was incubated with the primary antibody against nardilysin (mouse monoclonal; Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used in the secondary reaction. Immunocomplexes were visualized with an ECL Western Blot Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). &#x003b2;-actin antibody (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) was also used as a loading control.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>One or two representative tumor blocks, including the tumor center, invading front, and tumor-associated non-neoplastic mucosa, was examined from each patient by immunohistochemistry. In cases of large, late-stage tumors, two different sections were examined to include representative areas of the tumor center as well as of the lateral and deep tumor invasive front. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed with a Dako Envision+ Mouse Peroxidase Detection System (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Antigen retrieval was performed by microwave heating in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 30&#x000a0;min. Peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-methanol for 10&#x000a0;min, and sections were incubated with normal goat serum (Dako Cytomation) for 20&#x000a0;min to block nonspecific antibody binding sites. Sections were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-nardilysin antibody (dilution 1:50) for 1&#x000a0;h at room temperature, followed by incubation with Envision+ anti-mouse peroxidase for 1&#x000a0;h. For color reaction, sections were incubated with the DAB Substrate-Chromogen Solution (Dako Cytomation) for 10&#x000a0;min. Sections were counterstained with 0.1% hematoxylin. Negative controls were created by omission of the primary antibody.</p><p>Expression of nardilysin was scored in all tumors as positive or negative. When more than 10% of tumor cells were stained, the immunostaining was considered positive for nardilysin. Using these definitions, two surgical pathologists (NU and NO), without knowledge of the clinical and pathologic parameters or the patients&#x02019; outcomes, independently reviewed immunoreactivity in each specimen. Interobserver differences were resolved by consensus review at a double-headed microscope after independent review.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA interference</title><p>To knockdown the endogenous <italic>NRD1</italic>, RNA interference (RNAi) was performed. siRNA oligonucleotides for <italic>NRD1</italic> and a negative control were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Three independent oligonucleotides were used for <italic>NRD1</italic> siRNA. The <italic>NRD1</italic> siRNA1 sequence was 5&#x02032;-AUC AGU UGA GGC AUU AUC ACU ACC C-3&#x02032;.

Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 60&#x000a0;pmol of siRNA and 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX were mixed in 1&#x000a0;mL of RPMI medium (10&#x000a0;nmol/L final siRNA concentration). After 20&#x000a0;min of incubation, the mixture was added to the cells and these were plated on dishes for each assay. Forty-eight&#x000a0;h after transfection, cells were analyzed for all experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell growth, <italic>in vitro</italic> invasion, and wound healing assays</title><p>To examine cell growth, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The cells were seeded at a density of 2000 cells per well in 96-well plates. Cell growth was monitored after 1, 2, 4, and 8&#x000a0;days. Modified Boyden chamber assays were performed to examine invasiveness. Cells were plated at 10&#x000a0;000 cells per well in RPMI 1640 medium plus 1% serum in the upper chamber of a Transwell insert (8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m pore diameter; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) coated with Matrigel. Medium containing 10% serum was placed in the bottom chamber. After 1 and 2&#x000a0;days, cells in the upper chamber were removed by scraping, and the cells remaining on the lower surface of the insert were stained with CyQuant GR dye to assess the number of cells. To carry out the wound healing assay, the cells were plated onto collagen-coated coverslips. The monolayer cells were then scratched manually with a plastic pipette tip, and after being washed with PBS, the wounded monolayers of the cells were allowed to heal for 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Correlations between clinicopathologic parameters and nardilysin expression were analyzed by the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival curves were constructed for nardilysin-positive and nardilysin-negative patients. Survival rates were compared between nardilysin-positive and nardilysin-negative groups. Differences between survival curves were tested for statistical significance by the Log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression was used to evaluate the associations between clinical covariates and survival. <sc>spss</sc> software was used for these analyses (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models. For all analyses, age was treated as a categorical variable (more than 65&#x000a0;years versus 65&#x000a0;years plus less than 65&#x000a0;years). For final multivariate Cox regression models, all variables were included that were moderately associated (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.10) with survival by univariate analysis. A <italic>P-</italic>value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Upregulation of <italic>NRD1</italic> in ESCC</title><p>To identify novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets for ESCC, we reviewed a list of genes with upregulated expression in ESCC compared with normal esophagus, as identified by our SAGE analysis.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Among the 30 most upregulated genes in ESCC, we focused on the <italic>NRD1</italic> gene, which encodes the nardilysin protein, because expression of <italic>NRD1</italic> has not been investigated in ESCC, and an antibody against nardilysin is commercially available.

To address this issue, immunohistochemical analysis of nardilysin was performed in ESCC tissue samples. We first tested the specificity of the anti-nardilysin antibody. In Western blot of protein extracts from the TE1 cell line, anti-nardilysin antibody detected a single band of approximately 133-kDa (data not shown).</p><p>We performed immunohistochemical analysis, first in normal skeletal muscle in which abundant <italic>NRD1</italic> mRNA expression was found, to serve as a positive control. Staining of nardilysin was observed in the normal skeletal muscle (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>a), consistent with our qRT-PCR results. Next, we performed immunohistochemical analysis in 109 ESCC tissue samples. In non-neoplastic esophageal mucosa, only weak or negative staining of nardilysin was observed in squamous epithelial and stromal cells (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>b). In contrast, ESCC tissue showed stronger or more extensive staining than corresponding non-neoplastic esophageal mucosa (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>c). Staining of nardilysin was observed in the cytoplasm. Some ESCC cases showed heterogeneity of immunostaining of nardilysin, but a tendency for upregulation of nardilysin at the invasive front was not observed. Because some ESCC tissue samples showed heterogeneity of nardilysin immunostaining, we considered nardilysin staining to be positive when more than 10% of tumor cells were stained. In total, nardilysin-positive ESCC cases were found in 43 (39%) of 109 cases. We analyzed the relationship between nardilysin expression and clinicopathologic characteristics.

In the present study, to identify novel prognostic markers or therapeutic targets for ESCC, we reviewed a list of genes whose expression was upregulated in ESCC compared with normal esophagus, as identified by our SAGE analysis. We found that <italic>NRD1</italic> was upregulated in ESCC, and confirmed by immunohistochemistry that nardilysin protein was expressed in ESCC cells. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that nardilysin expression is an independent prognostic classifier of patients with ESCC. These results indicate that immunohistochemical analysis of nardilysin is a clinically useful method for prediction of ESCC patient survival.</p><p>In the present study, nardilysin protein expression was correlated with advanced T classification, N classification, and tumor stage. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis revealed that nardilysin expression was significantly associated with poorer prognosis in patients with ESCC who did not receive adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Furthermore, the invasiveness of <italic>NRD1</italic> knockdown cells was 60% less than that of the negative control siRNA-transfected cells. These results indicate that nardilysin was involved in tumor progression. Although expression of <italic>NRD1</italic> mRNA was found in normal pancreas and skeletal muscle, and was not specific to ESCC, expression levels of <italic>NRD1</italic> mRNA in ESCC were higher than skeletal muscle or pancreas. Thus, <italic>NRD1</italic> could be a good therapeutic target with less adverse effects for ESCC.</p><p>Although we showed that knockdown of <italic>NRD1</italic> inhibits invasion activity in esophageal cancer cell lines, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that expression of <italic>MMP2</italic> and <italic>MMP3</italic> mRNA could be inhibited by <italic>NRD1</italic> knockdown. Although <italic>NRD1</italic> knockdown inhibited cell invasion activity in both TE1 and TE5 cells, inhibition of <italic>MMP2</italic> and <italic>MMP3</italic> mRNA expression was only observed in TE5 cells, and not in TE1 cells. The migration activities of <italic>NRD1</italic>-knockdown TE1 and TE5 cells analyzed by wound healing assay were significantly lower than those of negative control siRNA-transfected TE1 and TE5 cells. Therefore, inhibition of invasion activity by <italic>NRD1</italic> knockdown is likely to be due to inhibition of migration activity rather than inhibition of <italic>MMP2</italic> or <italic>MMP3</italic> expression. It has been reported that heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) binds to nardilysin, and transient expression of nardilysin in HeLa cells increased migration in response to HB-EGF.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Because nardilysin-induced migration occurs via the EGF receptor (EGFR),<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> it is possible that inhibition of EGFR signaling is involved in reduction of migration activity by <italic>NRD1</italic> knockdown. In support of this, high expression of EGFR has been reported in TE1 and TE5 cells.<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It has also been reported that nardilysin is one of the mutant p53-specific binding partners, and that interaction of mutant p53 with nardilysin enhances invasion activity.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Because our previous study revealed that p53 mutation status is not associated with prognosis of patients with ESCC,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> expression of nardilysin may affect prognosis in patients with ESCC showing p53 mutation.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that nardilysin expression is an independent prognostic classifier in patients with ESCC.

Further analysis will help to elucidate the biological function and prognostic value of nardilysin in ESCC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mr Shinichi Norimura for his excellent technical assistance and advice.
