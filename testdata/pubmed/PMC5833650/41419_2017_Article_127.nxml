Premature senescence of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC) in DN may result from the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy is the principal process that eliminates damaged mitochondria through PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)-mediated recruitment of optineurin (OPTN) to mitochondria. We aimed to examine the involvement of OPTN in mitophagy regulation of cellular senescence in RTEC in the context of DN. In vitro, the expression of senescence markers P16, P21, DcR2, SA-&#x003b2;-gal, SAHF, and insufficient mitophagic degradation marker (mitochondrial P62) in mouse RTECs increased after culture in 30&#x02009;mM high-glucose (HG) conditions for 48&#x02009;h. Mitochondrial fission/mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1 significantly enhanced RTEC senescence under HG conditions, whereas autophagy/mitophagy agonist Torin1 inhibited cell senescence. MitoTempo inhibited HG-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and cell senescence with or without Mdivi-1. The expression of PINK1 and OPTN, two regulatory factors for mitophagosome formation, decreased significantly after HG stimulation. Overexpression of PINK1 did not enhance mitophagosome formation under HG conditions. OPTN silencing significantly inhibited HG-induced mitophagosome formation, and overexpression of OPTN relieved cellular senescence through promoting mitophagy. In clinical specimens, renal OPTN expression was gradually decreased with increased tubulointerstitial injury scores. OPTN-positive renal tubular cells did not express senescence marker P16. OPTN expression also negatively correlated with serum creatinine levels, and positively correlated with eGFR. Thus, OPTN-mediated mitophagy plays a crucial regulatory role in HG-induced RTEC senescence in DN. OPTN may, therefore, be a potential antisenescence factor in DN.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Tubulointerstitial injury is crucial in promoting the initiation and progression of DN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. High-glucose (HG)-induced accelerated senescence of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) is an important cellular event leading to renal interstitial injury in DN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, the molecular mechanisms by which HG induces cellular senescence remain unknown. Cellular senescence is characterized by increased expression of decoy receptor 2 (DcR2) on the cell membrane, enhanced activity of cytoplasmic senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactsidase (SA-&#x003b2;-gal), the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) in the nucleus, along with activation of p16- and p21-related signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. It has been demonstrated that HG-induced cellular senescence is associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Mitochondria are a major source of ROS generation. Accelerated senescence of RTECs as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in pathogenesis of DN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles undergoing continuous fusion and fission. Mitochondrial stability is maintained via the optimal balance between biogenesis and degradation for renewal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Segregation of severely damaged mitochondria through fission is a prerequisite for engulfment and degradation via mitochondria selective autophagy, known as mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Insufficient mitophagy occurring within a cell can lead to impaired clearance of damaged mitochondria and intracellular accumulation of mitochondrial fragments, as well as increased ROS production. It has been reported that more than 50% of renal tubular cells exhibit fragmented mitochondria in diabetic mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The number of fragmented mitochondria and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) generated are significantly increased in the renal cortex of diabetic rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, mitophagy is likely to be associated with the diabetic status in renal tubular cells.</p><p id="Par4">There are several important steps involved in mitophagy, including irreversible fission of severe damaged mitochondrial fragments, mitophagosome formation (mitochondrial co-localization with autophagosome), fusion and degradation of mitophagosome, and lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Mitochondrial fission is an initial step during mitophagy, which is dependent on mitochondrial fission protein drp1. As mdivi-l can selectively inhibit Drp1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, it is now widely considered as a specific mitochondrial fission/mitophagy inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, mitophagosome formation is the most important process of mitophagy. The PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)-Parkin pathway has been largely implicated in mitophagosome formation of mitophagy. Depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential stabilizes ubiquitin kinase PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to recruitment and activation of E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Parkin amplifies the initiation signals of mitophagy, facilitating PINK1-mediated recruitment of optineurin (OPTN) and NDP52<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Subsequently, autophagy receptors ULK1, DFCP1, WIPI1, and LC3 are further recruited to the mitochondria, allowing encapsulation of mitochondrial fragments via autophagic vacuoles and the formation of mitophagosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The autophagic adaptor p62 is recruited to damaged and ubiquitinated mitochondrial fragments and is essential for the clearance of mitochondrial fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Once mitophagy is impaired, damaged mitochondria accumulate, resulting in a gradual increase in the proportion of P62 protein in total mitochondrial proteins. Therefore, concomitant accumulation of P62 in the mitochondrial component is now widely recognized as reflective of insufficient mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">OPTN was initially identified as a regulator of NF-&#x003ba;B and interferon signaling, but has recently attracted attention due to association with various disease processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Mutations of OPTN are established in neurodegenerative diseases such as primary open-angle glaucoma and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. OPTN is a cytosolic protein associated with the actin cytoskeleton, microtubules, and the Golgi complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Importantly, OPTN has recently been identified as an important receptor for selective autophagy, in particular, mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. OPTN contains an ubiquitin-binding domain, with the ability to bind polyubiquitinated cargo and transport them to autophagosomes via a LC3-interacting domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, the role of OPTN in mitophagy and premature senescence of RTECs in DN remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate OPTN-mediated mitophagy in regulation of cellular senescence in RTECs in the context of DN pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par6">A total of 149 patients with type 2 DN were recruited in our study from the Department of Nephrology in Daping Hospital, China from 1 January 1 2011 to 1 January 2016.

Thus, the cell status would likely become problematic only when the inhibition of mitophagy persisted for more than 48&#x02009;h. Persistent increases in ROS levels is a well-known factor that mediate DNA damage and cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. HG conditioning results in increased ROS production and accumulation of damaged mitochondria in the cytoplasm of RTECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. mtROS may be a key factor in cellular senescence caused by mitophagy dysfunction. In our study, mtROS was found to be upregulated in response to Mdivi-1 stimulation in HG, while MitoTempo alleviated HG-induced cell senescence through specific removal of mtROS. MtROS accumulation induced by mitophagy impairment contributes substantially to stress-induced cellular aging.</p><p id="Par36">Our study aimed to decipher the molecular pathways associated with mitophagy during HG-induced cellular senescence. Three different kinds of antagonists were applied for inhibiting three critical steps of mitophagy independently. Although both the mitochondrial fission inhibitor Mdivi-1 and autolysosomal maturation inhibitor Baf-A1 had a synergistic inhibitory effect with HG, it remains unknown whether HG exerted its effect on other steps of mitophagy, such as degradation of autophagic lysosomes. It has been reported that autophagy&#x02013;lysosome pathway in RTECs is disrupted by advanced glycation end products in DN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Further studies are required to identify the role of other steps of mitophagy in HG-induced senescence.</p><p id="Par37">In this study, we focused on the regulatory proteins of mitophagosome formation. The results showed that PINK1, Parkin, and OPTN expressions decreased after HG stimulation. PINK1-Parkin is a classical regulatory pathway of mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Parkin acts as an amplifier of the PINK1-generated mitophagy signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. It has previously been demonstrated that decreased Parkin expression in lung epithelial cells can lead to insufficient mitophagy, which accelerates senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. CCCP, a known Parkin mitochondrial translocation agent, can enhance mitochondrial translocation of Parkin in HG condition. Although the expression of Parkin was slightly decreased in our study, it was not thought to be a key protein capable of inhibiting mitophagy.</p><p id="Par38">Extensive studies have identified PINK1 as a crucial component in the mitochondrial homeostasis pathway, which acts to eliminate damaged mitochondria through mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Curiously, although silencing of PINK1 gene aggravated HG-induced mitophagy dysfunction, overexpression of PINK1 failed to alleviate mitophagy dysfunction and cell senescence. This may be due to decreased PINK1 expression in HG environment being sufficient to initiate mitophagy. Thus, our findings suggested that PINK1 was not a key protein involved in mitochondrial dysfunction in DN.</p><p id="Par39">OPTN has recently been identified as an important autophagy receptor for autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. We found that upregulation or downregulation of OPTN in vitro significantly affected mitophagy dysfunction and HG-induced cell senescence. OPTN expression negatively correlated with renal function during the progression of DN. These results suggested that OPTN-mediated mitophagy might play a renoprotective role in HG-induced RTEC senescence and DN progression.</p><p id="Par40">In conclusion, we report for the first time that OPTN is involved in the modulation of HG-induced RTEC senescence through the regulation of mitophagy and mtROS production. Insufficient OPTN-mediated mitophagy is implicated in the pathogenesis of DN. These findings revealed the molecular mechanisms of mitophagy in regulation of cellular senescence during HG-induced renal lesions. Furthermore, restoration of OPTN-mediated mitophagy and scavenging of dysfunctional mitochondria-derived mtROS may be novel therapeutic targets in order to protect against cellular senescence in DN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>
