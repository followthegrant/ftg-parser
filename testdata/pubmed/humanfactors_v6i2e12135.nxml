These postconcussion symptoms can have a significant impact on the functional participation of youth in daily activities, such as sports, school, as well as family and social activities [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There is a lack of evidence-based interventions for the management of pediatric concussion [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but consistent application of best practice guidelines may help reduce the impact of concussion and persistent postconcussion symptoms [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, noticeable gaps continue to exist in concussion management with inadequate application of best practice guidelines, and there is growing evidence demonstrating both knowledge and practice gaps in concussion management [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consequently, individuals may receive inconsistent and incomplete messages regarding the best strategies to manage concussion, which could lead to poor health outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Concussion &#x00026; You</title><p><italic>Concussion &#x00026; You</italic> is an evidence-informed self-management education program for concussed youth and their families [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It features a concussion curriculum based on best evidence and expert opinion and is integrated within a self-management framework. <italic>Concussion &#x00026; You</italic> aims to provide evidence-informed best practice guidance regarding concussion recovery throughout the entire recovery process and enable participants to build an idiosyncratic concussion recovery toolkit using the practical concussion management strategies provided by the program for the management of return to school and play, sleep, nutrition, relaxation, and energy conservation that the youth can access throughout their recovery [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The feasibility of this program was validated in a pilot study that led to an increase in patients&#x02019; knowledge regarding concussion and concussion management strategies after intervention [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Youths and their families are able to implement strategies into their daily routines with the use of supplied daily planners, activity logs, and postconcussion symptom scales; results from the postsession survey indicated that these tangible tools positively affect participants&#x02019; recovery [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This program addresses many gaps in concussion management, which can significantly improve the quality of life and outcomes of concussed youth, but it currently relies on in-person interaction and only at 1 time point with no additional follow-up or support.</p></sec><sec><title>Mobile Health</title><p>Many clinical researchers have begun harnessing technology to develop innovative approaches that hold great promise for enhancing the accessibility and quality of care [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as mobile phones, are well suited to serve as platforms for the self-management of health conditions as they are ubiquitous, have great computational capabilities, and are commonly carried on the person [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, mHealth technologies can facilitate access to self-monitoring resources, time-sensitive health information, prompts, reminders, and personalized self-management tools in real time [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mobile phones are ubiquitous in the lives of youth [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], so interventions using mobile technology may provide important and innovative opportunities for engaging youth in and improving health-related self-management skills and behaviors [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We scanned app stores for concussion-related apps and found that concussion-related apps exist, but they are primarily focused on concussion identification, diagnosis, and general information about concussion symptoms and recovery recommendations. These apps are not focused on concussion self-management, are not specific to pediatric concussion, do not emphasize strategies or the provision of tools to promote recovery, and do not allow tracking of personal information or recovery progress. Furthermore, most apps have not been validated in the peer-reviewed literature, and thus, their efficacy in helping youth manage concussion is unclear. Some efforts have been made, as indicated in the literature, to develop and evaluate apps for pediatric concussion management. For example, a study [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] evaluated the effects of a gamified mobile phone app in promoting health management in teenagers with persistent postconcussion symptoms, and it showed promising initial results for the use of mobile phone apps for the management of postconcussion syndrome [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, this app focuses on improving the management of postconcussion syndrome that is experienced by only a subset of all concussed youth [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and the app does not provide guidance throughout the entire recovery process, thus missing the opportunity to be preventative and guide youth from the onset of injury. SMART, another app developed for pediatric concussion management, is a Web-based educational and self-management program; its initial results show promise for the use of apps for pediatric concussion management [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, a usability study of this app identified that some users felt the time and reading required to complete the program would be too difficult for children to comprehend and complete [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This may suggest the program requires a considerable amount of physical and cognitive effort to use, and the safety with which this app can be used by concussed youth is unclear and should be evaluated in addition to evaluating its efficacy. In addition, the app focuses on managing and tracking symptoms, instead of empowering or enabling the user to implement specific concussion management strategies; Zasler et al discussed that if symptoms persist, then focusing on symptoms might be counterproductive [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A technical limitation of Web-based apps is that they require an internet connection, which may not always be available or reliable, limiting access to individuals who have reliable access to the internet. In contrast to Web-based or HTML apps, native apps offer robust offline functionality, which is preferred for mHealth tools targeting individuals who may live in rural areas with poor internet connectivity or who do not have access to the internet [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Native apps also provide a richer user experience and better and more innovative capabilities than Web-based apps [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. There is a need to develop and evaluate tools that are easily accessible to youth, guide them throughout their concussion recovery, educate them on and assist them in implementing best practice concussion management strategies, and that require minimal engagement by the user to ensure safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Usability</title><p>Technologies with inadequate consideration of the needs of the intended users are difficult to learn, and these will be misused or underutilized and will ultimately fail to accomplish objectives originally set out [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Usability studies are commonly used to evaluate mHealth technologies [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and they focus on measurable user performance and preference metrics. Usability is defined as the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Having a user perform a set of tasks that relate to product features and are representative of the tasks that the user may use the technology for is an excellent way to determine the usability of a feature or feature workflow [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is important to perform a usability study for an mHealth technology with prospective end users to effectively determine how well the target audience interacts and relates to a technology.</p><p>The objective of this research was to develop and evaluate the usability of a mobile phone app that will help enable youth to better self-manage concussion by providing easy access to expert-informed concussion management information and strategies and a tool that will guide youth in self-managing and tracking concussion recovery. Overall, this app is expected to improve the quality of life of youth who have experienced a concussion by providing recovery support to enable safe return to daily activities of meaning and importance (eg, school, family, social activities, and sport activities).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Overview of Application, Prototype Design, and Development</title><p>A user-centered design approach and Agile development methods were used to design and develop the <italic>NeuroCare</italic> mobile phone app to ensure that it was useful and usable for the end-user population. The design, development, and improvements to the prototype were carried out using an iterative and incremental development (IID) approach [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] with the support of the design team. The design team consisted of the key stakeholders and user proxies that included health care professionals, concussion experts, business personnel, and brain injury researchers who were iteratively involved in the design of this technology, that is, assisted in identifying the end users, creating a target user group profile, creating a persona, identifying design requirements and design principles, identifying mobile app&#x02019;s features and functions, and identifying app content and design.</p><p>The design team identified that the primary end users of this technology are concussed youth aged between 10 and 18 years, and the secondary end users are the health care professionals who are involved in concussion assessment and management. Concussed youth can use this app to better self-manage their concussion through the implementation of evidence-informed concussion management strategies and progress tracking. Health care professionals can direct their youth clients/patients to the app and work with the youth to review concussion recovery progress and provide better direction and support. Both end users will use this app to improve communication between each other, which has shown to improve patient health outcomes, specifically emotional health and symptom resolution [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Youth may gain access to the app through Web-based app stores. The app can be used to support concussion recovery from the time of injury through to recovery and may be the most beneficial once the user begins to reintroduce daily activities at a gradual pace so that these do not provoke symptoms. Youth are instructed to use the app daily throughout their concussion recovery and share their progress (eg, how they have been feeling and the strategies implemented) with their health care professional to receive further support and feedback in managing their concussion (eg, advice and assistance regarding recommended and new strategies to implement). In addition, if health care professionals are aware of the app, they can direct youth to the mobile phone app upon concussion diagnosis and during recovery. As a result, both end-user groups were involved in testing the usability of this app.</p><p>The scientific content of this app, including the concussion management strategies (eg, energy conservation, sleep, nutrition, and relaxation strategies) and supplementary concussion management information found within this prototype was adapted from the <italic>Concussion &#x00026; You</italic> program. Through IID of the app prototype, the design team identified opportunities to add to the current <italic>Concussion &#x00026; You</italic> content, for example, the design team found that a new concussion management strategies section could be a beneficial addition for concussed youth. As a result, the design team developed a beta concussion management strategies section titled <italic>Social Goals</italic>, which includes strategies based on the current best practices and expert opinion to help reduce the impact of social isolation and depression that may accompany a concussion diagnosis [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The user interface (UI) of this prototype was initially influenced by the <italic>Concussion &#x00026; You</italic> program strategy planning tool found in the program&#x02019;s handbook [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and this initial design was iteratively assessed by the design team using the IID approach, which resulted in the final UI that was used for the end-user usability study. For further information about the development process and design of the app see the dissertation <italic>Development and Usability Testing of a Smartphone Technology for the Self-Management of Pediatric Concussion</italic> [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The app&#x02019;s information architecture is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref> for a higher resolution image); the 8 main sections of the application are divided into 2 distinct groups: destinations that aid self-management actively through action (ie, Feelings, My Goals, Summary, and Set Reminder pages) and destinations for aiding self-management passively through information (ie, Concussion Library, Resources, Using NeuroCare, and Contact Experts). The key features of the app are that it guides concussed youth in creating a personalized concussion recovery self-management plan, allows youth to track how they are feeling each day, provides daily reminders, and provides feedback and recommendations on how youth can improve their concussion recovery. A key design principle required that navigation through the app should be intuitive, simple, and demand minimal engagement from the concussed youth to ensure the app could be used safely (ie, to avoid symptom exacerbation). For example, an alternative path is indicated by the red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>, which guides the user to complete the required daily actions using a short and concise workflow that requires minimal user engagement: these daily actions ask the user to select how they are feeling today on the <italic>Feelings</italic> page, go to the <italic>My Goals</italic> page, and select the competition status of each goal, and then navigate to the <italic>Summary</italic> page to check their progress. At the end of the week, youth are asked to review and revise their concussion recovery plan, which includes adding or removing goals based on guidance from their physician and the <italic>Summary</italic> page. The fully functional mobile phone prototype was further evaluated through this usability study with end users.</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Final prototype information architecture. The app has a total of 8 main sections, with the Menu icons shown near the top.

Participants were excluded if they were younger than 10 years or older than 18 years; had not used mobile phone apps; were non-English speakers; were currently experiencing postconcussion symptoms; or if they had any physical, visual, or cognitive problems that may have precluded them from being able to use the mobile phone technology in the traditional way. Informed consent was obtained by all participants and/or their parents before participation. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital (REB#16-632) in Toronto, Canada.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol</title><p>We conducted a formative lab-based usability study [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with the fully functional mobile phone prototype. Formative lab-based usability testing is a widely used usability testing approach that is iterative in nature [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; the goal of this testing is to make improvements in design before releasing the product [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This includes identifying and diagnosing the problems, making and implementing recommendations, and then re-evaluating the product [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In formative usability studies, the most significant usability findings are observed with the first 5 participants [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This study was conducted at either Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital or at the health care professional&#x02019;s place of practice. The study was conducted in a quiet room and took 30 to 45 min to complete.</p><p>After the participant provided consent to participate in the study, they were asked to complete a demographics form. Then, the participant was introduced to the <italic>think aloud</italic> approach using a short video [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The <italic>think aloud</italic> approach asks the user to continuously verbalize their thoughts about their underlying thinking behind their interactions while using a technology by verbalizing what they are doing and why, stating when they encounter a problem, and how they feel while using the technology [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Next, the objective usability of mobile phone app was assessed by asking participants to complete 12 tasks (<xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) using the mobile phone app while <italic>thinking aloud</italic>. During these tasks, the participants were audio-recorded, and a mobile phone screen recording app (AZ Screen Recorder [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]) was used to record the mobile phone screen; this included recording screen clicks and navigation to aid in identifying usability issues. The participant&#x02019;s actions as well as performance metrics, such as task success, the time on task, and the number of errors and assists were also observed and documented using pen and paper notetaking. In addition, any issues the participants faced while using the technology, including issue type, frequency, and severity were documented.

Analyzing the open-ended answers from the questionnaire revealed that the youth who neither agreed nor disagreed thought it would be hard for youth to remember to set goals and change how they feel every day; however, reviewing the task success and errors data revealed that this youth failed to complete task 3 (ie, setting a daily reminder). The health care professional who disagreed provided no explanation for their choice to disagree with the usefulness of this app. However, during the exit interview, this health care professional did mention that they believed the technology would be useful in helping youth self-manage their concussions if the technology tracked postconcussion symptoms and somehow tied symptoms with the goals.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>This research described the development and evaluation of a mobile phone app to aid youth in self-managing concussion.

One health care professional mentioned that the current clock-face might require a lot of cognitive effort.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">To minimize the cognitive effort required to use this technology and improve usability, the current clock-face should be replaced with scrollable time picker.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In this study, the mean SUS score for this mobile phone app was found to be 81.9 (SD 11.3), which suggests that participants rated the app as highly usable; SUS scores above 68 (SD 12.5) indicate above average usability [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Sauro looked at the relationship between SUS scores and the <italic>Net Promoter Score</italic>. The latter asks individuals how likely they are to recommend a product to a friend or colleague [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Sauro found that individuals who rate a product with an SUS score of 82 (SD 5) tend to be <italic>promoters</italic> for the product [<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Thus, the mean SUS score for this study of 81.9 suggests that people are likely to be <italic>promoters</italic> of this technology, and they are likely to recommend this technology to their friends or colleagues. More importantly, the high and consistent SUS scores provided by youth (mean 87.5, SD 8.5) suggest that they are more likely to be promoters of this technology than health care professionals (mean 76.4, SD 11.5). These results are in contrast to the SUS scores of a recently proposed intervention for pediatric concussion management titled SMART [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The SMART intervention was tested with 4 child/parent pairs, and the mean child SUS score was 81 (SD 22.8), whereas the mean parent score was 89 (SD 10.7) [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These scores suggest that the features and design of the SMART technology resonated better with older adults than children. In addition, the large SD in youth SUS scores indicates that some youth perceived the usability of the SMART technology as below average. In contrast, the results from our study suggest that all youth perceived the usability of the mobile phone technology as high and are likely to be promoters for this technology. Unlike the results for the SMART intervention, these results suggest that the features and design of this technology resonated better with youth than older adults. To better understand the discrepancy between SUS scores among health care professionals and youth, key responses to the posttest questionnaire were analyzed. In the posttest questionnaire, youth and health care professionals were asked if they would recommend this app to a concussed youth, 100% (n=7) of youth slightly agreed or agreed (6/7 agreed and 1/7 slightly agreed), and 4 health care professionals agreed that they would recommend this technology to concussed youth. However, 3 health care professionals did not agree that they would recommend this technology; 1 health care professional neither agreed nor disagreed (ie, neutral), 1 slightly disagreed, and 1 disagreed. These results support Sauro&#x02019;s claim that individuals with SUS scores of 82 (SD 5) tend to be <italic>promoters</italic> for the product and are more likely to recommend the product. To better understand why some health care professionals did not completely agree to recommend the technology, the questionnaire&#x02019;s open-ended responses, if available, were reviewed. A concern among some health care professionals (2/7) who did not agree or slightly agreed to recommend this app was that recommending this app meant they were recommending screen time to concussed youth; this was associated with the fear that extended screen time could lead to exacerbation of symptoms. This may be due to the fact that the best practice concussion management guidelines recommend a period of physical and cognitive rest following a concussion [<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, new international consensus has suggested a shorter rest period; now, the suggested rest period is of approximately 24 to 48 hours after injury versus the previously suggested rest period until resolution of postconcussion symptoms [<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In addition, the benefits of the rest period have not been validated [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and it is unclear whether physical and cognitive rest aid concussed youth in recovery [<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In addition, findings from recent studies suggest that prolonged rest after concussion is associated with increased risk for the development of secondary problems [<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>-<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]; these secondary problems include, anxiety/stress, physical deconditioning, irritability, social isolation, and depression [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Furthermore, it is unknown the extent to which youth adhere to the recommendations for physical and cognitive rest [<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. However, further development of this mobile technology should aim to demand even lower cognitive effort to ensure the technology can be safely used by concussed youth. Many steps can be taken to reduce the amount of cognitive effort required for youth to use this technology, for example, resolving the identified usability issues can reduce the amount of time, frequency of errors, and the amount effort that is required to use a technology; the usability issues can be resolved by applying the provided recommendations (<xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>). In addition, future iterations of the app should inform users about symptoms that may be exacerbated when using a mobile phone app (eg, screen time may lead to increased headaches, fatigue, light sensitivity, and difficulty concentrating), provide methods to reduce possibility of symptom exacerbation (eg, inform users to decrease screen brightness), and notify users of what actions they can take if using the app leads to symptom exacerbation (eg, in the result of symptom exacerbation, stop engaging with the app, rest and attempt to re-engage when symptom exacerbation has resolved). Nevertheless, this usability study instructed participants to complete a series of tasks sequentially, which could have led to a high perceived cognitive workload, whereas concussed youth would only be expected to complete a subset of these tasks every day. Concussed youth would be expected to complete tasks 1 and 5 (<xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) everyday; these tasks ask youth to enter the app, select how they are feeling, then go to their <italic>My Goals</italic> page, and state the completion status of the goals in their action plan. In addition, the youth can view their <italic>Summary</italic> page, which is also a part of task 5. According to the task completion times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure4">Figure 4</xref>), on average these 2 tasks together required 24 seconds to complete. At the end of every week, youth would be asked to perform task 2 or task 7: these tasks ask youth to add a new goal. On average, these tasks take approximately 70 seconds to complete for each goal. Thus, youth would be expected to use this technology for less than 1 min on a daily basis and less than 2 min at the end of each week; this suggests that this technology requires lower effort per day compared with other concussion management interventions [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, during the usability study for the SMART intervention, analyzing the time-on-module data revealed that a mean of 49 min was spent on completing 6 of the 8 modules (2 modules were missing timing data), and there were a total of 103 webpages across the 8 modules [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To evaluate how safely this technology can be used by concussed youth and reduce health care professionals&#x02019; anxiety in recommending it, further work should include the analysis of perceived physical and cognitive workload as compared with other activities youth take part in during concussion recovery. A useful tool for evaluating perceived workload is the NASA Task Load Index questionnaire [<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], which is a widely used and validated questionnaire [<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] that can help to assess the perceived workload of this technology. In addition, further research is needed to trial this technology among a cohort of concussed youth to determine if the technology exacerbates postconcussion symptoms. Nevertheless, the majority (4/7) of health care professionals and all youth (7/7) stated that they would recommend this app to concussed youth.</p><p>In this study, health care professionals were asked about their perceptions of pediatric concussion management on the demographics form. When asked if they find all health care professionals in Canada manage pediatric concussion in a consistent manner, 100% (n=7) of the health care professionals disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement. When health care professionals were asked if they find that all youth in Canada are given enough information to manage their concussion, 86% (6/7) of the health care professionals either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement; 1 health care professional slightly disagreed with the statement. These results are consistent with the current literature, which has shown that there is a lack of standardization and that significant gaps exist in the management of pediatric concussion in Canada [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The results from this study suggest that this technology may be useful in helping reduce the gaps in pediatric concussion management by providing easy access to expert-informed concussion management information and strategies and a tool that can guide youth in self-managing and tracking their concussion recovery.</p><p>All of the participants (n=14) in this study indicated that they either own or have daily access to mobile phone and tablet. This supports the findings from the recent Pew Internet &#x00026; American Life Project that indicate that mobile phones have become the primary communication tool for the majority of adolescents in the United States [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; 75% of those aged 12 to 17 years now own mobile phones [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Both youth and health care professionals have shown interest in this technology; as discussed earlier, 100% (n=7) of youth slightly agreed or agreed (6/7 agreed and 1/7 slightly agreed) and 4 health care professionals agreed that they would recommend this technology to concussed youth. In addition, 100% (n=7) of the youth participants agreed that they would use this technology if they were to suffer another concussion in the future, and 86% of participants either slightly agreed or agreed (9/14 agreed and 3/14 slightly agreed) that this technology would be useful in helping the youth self-manage their concussion. This suggests that this mobile phone app may be an accessible, useful, and a feasible concussion management intervention for concussed youth.</p><p>This usability study provided valuable end-user feedback from both youth and health care professionals. A number of usability issues were identified, and the corresponding recommendations to improve the design of the app were provided (<xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2">Multimedia Appendix 2</xref>); many low and moderate severity issues were identified, and 4 high severity issues were identified. In addition, some recommendations to improve the safety, uptake, and overall design of the technology were provided. Our findings suggest that participants rated this mobile phone app as having high subjective usability as indicated by a mean SUS score of 81.9 (SD 11.3). In addition, mean task success rates were greater than 90% for 92% (11/12) of tasks, and most (11/12; 92%) tasks had a total error frequency of less than 11, which also suggests high objective usability. On average, each task was completed in less than 2 min, which suggests this app is highly efficient. The results of the posttest questionnaires suggest that youth and health care professionals are open to using this app for self-management of concussion in youth and feel that this technology would be useful in helping the youth in managing their concussions. Overall, the results from the study suggest that participants rated this technology as usable, acceptable to users, and that it may be useful in helping youth self-manage concussion. Further work should include the analysis of perceived physical and cognitive workload to evaluate the safely of this technology, applying the recommendations to resolve the identified usability issues, modifying features to reduce physical and cognitive workload, and conducting a second usability study. In addition, further research is needed to trial this technology among a cohort of concussed youth to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this technology.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Most participants (12/14) were from Toronto, Ontario, and the participants who chose to take part in this study may have been more motivated, knowledgeable of concussion management, and comfortable with using mobile phones. Thus, this sample may not be representative of the general concussed youth and health care professional populations. We were unable to gain insight into how different age groups among children and youth may engage and rate usability differently as this would require a larger sample size with representation across ages. The data from usability study were analyzed and interpreted to identify usability issues. This could have biased the study results by not having interpreted a participant&#x02019;s comments appropriately [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, to reduce this bias, we confirmed all findings during the exit interview and used the recordings to enhance and clarify the findings. This study was conducted with the researcher present in the room; a limitation of this type of study is that the behaviors and performance of participants may be altered as a result of their awareness of being observed [<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Although the results of this study suggest that the participants&#x02019; response to this mobile phone app has been very positive, further research is needed to trial this technology among a cohort of concussed youth to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this technology and to identify the subpopulations for whom this intervention would be most effective.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This research describes the development and usability evaluation of an innovative and accessible pediatric concussion management intervention in the form of a fully functional Android mobile phone app prototype <italic>NeuroCare</italic>. The results from our usability study indicate that participants rated this technology as usable, acceptable to youth and health care professionals, and that it may be useful in helping youth self-manage concussion. Consistent with the current literature, results from this research suggest that there are large gaps in the way concussion is managed from both the youths&#x02019; and health care professional&#x02019;s perspectives. This technology is expected to help bridge the gaps in pediatric concussion management by enabling and empowering youth to self-manage concussion by providing easy access to expert-informed concussion management strategies and helping guide youth in managing and tracking their concussion recovery. Next steps should include resolving the identified usability issues, modifying features to reduce cognitive and physical workload, and then conducting another usability study that should include the evaluation of perceived physical and cognitive workload. Future work should trial this technology among a cohort of concussed youth to determine the effectiveness and safety of this technology as a concussion self-management tool/intervention.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR; #127048), the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation, and the Ontario Brain Institute.
