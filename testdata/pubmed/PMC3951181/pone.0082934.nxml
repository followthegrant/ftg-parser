A prior study has demonstrated the anti-proliferative activity of a new class of mitochondria-targeting rosamines. This present study describes <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity of second-generation rosamine analogs, their mode of action, and their <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacies in a tumor allografted mouse model. Here, we showed that these compounds exhibited potent cytotoxicity (average IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0003c;0.5 &#x000b5;M), inhibited Complex II and ATP synthase activities of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway and induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. A NCI-60 cell lines screen further indicated that rosamine analogs <bold>4</bold> and <bold>5</bold> exhibited potent antiproliferative effects with Log<sub>10</sub>GI<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;7 (GI<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.1 &#x000b5;M) and were more effective against a colorectal cancer sub-panel than other cell lines. Preliminary <italic>in vivo</italic> studies on 4T1 murine breast cancer-bearing female BALB/c mice indicated that treatment with analog <bold>5</bold> in a single dosing of 5 mg/kg or a schedule dosing of 3 mg/kg once every 2 days for 6 times (q2d&#x000d7;6) exhibited only minimal induction of tumor growth delay. Our results suggest that rosamine analogs may be further developed as mitochondrial targeting agents. Without a doubt proper strategies need to be devised to enhance tumor uptake of rosamines, i.e. by integration to carrier molecules for better therapeutic outcome.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from Cancer Research Initiatives Foundation, Malaysia Ministry of Higher Education's HIR-MOHE grants (UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/MED/17 and UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/MED/33), Universiti Malaya Post Graduate Research Grant (PS204/2010B), and by grants to KB from The National Institutes of Health (GM087981) and The Robert A.

Lack of selectivity for neoplastic cells exhibited by these drugs typically limits their success as treatment agents. Contemporary chemotherapeutic strategies that target signaling pathways or particular gene products tend to be limited to cancers driven by a dominant oncogene and are often vulnerable to resistance via the multiplicity of tumorigenesis signaling pathways <xref rid="pone.0082934-Lemmon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. For example, most of the HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients who initially responded to treatment with trastuzumab develop secondary trastuzumab resistance within a year after the treatment began <xref rid="pone.0082934-Nahta1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Similar observations have been made for BRAF-targeted vemurafenib for melanoma therapy <xref rid="pone.0082934-Alcala1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and EGFR-targeted gefitinib or erlotinib for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer <xref rid="pone.0082934-Ayoola1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>A relatively new alternative to targeting DNA and enzymes in rapidly proliferating cells, or specific signaling pathways is to focus on organelles like the mitochondria. Mitochondria are the energy generators that maintain cell life and essential cell functions, including multiple signaling cascades that regulate cells, for instance, metabolism, cell cycle control, development, and cell death <xref rid="pone.0082934-McBride1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In cancer chemotherapy, mitochondria-targeting drugs interfere with cancer cell metabolisms by pertubing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, inhibiting the electron redox chain complexes, interfering the mitochondria transmembrane permeability, and targeting mitochondrial-DNA <xref rid="pone.0082934-Biasutto1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, . The most common types of mitochondria-targeting drugs are lipophilic, cationic drugs; these are selective for cancer cells because they tend to have higher mitochondrial membrane potentials than normal epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0082934-ModicaNapolitano1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082934-Lampidis1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>We have previously reported structure-activity relationships (SARs) for the anticancer properties of a series of rosamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082934-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0082934-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082934-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These compounds are delocalized lipophilic cations (DLC) with peripheral cyclic amines and various groups at the <italic>meso</italic> position; the majority of these cations are substantially more potent than rhodamine-123 which is a well-studied delocalized lipophilic cation. Consistence with this, SAR data for the rosamines suggested good potencies correlated with hydrophobic cyclic amines and <italic>meso</italic>-aryl substituents. Thiofuryl and 4-iodophenyl <italic>meso</italic> substitution corresponded to approximately 5-fold improvement in potency compared to phenyl substitution. Additionally, the data indicated that significantly lower IC<sub>50</sub> values were obtained for unsymmetrical compounds (X<sup>1</sup> not same as X<sup>2</sup>), but the combination of unsymmetrical amine substituents with thiofuryl and 4-iodophenyl <italic>meso</italic> substitution was not explored. Intracellular imaging on representative examples indicated these compounds accumulate in the mitochondria. These compounds (i.e rosamine <bold>2</bold> and <bold>5</bold>) are also found to be more cytotoxic against cancer cells compared with immortalized normal epithelial cells of the same organ type <xref rid="pone.0082934-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0082934-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082934.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structural variations of rosamine.</title><p>(A) of the rosamine dyes variously functionalized at the <italic>meso</italic> position as previously reported by Lim et al.

Therefore, risk minimization measures to deal with lactic acidosis such as those employed in the management of patients prescribed with metformin, a commonly used antidiabetic drug with similar toxic side effects, need to be outlined to prevent this serious complication <xref rid="pone.0082934-Renda1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082934-Kraut1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Another documented side effect commonly associated with DLC such as rosamines is selective accumulation of these compounds in cardiac muscle cells that can lead to fatal deterioration in the function of the heart muscle <xref rid="pone.0082934-Kurtoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

NCI-60 cell lines screen showed that these compounds are particularly effective against the colorectal cancer panel of cells and COMPARE analysis revealed a strong correlation in growth inhibitory pattern exhibited by mitochondrial respiratory inhibitor i.e. crystal violet. The anticancer effects of these compounds may have been due to their ability to compromise mitochondrial membrane potential and to inhibit the oxidative phosphorylation complexes primarily the ATP synthase which were both experimentally observed in this study. Although the preliminary <italic>in vivo</italic> antitumor activity of <bold>5</bold> is moderate against 4T1 murine mammary tumor, it may be worthwhile to test the compound in colon cancer xenograft models, for example, models based on HCT-116 and HT-29 cell lines which are both more sensitive to <bold>5</bold> on NCI-60 cell line screen. However further study is needed to diminish the toxic effects observed for this compound.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the National Cancer Institute for NCI-60 tumor cell line screening and Prof. Wong Y.C. from the University of Hong Kong for providing the HK-1 cell line.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0082934-Lemmon1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
