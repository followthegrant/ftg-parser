Acquired or hereditary defects of coagulation or a combination of these defects may facilitate the development of DVT. Recurrent DVT, a positive family history or unusual presentation may warrant investigation for hereditary thrombophilia. Investigations are best when conducted at least one month after completion of a course of anticoagulant therapy. Most patients are managed with heparin in the acute stage overlapped by warfarin. The case presented here describes a 40-year old man undergoing three episodes of DVT. Investigations revealed protein C and protein S deficiency. Protein C, protein S and antithrombin deficiency either singly or in combination, are relatively common causes of hereditary thrombophilia. The case presented here serves as a reminder of the need to look into the underlying cause of venous thromboembolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Deep vein thrombosis</kwd><kwd>Thrombophilia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality with an estimated annual incidence of 0.67 to 1.0 per 1000 among the general population in Western countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3)</xref> Pulmonary embolism and post-phlebitic syndrome are the recognized complications. DVT may be caused by hereditary or acquired defects in the coagulation-anticoagulation pathway. Risk factors include prolonged non-ambulation, recent surgery, obesity, prior DVT, female sex hormone therapy, post-partum status, lower limb trauma, neoplastic disease and stroke. Recurrent DVT, a positive family history and unusual presentation may warrant investigation for hereditary defects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4)</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Case</title><p>A 40-year-old non-smoker, non-diabetic, normotensive male presented with swelling and aching pain of the left lower limb extending from the left thigh to the ankle over one week. Upon examination, his pulse was 80 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 140/85 mm Hg. The left lower limb with dusky blue discoloration of skin was diffusely swollen, warm, and exquisitely tender to touch. Arterial pulses in the legs were palpable. Three years ago, he developed a similar illness in the right leg, and was diagnosed as a case of DVT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>Initial heparin therapy was followed by warfarin, which was discontinued after three months. Within two years the patient had DVT in the left lower limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The patient was prescribed an oral anticoagulant that was discontinued after several months.</p><p>There was no ulceration or gangrenous changes, nor was there any lymphadenopathy. Examination of the precordium revealed normal findings. Other systems were also normal. There was no neurological deficit. Fundoscopy was normal.</p><p>A duplex study of the lower limb vessels showed acute DVT involving the left femoro-popliteal segment. CT angiography revealed normal pulmonary arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Blood sugar, renal and liver function tests, serum electrolytes and calcium were normal. A haemogram including platelet count, urinalysis, chest radiograph and echocardiography revealed normal findings. A compliment fixation test for filaria was negative. Because of the recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), it was decided to search for any coagulation abnormality. Therefore, the blood coagulation profile was studied four weeks after the onset of DVT. Platelet count, bleeding time, clotting time and prothrombin time (PT) were normal. In addition, plasma fibrinogen and homocysteine levels were within normal range, and antithrombin activity in the blood was also normal. Conversely, the protein C activity was 58% (normal range: 70-140%), and the protein S activity was greatly reduced to 17% (normal range: 54-137%). Ideally, coagulation assay should be conducted one month after completion of a course of anticoagulation, but considering the number and frequency of recurrence of DVT, and associated risks of life-threatening complications like pulmonary thromboembolism, anticoagulant therapy was not stopped.</p><p>In the acute setting, the patient was managed according to standard protocols, including elevation of the affected limb. Additionally, 60 mg of enoxapain was administered subcutaneously every 12 hours for one week, and this was overlapped with 5 mg warfarin everyday 72 hours after the onset of low-molecular-weight heparin therapy. The international normalized ratio (INR) was kept between 2 and 3. The patient gradually improved and was discharged with warfarin. In a subsequent visit one month later, the INR was found to be 2.8; therefore, the patient was advised to continue oral anticoagulant therapy indefinitely.</p><p>Factor V Leiden and mutant prothrombin (Prothrombin 20210A) assay could not be done because these tests are not available in Bangladesh.</p><p>During follow-up over the next two-years, the patient was doing well and did not have any complaints related to DVT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Thrombophilia is the term used to describe predisposition to an increased risk of venous and occasionally arterial thromboembolism owing to haematological abnormalities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5)</xref> This condition may be acquired or hereditary. A genetic predisposition to thrombophilia has been identified in up to one-third of unselected patients with VTE and more than one-half of cases with familial thrombosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6)</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7)</xref> There may also be an inability of the body to produce adequate amounts of normal protein, or the body may produce abnormal protein that does not function normally.

Protein C is made in the liver and is vitamin K dependent. It acts to inactivate factor V and factor VIII. This protein also requires protein S as a cofactor and is activated by thrombin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12)</xref> Protein C deficiency is observed in 1 in 200 to 1 in 300 healthy subjects, many of whom remain asymptomatic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13)</xref> The protein S is vitamin K dependent and is synthesized by hepatocytes and megakaryocytes.

The second step is to consider screening for the causes of hereditary and acquired thrombophilia in selected patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18)</xref> Indications for thrombophilia screening are 1) all patients with a first episode of spontaneous VTE, 2) patients with VTE under the age of 50 years, even when they have a transient predisposing factor, 3) patients with VTE whose only risk factor is oral contraceptive therapy, estrogen replacement therapy or pregnancy, 4) patients with recurrent VTE, irrespective of risk factors, 5) patients with recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis without cancer and in the absence of varicose veins, 6) patients with VTE at unusual sites such as the cerebral venous sinus, mesenteric or hepatic veins and retinal vein occlusion under the age of 50 years, 7) patients with warfarin-induced skin necrosis or neonates with purpura fulminans not related to sepsis, 8) asymptomatic first degree relatives of individuals with proven symptomatic thrombophilia, 9) two consecutive or three non-consecutive abortions at any gestational age or one fetal death after the 20th week, 10) severe pre-eclampsia, 11) children with VTE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5)</xref></p><p>Functional, immunological and molecular tests are available for laboratory evaluation of hereditary thrombophilia. Functional and immunological investigations are used for antithrombin, protein S or protein C deficiency and factor V Leiden. Their sensitivity and specificity are variable and are influenced by pregnancy, hepatic insufficiency and medications. Molecular tests are gene specific and more sensitive and specific and available for factor V Leiden and mutant prothrombin 20210A.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5)</xref> A full blood count, platelet count, PT, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPPT) and thrombin clotting time (TCT) should be conducted routinely. Liver function tests and blood urea and electrolytes are also indicated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14)</xref> Blood counts may indicate myeloproliferative disorders, while APTT may be helpful in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, PT for interpretation of low protein C or protein S, and TCT for dysfibrinogenemia. Antiphospholipid antibodies should also be included. Further investigations under appropriate circumstances include assays for antithrombin, protein C and protein S, modified APC/SR test for factor V Leiden and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay for prothrombin G20210A. Factor VIII, homocysteine and fibrinogen assays are the second-line tests for thrombophilia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14)</xref> Polymerase chain reaction for factor V Leiden or prothrombin 20210A can be conducted at any time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5)</xref> Conversely, antithrombin, protein C and protein S assays are best delayed until at least one month after completion of anticoagulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14)</xref></p><p>Heparin, either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight, and warfarin are the mainstays of treatment of acute DVT. The duration of secondary prophylaxis with warfarin depends on the presence of risk factors associated with recurrent DVT. Thrombophilia due to deficiency of antithrombin, protein C or protein S, homozygosity for factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A, presence of cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant, elevated factor VIII or homocysteine and combined defects requires prophylaxis with warfarin indefinitely. INR is kept between 2 and 3.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19)</xref> In a patient with recurrent DVT with thrombophilia, secondary prophylaxis with warfarin is of the utmost importance. The repeated episodes of DVT observed in the case presented here could probably have been prevented if warfarin were continued indefinitely after the first recurrence.</p><p>In conclusion, in patients with recurrence or unusual clinical presentation of DVT, hereditary coagulation defects should be suspected. Laboratory tests during the acute episode may produce considerable confusion; therefore, they should be conducted at least one month after the cessation of anticoagulant therapy. In the presence of significant hereditary thrombophilia, secondary prophylaxis with warfarin is lifelong in most cases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The epidemiology of venous thromboembolism</article-title><source>Circulation</source><year>2003</year><volume>107</volume><issue>23 Suppl 1</issue><fpage>I4</fpage><lpage>I8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12814979</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Silverstein</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Heit</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohr</surname><given-names>DN</given-names></name><name><surname>Petterson</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Fallon</surname><given-names>WM</given-names></name><name><surname>Melton</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names><suffix>3rd</suffix></name></person-group><article-title>Trends in the incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: a 25-year population-based study</article-title><source>Arch Intern Med</source><year>1998</year><volume>158</volume><fpage>585</fpage><lpage>593</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9521222</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Hull</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name><name><surname>Pineo</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology of venous thromboembolism</article-title><source>Disorders of Thrombosis</source><year>1996</year><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>WB Saunders</publisher-name><fpage>159</fpage><lpage>174</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maheshwari</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mehrotra</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Abela</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Deep veins thrombosis.
