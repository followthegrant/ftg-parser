Nonetheless, it is likely to appear as cutaneous lesion, nipple retraction, sinus formation, fistula, abscess and lymphadenopathy.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Sonography findings comprise hypo echoic lobulated mass associated with either tubular or oval structure. IGM in mammography is appeared as neither distinct nor symmetrical densities; however, it could be associated with not only micro calcification and speculate form calcification, but also lymphadenopathy. Pathological finding approach is exploited as the gold standard for IGM diagnosis; though pathology analyzing is strictly recommended for exclusion of malignancy likelihood.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>There is no definitive therapeutic strategy for IGM; nevertheless, some approaches such as close and precise following up, surgery, antibiotic therapy, corticosteroid treatment can be exploited as beneficial strategies.

The target population comprised women whose IGM was substantiated via core biopsy method. Inclusion criteria involved women with mastitis disease showing neither staphylococcus nor TB infections as microbial agents of mastitis, nor treated via any interventional method. Informed consent was acquired from patients included in this intervention. The design of the study was approved by the Ethics committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (project No. 291163). This study was registered in Iranian Registry of clinical trial (IRCT number: IRCT 2013123015999N1).</p><p>The medical group consisted of 20 consecutive patients, which was compared with a historical control treated through surgical approach. Surgical group comprised 39 patients who had operation of IGM (in their medical history) providing their treatment had been implemented more than 1 year (since the commencement of the research). IGM was confirmed through histopathological and bacteriological methods.</p><p>In the medical group, questionnaires included demographic information like age, marital status, number of children, situation of lactation and also, baseline clinical data such as lymphadenopathy, pain, abscess, fever and number, side and size of lesions. Some data such as lymphadenopathy, abscess, fever (temperature &#x0003e;37.2&#x000b0;C), number, and side of lesions were collected by physical examinations, whereas the size of lesions was measured through sonography and the other information such as the pain was collected through interview. Treatment protocol consisted of concurrent administration of azithromycin (250 mg twice daily) and prednisolone (60 mg daily) for 2 weeks. Afterwards, prednisolone treatment was continued for 8 weeks (40 mg/day), then, it was tapered for 6 months. Patients were followed for recurrence of masses through physical examination for 12 months since initiation of treatment.</p><p>The surgical group consisted of patients who underwent partial mastectomy, as a conventional method, about more than a year before the study. We used medical documents of patients in order to gather information about age, marital status, number of children, situation of lactation, lymphadenopathy, pain, abscess, fever, number, side and size of lesions, and recurrence of mass. Indeed, relapse was evaluated for 12 months after the surgery.</p><p>The data were analyzed by SPSS for Windows version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Chi-square test were used to analyze data whenever appropriate. To compare the recurrence rate after 12 months of the initiation of treatment in the two groups we used Chi-square test be jaye ghesmate neveshte shode ebarate zir neveshte gardad. In order to study the association of type of the treatment to the recurrence rate we used regression method to control factors contributing to relapse such as lacrimation, abscess, number of children, size and number of lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 59 women documented for IGM through biopsy technique were included in this study. 20 patients were treated through medical approaches in a clinical trial, whilst the efficacy of surgical treatment was analyzed in 39 cases of IGMs. One patient treated through medical approach was excluded due to pregnancy situation and one individual in the respective medical trial was transferred to surgical one due to failure of treatment.</p><p>Mean of ages of people included in medical approach and surgical approach were 30.3 (standard deviation [SD] = 6.38) and 36.74 (SD = 13.51), respectively without significant statistical difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.154). Most of the women were of reproductive age (77.9%), though, there was no significant difference in above mentioned groups for marital status (<italic>P</italic> = 0. 108). Median of child numbers was two and three in medical and surgical groups respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001).

Hence, the pharmaceutical approach (without surgery) is strongly recommended; nonetheless, surgery could be suggested in the case of recurrent patients or lack of pharmaceutical efficacy.</p><p>However, there is no definite treatment in the case of IGM, whilst variety of methods has been testified in different studies. For example, DeHertogh <italic>et al</italic>. in 1980 were the first who investigated the efficacy of different treatments and they concluded that corticosteroid is an appropriate option for the treatment of the disease.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Furthermore, Sakurai <italic>et al</italic>. sought this pharmaceutical approach and they authenticated that corticosteroid could be efficient in 87% of patients without any relapse.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The proceeded results were validated by Hisuing <italic>et al</italic>. while their research implied that low doses of corticosteroids were efficient; though, more investigations in this field were recommended by them.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Moreover, in 2010, it was authenticated that corticosteroids provide appropriate treatment, whereas first option should be allocated to surgery in the case of relapse, fistula, and abscess.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Nonetheless, there are some investigations providing different results. For example, Boufettal <italic>et al</italic>. testified different approaches, which include tumorectomy plus antibiotic therapy with or without non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in 16 patients, tumorectomy plus antibiotic therapy and corticosteroid in one individual, and finally corticosteroid plus antibiotic therapy in three individual. This research showed that combination of surgery and corticosteroid application were the most appropriate approach since corticosteroids could be recommended in order to avoid relapse of the disease. It is suggested that the diverse result of the latter study might be justified by the difference of the samples in comparison with the present study.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>IGM, most of the times, occurs unilaterally and its clinical manifestations are defined as fever, lymphadenopathy, breast mass ranging from 0.5 to 15 cm.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] All of the patients in our study had breast masses and most of them were occurred unilateral in left breast. However, three patients had bilateral breast masses with proceeded clinical signs.</p><p>This study demonstrated that the number of breast masses was the only factor, which was significantly related to IGM relapse: The probability of IGM relapse increased 24 times per one increase in the mass numbers.</p><p>The limitation of our study was smallness of sample size due to the rare incidence of the disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This clinical trial demonstrated that pharmaceutical treatment has appropriate efficacy in IGM treatment relapse as well as surgical treatment. Moreover, this study presented number of the lesions as the most appropriate criteria for IGM prognosis and relapse.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>All authors have contributed in designing and conducting the study.
