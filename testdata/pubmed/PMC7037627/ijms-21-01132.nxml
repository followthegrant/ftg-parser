This study was undertaken to determine the performance of lapine (L) ACL-derived fibroblasts on embroidered poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide-<italic>co</italic>-<italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-caprolactone) (P(LA-CL)) and polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds in regard to a tissue engineering approach for ACL reconstruction. Surface modifications of P(LA-CL)/PLA by gas-phase fluorination and cross-linking of a collagen foam using either ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) or hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) were tested regarding their influence on cell adhesion, growth and gene expression. The experiments were performed using embroidered P(LA-CL)/PLA scaffolds that were seeded dynamically or statically with LACL-derived fibroblasts. Scaffold cytocompatibility, cell survival, numbers, metabolic activity, ultrastructure and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) synthesis were evaluated. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) revealed gene expression of collagen type I (COL1A1), decorin (DCN), tenascin C (TNC), Mohawk (MKX) and tenomodulin (TNMD). All tested scaffolds were highly cytocompatible. A significantly higher cellularity and larger scaffold surface areas colonized by cells were detected in HMDI cross-linked and fluorinated scaffolds compared to those cross-linked with EDC or without any functionalization. By contrast, sGAG synthesis was higher in controls. Despite the fact that the significance level was not reached, gene expressions of ligament extracellular matrix components and differentiation markers were generally higher in fluorinated scaffolds with cross-linked collagen foams. LACL-derived fibroblasts maintained their differentiated phenotype on fluorinated scaffolds supplemented with a HMDI cross-linked collagen foam, making them a promising tool for ACL tissue engineering. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ligament tissue engineering</kwd><kwd>ACL</kwd><kwd>embroidered scaffold</kwd><kwd>polylactic acid (PLA)</kwd><kwd>poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide-<italic>co</italic>-&#x003b5;-caprolactone (P(LA-CL))</kwd><kwd>fluorine</kwd><kwd>cross-linked collagen foam</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-21-01132"><title>1. Introduction </title><p>The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a hypocellular and hypovascular dense connective tissue. It runs intraarticularly, directly connecting the inner surface of the lateral femur condyle with the anterior tibial plateau, thereby ensuring knee stability. Since self-healing of the ruptured ACL is unlikely, a reconstruction must be carried out [<xref rid="B1-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In order to prevent the development of osteoarthritis as a typical sequela of knee instability, resulting in chronic knee pain, autologous tendon grafts are currently used as a gold standard for ACL reconstruction [<xref rid="B3-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, in light of the very forceful anatomical double-bundle structure of the ACL, these tendon autografts may not be able to permanently withstand the mechanical loads [<xref rid="B3-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Numerous experiments with various cell-free biomaterials to support ACL reconstruction have already been carried out, but with little success for clinical applications [<xref rid="B4-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, a tissue engineered ACL reconstruction is still urgently needed. Since the ACL is a hypocellular tissue, a stable and transient cell carrier is required to provide stability until a sufficient extracellular matrix (ECM) is synthesized by the cells and novel ACL tissue is formed.</p><p>Biomaterials that are appropriate as transient cell carriers for ACL reconstruction must be cyto- and biocompatible and withstand biomechanical stress [<xref rid="B5-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Synthetic materials such as poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide-<italic>co</italic>-<italic>&#x003b5;</italic>-caprolactone) (P(LA-CL)) or polylactic acid (PLA) are already established in the medical field [<xref rid="B9-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. P(LA-CL) has been recommended for ACL tissue engineering [<xref rid="B11-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The advantage of these materials is that they are cytocompatible [<xref rid="B12-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], degradable over a sufficient long period of time as well as stable enough and suitable for the embroidery process [<xref rid="B14-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Embroidered structures have promising biomechanical properties and are suited for colonization with lapine ACL (LACL)-derived fibroblasts [<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. PLA has been described as a degradable, biomechanically robust, highly biocompatible and well processable polymer [<xref rid="B16-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, a disadvantage is that PLA alone provides only limited cell adhesion, as described for ACL fibroblasts previously [<xref rid="B12-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Major influencing factors are its hydrophobicity [<xref rid="B16-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and the release of acidic degradation products [<xref rid="B17-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast to PLA, P(LA-CL) threads are more suitable for cell attachment, as shown in previous works [<xref rid="B12-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, functionalization of P(LA-CL) scaffolds has also been recommended [<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Accordingly, Chen et al. reported that functionalization of P(LA-CL) scaffolds with silk fibroin led to a higher proliferation of a human fibroblast cell line after 7 days [<xref rid="B18-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. </p><p>For this reason, a scaffold embroidered from both P(LA-CL) and PLA threads has been developed and supplemented with collagen foam. Hoyer et al. [<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed that a collagen foam integrated into P(LA-CL) scaffolds increased the colonization with LACL-derived fibroblasts, but did not mediate the direct cell-thread contact when incorporated into polydioxanone scaffolds. Moreover, the adherence of the collagen foam to the threads and its stability in the scaffold was limited [<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. From this, it can be concluded that additional functionalization and a special collagen cross-linking technique provide an advantage. </p><p>Collagen is a major structural protein of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of many tissues and supports their resilience as a stabilizing framework. The ECM of the ACL consists of more than 85% of collagen type I and III as well as of 12% sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) (related to dry tissue) [<xref rid="B19-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Collagen has successfully been used to improve cell adherence on synthetic polymers such as P(LA-CL) [<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It represents a helpful component to supplement polymer scaffolds for ligament tissue engineering, leading to increased collagen deposition and mechanical properties of the reconstructed ligament in vivo compared to the implanted pure polymer [<xref rid="B20-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Cross-linking of collagen is a recommended strategy for its stabilization, but the particular cross-linking agent should be selected properly in order to obtain a robust and cytocompatible construct [<xref rid="B21-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. </p><p>Chemical cross-linking stabilizes triple helical collagen against enzymatic degradation and denaturation by temperature [<xref rid="B22-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Many different reagents have been used in the past such as glutaraldehyde, carbodiimides, isocyanates, epoxides as well as polyvalent metal cations. These chemicals usually react with different side chains of the collagen molecules [<xref rid="B22-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This work aims at achieving high cytocompatibility and for this reason hexamethylen isocyanate (HMDI) and ethyl-3(3-dimethylamino)propylcarbodiimide (EDC) were used to stabilize the collagen&#x02019;s structure. Both have been investigated in the past regarding the stabilization of biomaterials [<xref rid="B23-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It has been reported that chemically cross-linked collagen using EDC facilitates higher rates of human fibroblasts migration and new tissue formation than physical cross-linking based on dehydrothermal treatment or ultraviolet light [<xref rid="B26-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A multitude of different material compositions, comprising a collagen component with increased stability against degradation and thus diverse application areas like bone tissue engineering [<xref rid="B27-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], soft tissue engineering [<xref rid="B28-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and also decellularized scaffolds [<xref rid="B29-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] were treated with HMDI for chemical cross-linking to increase their stability. Therefore, HMDI was also included as a cross-linker in the present study. Additionally, EDC and HMDI cross-linking were particularly suitable for dermal implants [<xref rid="B30-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], for hard tissue application [<xref rid="B31-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or for bioprosthetic mesh materials [<xref rid="B32-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Functionalization can not only be executed by coating with cross-linked collagen but also with a fluorination of the material surface to upgrade the actual basic PLA framework e.g., leading to increased hemocompatibility as an indicator of cytocompatibility [<xref rid="B33-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or elevated cell adhesion [<xref rid="B34-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The effect of gas-phase fluorination on biomaterials is not fully understood but includes radical chain reactions on the material surface, resulting in fluorine radical formation, which opens C&#x02013;H bonds and generates novel C-F, C-F2 and C-F3 groups ([<xref rid="B35-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Schroepfer et al.: Gas-phase fluorination on PLA improves cell adhesion and spreading, submitted in 2020 <italic>to ACS Omega</italic>). Based on the results of a previous work (Schroepfer et al.), the embroidered P(LA-CL)/PLA scaffolds in the present study were functionalized with a 10% fluorine concentration during synthetic air flushing and a native purified collagen foam. </p><p>The focus of the present study was to ensure cell adhesion and the differentiated phenotype of LACL-derived fibroblast through a suitable modification of the surface of the bi-component scaffold made of P(LA-CL) and PLA. The hypothesis of the present study is that the adherence, proliferation and migration ability of LACL-derived fibroblasts could potentially be increased in P(LA-CL)/PLA scaffolds treated by gas-phase fluorination and supplemented with a collagen foam. A second assumption was that a higher stability and superior scaffold colonization can be reached by cross-linking and thereby stabilizing of the collagen foam within the scaffold [<xref rid="B36-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To prove this, two cross-linking methods were tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-21-01132"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-21-01132"><title>2.1.

Cytotoxicity of Scaffold Variants</title><p>To assess whether the scaffold functionalization exerted cytotoxic effects on cells, cytotoxicity testing according to the International Standard DIN ISO 10993-5:2009 was performed with the murine L929 fibroblasts as a testing cell line. Since LACL-derived fibroblasts were used for the scaffold seeding experiments, these cells were also included in cytotoxicity testing experiments. The embroidered scaffold variants were either non-functionalized (control) or functionalized with gas-phase fluorination, filled with collagen foam and cross-linked with ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) or hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The metabolic activity of the L929 fibroblasts was higher than 75% when treated with extracts of all four scaffold variants. The positive control (treatment with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)) was lower than 45% and the negative control (treatment with normal growth medium) was 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot2-ijms-21-01132"><title>2.1.2. LACL-Derived Fibroblast Survival on the Scaffold</title><p>Due to the fact that none of the four scaffold functionalization variants was cytotoxic, scaffold colonization by LACL-derived fibroblasts was tested. Two seeding approaches were used: a dynamical seeding procedure with a cell suspension as well as a statical seeding strategy in which self-assembled fibroblast spheroids were placed on the scaffold. Since ligament-derived fibroblasts are mechanosensitive, the dynamical culture model was chosen to provide some mechanical stimuli for the cells. The spheroid-based method allows the directed seeding of distinct scaffold areas with cells and served as a suitable method for observation of the adherence as well as the combined spreading and migratory activity of LACL-derived fibroblasts: Spheroids have to attach to the scaffold mediated through direct cell-scaffold interactions in order to enable cell emigration from the spheroid onto the threads. After 7 and 14 days in both culture systems cell survival on the scaffolds was verified with a vitality assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The live/dead images showed that LACL-derived fibroblasts colonized all four scaffold types (control, only fluorinated, EDC cross-linking and HMDI cross-linking variations, both combined with fluorination).</p><p>The scaffold of the control group, however, presented only few clusters of aggregated cells after seven days of dynamical seeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). After 14 days, it was found that although some dead cells were present, these were distributed in the majority of the living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>I). The shapes of the cell spheroids placed onto the statically seeded scaffold remained mainly round and convex, with only a few cells migrating from the spheroids into the control scaffolds after 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). After 14 days the spheroids were still round, but more flattened, whereby more single cells had moved out of the spheroid and migrated onto the threads of the scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>M). Fluorinated scaffolds that were seeded dynamically with the cell suspension showed more cell adhesion compared to the non-fluorinated control after 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). The results after 14 days did not significantly differ compared to the respective control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>I,J). At the same time, the spheroid culture on fluorinated scaffolds revealed that the spheroids were more deeply embedded in the scaffold compared to the non-fluorinated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>E,F). A higher number of emigrated and viable cells was observed on the threads around the spheroids after 14 compared to 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>N) but with no major differences to the control at 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>M). In comparison to the control, more cells were distributed on the threads after 7 days of dynamical culture in the EDC cross-linked variant supplemented with collagen foam. Formation of some small cell clusters was visible after 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). After 14 days, the number of cells on the threads was higher and the cell arrangement was denser than after 7 days in the dynamical culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>K). The spheroid culture on EDC cross-linked scaffolds showed a large colonized area, with only a few dead cells after 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>G). After 14 days, the spheroid was still visible with more emigrated cells forming small clusters than after 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>O). The HMDI cross-linked scaffolds showed an even distribution of LACL-derived fibroblasts on the threads only 7 days after seeding with a cell suspension and dynamical culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). After 14 days, mainly living LACL-derived fibroblasts were still visible, densely colonizing the scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>L). Hence, the cell behavior was similar to that after 7 days. The HMDI cross-linked variant showed more threads colonized with LACL-derived fibroblasts than the other three groups. In this variation, the spheroid-based scaffold colonization showed a spheroid with a high number of living and only a few dead cells in the middle of the spheroid after 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>H). The spheroid containing the majority of vital cells and only a few dead cells at its surface was completely embedded between the threads after 14 days. The spheroid shape was no longer discernible and the threads around the spheroid were colonized by more cells than the three other scaffold variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f003">Figure 3</xref>P).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot3-ijms-21-01132"><title>2.1.3. Cell Morphology on the Scaffold Functionalization Variants Shown by Scanning Electron Microscopy</title><p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of primary LACL-derived fibroblasts on the embroidered scaffolds showed direct cell attachment and spreading on the threads after 14 days of dynamical culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f004">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;D). A close interaction of the cells with the scaffold threads could be seen. Fibroblasts on the scaffold without functionalization showed a convex and spindle-shaped cell body with a small number of filopodia. Cells on the scaffold with fluorine functionalization had a flattened cell shape. The fibroblasts were embedded in a filamentous network of collagen in the EDC cross-linked scaffold. The cells were rounded, had a convex cell body and formed a small cluster. Fibroblasts on the HMDI cross-linked scaffolds were elongated and flattened with a high number of cell-scaffold contacts by focal adhesion points. In addition, elongated filopodia could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f004">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;D). </p><p>The spheroid based seeding method was used to visualize spreading and migratory activity of the cells.

Especially in the HMDI cross-linked scaffolds, a higher number of emigrated cells could be observed in comparison to the non-functionalized scaffolds, where cells remained convex and oriented parallelly to each other in a helicoidally twist around the thread. It was observed that the filopodia of LACL-derived fibroblasts contained multiple cell adhesion points and were generally longer, more stretched and had a higher tendency to orientate along the thread direction in the HMDI cross-linked scaffold when compared to the other variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f004">Figure 4</xref>E&#x02013;L).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot4-ijms-21-01132"><title>2.1.4.

Only about 3% of the surface area of the control scaffold was occupied by cells measured with the ImageJ software. The colonized scaffold areas of the HMDI cross-linked scaffolds were significantly higher than in the three other scaffold variants with 18% (7 days) and 17% (14 days), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f005">Figure 5</xref>A).

The cell number per scaffold was around 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells in the scaffold with fluorine functionalization alone. Generally, there was a slight and non-significant cell number reduction on each scaffold type after 14 days in comparison to the 7-day time point.

Although the differences were not significant for the 7 day time point, all functionalized scaffold variants (fluorine, fluorine + collagen + EDC and fluorine + collagen + HMDI) showed a slightly higher metabolic activity compared to the control (without functionalization). After 14 days, the metabolic activity of LACL-derived fibroblasts on the different scaffold types was generally lower than the activity at the 7-day time point (not significant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot7-ijms-21-01132"><title>2.1.7. sGAGs Synthesized by LACL-Derived Fibroblasts on the Scaffold Variants</title><p>sGAG content was analyzed by using the DMMB assay to proof the synthetic activity of LACL-derived fibroblasts within the scaffold variants.

However, a significant increase in sGAGs could be measured when comparing sGAG synthesis at 7 and 14 days in the non-functionalized scaffolds (control).

Migration Distance of LACL-Derived Fibroblasts into Scaffold Variants</title><p>The extent of cell penetration into inner parts of the scaffold was measured for all four scaffold variants after DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Cells were seeded dynamically with a LACL cell suspension and cultured for 7 days. Vertical cross-sections of scaffolds of the control group showed that the LACL-derived fibroblasts were mostly localized at the surface of the scaffold and formed cell clusters inside the scaffold. Therefore, the penetration depth of cells was significantly lesser in the control scaffolds in comparison to the other three variants. After 7 days, the penetration depth of the cells in the HMDI cross-linked scaffolds was significantly larger colonizing more than 45% of the cross-sectional diameter compared to the control groups, solely fluorinated scaffold group and the EDC cross-linked group. It seemed that both outer layers and most of the inner layer of the HMDI cross-linked scaffolds were nearly completely penetrated by LACL-derived fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f006">Figure 6</xref>D). </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot1dot9-ijms-21-01132"><title>2.1.9. Expression of Ligament-Related Genes in Scaffold Cultures</title><p>The expression of ligament-related genes was measured to assess whether the differentiated phenotype of ligament-derived fibroblasts is maintained on the scaffold. Generally, a high inter-donor variance was observed with all genes investigated. Hence, the differences did not reach the significance level. At 24 h, the relative collagen type I (alpha1 chain, COL1A1) expression was the highest in the non-functionalized scaffold in comparison to the other three scaffold groups. The relative gene expression of COL1A1 decreased after 7 days but increased after 14 days again in all four scaffold variants, with no significant differences between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). Although there was no significant difference to the functionalized variants, the relative decorin (DCN) gene expression of LACL-derived fibroblasts was the highest after 24 h in the scaffolds without functionalization. Over the entire observation, the relative DCN expression decreased in the non-functionalized scaffold but remained stable in the functionalized variants. The relative DCN expression in the scaffold with fluorine functionalization was nearly the same at 7 and 14 days. At 24 h, the relative DCN expression was the lowest in the EDC cross-linked scaffold in comparison to the other three functionalized scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). At 24 h and at 7 days the relative tenascin C (TNC) expression was the highest in the HMDI cross-linked variant. At 14 days the relative TNC gene expression showed no major difference between the four scaffold variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f007">Figure 7</xref>C). LACL-derived fibroblasts revealed higher transcriptional activity of the Mohawk (MKX) gene in the control group after 24 h in comparison to other groups after 24 h. The relative MKX gene expression slightly increased over time in the HMDI cross-linked variant. After 14 days, the relative MKX gene expression increased non-significantly in the functionalized scaffolds compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01132-f007">Figure 7</xref>D). In the scaffold with only fluorine functionalization a continuous increase over time as well as the highest relative tenomodulin (TNMD) expression could be observed.

Discussion</title><p>Scaffold based ligament regeneration depends on crucial cellular processes including cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and tissue maturation [<xref rid="B37-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Scaffolds prepared from synthetic biomaterials that can meet biomechanical requirements [<xref rid="B12-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] often do not sufficiently support these cell needs. Hence, an appropriate functionalization of the material is necessary. This study focused on scaffold functionalization tailored for ACL tissue engineering and characterized LACL-derived fibroblasts performance in a functionalized scaffold in detail. The results of the experiments revealed that scaffold fluorination and supplementation with collagen foam stabilized by HMDI cross-linking are appropriate for ACL scaffold functionalization. </p><p>Moreover, a high cytocompatibility of all scaffold surface modifications, irrespective of whether cross-linked or not, could be proven with both a fibroblast cell line (L929) or primary LACL-derived fibroblasts with no significant differences for HMDI and EDC. The vitality assay showed that the all scaffolds variants could be colonized with primary LACL-derived fibroblasts not only using a dynamical but also with a statical cell spheroid-based method. This underlines the cytocompatibility of the cross-linked collagen foam within the scaffolds. The HMDI cross-linked variant revealed the largest colonized scaffold areas corresponding with the highest cell content calculated from the DNA content. However, there was no increase in the colonized area from 7 to 14 days in none of the four scaffold variants. Moreover, the cell number decreased slightly but not significantly on all variants after 14 days in culture. This allows the assumption that impaired cellularity could mimic the natural switch from cell proliferation to matrix synthesis, organization and differentiation in maturing ligaments. Generally, mature ligaments possess a lower cell content than immature tissues [<xref rid="B38-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but decreased cell numbers could also be caused by a loss of cell adhesion. </p><p>It has been shown previously that surface modifications by fluorination using xenondifluoride as a fluorination agent increased mesenchymal stromal cell adhesion on graphene sheets and their neuronal differentiation [<xref rid="B39-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but the effects of fluorine or of material surface alterations mediated by fluorination on LACL-derived fibroblasts are still unknown. Therefore, effects of gas-phase fluorination on cells are currently studied in more detail ([<xref rid="B29-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] <italic>Schroepfer</italic> et al.: Gas-phase fluorination on PLA improves cell adhesion and spreading, submitted 2020 <italic>to ACS Omega</italic>). The stimulation of various G proteins through aluminofluoride [<xref rid="B40-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] was described. <italic>Wardas</italic> and colleagues gave evidence that fluorine leads to an activation of the lysyl and prolyl hydroxylases, which are essential for collagen production, inducing a slight increase in collagen synthesis [<xref rid="B41-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. An impaired fibroblast growth has also been reported in the presence of fluorine concentrations higher than 0.2 parts per million (ppm) [<xref rid="B42-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. While it remains questionable whether cells indeed take up fluorine, it is necessary to consider the possibility that only indirect effects on cells occur, mediated by fluorination-induced changes e.g., of the surface charges and hydrophilicity of a respective material treated. The fluorinated scaffolds revealed only a slight but not significant stimulatory effect on LACL-derived fibroblast growth and activity on the scaffolds, observed after 7 days, but the degree of cell penetration into the scaffolds was indeed significantly higher than in the control scaffolds at the same time point suggesting an influence of fluorine on cell performance. </p><p>Compared with the fluorination alone, the stimulatory influence on cell colonization of deeper scaffold areas exerted by a collagen foam was significantly higher either cross-linked by EDC or more pronounced, when treated with HMDI. One could hypothesize that the refibrillated collagen presents natural binding motifs for integrin mediated cell adhesion and migration. The measured cell penetration at day 7 of around 45% of the inner scaffold diameter for the HMDI cross-linked variant suggests that the porosity of the scaffolds might be within a suitable range for ACL-derived fibroblasts. The porosity was calculated previously to be 65%&#x02013;75% for the non-functionalized scaffolds [<xref rid="B43-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The retention of cells in the scaffold over the entire observation time suggests also sufficient stability of the collagen foam by both cross-linking techniques. </p><p>In this study, the statical spheroid seeding approach was used as a simple and versatile model to study cell adherence and migration onto the scaffold threads. Spheroids present a tool for targeted and directed colonization of defined scaffold areas by the desired cell type. Hence, a spheroid-based seeding has become a well-established method in regenerative medicine, not only with stem cells [<xref rid="B44-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], endothelial cells [<xref rid="B45-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] or osteoblasts [<xref rid="B46-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] but also with ligament- and particularly ACL-derived fibroblasts, as previously shown [<xref rid="B15-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The results after 14 days indicate that long-term cultivation is possible with both the dynamical and statical (spheroid-based) seeding approaches. Scaffolds with no functionalization (control group) showed lesser numbers of emigrated cells and smaller spheroid sizes, suggesting lower cell-thread interaction and thereby spreading than the three scaffold types with functionalization. SEM analysis of the spheroids allowed a detailed insight into spheroid attachment on the scaffold variants as well as the emigration of the fibroblasts compared to live/dead staining. The more flattened spheroid and cells on the HMDI cross-linked variant suggest a more intense cell-thread interaction.</p><p>The parallel cell arrangement and longitudinal orientation according to the thread direction observed in the present study by SEM and live/dead staining is comparable to cell alignment in the native ACL [<xref rid="B47-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and was observed in another scaffold type consisting of braided nanofibers [<xref rid="B48-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. </p><p>In addition to cell distribution, synthetic activity is important for tissue formation. The present study revealed that primary LACL-derived fibroblasts are still highly metabolically active in all investigated scaffold variants with no significant difference between 7 and 14 days. If the synthetic capacity is considered, a comparatively low sGAG content was observed at 7 days of dynamical cultivation, which is not unusual for ligament-derived fibroblasts compared to chondrocytes [<xref rid="B49-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, it increased in the non-functionalized control group, becoming significantly higher than in all the other scaffold variants after 14 days. The most important proteoglycan containing sGAGs in ligaments and tendons is the small leucine-rich proteoglycan named decorin (DCN). It was investigated here at the gene expression level. In general, a functionalization led to a higher expression after 14 days in comparison to the non-functionalized scaffold group after 14 days. DCN is involved in the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis, modulation of growth factor activity and regulation of cellular growth [<xref rid="B51-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. DCN has a life-long expression [<xref rid="B53-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and it is involved in tendon healing [<xref rid="B54-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Therefore, the decrease in relative DCN gene expression in the HMDI cross-linked scaffold after 7 days could be part of a natural remodeling process in the tissue-engineered construct. Since the particular effect of EDC and HMDI on ligamentogenesis by LACL-derived fibroblasts in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds has not been investigated so far, gene expression analysis of other ligament-related genes was performed. </p><p>Collagen type I is the most abundant protein in the extracellular matrix of ACL. An increase in the COL1A1 gene expression level as observed at 14 days compared to 7 days in the present study is in accordance with another study [<xref rid="B55-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and could indicate the starting point of tissue formation. </p><p>Gene expression of the fibroblast marker and extracellular glycoprotein tenascin C (TNC) typically observed in ACL-derived fibroblasts [<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] could be confirmed, showing no significant difference between functionalization variants. TNC gene expression after 7 days, especially in the HMDI cross-linked scaffold, confirmed our hypothesis that collagen cross-linking offers LACL-derived fibroblasts a more suitable opportunity for cell matrix formation than other functionalized scaffolds. </p><p>Expression of the tendon/ligament-specific transcription factor Mohawk (MKX) is influenced by surface topology as shown for other synthetic polymer scaffolds including braided structures and mesenchymal stromal cells undergoing tenogenesis [<xref rid="B56-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It is also known to be regulated by mechanical forces and to mediate mechanoresponses [<xref rid="B57-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. For this reason, we used a dynamical culture approach for gene expression analysis in the present study. The MKX gene expression of LACL-derived fibroblasts increased non-significantly after 14 days compared to 7 days, suggesting the maintenance of the ligament-specific phenotype in the scaffolds [<xref rid="B59-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Interestingly, no significant differences in MKX expression between the non-functionalized and functionalized scaffolds were observed during the entire observation time. Although MKX is known to regulate type I collagen gene expression [<xref rid="B59-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], no correlations could be found at the gene expression level. </p><p>Tenomodulin (TNMD) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein of tendons and ligaments, which participates in tendon development, proliferation and maturation and hence, is designated as tendon marker [<xref rid="B60-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The relative expression of TNMD in the four different scaffold variation increased after 14 days in culture, especially the functionalized scaffolds with fluorine and EDC cross-linking showed high expression after 14 days compared to the other groups [<xref rid="B15-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijms-21-01132" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>In summary, a new scaffold functionalization strategy based on a fluorination and a cross-linked refibrillated collagen foam has been successfully developed and evaluated for ACL tissue engineering using a lapine primary ACL cell model as basis for future research in a rabbit ACL reconstruction approach. Functionalization of the scaffold in itself supported cell adherence, cell content and the differentiated ACL phenotype more extensively than without functionalization. This study focused solely on cytocompatibility and the cell response to scaffold functionalization. Cell retention over the whole observation time suggested sufficient stability of the cross-linked collagen foam. Future studies using only a simple dynamical culture procedure should provide stronger evidence how the ligamentogenic cellular response of the LACL-derived fibroblasts (cell orientation, proliferation and specific extracellular matrix synthesis) can be optimized by uniaxial cyclic tension of the functionalized embroidered P(LA-CL)/PLA scaffolds. </p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-21-01132"><title>4.

Measurement of the Penetration Depth of Cells into the Scaffolds</title><p>The cell nuclei stained with 4&#x02032;,6&#x02032;-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI) were assessed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Scaffolds were rinsed with Tris buffered saline (TBS: 0.05 M Tris, 0.015 NaCl, pH 7.6) before being incubated with protease-free donkey serum (5% diluted in TBS with 0.1% Triton X100) for cell permeabilization for 20 min at RT. Cell nuclei were stained using DAPI (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 20 min at RT. Subsequently, scaffolds were washed several times with TBS before examined by using CLSM. The penetration depth of vertically cross-sectioned scaffolds was measured with the Leica X 3D image simulation program. Measurement was done starting at the scaffold border extending to the position of the innermost nuclei detected in the scaffold. The relative values were calculated according to the absolute scaffold thickness (cross-section). Three independent experiments were performed. Three pictures of each scaffold were taken. In summary, nine images of each scaffold variant with distance measurements at five different positions in each image were included.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5dot4-ijms-21-01132"><title>4.5.4.

Afterwards, the scaffolds were gently rinsed four times, each 15 min in PBS and dehydrated in an ascending ethanol (ETOH) series (70%, 80%, 90% and 96% ETOH, each for 30 min) and three times 100% ETOH for 15 min. Then, the samples were critical point dried, mounted onto specimen holders and sputtered (agar auto carbon coater, Agar scientific Ltd, Essex, UK) with a thin layer of carbon before photos were taken by the SEM (Cambridge Stereoscan 250; ESEM XL30, Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. </p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5dot5-ijms-21-01132"><title>4.5.5.

Quantitative Assays for DNA- and Sulfated Glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) Quantification</title><p>By CyQUANT&#x000ae; NF Cell Proliferation Assay the influence of respective treatment on cell division was examined after 7 and 14 days. The standard curve was generated by serial dilution of calf thymus DNA stock solution (1 mg mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) with TRIS/EDTA (TE)-buffer (10 mM TRIS (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA in Aqua dest). For the standard curve, 25 &#x000b5;L of the serial calf thymus DNA dilutions was mixed with 25 &#x000b5;L of CyQuant dye solution (Hank`s balanced salt solution (HBSS) + dye binding solution 1:250 (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA)). After analyzing time points (7 and 14 days) of 3D culture, scaffolds had to be transferred to RNase and DNase using free 2 mL safe seal tubes (Sarstedt AG &#x00026; Co. KG, N&#x000fc;rnbrecht, Germany) with 50 &#x000b5;L of the Proteinase K digestion buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20) containing 0.5 mg mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> proteinase K (PanReac, ApplyChem, Darmstadt, Germany). Samples were homogenized with a 7 mm stainless steel bead (RNase and DNase free, sterile, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) by using the Tissue Lyser of Qiagen (50 Hz, 5 min, RT). Then, 250 &#x000b5;L of the Proteinase K digestion buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20) containing 0.5 mg mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> proteinase K (PanReac, ApplyChem) were added. All samples were digested for 16 h at 56 &#x000b0;C under continuous shaking. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by freezing the samples at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C for 30 min. Before DNA quantification, all samples were thawed and then centrifuged for 15 min at 10000 rounds per minutes (rpm). 10 &#x000b5;L of each sample were added to 150 &#x000b5;L TE buffer and thoroughly mixed.

Subsequently, plates were covered to be protected from light and incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 60 min. The fluorescence of each well was measured in triplicate at 485 excitation/530 emission nm in a fluorometric plate reader. Three independent experiments with cells derived from three different donors were performed. </p><p>For the dimethyl methylene Blue (DMMB) Assay, the same supernatant was used as in the CyQuant Assay. After adequate sample dilution the DMMB solution (ApplyChem) was added (40 mM glycine (Sigma-Aldrich), 40 mM NaCl (Carl Roth GmbH) at pH 3 and DMMB (8.9 mM in ethanol)). Chondroitin sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as standard. The absorption shift was measured at wave length of &#x003bb; = 633 nm to &#x003bb; = 552 nm using a Genios spectral photometer (Tecan, Groedig, Austria).

Conclusions</title><p>This study showed that 3D embroidered scaffolds can be functionalized with a gas-phase fluorination and a cross-linked collagen foam. A detailed investigation (cell survival, scaffold colonization, cell numbers, ultra-morphology) revealed that the functionalization strategy using fluorination and cross-linking of the collagen foam by using hexamethylene diisocyante (HMDI)) allowed a higher cell colonization and cell penetration into inner parts of embroidered PLA/P(LA-CL) scaffolds compared to non-functionalized controls. Moreover, it also guaranteed the maintenance of the differentiated ligamentocyte phenotype of ACL-derived fibroblasts over the entire observation time. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Silke Schwarz (PMU) for fruitful discussions and her contribution to establishing some of the methods applied, Nicole Schneider (IPF Dresden) for scaffold fabrication and Harald Br&#x000fc;nig (IPF Dresden) for melt spinning the PLA multifilament used in this study.
