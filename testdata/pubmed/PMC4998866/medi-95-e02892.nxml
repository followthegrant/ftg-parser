The detailed clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded upon admission, including risk factors of vascular disease and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores. The patients were divided into groups of different circles of Willis types based on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) that was performed within 3 days of admission&#x02014;type I: complete circle of Willis; type II: complete anterior half of the circle of Willis and incomplete posterior half of the circle of Willis; type III: incomplete anterior half of the circle of Willis and complete posterior half of the circle of Willis; and type IV: incomplete anterior and posterior halves of the circle of Willis. Patients were re-evaluated for NIHSS scores at discharge and after discharge. The modified Rankin score (mRS) was recorded for 90 days, and stroke recurrence and death after 90 days were also recorded until the end of the study.</p><p>The 376 patients were divided into 4 groups based on the MRA&#x02014;type I group: 92 patients (24.5%); type II group: 215 patients (57.2%); type III group: 12 patients (3.2%), and type IV group: 57 patients (15.2%).

Studies have shown that<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> acceptable intracranial collateral circulation effectively reduced the risk of cerebral infarction and that the rapid establishment of collateral circulation after cerebral artery occlusion may significantly reduce the extent of damage to brain function and structure. Multiple collateral circulation pathways exist for cerebral arteries, and the circle of Willis, which is the primary collateral circulation of cerebral arteries, is one of the most important intracranial collateral circulation compensatory pathway, followed by the ophthalmic artery, leptomeningeal vessels, and anastomosis among the perforating arteries of cortical arteries. Compensatory pathways, such as the ophthalmic artery and the leptomeningeal artery, will not be a factor unless a compensatory dysfunction of the circle of Willis is present.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The compensatory capacity of the circle of Willis, which is a major intracranial collateral circulation pathway, is dependent on the presence of its constituent vessels<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and the size of the vessels.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The circle of Willis is closely associated with the occurrence of acute cerebral infarction. As early as the 1960&#x0200a;s, Alpers and Berry discovered via autopsy that the rate of dysplasia of the circle of Willis was significantly higher in brains with signs of cerebral infarction (194 cases) than in normal brains (350 cases).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, Battacharji et al<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> reported that the circle of Willis was closely associated with cerebral infarction for patients with severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery or vertebral-basilar artery. Studies of the relationship between the circle of Willis and cerebral ischemia<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> tended to enroll patients with severe stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery. Henderson and Eliasziw conducted a study of cases in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and discovered that the incidence of hemispheric cerebral infarction or transient cerebral ischemic attack was significantly reduced during the perioperative or long-term follow-up period for patients with &#x0003e; 70% stenosis of the internal carotid artery if the normal constituent vessels of the circle of Willis were present.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, additional research revealed that the relationship between the circle of Willis and ischemic stroke was extended beyond cases of severe stenosis (or occlusion) of the internal carotid artery. Hoksbergen et al<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> conducted a case-control study and determined that the nonfunctional rate of the anterior communicating artery (AcoA) and posterior communicating artery (PcoA) was significantly higher in the cerebral infarction group than in the noncerebral infarction group when stenosis of the internal carotid artery was excluded as a factor and the incidence of an incomplete circle of Willis (hypoplasia or absence of the constitute vessels of the circle of Willis) was significant in patients with anterior circulation infarction. Miyazawa et al performed a logistic regression analysis and determined that the incidence of cerebral infarction was significant and that the number of lacunar infarctions significantly increased for patients with an incomplete anterior half of the circle of Willis.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>The majority of previous studies focused on patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery, and reports on the general population are relatively scarce. Studies of the features of the circle of Willis and the severity of cerebral infarction and treatment outcome were frequently incomprehensive and only focused on certain features of the circle of Willis (e.g., A1 segment hypoplasia and poor development of PCoA) or patients with a certain limited condition (e.g., patients after intravenous thrombolysis), which affected the applicability of research findings. This study was designed to analyze the relationship between different circle of Willis types and the severity of cerebral infarction and treatment outcomes in patients with initial acute noncardiac cerebral infarction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was approved by ethics committee of First Affiliated Hospital of SunYat-sen University.

The patients received a thorough physical examination of their nervous systems. At admission, all patients were rated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age 18 to 80; (2) time from onset to admission &#x02264; 7 days; (3) acute cerebral infarction diagnosed with head computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (4) initial clinical onset; and (5) ability to cooperate with various examinations after admission, such as head MRI + magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, Doppler vascular ultrasonography of the neck, chest x-ray, and laboratory tests.

A 3.0 T superconductive MRI scanner (gradient field: 45&#x0200a;mT/m) and a 16-channel array head coil were used. Routine MRI sequences included axial T1-FLAIR, T2WI, and T2-FIAIR, and sagittal or coronal T2WI. Two radiologists with extensive experience in neuroimaging and diagnosis conducted a blinded and independent evaluation of all MRI images. In the case of discrepancy, the 2 radiologists discussed the images to obtain a diagnosis. The MRI images were primarily analyzed for the presence of the constituent vessels of the circle of Willis. According to the criteria outlined in the literature,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> if the start and end points of a vessel are present on the 3D-TOF source image, then the vessel is determined to be &#x0201c;present.&#x0201d; A vessel is defined as &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; if the vessel diameter &#x02265; 0.8&#x0200a;mm or is indicative of dysplasia if the vessel diameter &#x0003c; 0.8&#x0200a;mm.</p><p>Criteria for the type of the circle of Willis are as follows: the typical circle of Willis is anatomically divided into the anterior half and the posterior half, in which the anterior half consists of ACoA, bilateral A1 segments, and bilateral terminal segments of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the posterior half consists of bilateral PCoAs, bilateral P1 segments, and the basilar artery (BA).

Compared with patients with acute cerebral infarction in the incomplete circle of Willis group, patients in the complete circle of Willis group had lower NIHSS scores at admission and discharge, less-severe neurological impairments, and better recovery of neurological function at the end of the 90-day follow-up.</p><p>Less than 50% (or significantly &#x0003c;50%) of the general population have a normal circle of Willis due to congenital abnormalities or atherosclerosis and other factors. Previous studies of the circle of Willis patterns were dependent on autopsy. An autopsy study of 1000 brain specimens showed that 45.2% of the specimens exhibited a normal circle of Willis and 54.8% of the specimens exhibited variation in the circle of Willis.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Advances in medical imaging techniques have enabled additional studies of the physiological state of the circle of Willis. Some researchers investigated the integrity of the circle of Willis in 160 healthy Chinese using head computed tomography angiography (CTA). The results showed that 79% of the subjects had a complete anterior half of the circle of Willis, 31% had a complete posterior half of the circle of Willis, 27% had a complete circle of Willis, and 9.4% had embryonic posterior cerebral artery.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Therefore, the variation in the pattern of the circle of Willis is common, and the compensatory capacity of different variations of the circle of Willis (as intracranial collateral circulation) also varies. In this study, the MRA showed that 24.5% of the patients with acute cerebral infarction had a complete circle of Willis, 81.7% had a complete anterior half of the circle of Willis, and 27.7% had a complete posterior half of the circle of Willis. Compared with foreign studies,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> lower rates for a complete circle of Willis and a complete posterior half of the circle of Willis were obtained in this study, whereas the rates for a complete anterior half of the circle of Willis were comparable to this study. Previous studies have shown that<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> the integrity of the circle of Willis is significantly associated with the incidence of cerebral infarction and that an incomplete circle of Willis is associated with a higher incidence of cerebral infarction. This difference in the integrity of the circle of Willis between studies in China and other countries may explain why the incidence of cerebral infarction in China is significantly higher than the global average of the incidence of cerebral infarction.</p><p>The severity of cerebral infarction is significantly correlated with the collateral circulation of cerebral arteries.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Good collateral circulation enables the timely reperfusion of blood flow to the ischemic penumbra, which reduces the volume of cerebral infarction, minimizes neurological impairments, and improves prognosis. A complete circle of Willis was an independent predictor of good recovery. According to the past studies, the protective effect of a complete circle of Willis on acute cerebral infarction may be attributed to several factors. First, a complete circle of Willis has better collateral circulation and higher compensatory capacity in the case of cerebral ischemia, enabling a greater chance of collateral reperfusion to the ischemic penumbra and minimizing neurological impairments. Second, a complete circle of Willis indicates that more blood flow is available to form collateral pathways via the circle of Willis, creating the conditions for reperfusion to the cerebral ischemic lesions<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and helps to improve the hemodynamics of artery anastomoses in the pia mater, improving the compensatory capacity of collateral anastomoses in the pia mater to the infarct vessels. Third, a complete circle of Willis reduces cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and counteracts the hemodynamic changes of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, reducing brain damage.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>This study showed that patients in the complete circle of Willis group had better neurological recovery, which was consistent with the study results of Chuang et al.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> However, Chuang et al investigated patients with acute noncardiac cerebral infarction who received intravenous thrombolysis. The enrolled subjects had to satisfy specific inclusion criteria. In this study, the inclusion criterion was patients with initial acute noncardiac cerebral infarction, producing a more inclusive study. Chuang et al showed that the mean NIHSS score at admission was lower in the complete circle of Willis group than in the incomplete circle of Willis group, but the difference was not statistically significant, which was inconsistent with this study. This finding is most likely attributed to the following factors: (1) the onset time&#x02014;Chuang et al<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> evaluated patients within 3 hours of onset, whereas this study evaluated patients within 7 days of onset. Some time is required for acceptable collateral circulation to serve a protective role on cerebral ischemia, and (2) intravenous thrombolysis&#x02014;Chuang et al<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> evaluated patients who received intravenous thrombolysis, which may alter the integrity of the circle of Willis. Compared with the study conducted by Chuang et al, this study was more inclusive and representative with broader clinical significance.</p><p>This study showed that circle of Willis type is associated with stroke severity and prognosis; patients with an incomplete circle of Willis have more severe conditions and a higher 90-day poor prognosis rate than patients with a complete circle of Willis. A complete circle of Willis is an independent predictor of good prognosis. However, this study has some drawbacks. First, although 3D-TOF MRA combined with raw images is highly sensitive and accurate for analyzing the circle of Willis and is easy to operate, MRA is insensitive for detecting tiny blood vessels with slow blood flow<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and has certain limitations. Some constituent vessels of the circle of Willis, especially communicating arteries, did not show on the MRA due to slow blood flow. As a result, this study may have slightly underestimated the percentage of patients with a complete circle of Willis. Second, a significant difference in age was observed among the groups in this study. Previous studies<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> showed that younger age was associated with a higher rate of a complete circle of Willis. The younger the age, the greater are the diameters of the constituent vessels of the circle of Willis. Age is one of the most important factors that affects the severity of neurological impairments, neurological recovery and clinical prognosis.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Therefore, the difference in age among the groups in this study inevitably affected the assessment of the severity of a patient's condition and the clinical prognosis. Third, for 2-year follow-up, the lost rate was as high as 50%. This may have some influence on our results about the correlation between completeness of circle of Willis and stroke recurrence. But in our study, all of the patients finished the 90-day follow-up and the main findings that patients with complete circle of Willis would be with good recovery still make sense.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: 3D-TOF = 3-dimensional time-of-flight, AcoA = anterior communicating artery, BA = basilar artery, CHOL = cholesterol, CI = confidential interval, Cr = serum creatinine, CT = computed tomography, CTA = computed tomography angiography, ECG = electrocardiography, Glu = fasting blood glucose, HbAlc = glycosylated hemoglobin, HDL-c = high-density lipoprotein, ICA = internal carotid artery, LDL-c = low-density lipoprotein, MRA = magnetic resonance angiography, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, mRS = modified Rankin score, NASCET = North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, NIHSS = National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, OR = odds ratio, PcoA = posterior communicating artery, TG = triglyceride, UA = uric acid</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>HZ and JS contributed equally to this study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Financial support: Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (No. S2013010015840) and Guangdong province science and technology plan (2015A030302013).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Christoforidis</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohammad</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Kehagias</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
