Reported functions of Npl3 include transcription elongation, splicing and RNA 3&#x02019; end processing. We used UV crosslinking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC) to map precise RNA binding sites, and strand-specific tiling arrays to look at the effects of loss of Npl3 on all transcripts across the genome. We found that Npl3 binds diverse RNA species, both coding and non-coding, at sites indicative of roles in both early pre-mRNA processing and 3&#x02019; end formation. Tiling arrays and RNAPII mapping data revealed 3&#x02019; extended RNAPII-transcribed RNAs in the absence of Npl3, suggesting that defects in pre-mRNA packaging events result in termination readthrough. Transcription readthrough was widespread and frequently resulted in down-regulation of neighboring genes. We conclude that the absence of Npl3 results in widespread 3' extension of transcripts with pervasive effects on gene expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Npl3 is a yeast mRNA binding protein with many reported functions in RNA processing. We wanted to identify direct targets and therefore combined analyses of the transcriptome-wide effects of the loss of Npl3 on gene expression with UV crosslinking and bioinformatics to identify RNA-binding sites for Npl3. We found that Npl3 binds diverse sites on large numbers of transcripts, and that the loss of Npl3 results in transcriptional readthrough on many genes. One effect of this transcription readthrough is that the expression of numerous flanking genes is strongly down regulated. This underlines the importance of faithful termination for the correct regulation of gene expression. The effects of the loss of Npl3 are seen on both mRNAs and non-protein coding RNAs. These have distinct but overlapping termination mechanisms, with both classes requiring Npl3 for correct RNA packaging.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Wellcome Trust Fellowships to RKH [085511], ACT [103977] and DT [077248] and a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (to LMS).

This structure shows similarities to the SR (Ser-Arg rich) class of metazoan pre-mRNA binding proteins [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Genetic and biochemical analyses have implicated Npl3 in many processes, including pre-mRNA splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA export and cytoplasmic translation [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], as well as R-loop prevention and chromatin modification [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Transcription termination of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occurs by polyadenylation-dependent and polyadenylation-independent pathways, correlated with whether the transcript is coding or non-coding (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). Termination of mRNAs, requires two complexes termed cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) and cleavage factor (CF). Together, the CPF and CF complexes facilitate cleavage of the nascent RNA strand and removal of the elongating polymerase, resulting in a polyadenylated RNA product. Two mechanisms have been reported for these processes, which are likely to occur in combination. In the &#x02018;torpedo&#x02019; pathway, the nascent RNA molecule is cleaved at the polyA site and the released 3&#x02019; fragment of the transcript still bound by RNAPII is degraded by the 5&#x02019;-3&#x02019; exonuclease Rat1. This is proposed to then destabilize the polymerase complex. A second &#x0201c;allosteric&#x0201d; mechanism leads to the elongating polymerase being disengaged from the nascent transcript downstream of the polyA site due to, poorly understood, conformational changes concomitant with assembly of the CPF-CF complex. Notably, analyses on reporter constructs indicated that Npl3 can act as an anti-terminator, by antagonizing cleavage factor 1 (CF1) binding and thus restricting the use of cryptic poly(A) sites [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In addition to mRNAs, RNAPII also transcribes several classes of non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and the majority of these terminate by polyadenylation-independent pathways. These ncRNAs include the small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), 73 of which function in yeast ribosome synthesis, four small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) that form the core of the pre-mRNA spliceosome, as well as diverse long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) such as the <underline>c</underline>ryptic <underline>u</underline>nstable <underline>t</underline>rancripts (CUTs). The snoRNAs are processed from pre-snoRNAs that can be independently transcribed, cleaved from polycistronic transcripts, or excised from pre-mRNA introns. Independently transcribed snoRNAs, snRNAs and CUTs are all thought to predominately terminate via a pathway that requires RNA-binding by Nrd1-Nab3 complex and the Sen1 helicase (together termed the NNS complex) [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Termination of snoRNAs and CUTs by the NNS complex is associated with recruitment of the TRAMP and exosome complexes to the nascent RNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The TRAMP complex tags RNAs by the addition of a short 3' oligo(A) tail, and directs target RNAs to the nuclear exosome for degradation [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This can result in either complete degradation of the RNA, in the case of CUTs, or the processing of long precursor snoRNAs to the shorter, mature form [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, some snoRNAs can also be terminated by mRNA 3&#x02019; cleavage factors, with [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or without [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] subsequent polyadenylation. In addition, surveillance factors can influence termination, since loss of exosome activity leads to defects in NNS termination [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, gene-length correlates with the termination pathway used, probably via changes in the phosphorylation state of RNAPII [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and/or histone H3, lysine 4 trimethylation [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], both of which can promote NSS termination. Prior data indicate that a proportion of RNAPII transcription events terminate early on protein-coding genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These promoter proximal ncRNAs or &#x0201c;sCUTs&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] are oligoadenylated, presumably by the TRAMP complex [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and targeted for turnover by the nuclear surveillance machinery.</p><p>To better understand the in vivo functions of Npl3, we determined its RNA binding profile, and identified changes in RNA abundance and RNAPII association when the <italic>NPL3</italic> gene is deleted. The absence of Npl3 resulted in transcriptional termination defects at diverse RNAs, with readthrough observed on large subsets of both mRNAs and ncRNAs.

<bold>A:</bold> Comparison of Npl3 binding across different RNA classes in two replicate CRAC experiments. Hits were assigned to RNA classes according to gene annotations from Ensembl (EF4.74) supplemented with additional features including ncRNAs, UTRs and antisense transcripts, as previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Antisense, intergenic and ncRNA RNA classes are defined as follows. Antisense: a hit will be assigned as 'antisense' if it maps to regions of published antisense transcription [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] or to the opposite strand of a known feature. Intergenic: these are hits that map to any region of the genome where no other feature has been annotated. NcRNA: this category comprises 15 ncRNAs that don't fall into other categories, including scR1, SRG1 and TLC1. <bold>B:</bold> Distribution of Npl3 binding over mRNAs. Average distribution of Npl3 around the 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; ends of mRNAs. Transcripts are aligned at the transcription start sites (TSS) and polyA (pA) site.

On mRNAs, Npl3 binding was highest in the 5&#x02019; end region (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), consistent with other recent RNA-crosslinking data [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A previous ChIP analysis, in which Npl3 is crosslinked to chromatin, found Npl3 enriched at 3' ends [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This apparent discrepancy may reflect differences in Npl3 binding at the 5' and 3' ends of genes, with direct RNA binding occurring predominantly at the 5' end, and stronger association with the transcription and processing complexes at the 3' end. Similar 5&#x02019; enrichment was reported for nuclear surveillance factors including Nrd1, Nab3 and Mtr4 as well as for RNAPII, and has been proposed to reflect a substantial level of premature transcription termination [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As described above, these promoter proximal lncRNAs are oligoadenylated by the TRAMP complex, and we therefore mapped the association of Npl3 with RNAs carrying non-encoded oligo(A) tails [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Among RNA fragments recovered in association with Npl3, 24&#x02013;28% carried oligo(A) tails, depending on the individual CRAC experiment, indicating that Npl3 frequently binds across the junction between truncated mRNAs and oligoA tails. Note that the total fraction of Npl3 target RNAs that are oligoadenylated is likely to be higher, as only a small region of each transcript is sequenced. In contrast, only 4&#x02013;4.7% of RNAs bound by RNAPII were oligoadenylated (see below). <xref rid="pgen.1005735.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> shows the distribution of Npl3 bound hits containing oligo(A) tails across different RNA classes for two independent CRAC experiments. The distribution of oligo(A) tails in Npl3 target sequences was similar to the overall distribution of hits on mRNAs (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). This indicated that Npl3 is frequently bound to degradation substrates or intermediates, including prematurely terminated mRNAs, and suggests that it may function with surveillance factors to mediate early transcription termination and/or RNA degradation.</p><p>Npl3 is known to be required for efficient splicing of ribosomal protein gene (RPG) pre-mRNAs [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Consistent with this, we found that Npl3 strongly accumulated on introns of these pre-mRNAs relative to other intron-containing pre-mRNAs (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>). On non-RPG, intron-containing pre-mRNAs, the binding of Npl3 dropped sharply at the 5&#x02019; end of the intron. The lower recovery of introns relative to mature message indicates that Npl3 remains bound to mRNAs after splicing (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>).</p><p>The distribution of Npl3 over the CUT class of lncRNAs was similar to that observed for mRNAs with strong enrichment towards the 5' end (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>), consistent with the proposal that initial cotranscriptional packaging of pre-mRNAs and lncRNAs is similar [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In marked contrast, Npl3 binding was enriched towards the 3' end of snoRNAs (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>), suggesting a role in transcription termination and/or 3' end processing of these ncRNAs. Overall, our RNA binding site data suggest that Npl3 is involved in surveillance and/or transcription termination of both mRNAs and ncRNAs.</p><p>Motif analysis did not identify a specific Npl3 binding site. We note, however, that the four most overrepresented 4-nucleotide motifs each contain a U-G sequence (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E Fig</xref>). Npl3, and particularly RRM2, was reported to show strong <italic>in vitro</italic> binding to U+G rich sequences including U-G dinucleotides [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>The absence of Npl3 results in expression changes for both coding and noncoding RNAs</title><p>To identify functional targets of Npl3, we assessed the transcriptome-wide effects of the loss of the protein on steady-state RNA levels, using strand-specific tiling arrays. Npl3 was reported to be highly abundant (78,700 copies per cell) [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and has many different targets, which might show differential binding to residual Npl3 following depletion or relocation.

As expected, the most down-regulated gene was <italic>NPL3</italic>, which is absent from the genome and was discounted from the analysis. We found that 15/30 (50%) of down-regulated genes reside in a convergent orientation with an expressed protein coding gene. A previous analysis found that only 6% of all yeast genes reside in convergent orientations in which both genes are expressed [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The proportion of convergent mRNAs with reduced expression in <italic>npl3</italic>&#x00394; strains was therefore unexpectedly high. At 11 of the 15 convergent mRNA loci (73%), the down-regulated gene is adjacent to a gene that showed clear transcription readthrough, suggesting that their expression is blocked by transcriptional interference. An additional nine down-regulated mRNAs are convergent with an ncRNA that showed transcription readthrough. A further four down-regulated mRNAs are located in tandem with an upstream gene that shows readthrough, while seven mRNAs are apparently down-regulated by both tandem and convergent readthrough. Three of the 30 most down-regulated genes do not appear to be inhibited by convergent or tandem readthrough, or by intergenic transcription.

To discriminate between increased readthrough and RNA stabilization, we assessed changes in RNAPII occupancy following loss of Npl3. To do this, we used CRAC to crosslink RNAPII to the nascent transcript, which provides genome-wide, strand-specific, nucleotide resolution mapping data <italic>in vivo</italic> in growing cells. The CRAC technique was applied using strains in which the largest subunit of RNAPII, Rpo21, carried a C-terminal, His6-TEV-Protein A (HTP) tag, as recently described (Milligan et al., submitted).

Some snoRNAs appear to be extended many kilobases, apparently utilizing the termination site of the next downstream protein gene. To confirm that snoRNA 3&#x02019; extensions result from transcriptional readthrough, we calculated &#x0201c;readthrough scores&#x0201d; for three snoRNAs (<italic>SNR11</italic>, <italic>SNR30</italic> and <italic>SNR60</italic>) that appeared to be extended based on tiling array data, as well as <italic>SNR17B</italic> that did not appear to be extended. We calculated the sum of all RNAPII hits in the 500 nt 3&#x02019; flanking region, relative to the sum of all hits within the snoRNA sequence, and compared this ratio for the WT and <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic> strains. For the extended snoRNAs, Rpo21 hits in the 3&#x02019; flanking region hits were elevated 1.16 to 2.17 fold in <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic>, but reduced to 0.84 fold of the WT for <italic>SNR17B</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). Overall, the magnitude of RNAPII occupancy changes downstream of snoRNAs in <italic>npl3</italic>&#x00394; relative to WT is much less than changes in expression. We suggest that the extended snoRNA transcripts predominately reflect defects in RNA surveillance rather than processing/maturation, as we found the abundance of mature snoRNAs to be comparable in the <italic>npl3</italic>&#x00394; mutant and WT strains (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4D Fig</xref>).</p><p>Many snoRNAs harbor a cleavage site for the endonuclease Rnt1 (RNase III) positioned downstream of the mature 3&#x02019; end (reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]). Cotranscriptional cleavage by Rnt1 provides an entry site for 3&#x02019;-exonuclease processing back to the mature 3&#x02019; end of the snoRNA, and also allows the 5&#x02019; exonuclease Rat1 to degrade the nascent transcript and terminate the transcribing polymerase [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

Furthermore, as for snoRNAs, Rnt1 cleavage sites flank the U1, U2, U4 and U5 genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].

Nab3, like Npl3, binds strongly at the 5' ends of mRNA transcripts (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5C Fig</xref>) and showed a substantial frequency of non-templated oligo(A) tails (36% in two experiments) consistent with active surveillance in this region.</p><p>Inspection of the <italic>VHR2-THO1</italic> convergent gene locus (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1005735.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1005735.g006" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>) revealed strong peaks of Nab3 binding at the 5&#x02019; ends of <italic>VHR2</italic> and <italic>THO1</italic>, reflecting the role of NNS in early termination on protein coding genes. In the <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic> strain the peak at the 5&#x02019; end of <italic>VHR2</italic> was unaltered, whereas the peak on <italic>THO1</italic> was lost due to transcription interference. A peak of Nab3 towards the 3&#x02019; end of <italic>CUT557</italic> presumably reflects the known role of NNS in CUT termination. Notably, this peak was increased when Npl3 is absent, corresponding with the increased <italic>CUT557</italic> expression. We conclude that the <italic>VHR2-CUT557</italic> readthrough transcripts are likely to be terminated by the NNS pathway rather than by the CPF-CF pathway. Nab3 binding across CUTs was strongly increased in <italic>npl3</italic>&#x00394;, particularly around the 3' ends of these transcripts and at downstream sites (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). The increased binding of CUTs by Nab3 in <italic>npl3</italic>&#x00394; was greater than the increased RNAPII association we observe in the mutant strain (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>) suggesting that it reflects not only increased expression of these ncRNAs, but additional non-productive recruitment of this surveillance factor to normal degradation substrates.

We ranked all 2234 genes by readthrough ratio (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>) and compared polymerase occupancy around the 3' ends of genes with the highest readthrough rank (top 200) and the control group with a low readthrough rank (1200 genes).

We found that readthrough correlated weakly with gene length. Longer genes were more likely to show readthrough (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig</xref>), consistent with a report showing preferential binding of Npl3 to longer genes [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To identify potential motifs, we compared the 3&#x02019; regions from all genes in the top and bottom groups based on the readthrough ranking. This identified UAUAUA and UAAAUA motif as strongly over-represented in low readthrough genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). UAUAUA is the binding site for the pre-mRNA 3&#x02019;-end processing factor Hrp1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and comparison of the locations of the UAUAUA motifs showed enrichment at the expected location upstream of the pA site in low readthrough genes (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>). The enrichment of Hrp1 binding sites in genes that do not show readthrough in the absence of Npl3 strongly suggests that direct, efficient recruitment of Hrp1 can bypass the requirement for Npl3 in termination.</p><p>Gene ontology analysis showed that genes with higher readthrough were enriched for plasma membrane proteins and functions in localization and/or transmembrane transport (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>).

Deletion of <italic>NPL3</italic> revealed its involvement in termination on diverse transcripts that had not appeared to share termination systems. These included many mRNAs and ncRNAs including the CUT class of lncRNAs and most snoRNAs. In contrast, no defects were seen for snRNAs, which have 3&#x02019; processing and termination pathways that appeared to closely resemble snoRNAs.</p><p>Significant transcription termination defects were seen on approximately 30% of protein coding genes in <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic> strains. Readthrough was associated with widespread gene expression changes due to transcriptional interference at downstream genes. This likely reflects the disruption of nucleosome positioning and/or transcription factor binding caused by passage of RNAPII through the nucleosome free regions characteristic of yeast promoters. The precise number of genes that are inhibited by this mechanism is difficult to determine accurately. In the cases of the convergent genes highlighted in the text, the phenotype is clear because the transcripts lie on opposite strands. However, actively transcribed, convergent genes are quite rare in yeast, and transcriptional interference on tandem genes may be less evident. Downstream gene expression may appear unaffected on microarrays, despite generating little functional mRNA, with downstream signal representing extended upstream gene products. From the RNAPII CRAC data it appears that sense-orientated genes some distance from a site of readthrough can display the hallmarks of decreased expression. This was shown, for example, by the decreased RNAPII peak at the 5&#x02019; end of the <italic>HOR2</italic> gene, located downstream of the extended <italic>VHR2</italic> transcript (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p>The widespread interference seen in the absence of Npl3 highlights the necessity for very efficient release of RNAPII at the 3&#x02019; ends of genes. In general, fold changes in RNAPII occupancy were less marked than changes in downstream transcript levels. This indicates that readthrough by a small number of polymerases can drastically alter the regulation of gene-expression. In the case of snoRNAs, it appears that low levels of transcription readthrough, as determined by accumulation of downstream RNAPII, result in high levels of extended transcripts. Normal snoRNA termination and processing require the NSS complex, which stimulates exosome recruitment [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and Nab3 association with snoRNAs was reduced in <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic> strains. These observations strongly indicate that loss of Npl3 also leads to defects in snoRNA 3&#x02019; processing and/or surveillance of 3&#x02019; extended species. The relative contributions of impaired snoRNA processing versus impaired surveillance in <italic>npl3&#x00394;</italic> mutants is difficult to assess&#x02014;as is the case for many substrates for nuclear surveillance/processing factors. Distinguishing the contributions of processing and surveillance is not generally feasible when the phenotype is accumulation of extended species at steady state, and will require the development of very fast, <italic>in vivo</italic> kinetic analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Potential roles for Npl3 in termination</title><p>Termination defects seen in the absence of Npl3 were restricted to RNAPII. However, while diverse classes of RNAPII transcripts are affected, this was not the case for all transcripts of any class. To try to understand what determines this apparent variability in the requirement for Npl3, we ranked protein-coding genes by their degree of readthrough (readthrough ratio) in the absence of Npl3, and sought correlated features in protein coding genes.</p><p>A notable correlation was with the elevated presence of consensus, UAUAUA binding sites for the mRNA 3&#x02019; cleavage factor Hrp1 in the 3&#x02019; regions of transcripts with low readthrough scores (i.e. with low dependence on Npl3 for termination). We postulate that association of Hrp1 and/or other cleavage factors with the pre-mRNA is normally promoted by Npl3-mediated packaging, but this requirement can be alleviated by the presence of high-affinity RNA-binding sites. In contrast, competition between binding of Npl3 and pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factors including Hrp1 was previously reported for <italic>GAL</italic> reporter constructs [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This apparent anti-termination activity of Npl3 is the opposite of our general findings. However, it could readily be envisaged that on individual genes, Npl3 binding sites conflict with the association of specific factors. The <italic>GAL</italic> genes are not expressed under the conditions used in our analyses, making it difficult to determine whether these effects are also seen on the endogenous genes.</p><p>Readthrough ratio was weakly correlated with gene length, with longer genes more likely to exhibit termination defects when Npl3 was absent. Preferential association of Npl3 with longer transcripts as been reported [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], suggesting that these may show greater changes in pre-mRNA packaging in its absence. However, we saw no clear length dependence for Npl3 in termination on ncRNAs, which are generally shorter than mRNAs.</p><p>Several distinct, but overlapping pathways for RNAPII termination are normally used by transcripts that are extended in the absence of Npl3. On pre-mRNAs, recognition of the cleavage and polyadenylation site is linked to changes in the transcribing polymerase that make it prone to termination at downstream pause sites. This may involve Tyr1 dephosphorylation in the CTD by the Glc7 phosphatase that associates with the CPF-CF [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Loss of Tyr1P promotes binding of the cleavage factor Pcf11, as well as Rtt103, which in turn recruits the Rai1/Rat1 complex for the &#x0201c;torpedo&#x0201d; termination pathway. In contrast, termination of a wide range of ncRNA transcripts involves the Nrd1/Nab3/Sen1 (NNS) complex, which binds to the nascent transcript and to the RNAPII CTD with Ser5P modification, as well as the TRAMP nuclear surveillance complex and promoter proximal nucleosomes with H3K4 trimethylation ([<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] reviewed in [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]). Other termination mechanisms are initiated by co-transcriptional cleavage by the RNase III homologue Rnt1 [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and by formation of a transcription elongation &#x0201c;roadblock&#x0201d; due to Reb1 binding on the DNA [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>We found no correlation between known Rnt1 or Reb1 targets and transcription readthrough in <italic>npl3</italic>&#x00394; strains. Binding of Nab3 to the CUT lncRNAs was increased in <italic>npl3</italic>&#x00394; strains. A simple, potential explanation might be that the absence of the, normally very abundant, Npl3 protein frees binding sites that can be occupied by other factors, including Nrd1-Nab3. However, the abundance and readthrough of CUTs were also increased in the absence of Npl3, and this may contribute to the apparent changes in Nab3 association. We propose that loss of Npl3 results in aberrant RNP formation that still permits Nab3 recruitment, but binding may be non-productive.</p><p>Npl3 was reported to directly stimulate RNAPII elongation and a mutant that disrupts this function, <italic>npl3-120</italic>, resulted in improved termination. The slower RNAPII elongation rate in <italic>npl3-120</italic> strains may enhance termination by increasing the time available for recruitment of 3' end processing factors such as Hrp1. In contrast, an Npl3 mutant (S411A) that blocks a phosphorylation site was associated with impaired transcription termination [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This defect was proposed to arise from retention of the mutant Npl3 in association with the RNAPII CTD and the mRNA. However, the list of genes showing 3&#x02019; extension in Npl3S<sub>411</sub>A strains overlaps substantially with the genes showing RT in <italic>npl3</italic>&#x00394;, indicating that Npl3 retention is not solely responsible for this phenotype. Of the 818 genes showing 3&#x02019; extension in Npl3S<sub>411</sub>A, 143 overlap with the 614 genes showing significant readthrough in <italic>npl3</italic>&#x00394; (p-value 7.1e-16, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test).</p><p>Npl3 is a highly abundant RNA binding protein that participates in many processing events and associates with all nascent RNAPII transcripts. It seems probable that its absence will result in substantial changes in the nascent RNP structure. We speculate that such inappropriately packaged RNA is associated with downstream defects in transcription termination, reflected by changes in binding by the termination factor Nab3, consequently impairing a remodeling event that promotes removal of the polymerase from the nascent transcript.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec016"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec017"><title>Strains and media</title><p>Yeast were grown in standard SD medium at 30&#x000b0;C unless otherwise stated.

Firstly, to examine the distribution of proteins at the 5' and 3' ends of mRNAs, hits within 300&#x02013;900 nt windows aligned to the start (TSS) and end (pA) were plotted using published scripts [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Readthrough ratios were also calculated for wild-type replicate 2 versus wild-type replicate 1, to provide an empirical null distribution and enable transcripts with a significant increase in readthrough for npl3-delta versus wild-type to be identified. The Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg procedure was used to control the false discovery rate at 0.05. For this step, the two replicate experiments were treated separately, then a stringent list of genes with elevated readthrough obtained by intersecting the results from both replicates.</p><p>A series of filters was used to exclude transcripts for which readthrough ratios may be inaccurate, either due to low expression or because of evidence of independent transcription initiation downstream. The following criteria were used: (i) there must be &#x0003c; 10 Cbc1 (cap-binding complex protein 1) CRAC reads in the DN100 window, (ii) TRAN median probe intensity must be &#x0003e; -4.88 for wild-type and npl3-delta, (iii) for npl3-delta, the median probe intensity in the DN100 window must be &#x0003e; 70% that of the TRAN window, and (iv) the median probe intensity in the TRAN window for npl3-delta must be at least 70% that of the same window in the wild-type sample. For filters (ii)-(iv), the mean of the two replicates was used.</p><p>Plots of Pol II distribution in regions centered on transcript 3&#x02019; ends were obtained by taking the individual Pol II CRAC read distributions for each gene, linearly transforming each gene so that its maximum value was equal to 1, and then summing at each nucleotide for the indicated set of genes (either high or low readthrough groups). We observed that genes with the very lowest readthrough ranks had a spurious negative readthrough ratio due to having increased expression in the <italic>npl3</italic>&#x00394; strain relative to WT. To limit the contribution of these genes, we took a larger number of genes for the low readthrough group (1200 compared to 200).</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Motif analyses</title><p>Npl3 binding sites were analyzed for enriched motifs by first filtering total reads to exclude low complexity sequences, as previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The pyCRAC package [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was used to calculate statistical overrepresentation scores for every possible k-mer (<xref rid="pgen.1005735.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>) using a previously described algorithm [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. We used pyCRAC to calculate False Discovery rates (FDRs) and selected only reads forming clusters of 5 reads or more with an FDR &#x0003c; 0.05 for further analysis. Reads were further filtered to include only those with one or more T-C substitution, representing a site of crosslinking, and therefore predicted to indicate genuine binding sites with greater stringency.</p><p>To identify sequence motifs that differentiate high- and low-readthrough genes, we considered the 1822 genes for which reliable readthrough scores could be established, and separated these genes into quartiles by their readthrough scores. 2234 genes were included in the genome-wide readthrough analysis, but the bottom 250 were excluded from the motif analyses as these were found to have spuriously low readthrough ratios resulting from increased expression in the <italic>npl3</italic>&#x00394; mutant. Of the remaining 1984 genes, only those with well-defined polyA sites (1822) were included in the motif analysis. For each 6-mer nucleotide motif, we calculated the numbers of genes in each quartile that contained the motif within the region (-80 to -20 nucleotides) from the polyadenylation site (polyA site). The polyA site was defined from Pab1 CRAC data as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We then identified the motifs that were significantly enriched in the low-readthrough genes, relative to high-readthrough genes, by calculating Z-scores as described [<xref rid="pgen.1005735.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. To illustrate the localization of motifs relative the polyA site, we plotted the total coverage of UAUAUA motifs as a function of distance from the polyA site, separately for the top and bottom quartile of genes ranked by readthrough scores.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec031"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1005735.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Npl3 RNA binding profile.</title><p>
