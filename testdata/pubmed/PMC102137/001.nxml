Why a new medical journal? Why especially this new journal? What
are its ambitions? What audience can it reach? Specialists,
generalists or both simultaneously? It is intended to be a link
between the international scientific community, in particular
within the fields of life science and its technological
application.
</p><p>
There is undoubtedly a niche to be occupied, an important role to
be played to better link this community. I am delighted by the
initiative taken by the promoters of this journal, who had the
courage to enter the competitive field of scientific journals and
to launch an exciting intellectual adventure.
</p><p>
For my part, I would like to briefly broach some medical questions
that are dear to me, and that are sufficiently general to be the
subject of an editorial.
</p><p>
Where indeed is medical practice going and what does the medicine
of tomorrow hold for us? We have watched, amazed, the fantastic
advances that are progressively entering current medical practice.
The revolution we have witnessed has names, in particular:
vaccination, developed by Pasteur, which still has new fields to
conquer (until now there is no vaccine against malaria or against
AIDS!). There is also antibiotic therapy, exploited to full
advantage but beginning to run out of steam, showing its limitations
because of the rapid rise of resistant microorganisms. It is only
a few decades since developments in immunology have allowed the
transplantation of organs or bone marrow. Transplantation&#x02014;an old
dream of humanity finally realized&#x02014;whose successes themselves
have led to many disappointments among the very many patients on
the waiting lists, because of the shortage of the organs to be
transplanted. It is nevertheless admirable that, in the whole
world, 6 million individuals are ready to give their marrow to
save patients, in particular those with leukemia. To this list of
successes we should add the many victories in oncology due to
improved monitoring of tumorigenic agents? And finally, we must
not forget the methods of biological investigation and medical
imaging, which have seen great improvements recently.
</p><p>
This panorama would be quite incomplete if I did not add the
spectacular rise of medical genetics, which makes it possible to
locate and to clone the genes responsible for many monogenic
diseases and, in the near future, the genes that act in concert to
produce the many polygenic diseases that afflict our
industrialized societies.
</p><p>
Provided with this arsenal, the doctor, who is a specialist or
general practitioner, can from now on offer to his patients
increasingly effective therapies, often leading to the cure or
amelioration of chronic diseases. Longevity continues to increase
each year in the industrialized countries. It should be the same everywhere.
</p><p>
I initiated, many years ago, the concept of predictive medicine,
based on frequent associations between some diseases and the
alleles of genes of the HLA system. For example ankylosing
spondylitis, associated with HLA-B27, or insulin dependent
diabetes, associated with HLA-DR3/DR4. This concept has now been
extended to the entire human genome and the number of genes of
susceptibility to (or protection from) many diseases can only
increase. Apart from the HLA system, we know of susceptibility to
familial breast cancer, given by genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2.
This idea can only grow in importance, but there is a danger.
There can be no question of detection of susceptibility genes
without simultaneous development of a preventive or therapeutic
counterpart. We should not, under any circumstances, warn a
healthy person of an uncertain future, because in this case&#x02014;and I
emphasize this point&#x02014;we are dealing with a risk of uncertain
proportions, without a corresponding method of prevention or cure.
It would be unforgivable to cause useless anxiety.
</p><p>
Whatever reservations we might have, the future direction is now
clear. There are more and more specialties where tests of
increased susceptibility to disease exist. These must be used for
the benefit of the patient and not to his detriment.
</p><p>
The physician of the 21st century, if he or she
applies these new concepts with prudence, could become the adviser
of healthy patients, who are no longer ill. Each person will be
able to manage his health capital, as he manages his banking
capital; with full knowledge, guided by his doctor, of the
developments of modern genetics.
</p><p>
Is it not interesting to note that medicine was, in its history,
first of all curative, then preventive and finally predictive,
whereas today the order is reversed: initially predictive, then
preventive and finally, only in desperation, curative?
