There was no history of fever, anorexia, cough, or chest pain. He had visited another hospital, where he was found to be hypoxemic; a chest X-ray showed consolidation in his upper lungs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Echocardiography revealed marked right ventricular dilation and flattening of the interventricular septum with severe pulmonary hypertension (transtricuspid pressure gradient, 109&#x000a0;mm Hg). He was referred to our hospital within a few hours of presentation. Five years previously, he was diagnosed as having gastric cancer (pT2N2M0 stage IIIA), for which he underwent distal gastrectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur plus uracil. On follow-up, after completion of 2&#x000a0;years of chemotherapy, no recurrence was observed. His family history was unremarkable. He was a former tobacco smoker with 20 pack-years of smoking history; there was no history of alcohol intake.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Chest X-ray.

A physical examination was unremarkable with the exception of purpura on his upper extremities and trunk. Blood tests showed normocytic anemia with leukoerythroblastosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. His serum alkaline phosphatase level was remarkably elevated (3205 U/L), but serum transaminase level was normal. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with emphysema in his upper lungs, moderate pleural effusions, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and enlargement of the right ventricle and main pulmonary artery (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.

Plans for chemotherapy were deferred because of his poor performance status, and he was eventually transited to palliative care. Favorable conditions continued for several weeks. On day 41 of hospitalization, he developed fever with rigors, and empirical antibiotic treatment (cefepime and vancomycin) was initiated. He soon turned afebrile; however, on day 45 of hospitalization, he suddenly died of respiratory failure. Necropsy of the lung confirmed the diagnosis of PTTM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>); there was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par17">Our patient was a 62-year-old&#x000a0;Japanese man with a 4-week history of dyspnea on exertion. Key findings included hypoxemia, severe pulmonary hypertension, and negative pulmonary angiogram. Recurrence of gastric cancer was confirmed from the results of a bone marrow biopsy; PTTM was considered. He was treated with conservative management, following partial alleviation of respiratory failure, and died 6&#x000a0;weeks after admission. Most patients with PTTM die within a week of dyspnea onset; however, our patient survived for 10&#x000a0;weeks from the day of presentation.</p><p id="Par18">PTTM, a special type of tumor thromboembolism, is found in 3.3% of postmortem cases of carcinoma; of all PTTM cases, 52% are attributable to gastric cancer (especially mucinous or signet ring adenocarcinoma) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Clinical manifestations include progressive dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and pulmonary hypertension. Chest radiography is typically normal; reported chest CT findings include beading of peripheral subsegmental arteries, interlobular septal thickening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and tree-in-bud pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Almost all patients with PTTM die within 1&#x000a0;week of the onset of dyspnea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and establishing an antemortem diagnosis is a challenge. The rapid progression usually prevents treatment targeting the primary tumor. The prognosis in this case was better than that in the previous reports. In PTTM, tumor emboli in pulmonary vessels may not only damage the endothelium but also activate the coagulation systems and release inflammatory mediators and growth factors, including tissue factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and osteopontin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which induce fibrocellular intimal proliferation. PDGF induces macrophage recruitment and VEGF upregulation in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which leads to inflammation through angiogenesis and enhanced vascular permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Osteopontin not only regulates macrophage recruitment but also modulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Several reports have demonstrated that the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, released by activated macrophages, play an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, inflammatory stimuli including that from IL-1&#x003b2; have been shown to exacerbate hypoxic vasoconstriction in a mouse model of PAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In PTTM, corticosteroid therapy may help control local inflammation in the pulmonary microvasculature and improve hemodynamics by alleviation of pulmonary vasoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our experience with this case suggests that the control of local inflammation with corticosteroid therapy may have helped improve the prognosis, although the time from the onset of pulmonary symptoms to death ranged from 1&#x000a0;day to 12&#x000a0;weeks in one series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par19">PTTM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with cancer who present with severe pulmonary hypertension.
