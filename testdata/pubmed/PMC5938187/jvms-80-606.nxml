for preparing cadavers in anatomical study. Paradoxically, health risk among students,
instructors, and all involving parties via skin contact and inhalation becomes the major
disadvantages of Fd. The immediate symptoms include irritation of the throat, nose, eyes, and
skin [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The United
States Environmental Protection Agency [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and
International Agency for Research on Cancer [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]
classified Fd as a human carcinogen, such as nasopharyngeal cancer, ocular melanoma, lung
cancer, brain cancer, and leukemia [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Accordingly, the Occupational Safety and Health and
Administration [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] sets a permissible exposure limit
(PEL) of Fd to be 2 ppm for short-term exposure limit (STEL), and 0.75 ppm for time-weighted
average (TWA). Since Fd is readily and reactively polymerizing gas at room temperature [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], neutralization of Fd in cadavers to lower its vapor to
approximately 1 ppm was the goal of this experiment. Thus far, rigorous and regulatory
enforcement of lowering Fd exposure limits have driven anatomists and anatomical institutions
to improve laboratory ventilation and exhausting systems, limit the period of laboratory
teaching sessions, augment the use of personal protective equipment, and develop advanced
preservation method of anatomical specimens, e.g. corrosive cast and plastination. The use of
computer imaging, simulation and multimedia is also accepted as an alternative to using
cadavers in anatomical teachings. However, their inadequacies in pedagogic principles seems to
hinder the substitution for the real cadavers.</p><p>Recently, emphasis has been placed on the use of Fd-inactivating chemicals to neutralize or
convert Fd in the embalmed cadavers to be the least noxious compound. Some chemical additives,
such as cooking salt [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], monoethanolamine, methanol,
phenoxyethanol [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and nitrite pickling salt [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], were claimed to have preservative potential for this
purpose. In addition, several expensive commercial fixatives, for examples, Perfect
Solution<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Carolina Biological Supply, Burlington, NC, U.S.A.), ESCO
Chemicals<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Embalmer&#x02019;s Supply Co., Ontario, Canada), and Streck Tissue
Fixative<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Streck Laboratories, Omaha, NE, U.S.A.), are available, but major
concerns about using these products at our anatomical teaching laboratory are duration of
storing the embalmed specimens and embalming cost per cadaver, especially in large animals.
Other studies confirmed that ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate could successfully
decrease Fd in cadavers [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although both chemicals yield ammonium ions to react with Fd to form a
safe and nonvolatile products&#x02014;i.e, hexamethylenetetramine or methenamine, they are expensive
and not readily available as consumer products. Direct use of ammonia gas, which is a harmful
gas and difficult to store or handle, is also unlikely. Instead, nontoxic ammonium ion donors
which are commercially available at low cost and are simple to handle, such as urea and urea
fertilizer, were evaluated for this particular purpose. In addition, rapid neutralization of
Fd using urea-treated dry materials was patented [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
Our preliminary trials of spraying urea solution (US) or urea fertilizer solution (UFS)
directly onto the formalinized specimens or briefly dipping the specimens in the US or UFS
could immensely reduce the amount of Fd vapor from the specimens. Covering the specimens with
towel soaked with US or UFS could also trap and neutralize the Fd vapor; thus reducing the
amount of Fd from vaporizing into the environment. Although urea has been used to reduce risk
of exposure to formaldehyde [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we know of no report
of using urea and urea fertilizer in preparing animal cadavers. The present study explored the
potential of US and UFS to decrease Fd in chicken cadavers through measuring Fd vapor.</p><p><italic>In vitro neutralization</italic>: Initially, 32.5% US (Q&#x000eb;RC Chemical Co., Ltd.,
Chonburi, Thailand) and UFS (N-P-K formula 46-0-0, Jiatai Co., Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand) were
prepared as stock solutions for diluting to 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 and 32.5%.
Five m<italic>l</italic> of each concentration was added into each test tube containing 5
m<italic>l</italic> of 10% FS (Q&#x000eb;RC Chemical Co.), respectively. Level of Fd vapor emitting
from these mixtures was determined at the mouth of each test tube at 0, 15, 30 and 60 min
after mixing by using HAL-HFX105 handled Fd meter (Hal Technology, LLC; Rancho Cucamonga, CA,
U.S.A.) for three times. The meter is capable of measuring Fd concentrations ranging from
0&#x02013;100 ppm with resolution of 0.01 ppm. It was apparently that Fd level was lowered with the
increasing concentrations of US and UFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Level of Fd vapor releasing from the mixtures of 10% FS and various concentrations of

mixing. Apparently, FD vapor was decreased to approximately 1 ppm or lower when 18% US
and 27% UFS or higher concentrations of both solution were applied.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-80-606-g001"/></fig>). Although the neutralizing pattern of these two solutions was similar, UFS could not
reduce or neutralize Fd as much as US could. Upon the measurement at 60 min, the lowest
concentration of US that could reduce Fd vapor to below 1 ppm (0.74 ppm) was 18% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1a</xref>), and 27% UFS was needed to decrease Fd to
nearly 1 ppm (1.14 ppm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1b</xref>). Regardless, 18%
US and 27% UFS were selected for the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment. In addition, pungent
odor of Fd was generally undetectable in the reactions having level of Fd vapor lower than 1
ppm.</p><p><italic>In vivo neutralization</italic>: This experiment received approval from the Animal
Ethics Committee of Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand (IACUC KKU No. 3/2015), and was
conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institute of Animal Health
(Thailand). Accordingly, 30 commercial broiler chickens at 6-week-old weighing 5&#x02013;7 kg were
anesthetized in a diethyl ether chamber, exsanguinated, and then infused 20.8
m<italic>l</italic> of 10% FS per 100 g BW via the right common carotid artery. After being
kept for 24 hr at room temperature, the chickens were infused with normal saline (control
group, n=10), 18% US (US group, n=10) and 27% UFS (UFS group, n=10) in an equal volume to that
of FS. Fd vapor was measured after 48 hr between the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Then,
tissues and organs, including superficial pectoralis muscle, iliotibialis muscle, heart, lung,
liver, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and spleen were dissected to investigate the
preservation efficacy. Each sample was kept separately in each plastic bag which was tightly
closed until the measurement was carried out. The measurement of Fd vapor was performed at the
mouth of the bag. Pungent odor of the Fd was noticed at the time of measurement. Initially,
normal distribution of the Fd level was examined using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The data were
evaluated by analyses of variance (ANOVA), and followed by Tukey&#x02019;s HSD for the multiple
comparisons of means. Statistical significance for all statistical tests was considered at
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05. It was apparently that level of Fd vapor in body cavity and each
organ after the infusion of US and UFS was decreased considerably (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Level of Fd vapor released from the chicken cadavers with 18% US and 27% UFS

differences were clearly seen between the control and the treatment groups (both US and UFS)
at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05. Levels of the Fd vapor of the US and UFS treated groups were
8.6 and 6.4 times less than that of the control group, respectively. This statement indicated
that neutralizing power of US was about 1.3 times higher than that of UFS. Although US was
likely to be more potential than UFS, the pair comparison between the US and UFS group could
not found significant difference, except that of the lung, liver, and large intestine (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Odor of Fd was much less or even
unnoticeable in the cadavers or organs with Fd level lower than 1 ppm.</p><p><italic>Preservation efficacy</italic>: Fd vapor was efficiently eliminated since no pungent
odor was noticeable in the neutralized samples, especially those having Fd lower than 1 ppm.
The macroscopic observation could reveal that tissues and organs of all groups were
well-preserved and suitable for the gross anatomical study. Difference in histological
appearances of all tissues among the three groups was not observable. All parenchymal
structures of each tissue and organ either in cadavers of the control or the US and UFS groups
were easily identifiable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Histology of pectoralis muscle (a&#x02013;c), heart muscle (d&#x02013;f), lung (g&#x02013;i), liver (j&#x02013;i),

preparation and processing. Thus, this practice should be acceptable as an effective Fd
neutralizing protocol in addition to the conventional cadaver preparation.</p><p>The remarkable lowering of Fd vapor levels in the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment could
strongly support our confidence on the neutralizing potential of the 18% US and 27% UFS
against Fd in the embalm specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). Urea
and urea fertilizer are nontoxic chemicals yielding ammonia to react with Fd of which harmless
and non-volatile methylolurea copolymer (also called monomethylolurea) was formed [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Such
reaction is usually carried out by using urea and Fd at a molar ratio of 1:1. Odor of Fd vapor
after adding US or UFS should be reduced or disappeared; especially in the case that Fd vapor
level is lower than 1 ppm [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This statement conforms
to the odor threshold of Fd of which is 0.5&#x02013;1 ppm in air. Our results could show clearly that
neutralizing power of US is approximately 1.3 times higher than UFS. This would be from the
differences in the existing amount of active urea molecules in each solution. Commercial urea
fertilizer is usually produced to have only 50% nitrogen to provide nitrogen nutrient to plant
and soil [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, number of free urea molecules in
UFS is approximately one half of that in US with the same concentration. Since 18% US and 27%
UFS were used, the difference between number of free urea molecules of both solutions was
about 1.29 times. Such difference was quite similar to the 1.3 times difference in
neutralizing power of the two solutions. Even all concentrations of US and UFS could react
with Fd for 60 min, none could completely neutralize Fd. Many factors that interfered the
complete reaction might include temperature, ventilation, equipment, and measuring duration.
Further investigation on these particular aspects may be important.</p><p>In this study, a volume of FS being infused into each chicken was calculated from its body
weight. This experiment assumed that FS was distributed into each organ or tissue.
Nevertheless, the amount of FS distributing into each organ should be dependently upon their
size and fluid holding nature&#x02014;the larger organ or higher fluid holding nature, the higher
infusing volume of FS be retained. The differences of Fd vapor levels measured from body
cavity and each organ in the control group could be proportional to the volume of free Fd
being held inside such organ. A similar reaction and result as in the <italic>in
vitro</italic> experiment was expected when 18% US and 27% UFS at an equal volume to FS was
infused into the each formalinized cadaver. This statement could be proved by the immense
reduction of Fd levels in body cavity and all organs. Initially, the mean value of Fd in the
control group was 6.29 &#x000b1; 1.29 ppm. But after being infused with both neutralizing solutions,
Fd levels in the body cavity and most organs of both treatment groups were below 1 ppm, except
that in large intestine (1.00 &#x000b1; 0.14 ppm) and pectoralis muscle (1.01 &#x000b1; 0.18 ppm) of the US
treated group, and lung (1.39 &#x000b1; 0.34 ppm) and liver (1.82 &#x000b1; 0.23 ppm) in of the UFS treated
group (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Toxic odor of Fd was much lesser
or even undetectable in the treatment groups with Fd level below 1 ppm, especially when
compared with the same organs in the control group. Thus, we were confident that both
solutions could satisfactorily reduce Fd level to conform to the permissible exposure limits
[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Upon our embalming experiences, the higher amount
of FS levels in these four organs would correlate to their size and fluid-holding capacity.
Large intestine is a hollow organ. Its lumen could accumulate FS fluid leaking from the blood
vessels during the infusion. To neutralize this excess FS, an extra-amount of neutralizing
solution might be required. In poultry, pectoralis muscle is the largest muscle of the body
and the whole muscle comprises approximately 8% of the body weight. Hence, FS fluid should be
distributed into this muscle in vast amount. As a result, neutralization of Fd in pectoralis
muscle would require high amount of neutralizing solution. Lung has a high capacity to hold
and accumulate the excess FS fluid in its alveolar lumens; thus, could be considered as the
main target of FS deposition. In the cadaver, the infused FS would be able to pass through the
alveolar wall to retain in the alveolar lumen. Such retaining FS could release Fd vapor
afterward. On this particular, a higher amount of neutralizing solution would be infused to
neutralize such excess FS. But with this conventional infusing practice, the amount of
solution being infused into lung cannot be easily manipulated. Liver, as a matter of fact, is
the largest organ of the body. It might be able to trap high amount of FS inside. Even liver
is a solid organ, it has several large blood vessels to drain blood from abdominal viscera,
abdomen, pelvic, and hind limb into liver. FS being infused through blood vessel could come to
the liver in a high amount. Thus, neutralizing FS in liver to be lower than 1 ppm might need a
higher amount of US and UFS than the calculated amount.</p><p>In conclusion, 18% US and 27% UFS could be considered as good neutralizers of Fd in cadavers.
They could reduce pungent and toxic odor of Fd vapor to meet the safety level designated by
many organizations without affecting the cadaveric and histological quality. Application of
this practice into any formalin-based embalming protocols should be immensely beneficial to
all involving parties. Since this is the first report on using US and UFS for neutralizing Fd
both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in chicken cadavers, similar study in other animal species
is necessary.</p></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Takuya Hirose of Laboratory of
