EBM was originally designed to address clinical problems within internal medicine, but has been generalised and expanded to enable applicability to other medical specialties.

Invitations were emailed to radiologists enrolled in the critical skills appraisal programme at The University of Sydney (July 2013) or were attending an Annual Scientific Meeting (October 2013). Radiologists known to the investigators were also invited and participants could nominate other radiologists who could offer a different perspective about EBM.

AT conducted a face-to-face semistructured interview with each participant from July to November 2013. Participant recruitment ceased when theoretical saturation was reached that is, when little or no new concepts were being raised in subsequent interviews. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed.

There&#x02019;s been no improvement or change in the incidence of chronic renal disease in children as a consequence of treatment of urinary tract infection or treatment of reflux. So that has totally changed the management. Seven or eight years ago I was doing MCUs on children up to five years old and there were probably five or 10 on a list. Now it&#x02019;s down to less than one because of evidence-based medicine showing that the treatment doesn&#x02019;t&#x02014;the investigation and treatment doesn&#x02019;t change outcome.</italic> (ID13)<break/><italic>So the literature that appeared over that period of time has really changed the way that I think about using gadolinium in renal impairment.

<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Current models for educating evidence-based practice include having trained epidemiologists to deliver regular teaching and interactive sessions which encompass theory, self-directed learning, and application to clinically relevant questions; or providing training workshops or teaching EBM in postgraduate meetings which cover the principles of EBM.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Our study has highlighted important implications for teaching EBM within radiology. Skills that require greater emphasis included literature searching and critical appraisal. A recent survey found that radiologists and trainees preferred Google, customised radiology-focused produces and apps, and online resources to solve imaging questions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Evidence summaries or EBM guidelines could be developed and disseminated via these channels. Confidence in appraisal skills could be improved with wider use of EBM tools.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> For most EBM skills, a mix of educational strategies is likely to be most effective in increasing skills including interactive online courses, journal clubs and seminars.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>While our findings are likely to have some commonality across geographic regions, further studies on barriers to EBM in different areas would be enlightening. Teaching strategies that are most helpful to radiologists should be clarified, as these may not be the same as those for bedside practitioners. Studies of implementation of evidence-based guidelines for imaging pathways and whether these improve patient's important outcomes and cost are also needed.</p><p>Better access to evidence, ongoing education and training supplemented with practical tools for appraising evidence; and developing evidence-based guidelines and protocols may promote optimal use of EBM within radiology, and ultimately translate to better patient care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e216" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006199.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e217" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006199.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors sincerely thank all the participants for their time and efforts in sharing their perspectives.
