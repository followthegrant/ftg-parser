Recent studies suggest that &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregates may spread from cell to cell and raise questions about the propagation of neurodegeneration. While continuous progress has been made characterizing &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregates <italic>in vitro</italic>, there is a lack of information regarding the structure of these species inside the cells. Here, we use confocal fluorescence microscopy in combination with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, dSTORM, to investigate &#x003b1;-synuclein uptake when added exogenously to SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and to probe <italic>in situ</italic> morphological features of &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregates with near nanometer resolution. We demonstrate that using dSTORM, it is possible to follow noninvasively the uptake of extracellularly added &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregates by the cells. Once the aggregates are internalized, they move through the endosomal pathway and accumulate in lysosomes to be degraded. Our dSTORM data show that &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregates remain assembled after internalization and they are shortened as they move through the endosomal pathway. No further aggregation was observed inside the lysosomes as speculated in the literature, nor in the cytoplasm of the cells. Our study thus highlights the super-resolution capability of dSTORM to follow directly the endocytotic uptake of extracellularly added amyloid aggregates and to probe the morphology of <italic>in situ</italic> protein aggregates even when they accumulate in small vesicular compartments.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003404</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Single Molecule Point of View in Aggregation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aartsma</surname><given-names>Thijs J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work is part of the research program &#x02018;Single Molecule Point of View in Aggregation&#x02019; of the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fom.nl">www.fom.nl</ext-link>), which is part of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nwo.nl">www.nwo.nl</ext-link>).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Progressive accumulation and deposition of specific protein aggregates is a characteristic of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD). In PD, &#x003b1;-synuclein(&#x003b1;-syn), a small presynaptic protein (~15 kDa), is the main fibrillar component of the intraneuronal protein aggregates (Lewy bodies) that represent the pathological feature of this disease [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although &#x003b1;-syn is predominantly a cytosolic protein, recent studies suggest the protein exerts not only a pathogenic effect inside the cells, but an extracellular pathogenic action as well. Multiple forms of &#x003b1;-syn have been observed in cerebrospinal fluid, blood plasma and more recently, in saliva [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. When applied to cultured cells, &#x003b1;-syn preformed aggregates are internalized via endocytosis and targeted to the lysosomes for degradation [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The extent of aggregate accumulation inside cells is determined by the cells ability to degrade and remove the aggregates. Few groups reported that &#x003b1;-syn taken-up from the extracellular space induces the aggregation of the endogenous protein leading to the formation of Lewy body-like inclusions [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Cell to cell transmission of &#x003b1;-syn pathological aggregates most likely through sequential exocytosis and endocytosis, has been demonstrated in neuronal cultured cells as well as in animal models [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153020.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>At this moment, the fate of the exogeneous &#x003b1;-syn aggregates once they enter the cells is not clear. Are the aggregates degraded in the lysosomes, or do they start growing into larger &#x003b1;-syn aggregates? Do they overload the degradation systems impairing their activity and escape in the cytosol inducing aggregation of the endogeneous protein? In order to address these questions, we followed directly the uptake and fate of &#x003b1;-syn preformed aggregates when added to neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y, by super-resolution microscopy.</p><p>While atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been extensively used to obtain the ultrastructure and morphological features of the amyloid aggregates, the technique has the drawback to be applicable only <italic>ex situ</italic>. In contrast, optical microscopy and in particular the new super-resolution methods are powerful and non-invasive techniques for the study of morphological features of the amyloid aggregates with nanometer resolution. In the last years, these optical techniques have been successfully used in several studies to probe the morphology of protein aggregates <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and in cells [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Here we applied confocal fluorescence microscopy and optical super-resolution microscopy to follow and characterize the fate of small <italic>in vitro</italic> assembled &#x003b1;-syn fibrils in human neuroblastoma cells. We found that fibrils were shortened when trafficked through the lysosomal pathway. Further fibril maturation and formation of long fibrils was not observed. Our study thus highlights the potential role of lysosomal degradation in the prevention of &#x003b1;-syn aggregation in cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Preparation of labeled &#x003b1;-syn fibrillar seeds</title><p>Recombinant human wild type &#x003b1;-syn was expressed and purified as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

We stopped the aggregation process when the plateau was reached as seen by thioflavin T fluorimetry (data not shown). The presence of fibrils was confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Labeling of &#x003b1;-syn fibrils with the NHS ester (succinimidyl ester) of Alexa Fluor 532 and Alexa Fluor 647 was performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Life Technologies, USA). Briefly, &#x003b1;-syn fibril solution was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 532 dye in a 1:1 protein/fluorophore molar ratio. The unbound dye was removed by pelleting the fibrils at 13000 rpm for 15 min in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet containing labeled fibrils was resuspended in PBS. The centrifugation/resuspension cycle was repeated twice. Purified labeled &#x003b1;-syn fibrils were divided in 20 &#x003bc;L aliquots, flash frozen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C.

The Alexa 532 dye was excited using a 532 nm laser (Cobolt, Sweden). A 405 nm laser (CrystaLaser, USA) was used for photo-switching and to adjust the density of visible fluorophores. The light was reflected into the objective by the dichroic mirror ZT405/532/635rpc (Chroma, USA). The fluorescence light in the detection path was filtered using the emission filter ZET532/633m (Chroma, USA). Excitation intensities were in between 0 and 20 W/cm<sup>2</sup> at 405 nm and 3 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> at 532 nm. For each sample, we acquired 10000 single-molecule images with an acquisition time of 10 ms per frame and a frame rate of 87 Hz.

From the fit we determined the location of each molecule to high accuracy of 11 nm on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The localization accuracy coincides with the value predicted from the width of the point-spread-function and the detected number of photons, 293 nm / &#x0221a;[447] = 14 nm. Subsequently, the localization data were used to generate super-resolution images. Super-resolution images were obtained by binning localizations into 20&#x000d7;20 nm<sup>2</sup> bins. For zoom-ins we used probability density maps in which each localization was represented as a normalized Gaussian centered at the position and of width given by the sigma-uncertainty in localization. The pixel size was chosen to represent 1&#x000d7;1 nm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>For analysis of fiber width and length we used line fitting from the raw localization data. We selected a region of interest (ROI) around a fibril. The selected localizations were rotated and subsequently the y-coordinates of the localizations were binned.

In AFM experiments, we used the height information to estimate the diameter of the labeled &#x003b1;&#x02212;syn fibrils. The mean height was found to be 8 &#x000b1; 1 nm for the labeled &#x003b1;&#x02212;syn fibrils (mean &#x000b1; s.e. from 50 fibers, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153020.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The apparent discrepancy in fiber widths between the two methods probably relates to some additional imperfections due to the angular alignment in the super-resolution imaging, which were not considered in the deconvolution procedure. In any case, fibers appeared as structures of width way below 50 nm.</p><fig id="pone.0153020.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0153020.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Characterization of different sized &#x003b1;-syn fibrils by dSTORM.</title><p>(a) Detailed view of an intact &#x003b1;-syn-Alexa532 fibril (the marked fibril from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

Several studies have shown that exogenously generated &#x003b1;-syn fibrils and not the oligomers, specifically induce intracellular LB-like inclusion formation. It has been also shown that the uptake is more efficient if the fibrils are shorter [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153020.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For this reason, &#x003b1;-syn fibrils were sonicated prior their addition to the cells. The effect of sonication on fibril size is already apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Whereas fibril length clearly exceeds 1 &#x003bc;m for the intact fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g002">Fig 2A &#x00026; 2B</xref>), after sonication the length shortened to &#x0003c;1 &#x003bc;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g002">Fig 2C &#x00026; 2D</xref>) independent of the imaging method used. The lengths of the sonicated fibrils determined by AFM were between 50 and 700 nm. The lengths determined by dSTORM were similar, and in the range between 30 and 650 nm. The smaller length fibrils appear as globular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g003">Fig 3D1</xref>) whereas the longer structures as clear fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g003">Fig 3D2</xref>). While sonication led to a significant decrease in fibril length the fibril width was unchanged. The distribution of sonicated fibril width, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, is characterized by a mean of 42 &#x000b1; 11 nm, which leads, after deconvolution, to a real width of FWHM<sub>d</sub> of 32 &#x000b1; 11 nm.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Internalization of extracellular &#x003b1;-syn fibrils into neuroblastoma cells</title><p>Uptake and intracellular localization of preformed &#x003b1;-syn aggregates</p><p>Having established that we were able to distinguish small sized &#x003b1;-syn aggregates <italic>in vitro</italic>, we moved further to study the fate of the aggregates once they are exogenously added to cells in culture.

Sonicated, labeled seeds were added at a concentration of 100 nM to the culture medium and left during the experiment. Their uptake by SH-SY5Y cells was followed in time using confocal microscopy and dSTORM. In the first 2 hours &#x003b1;-syn aggregates were mostly present at the cell membrane resulting in images that resemble typical images of the cell&#x02019;s outline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g004">Fig 4</xref> left&#x00026;middle). After 24 hours Alexa532-syn aggregates disappear from the outer cell membrane and localize as granular intracellular deposits mostly close to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g004">Fig 4</xref> right). This observation suggests that fibrils were internalized and probably processed in the endosomal pathway towards perinuclear lysosomes. This interpretation is supported by dual color experiments that showed that the granular deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g004">Fig 4</xref> green) colocalized with a marker for acidic organelles. (LysoTracker; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g004">Fig 4</xref> red). To further confirm that labeled &#x003b1;&#x02212;syn aggregates accumulate in lysosomes, we further used CellLight Lysosomes-RFP, BacMam 2.0 (Life Technologies), a fusion construct of Lamp1, to specifically label the lysosomes. Analysis of the SH-SY5Y cells exposed for 24 hours to the Alexa647-labeled &#x003b1;-syn fibrils showed that the aggregates are internalized and they do colocalize with Lamp1, marker protein for lysosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153020.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). At the same time, we demonstrated that internalization and fate of the aggregates is not influenced by the fluorophores used for labeling. Hence, our data confirm earlier results which suggested that protein aggregates like &#x003b1;-syn are transported towards the lysosomal compartment to be degraded [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153020.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0153020.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0153020.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Internalization of &#x003b1;-syn sonicated fibrils in human neuroblastoma cells.</title><p>Images show co-localization of Alexa 532 labeled &#x003b1;-syn aggregates (green) with LysoTracker Deep Red (red).

Whether and how maturation occurs and whether that will lead to some equilibrium distribution of aggregates, monomers and degraded peptide in cells when being continuously exposed to an extracellular concentration is still unclear. One proposed mechanism for maturation, that has been linked to disease, is that fibrils further aggregate inside the acidic endocytic vesicles as the combination of low pH and high effective concentration are favorable conditions for &#x003b1;-syn aggregation [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Further it is unclear whether such maturation would lead to the formation of long &#x003b1;-syn fibrils in the cytoplasm of the cells.</p><p>To address these questions, we used the super-resolution capability of dSTORM to probe directly the morphology of &#x003b1;-syn aggregates while entering SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The dSTORM images, like the confocal images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g004">Fig 4</xref>, showed that &#x003b1;-syn aggregates initially associated with, and accumulated at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In the course of time cells took up the fibrils and accumulated them in endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g005">Fig 5B &#x00026; 5C</xref>). Inside the vesicles the aggregates appeared tightly packed forming bigger clusters. The typical size of those intracellular globular structures stretched from 30&#x02013;150 nm. It is worth mentioning that the small-sized fibrils did not completely lose their morphology at the length scale of our resolution even after 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153020.g005">Fig 5B &#x00026; 5C</xref>). Endosomes and lysosomes are typically 50&#x02013;400 nm in diameter and are distributed uniformly throughout the cytosol [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Hence, the size of the clusters, as determined by live-cell dSTORM, falls into the small size region expected for endosomes and lysosomes. We considered the possibility of lysosomal membrane decoration by &#x003b1;-syn. However this would present as ring-like structures in our super-resolution images of vesicles larger than then twice FWHM of ours localizations (52nm). This has not been observed in our data, even for vesicles &#x0003e;100nm.</p><fig id="pone.0153020.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0153020.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Super-resolution images of internalized &#x003b1;-syn aggregates in endosomal vesicles in time.</title><p>(a) dSTORM image of a cell treated for half an hour with &#x003b1;-syn -Alexa532 aggregates.

Our study provides also additional evidence in favor of lysosomal degradation pathway for removal of extracellular &#x003b1;-syn aggregates. Cells internalize extracellular small sized fibrils (&#x0003c;1 &#x003bc;m length). Subsequently the aggregates accumulate in endocytic vesicles and are trafficked towards lysosomes. Fibrils keep their morphology and do not further mature but rather shortened possibly due to lysosomal breakdown as they move through endosomal pathway. As lysosomal malfunction has been linked to neurodegeneration and age-related neurodegenerative disorders [<xref rid="pone.0153020.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0153020.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], enhancing lysosomal function may be a potential therapeutic strategy for prevention or treatment of PD.
