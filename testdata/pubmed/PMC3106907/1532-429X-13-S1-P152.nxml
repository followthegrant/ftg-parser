This is important for differentiating ischemic from nonischemic lesions in late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images.</p><p>In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy septal ablation (TASH) with injection of microparticles instead of ethanol represents a controlled model of iatrogenic embolic infarction.</p><p>We compared cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scar patterns after microparticle-induced TASH with those after clinical embolic infarctions from other sources.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>18 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (13 male, 60&#x000b1;17 years) underwent injection of foam particles into a septal coronary branch. We compared the shape of the resulting myocardial scar with those in 23 consecutive patients (14 male, 55&#x000b1;15 years) with evidence of embolic myocardial infarctions. Embolic infarctions were defined as small single or multiple myocardial scars in conjunction with a normal coronary angiography or a single thrombotic lesion without evidence of general atherosclerosis. A history of embolic events in other vascular territories or the presence of atrial shunts confirmed the diagnosis. Patients with evidence of acute inflammation were excluded. In all patients 3 long axes and a contiguous stack of short axis LGE images were obtained after 0.2 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA in 1.5 a T scanner. In-plane resolution was 1.8 mm/pixel.</p><p>Using Osirix 3.3.2., we measured maximal subepicardial and subendocardial extent on LGE images in that short axis slice with the largest extent of the scar. Thereby we differentiated wedge-shaped scars (subepicardial extent &#x0003e; subendocardial extent) from transmural (subepicardial = subendocardial) or subendocardial scars (subepicardial &#x0003c; subendocardial).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After embolic TASH, infarction scars showed a wedge-shaped pattern in 13/18 cases (72%) with a subendo-subepicardial ratio of 0.8&#x000b1;0.3. In patients with embolic infarctions, 7 cases showed multiple lesions. Wedge-shaped lesions with larger epicardial extent were found in 11, transmural lesions in 10, subendocardial lesions in 2 cases. The mean subendo - subepicardial ratio of embolic infarctions was 0.6&#x000b1;0.1<bold>.</bold></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Embolic infarctions after septal ablation in HOCM show a wedge-shaped pattern with a larger extent on the epicardial surface, resembling the pattern of other embolic infarctions. This wedge-shaped pattern contradicts the wavefront phenomenon. When differentiating non-ischemic from ischemic lesions in late enhancement images this phenomenon should be taken into account to avoid misclassification of embolic infarction scars as nonischemic lesions.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Wedge-shaped scar after embolic TASH in HOCM (left) and 2 different patients (center and right) with embolic infarctions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1532-429X-13-S1-P152-1"/></fig></sec></body></article>
