The role of inflammasomes in cancer is not very well studied, however, literature supports both pro-and anti-tumorigenic effects of inflammasomes on cancer depending upon the type of cancer. Asbestos is a causative agent for MM and we have shown before that it causes inflammasome priming and activation in mesothelial cells. MM tumor cells/tissues showed decreased levels of inflammasome components like NLRP3 and caspase-1 as compared to human mesothelial cells or normal tissue counterpart of tumor. Based on our preliminary findings we hypothesized that treatment of MMs with chemotherapeutic drugs may elevate the levels of NLRP3 and caspase-1 resulting in increased cell death by pyroptosis while increasing the levels of IL-1&#x003b2; and other pro-inflammatory molecules. Therefore, a combined strategy of chemotherapeutic drug and IL-1R antagonist may play a beneficial role in MM therapy. To test our hypothesis we used two human MM tumor cell lines (Hmeso, H2373) and two chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin, cisplatin). Through a series of experiments we showed that both chemotherapeutic drugs caused increases in NLRP3 levels, caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis and pro-inflammatory molecules released from MM cells. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies using SCID mice and Hmeso cells showed that tumors were smaller in combined treatment group of cisplatin and IL-1R antagonist (Anakinra) as compared to cisplatin alone or untreated control groups. Taken together our study suggests that chemotherapeutic drugs in combination with IL-1R antagonist may have a beneficial role in MM treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by NIH RO1 ES021110.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="20"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All the relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All the relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a neoplasm of pleural or peritoneal mesothelial cells with no successful therapy available. MM is caused by asbestos and is extremely resistant to chemotherapy and radiation [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among other factors, a defect in apoptosis appears to be a major contributory factor in drug resistance. Inflammation also plays an important role in MM development as shown by our group as well as others [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145404.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The inflammasome is a special component of the inflammation machinery that is comprised of NOD-like receptors (NLRs), a family of intracellular sensors [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. NLRs like NLRP3 and others form a multiprotein complex with apoptotic speck-like protein containing a CARD domain (ASC) in response to stimuli, resulting in caspase-1 activation. Active caspase-1 can process pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 into their mature form. IL-1&#x003b2; is well known to play a positive role in tumorigenesis of various cancers [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145404.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and has been implicated in proliferation of mesothelial cells, a cell of origin for MM [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recently we have demonstrated that asbestos and erionite can prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in human mesothelial cells and that an autocrine feedback loop for inflammasome regulation exists [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the same study, treatment of MM tumor bearing SCID mice with IL-1R antagonist (Anakinra) resulted in significantly decreased levels of IL-8 and VEGF in peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF), suggesting that IL-1 cytokines may play a significant role in regulating other pro-tumorigenic cytokines and, therefore, tumorigenesis.</p><p>The role of inflammasomes in carcinogenesis is contrasting; they may inhibit tumor promotion by activating caspase-1 and cell killing, or may promote tumor growth by upregulating secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules like, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-18, FGF2 and HMGB1. It has been reported that pro or anti tumorigenic effects of inflammasomes may depend on the cell type in which they are activated. For example, 2 groups independently reported that the absence of NLRP3 and caspase-1 attenuated chemical-induced colitis in mice [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145404.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], whereas other groups have reported that different inflammasome knockout (KO) mice are more sensitive to chemical-induced colitis and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145404.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Detailed studies by a later group demonstrated that NLRP3 expression by hematopoietic cells exerts anti-tumorigenic functions, whereas that from intestinal epithelial or stromal cells do not [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These studies suggest that inflammasomes from a different cell type of the same individual may have differing effects; thus; global KO mice may not be the appropriate tool to study the effect of inflammasomes.</p><p>For the present study, we hypothesize that NLRP3 inflammasome attenuation, which occurs in mesothelioma, enhances drug resistance, and hence there is a case for induction of inflammasome activation. The downside of this is more production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1&#x003b2; and related cytokines with a tumor growth promotion effect. Blocking IL-1&#x003b2; function would inhibit the latter effect. Treatment of MM cell lines with chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in priming and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules. Based on our preliminary findings we hypothesized that a combination of chemotherapeutic drug and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) may work better for MM treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture and exposure to agents</title><p>Human peritoneal mesothelial LP9/TERT-1 (LP9) cells [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] were purchased from Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Harvard University, Boston, MA and grown as reported previously.

Cisplatin was effective at higher doses in Hmeso cells (<xref rid="pone.0145404.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and Dox was most effective at 5 &#x003bc;M concentration in all MM cell lines tested. For further studies we selected 100 &#x003bc;M cisplatin and 5 &#x003bc;M Dox. The lack of effect of Dox at higher concentration could possibly be due to cytotoxicity as reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition to NLRP3, we also measured steady-state mRNA levels of ASC/PYCARD and pro-caspase1 in MM cells with and without chemotherapeutic drugs and got varied results based on cell types and concentration of drugs used (<xref rid="pone.0145404.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0145404.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145404.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Chemotherapeutic drugs increase NLRP3 levels in human MM cell lines.</title><p>Human MM cell lines were treated with different concentrations (0&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M) of cisplatin or Dox (0&#x02013;25 &#x003bc;M,) for 24 or 48 h and steady-state NLRP3 mRNA levels were assessed by qRT-PCR. *p&#x02264;0.05 as compared to untreated (0) controls at the same time point.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0145404.g002"/></fig><fig id="pone.0145404.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145404.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Chemotherapeutic drugs regulate PYCARD/ASC and pro-caspase levels in MM cell lines.</title><p>Human MM cell lines were treated with different concentrations (0&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M) of cisplatin or Dox (0&#x02013;25 &#x003bc;M) for 24 or 48 h and steady-state PYCARD/ASC or pro-caspase-1 mRNA levels were assessed by qRT-PCR. *p&#x02264;0.05 as compared to untreated (0) controls at the same time point.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0145404.g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Chemotherapeutic drugs prime and activate NLRP3 in Hmeso and H2373 cells</title><p>We selected two human MM cell lines, Hmeso and H2373, which form tumors in SCID mice, for further studies. Cell were treated with either Dox (5 &#x003bc;M) or cisplatin (100 &#x003bc;M) for 24 or 48 h and NLRP3 protein and caspase-1 activation was assessed. Drug concentrations used in this experiment were derived from results obtained from experiments in <xref rid="pone.0145404.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. A significant increase in NLRP3 protein levels was observed with both drugs in Hmeso cells; however, only cisplatin caused a significant increase in NLRP3 levels in H2373 cells (<xref rid="pone.0145404.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>). Caspase-1 activation, as measured by release of p20 subunit in the medium, was increased by both drugs in both MM cell types (<xref rid="pone.0145404.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B and 4D</xref>). To show that activated caspase-1 contributes to drug-induced cell death (pyroptosis), we pretreated MM cells with a specific caspase-1 inhibitor (40 &#x003bc;M Caspase-1 inhibitor VI (zYVADfmk), EMD Biosciences, Billerica, CA) for 1 h and subsequently with chemotherapeutic drugs, Dox (0&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M) or cisplatin (0&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;M) for 24 h (Hmeso) and 72 h (H2373). Higher concentrations of drugs were used for this experiment as low concentrations did not show any toxicity. Also, different concentrations of drugs were used for two different cell lines due to their differential susceptibility to drugs as reported previously (25). Cell viability was then determined by MTS Assay [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is clear from <xref rid="pone.0145404.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, that Dox or cisplatin induced caspase-1 activation did not contribute significantly to Hmeso cell death, however, in H2373 cells caspase-1 inhibition resulted in a significant decrease in cell death by Dox (<xref rid="pone.0145404.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). With cisplatin, a similar trend of increased survival was also observed with caspase-1 inhibition in H2373 cells, but was not statistically significant. These data suggest that drug-induced killing is contributed in part by pyroptosis in some MM cells. Based on recent reports that there exists cross talk between the inflammasome and other caspases like caspase-8 [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we hypothesized that inhibition of caspase-1 may cause a compensatory increase in caspase-8 activity, resulting in no effect of caspase-1 inhibition on cell viability as seen in Hmeso cells (<xref rid="pone.0145404.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). To test this we used a pan caspase inhibitor (z-vad-fmk, MP Biomedicals) on both MM cell lines. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0145404.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>, pan caspase inhibitor significantly decreased drug-induced cell death in both cell types suggesting the possible compensation by other caspases in drug-induced toxicity. To demonstrate that these inhibitors are inhibiting caspase-1 activity, we performed caspase-1 activity assay in MM cells after treating them with chemotherapeutic drugs with or without caspase inhibitors. Results showed that both caspase inhibitors significantly attenuated drug-induced caspase-1 activity in both MM cell lines (<xref rid="pone.0145404.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0145404.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145404.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Chemotherapeutic drugs cause priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in MM cell lines.</title><p>Treatment of Hmeso MM cells with Dox or cisplatin resulted in increased NLRP3 protein levels (A) and activation of inflammasome (B).

Two daily doses of Anakinra were injected because half-life of Anakinra in mice is very short. Due to the short half-life of Anakinra in mice, a higher dose (100 mg/kg) is recommended for mice as opposed to the low dose (1 mg/kg) used in humans [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Anakinra at this dose is non-toxic except for being a local irritant in some cases due to low pH; however, no such effect was observed in our study. Four weeks post cell inoculation tumors were harvested and weighed. As this is an intraperitoneal model of MM, only one time point measurement of tumor and PLF is possible. PLF was collected and assessed for total and differential cell counts and cytokine levels (IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-18, IL-6, FGF2 and HMGB1). Two different control groups were planned so as to study the effect of number of injections on tumor growth, if any. We did not observe any significant effect of number of injections on tumor growth; therefore the two groups were pooled for the purpose of analysis. Weights of mice were measured before cell injection and every week thereafter till the end of the experiment.

Our findings suggest that there is an initial increase in IL-1&#x003b2; levels in response to chemotherapeutic drugs which later on subsides due to activation of feed- back regulatory mechanism. However, the initial increase could be sufficient to start signaling cascades for tumor promotion and blocking it by exogenous IL-1ra (Anakinra) before chemotherapy could be a better strategy for MM tumor treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>NLRP3 regulation by chemotherapeutics in Hmeso MM cells</title><p>To understand the process of inflammasome regulation by chemotherapeutics in MM cells, Hmeso cells were treated with Dox alone or in combination with various inhibitors known to regulate inflammasomes in various systems (CA-074Me/cathepsin B inhibitor, cytochalasin D/actin polymerization inhibitor, KCl/blocks K<sup>+</sup> efflux, KN-62/ATP receptor antagonist, NAC/antioxidant).

Based on our hypothesis that this upregulation of the inflammasome has both an anti-tumor effect (through caspase- activation) and a tumor promoting effect (through enhanced cytokine production) we propose that combining chemotherapeutic drugs with IL-1 receptor antagonist may have a beneficial effect on MM tumor reduction.</p><p>The low caspase-1 activity could in part be responsible for the observed drug resistance in MM tumors, as active caspase-1 catalyzes activation of executioner caspase-7 and several other substrates resulting in apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In support, it has been demonstrated that caspase-1 is down-regulated in human prostate cancers [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and reintroduction of caspase-1 leads to greater sensitivity to radiation-induced killing <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Based on this report and our preliminary findings we hypothesized that chemotherapeutic drugs may activate inflammasomes and therefore, caspase-1, resulting in reduced drug resistance. As caspase-1 is involved in activating pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18, the negative effect will be increased levels of these pro-tumorigenic cytokines. To circumvent this, we proposed to use chemotherapeutic drugs in combination with IL-R antagonist (IL-1Ra, Anakinra) for MM tumor reduction.</p><p>First, using 2 human MM cell lines we demonstrated that chemotherapeutic drugs, Dox or cisplatin, can prime and activate NLRP3 as evident by caspase-1 activation. Although caspase-1 was activated in both MM cell lines, it impacted Dox-induced cell death in only H2373 cells. This lack of effect in Hmeso cells and by cisplatin in H2373 cells is possibly due to compensation by other caspases, as demonstrated by pan caspase inhibitor. In support recent literature demonstrates the cross talk of inflammasome with other caspases like caspase-8, in addition to caspase-1 [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145404.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been reported that in dendritic cells Dox can release IL-1&#x003b2; by stimulation of non-canonical caspase-8 pathway [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In support of our findings other groups have also reported activation of inflammasome pathways by chemotherapeutic drugs in various cancer and non-cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Inflammasome activation is also associated with release of mature pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-18 and FGF2 (basic fibroblast growth factor). Our studies demonstrated that Dox or cisplatin treatment of MM cells produced significant amounts of these cytokines which are pro-tumorigenic molecules and favor tumor growth by various mechanisms. Anti-tumorigenic drugs producing pro-tumorigenic molecules by inflammasome activation have been reported by others also [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and is a matter in need of further investigation. In addition, high mobility group box protein (HMGB1) another product of inflammasome activation was significantly upregulated by Dox or cisplatin in both MM cell lines. HMGB1 is a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and can induce an inflammatory response. Chemotherapeutic drugs are also known to induce HMGB1 up-regulation and impart drug resistance by inducing autophagy in different cancers [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145404.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Designing a combination treatment where we can keep the caspase-1 activation, but reduce the cytokine/HMGB effects could be a better approach. Therefore, we used IL-1R antagonist (Anakinra) in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs in an <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> system. Unlike our previous observation in mesothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], no significant effects of IL-1R blocking were observed in MM cells suggesting that no autocrine feed-back regulation of inflammasome exists in MM cells.</p><p>Of the 2 MM cell lines used in most of the experiments, one is epithelioid (Hmeso) and another one is fibrosarcomatoid (H2373). The different effect could be attributed to the different nature of the two cell lines. Currently we have many epithelioid but only one fibrosarcomatoid MM cell line in stock, making the verification of this effect difficult.</p><p>An <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment was designed to confirm that chemotherapeutic drugs in combination with IL-1ra could be a better choice for inhibiting MM tumor growth. We injected SCID mice with human MM Hmeso cells and then treated them with cisplatin and/or Anakinra for 3 weeks. Cisplatin alone was very effective; however, cisplatin and Anakinra together had almost no tumors (in 4 out of 5 animals). Lack of tumor tissues in the combination treatment group prevented us from doing tumor tissue based analysis in this experiment. There was a significant decrease in the number of neutrophils in PLF of animals treated with the combination treatment, suggesting a contribution of inflammation in the process. BioPlex cytokine analysis performed on PLF showed a significant decrease in VEGF, IL-8, FGF2 and MCP1 in cisplatin alone and the combination group, as compared to the saline or Anakinra alone groups. VEGF, IL-8 and FGF2 are related to the process of angiogenesis and are directly or indirectly related to inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x003b2; release. IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-18 and IL-6 assessment in PLF also showed a decreasing trend but did not reach significance. Increased IL-1&#x003b2; levels observed in PLF in response to combination therapy could in part be due to increased IL-1ra in response to Anakinra as previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] thereby resulting in reduced IL-1&#x003b2; function but increased unbound IL-1&#x003b2; levels. There may be more reasons for this that deserves further attention. We have previously reported attenuated levels of MCP1 and VEGF by Dox in PLF of MM tumor bearing SCID mice, however, IL-6 and IL-8 levels were significantly increased [<xref rid="pone.0145404.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This study has limitation of using immunocompromised mice as we don&#x02019;t know the contribution of adaptive immune cells in the process of inflammasome activation or IL-1&#x003b2; release in response to chemotherapeutic drugs. To resolve this, further studies are in progress using allograft mouse models that will also educate us about the effect of host response in chemotherapy. These are very encouraging data suggesting that manipulation of inflammasome may work to control MM tumor growth by regulating various aspects of tumorigenesis. Currently we are in the course of studying this process in detail, with a lower (single) dose of cisplatin alone and in combination with pemetrexed, and with a larger number of animals /group, so as to understand the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Taken together our study is first to suggest that chemotherapeutic drugs can activate NLRP3 inflammasomes in MM tumors resulting in caspase activation and increased cell death. Activation of the inflammasome is also accompanied by increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, a combination of chemotherapeutic drugs and IL-1R antagonist could be a possible strategy for inhibiting MM tumor growth. Our report is a very small first step in this direction and detailed <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with various models, chemotherapeutic drugs and tools to antagonize IL-1&#x003b2; are required to confirm the findings of this study and are presently in process.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the help from the UVMCC DNA Analysis Facility for qRT-PCR.
