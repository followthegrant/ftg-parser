Its capacity to adapt and survive in the human stomach can be attributed to its genetic flexibility. Its natural competence and its capacity to turn genes on and off allows <italic>H. pylori</italic> to adapt rapidly to the changing conditions of its host. Because of its genetic variability, it is difficult to establish the uniqueness of each strain obtained from a human host. The methods considered to-date to deliver the best result for differentiation of strains are Rapid Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis. While RAPD analysis is cost-effective, it requires a stable genome for its reliability. MLST and WGS are optimal for strain identification, however, they require analysis of data at the bioinformatics level. Using the StainFree method, which modifies tryptophan residues on proteins using 2, 2, 2, - trichloroethanol (TCE), we observed a strain specific pattern of tryptophan in 1D acrylamide gels. In order to establish the effectiveness of tryptophan fingerprinting for strain identification, we compared the graphic analysis of tryptophan-labelled bands in the gel images with MLST results. Based on this, we find that tryptophan banding patterns can be used as an alternative method for the differentiation of <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains. Furthermore, investigating the origin for these differences, we found that <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains alters the number and/or position of tryptophan present in several proteins at the genetic code level, with most exchanges taking place in membrane- and cation-binding proteins, which could be part of a novel response of <italic>H. pylori</italic> to host adaptation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100006071</institution-id><institution>University of the Andes | Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de los Andes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Proyecto Semilla 2017-10</award-id><award-id>Proyecto Semilla 2017-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rojas-Rengifo</surname><given-names>Diana F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaramillo</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2"><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is a Gram (&#x02212;) bacterium colonizing the human stomach. It has been estimated that around 50% of the human population are colonized by <italic>H. pylori</italic>, most of them during childhood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Several studies have confirmed the evolution of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and its genetic changes in relation with time has been attributed to its capacity to incorporate external genetic material into their DNA. For research studies as well as for diagnosis, the identity of a bacterial strain relies on its DNA stability. Based on this premise, one of the preferred methods for comparison of strains and their identity is the RAPD (Rapid Amplification of Polymorphic DNA). This technique uses a short DNA primer containing a sequence that is able to anneal to several regions of the DNA amplifying fragments variable in size and creating a pattern of fragments after their separation in a gel. This method is relatively easy to establish in a molecular analysis laboratory, assuming that PCR is part of the routine work. However, since RAPD is based on DNA stability between strains, <italic>H. pylori</italic> poses here a challenge. The capacity of <italic>H. pylor</italic>i to acquire and randomly incorporate DNA into its own genome (natural transformation competence) makes RAPD test results somehow unreliable for this bacterium. At the moment, there are two methods recognized to distinguish <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains from each other: Multi-locus Sequence Typing (MLST), which relies in the stability of seven highly conserved genes in the genome of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). For MLST fragments ranging from 400 to 600&#x02009;bp each of seven genes (<italic>atpA</italic>, <italic>efp</italic>, <italic>mutY</italic>, <italic>ppa</italic>, <italic>trpC</italic>, <italic>ureI</italic> and <italic>yph)</italic>, are amplified and their products are sequenced. The results are then used to confirm the uniqueness of the isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This method, although highly accurate, implies higher costs than the detection of DNA fragments and their patterns as in RAPD. In the case of WGS, even though the advancement of sequencing technologies has reduced the costs for whole genome sequencing to hundreds of dollars per genome, the results require extensive and specialized bioinformatic analysis, not always available or suitable for all purposes. Tryptophan is the biggest amino acid existing, and with methionine, they are the only two amino acids encoded by only one codon (UGG and AUG, respectively). Tryptophan is considered an essential amino acid and its indole group makes it an aromatic amino acid with paramagnetic characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and confers proteins a fluorescence at 280&#x02009;nm wavelength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Ladner <italic>et al</italic>. adapted the use of 2, 2, 2 trichloroethanol (TCE) to stain proteins in polyacrylamide gels making all proteins containing tryptophan residues visible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, by adding chloride to the indole ring, which changes the excitation wavelength of tryptophan to 305&#x02009;nm with an emission at around 500&#x02009;nm. When visualizing full protein lysates from <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains with this method, each strain presents a distinguishable pattern of proteins containing tryptophan. The analysis of each strain&#x02019;s pattern (or tryptophan fingerprint, TryF) was compared with MLST data, showing TCE staining of proteins (StainFree method) as a reliable alternative method for the differentiation of <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains, with lower costs and faster results than the currently available ones.</p><p id="Par3">Protein separation in 1D acrylamide gel is governed by different protein characteristics, like their size, posttranslational modifications and conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The detection of proteins using tryptophan, is not only dependent on the number amount of tryptophan residues present in a protein&#x02019;s primary structure, but as well on the protein expression levels. Tryptophan is usually encoded by only one codon (UGG). However, yeast mitochondria and <italic>Mycoplasma capricolum</italic> have adapted the stop codon UGA to code for tryptophan instead<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

We had seen differences in tryptophan patterns for standard strains previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and here decided to compare RAPD and tryptophan patterns from six <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains isolated from three patients (two per patient). In different strain pairs, different results can be observed. For example, RAPD results for strains from patient 49 show both strains as being identical, which is confirmed with the presence of identical tryptophan pattern (Tryptophan Fingerprinting (TryF) for the same strains) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). However, strains with identical RAPD can show differences in TryF, as it was seen with strains from patient 101 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). As expected, differences between strains were as well established by both methods (RAPD and TryF) as it was the case for strains from patient 230 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Cases for which RAPD showed differences between strains and TryF showed them to be identical were not observed in any of the 43 patient&#x02019;s strains analyzed.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>RAPD and Tryptophan Fingerprinting (TryF). Two <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains isolated from patients 49 (<bold>A</bold>), 101 (<bold>B</bold>) and 230 (<bold>C</bold>) were analyzed using RAPD (DNA analysis) and StainFree (Tryptophan in proteins). For comparison of signals, original images were cropped and fitted for better graphic display.

Since MLST is considered more reliable for differentiation of strains in <italic>H. pylori</italic>, we decided to compare the TryF data with this method. For a better analysis and comparison with MLST data, we designed a tool for the detection of bands and its analysis using dendrograms to establish similarities between strains (Ruiz and Ulloa-Guerrero, <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript in preparation). Since any pattern comparison in 1D-gels can be only attempted if most external variables are reduced, all samples were standardized (see below) and all samples compared were loaded in the same gel. During detection of tryptophan in proteins, signals are dependent on the amount of protein contained in the sample and the number of tryptophan residues present in each protein. In our analysis, band presence and intensity were considered. Therefore, to avoid false detections, all protein lysates are standardized to equal amount of colony forming units (cfu) per sample (see Materials and Methods). Tryptophan was detected in the acrylamide gel after electrophoresis and analyzed using the 1D-GelPhyBase software (see Material and Methods for details). This software produced the corresponding dendrogram (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>) showing similarities and dissimilarities in strains. As standard strains we used 26695, P12 and Tx30a. As expected, all three standard strains are recognized as independent strains with different relative distances between each other. Tx30a clustered separately from strains P12 and 26695. Even though P12 and 26695 belong to the same cluster, they are sister groups that have variations in the tryptophan pattern generating a slight difference in the relative distances of the branch lengths (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). When comparing the patient strains, only strains from patient 49 (49A44 and 49A33) seem to be closely related. However, strains from two different patients (139A39 and 163A4), which are expected to be independent strains, showed as well high similarity in this analysis. To confirm the uniqueness of all other strains, the MLST data from each strain was analyzed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) and showed that strains from patient 112 (112&#x02009;A2 and 112A5), 49(49A33 and 49A4), 101 (101A27, 101A35), 98 (98A14 and 98C6) and 163 (163&#x02009;A15 and 163A4) are the most similar, while all other ones are different enough to be potentially unique strains. To clarify the identity of the patient strains, we performed genotyping using <italic>cagA</italic>, <italic>vacA</italic> and <italic>hopQ</italic> genes and immunological tests for phenotyping by identifying the production of CagA, VacA and OipA. For <italic>cagA</italic> gene we amplified the region encoding the EPIYA motif at the 3&#x02032;-half of the gene. Although <italic>vacA</italic> is present in all strains, it differs between strains in two regions: region s (5&#x02032;-region) and region m (middle region)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. <italic>hopQ</italic> gene is known to have two distinct alleles (Allele I and Allele II) that show some correlation with <italic>cagA</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The existence of <italic>cagA</italic> and <italic>vacA</italic> genes are better evaluated through detection of protein production. Therefore, this data has been complemented with immunodetection of CagA and VacA. In the case of OipA, an Outer Membrane Protein, it is known to be turned on and off by <italic>H. pylori</italic> through slipped-strand mispairing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Its relevance in infection requires detection of the protein for a correct typing of the strain. With genotype and phenotype data (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) the differences in strain classification between TryF and MLST are clear: In case of the MLST analysis, only strains from patients 49 and 112 show identical phenotypes and genotypes in the genes tested. However, in the case of patient 101, one of the strains contains the gene for CagA but it does not express it; for patient 98, only strain 98A14 expresses enough VacA that was detectable in our assay; and for patient 163 both strains are only similar in the allele type of <italic>hopQ</italic> (allele II). These differences between strains also explain the differences between the dendrograms of TryF and MLST. While the MLST dendrogram graphs the phylogenetic distance of single strains (with Tx30a being the most distant), the TryF method detects differences in protein production, which creates a different kind of distance measure, more related to phyloproteomics.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Data analysis from Tryptophan Fingerprinting (TryF) and MLST.

To define the relevance of genomic changes in tryptophan composition between different strains in <italic>H. pylori</italic>, two reference strains (P12 and 26695) were used to compare the changes on Tryptophan (Trp, W) in their homologous proteins. These strains showed differences experimentally in their tryptophan banding pattern of full lysates experimentally analyzed on gels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>).

Looking in detail the tryptophan exchanges between P12 and 26695, most of the changes occurred by exchanges between tryptophan and leucine (W/L, 41 cases (44%)), followed by glycine (W/G, 8 cases (8%)), deletions (6 (6%) and insertions (5 (5%)).

Reliable methods like MLST and WGS come with higher cost and require time for its analysis. And even the interpretation of MLST data for the identification of identical strains is difficult with <italic>H. pylori</italic>. It has been documented that the high genetic variability of <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains in the host across time makes the certain genotyping of a strain challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. On the other hand, Tryptophan fingerprinting (TryF) was able to expose changes in bacteria that are only present at the protein level and not necessarily visible in the genomic analysis, allowing a quick and reliable identification of candidate identical strains. The TryF analysis should not be considered an absolute way to define the identity of a strain; however, it offers a quick and low-cost method to screen a high number of samples compared with the methods available and limit the amount of samples to sequence if necessary. While MLST and WGS can take up from one to several weeks for a final result, TryF can be performed in one day including the analysis with our developed software, making it the best method for first screening of strain identity. This is possible because of the differences that <italic>H. pylori</italic> presents in tryptophan usage in its strains.</p><p id="Par16">To alter the number of tryptophan present in a protein, the bacterium must do any of the following: i) change its DNA to eliminate/add or alter a codon to match a UGG codon, ii) adapt or modify the Aminoacylsynthetase for the tRNA<sub>Trp</sub>, iii) modify its tRNA to recognize other codons, or iv) use the stop codon UGA as alternative codon for tryptophan (reviewed in Ling J <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>). Additionally to genome changes, other causes for differences in tryptophan patterns observed in the protein gels include changes in proteins expression or their glycosylation. We opted to analyze the changes on genetic code and found that in the two reference strains (P12 and 26695) the changes observed in the protein gels can have a genetic background. Moreover, the changes here discovered showed that leucine codons (CCU, CUC, CUA, CUG, UUA, UUG) where preferential for changes to tryptophan (UGG). When compared to <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> strains (a close related bacteria species from the epsilon-proteobacteria group), we found that <italic>H. pylori</italic> is three times more likely to exchange their tryptophan content between these strains. In general <italic>H. pylori</italic> has a higher variation of amino acid residues between homologous genes than the analyzed <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strain. This could be explained by the genetic flexibility of <italic>H. pylori</italic> as response to host interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">Tryptophan (Trp, W) is one of two amino acids coded by only one codon.

Additionally, as with all other aromatic amino acids (Tyrosine (Y), Phenylalanine (F)), tryptophan plays an important role in &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; and cation-&#x003c0; interactions involved in secondary, tertiary and quaternary conformation of proteins and their interactions with cations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The fact that most of changes occurred in proteins with membrane interactions and cation-binding domains, support the hypothesis that tryptophan changes in <italic>H. pylori</italic> may play an important role in the adaptation of proteins to the needs of each strain. Since tryptophan is known to alter the association of proteins with membranes, it was a surprise to discover that most of the exchanges in membrane associated proteins did not take place in the transmembrane regions, but within regions rich in hydrophobic amino acids. Therefore, we presume that these changes might have a functional target. Several options have been described. Relevance for dimerization of the proteins was described for the TssL protein, part of the inner membrane components of the Type VI secretion system, through tryptophan &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Other possibilities include conformational switches with tryptophan residues, as it was shown in the gp120 of HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, or to alter the activity of the protein or its recycling through oxidation of tryptophan residues as cue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Although we do not yet know the specific cause for changes of tryptophan in proteins by <italic>H. pylori</italic>, we can use it to distinguish strains in a specific way and we open the possibility that this phenomenon could be used by other bacterial species.

This program adjusts the image saturation and contrast and obtains the complementary image by implemented image processing functions. Subsequently, a rectangle is drawn on each lane for which bands are to be detected. For each rectangle, a band pattern image is generated and is converted from its image format a double type variable of intensity values. Changes in intensity along the lane were used to detect the location of bands. (Supplement Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

The locations of the bands are defined as local maxima of the intensity profile using a threshold of 0.012 as the peak prominence to measure the change in intensity compared to neighboring regions. Data for each lane is stored in a matrix in which binary values are assigned; 1 for band presence, 0 for band absence. The result is a matrix profile of the location of bands in every lane. An admissible error parameter is defined to consider the magnitude of the distance that the homologous bands in different lanes could be apart.
