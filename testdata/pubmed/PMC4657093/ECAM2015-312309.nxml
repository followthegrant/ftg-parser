Background</title><p>Periarthritis of shoulder (PAS), or, namely, the frozen shoulder, is a common, disabling musculoskeletal disorder in middle-aged people. It commonly refers to a collection of pain symptoms in shoulders, plus motor function limitation, due to soft tissue abnormalities surrounding the affected shoulder [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is mostly a aseptic inflammation of the musculoskeletal system. The PAS is prevailing in people of the age 40 to 60 years, and thus they were called &#x0201c;the forty's shoulder.&#x0201d; The population incidence of PAS is 2%&#x02013;5% in the United States [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In China, the PAS in urban population accounts for 8% and three quarters are female patients [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Studies also demonstrated that inadequate treatment or inappropriate treatment led to severely reduced life quality and unsatisfactory work performance [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Nowadays, there are many treatment options for PAS, including intra-articular triamcinolone injection [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and bupivacaine suprascapular nerve blocks [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These modern therapies are successfully employed in clinical practice for PAS treatment. However, the treatment effects are not always long-lasting and most of which disappear in 4 weeks after treatment approximately [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, these treatment options may be associated with severe adverse events, such as infectious arthritis and cartilage damage, all of which may put the patient into certain risks of disease deterioration [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, to search for novel treatment modality is of great significance for the management of PAS.</p><p>In China, acupuncture is an effective traditional therapeutics that is originated in ancient China. During its over 3000 years of history of clinical practice, acupuncture treatment gets developed and evolved to treat various disorders. In recent decades, acupuncture as a complementary and alternative therapy has been increasingly recognized in western countries. Current evidence suggests that acupuncture is a valid intervention for treating pain [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and musculoskeletal disorders [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There are also studies revealing that acupuncture triggers the endogenous opium and cannabinoids system to release several pain-ameliorating substances to reduce pain [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, many PAS patients resorted to acupuncture therapy in China and other foreign countries. Though studies reported that acupuncture is effective for PAS, the strength of evidence and its recommendation is still weak. According to a recent Cochrane systematic review, the effect of acupuncture for shoulder pain and its function improvement is still inconclusive. Current little evidence is unable to affirm or refute the effectiveness of acupuncture for PAS. It is of great importance to conduct a clinical trial with rigorous methodology to assess acupuncture's effect.</p><p>Importantly, acupuncture is a complex of different needling therapies. Different acupuncture modalities or equipment may possess different treatment powers. The<italic> Feng Gou Zhen</italic> (sharp-hook needle) is a modified form of ancient nine needles as recorded in the Yellow Emperor's Internal Medicinal Cannon (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The modification of this form of needle is initiated by Dr.<italic> Huaitang Shi</italic> who was a renowned acupuncturist in China, as well as the First Director of the Research Center of Acupuncture in Shanxi. The design of the<italic> Feng Gou Zhen</italic> is based on the three-edge sharp needle of ancient nine needles and the adding of certain features of the hook needle in folks. By integrating their characteristics, we invented the<italic> Feng Gou Zhen</italic> device. Our clinical observation indicates that the<italic> Feng Gou Zhen</italic> is very effective for treating lots of diseases, and PAS is just one of them. In our practice, we found that one session or two sessions of sharp-hook acupuncture treatment relieve the pain of PAS and recovers the function of shoulder joint. But, at present there is still no randomized controlled trial evaluating the effective of sharp-hook acupuncture for PAS. We therefore performed this one-center, randomized controlled, open-labeled trial to assess the effect of acupuncture as add-on for pain relief and joint function improvement in PAS.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

</p><p>To be noted, &#x0201c;A-Shi point&#x0201d; refers to the most representative point of PAS symptoms, mostly pain, on certain body surface, where it hurts the most when pressed on with finger(s)/treatment equipment. Therefore, no fixed location of A-Shi point can be defined. Mostly, its identification is depending on the location of disease, the place where the organ was affected and where tissue was harmed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.2"><title>2.3.2.

Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the pain relief of shoulder as measured by Visual Analogue Scale at 1 week after treatment. The secondary outcomes included (1) the function of shoulder joint as measured by the physical examination score for shoulder and (2) McGill pain questionnaire. All outcome measurements were assessed at 0 week, 1 week, and 4 weeks and were collected by an individual researcher in clinics or by telephone interview. The safety issue of sharp-hook acupuncture for patients with periarthritis of shoulder was assessed by any related adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Sample Size</title><p>Sample size was calculated by a G<sup><italic>&#x02217;</italic></sup>Power 3 software (Institute for Experimental Psychology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Germany).

In the random number sequence, number &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; represents acupuncture group, while number &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; stands for the control group. Each random number was carefully concealed by the clinical researcher in an sequentially numbered opaque envelope which was not permitted for acupuncturist to unfold until eligible patients were included in this trial with written informed consent. After a patient was enrolled in the trial by the clinical trial communicator, the clinician would open one of the opaque envelopes according to his/her inclusion order and then further assign the patient to either acupuncture or control group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>2.7. Blinding</title><p>As an open-labeled clinical trial, the patients and clinicians would not be blinded in the whole treatment process. Patients in each group knew which treatment approach they would receive; they were required to cooperate with their physicians or therapists prior to treatment. The assessment of clinical effectiveness was performed through telephone interview by a clinical assessor who was masked to the treatment assignment. While in data collection and analysis stage, the clinical researcher, assessor, and statistician were, respectively, separated from each other.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8"><title>2.8. Statistical Methods</title><p>All main analyses (with SPSS 16.0) were based on the intention-to-treat population which automatically imputed the missing data according to the last visit data. Additionally, a per protocol analysis was done including only patients with no major protocol violations by the end of 4 weeks after randomization. The demographic, clinical, and outcome variables at baseline were described by using means and standard deviations for continuous variables. Two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test analysis of variance was used to compare baseline data and difference between groups.

Results</title><p>156 patients were enrolled in this study, but only 132 eligible ones were included to received treatment. 24 patients were excluded due to various reasons. For the included patients, 120 completed the trial (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Six patients in acupuncture group discontinued the study due to unsatisfaction, traffic problem; 6 patients in control group abandoned the treatment due to reasons that are unclear. Due to the very short follow-up period, all patients returned follow-up data. In data analysis, 59 patients in acupuncture group and 58 patients in control group were included in ITT analysis.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. Baseline Data</title><p>The demographic information and baseline comparison between groups were shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. There was no significant difference in age, gender, and disease history between groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Moreover, the pain intensity no matter measured by VAS or McGill pain questionnaire and the shoulder joint function score measured by general physical examination were not significant between acupuncture group and control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. Outcomes and Estimation</title><p>The pain intensity and joint function score at 1 week and 4 weeks after randomization were listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. The result showed that both acupuncture and conventional analgesics significantly reduced pain intensity of PAS measured by VAS as compared with their respective baseline condition (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The comparison between two groups showed that, at 1 week after randomization, the pain intensity measured by VAS in acupuncture groups showed more significant reduction than control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Pain intensity measured by McGill pain questionnaire showed similar significant reduction in both groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). At 1 week after randomization, acupuncture significantly reduced pain intensity measured by McGill pain questionnaire compared with control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Moreover, the function of shoulder joint was significantly improvement in both groups as compared with baseline (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The comparison between acupuncture group and control group showed that shoulder joint function was significantly improvement in sharp-hook acupuncture group as compared with control group at 1 week after randomization.</p><p>However, in the 4-week follow-up, the pain intensity and shoulder joint function of patients in control group relapsed but still with statistical difference as compared with baseline. As to acupuncture group, the pain intensity and shoulder joint function were significantly improved as compared with baseline and 1 week follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), suggesting that the treatment effect lasted from the 1 week to the 4 weeks after randomization. Furthermore, there were more significant reductions in pain intensity and shoulder joint function for acupuncture group at 4 weeks after randomization, as compared with control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The changes in pain intensity as measured by VAS or McGill pain questionnaire and the shoulder joint function score were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.

Discussions</title><p>The periarthritis of shoulder is a prevailing musculoskeletal disorder which commonly pathologically encompasses aseptic inflammation and soft tissue adherence in shoulder joint. Though not a fetal disorder or major disease like cancer, angina pectoris, stroke, and so forth, the PAS seriously causes pain, leads to notable motor function limitation of the affected joint, and subsequently endangers people's life quality. Therefore, the treatment of PAS is of great significance to increase people's life quality and advance public health. However, conventional treatment of modern medicine cannot withdraw the symptoms and harmfulness of PAS completely and satisfactory, most of which are associated with adverse events and side effect. It is therefore of great importance to introduce some other therapeutics as complementary and alternatives to help boost the treatment effect and increase patient's compliance.</p><p>Acupuncture in China has been applied in PAS treatment for a long history. Now with culture communication and immigration, people in western world started to use acupuncture treating PAS in recent decades. However, the evidence base of the effectiveness of acupuncture for PAS is not firm. A recent systematic review suggested that the reasons for inclusive statements were due to the inadequacy in trial design and implementation [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, we used a prospectively defined trial protocol to evaluate the effect of a form of acupuncture for PAS. Due to the significant features of sharp-hook acupuncture, we were unable to perform certain blinding measures as suggested by standards of the Good Clinical Practice. We therefore employed the open-labeled design regardless of the placebo effect caused by unblinding. In the whole process, clinical practitioners, trial researchers, data collectors, and statisticians were independent of each other. The clinical practitioners and trial researchers had no access to clinical database and therefore the clinical data was unavailable to them. Moreover, the allocation information was completely masked for the assessors and statisticians. This step eliminates bias caused by researcher's preference and therefore ensures the internal validity of the results. On the other hand, this study demonstrated the application of an explanatory trial to assess the efficacy of the sharp-hook acupuncture for PAS. The patients were selected according to very rigorous criterion, which may increase the internal validity but decrease the external validity to some extent. The treatment form in experimental group and the acupuncture group included both acupuncture and conventional therapy, which is a mimic of the real work practice situation. Therefore, this design to some extent increased the external validity of the study. Future pragmatic trials in a real world environment are warranted for they can add more valuable findings.</p><p>This randomized controlled trial demonstrated that sharp-hook acupuncture therapy as an add-on boosted the analgesic effect of conventional nerve block and significantly increased patients' shoulder joint function. The difference in treatment effect observed in 4 weeks between acupuncture and control group may reflect the strength and importance of sharp-hook acupuncture. The result of this study is consistent with a previous study reporting that acupuncture plus shoulder exercise experienced significant improvement after treatment compared with exercise only [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In their study, they observed that the effect of acupuncture added to exercise sustained from 6 weeks after randomization to 20 weeks, suggesting a long-term effect of acupuncture. In our study, the focus is on the instant analgesic effect. We found that sharp-hook acupuncture led to significant reduction in pain and improvement in shoulder function. The 4-week follow-up indicates that the effect of sharp-hook acupuncture increases as the time passes. This response is consistent with the aforementioned study about the relative persistent effect of acupuncture. In addition, several other studies and reviews also confirmed our result [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, the superiority of sharp-hook acupuncture over nerve block by acupoint injection with conventional analgesics is not odd. The PAS is a disease not only with aseptic inflammation but also with severe soft tissue deformations [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Imaging studies suggested that there were significant pathological deformations in the local area of the affected shoulder of PAS patient [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These pathological manifestations include capsulitis of the shoulder, trigger point [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or pressing pain point, tensions, rigid muscle, or even nodes. In traditional Chinese medicine, this pathological presence was regarded as a convergence of unsmooth Qi and blood, blood stasis, and hot or cold phlegm. These pathological factors blocked the meridians and channels to cause pain and limited joint function. In modern medicine, the treatment emphasizes mostly emphasized local nerve block to stop pain with ignorance of the pathological presences, which may contribute to the relapse of pain and function limitation as observed in control group. While this trial applied three acupoints of the three Yang meridians of hand (namely, three acupoints for shoulders), accompanied with an extra-point Jianqian and the local A-Shi point to dredge the meridian, activate Qi and blood to remove pain. Moreover, the sharp-hook acupuncture needle is very unique in shape which enables it to be very convenient to remove or intersect the soft tissue adherence. In clinical practice, the sharp-hook acupuncture needle was used to deprive the functional soft tissue from adhering tissue, then to dissect the pathological scar within the affect joint and intersect the connections of the pathological nodes, according to blunt dissection and sharp dissection. The location of soft tissue and function of shoulder joint were restored by this procedure [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is speculated that the dissection of these pathological presences by sharp-hook acupuncture needles is essential to the sustainable effect of sharp-hook acupuncture observed in the acupuncture group as compared with control group.</p><p>Safety is a very important issue for no matter novel therapy or traditional treatments. Actually, we have assessed the safety of sharp-hook needle. It is assessed by the adverse events reported by patients and doctors. We have a specific section in our case report form called &#x0201c;adverse events,&#x0201d; in which any adverse events including bleeding, hematoma, dizziness, faint, and nausea would be recorded if developed. This helps us to address the safety issue. However, there is no adverse events reported in our patients. It is true that the three-edge hook is thick and long in some cases. But the fact is that all our treatments were performed on the basis of local anesthesia by acupoint injection of 2% lidocaine. In addition, all practitioners are very experienced clinical doctors. Their clinical skills and communication ability are critical in this study. These are the reasons why the patients safety was guaranteed and their rights were respected. Thus, the sharp-hook needle is safe for PAS patients when handled with appropriateness.</p><p>Besides, the sharp-hook acupuncture needle invented by our team can also be used to perform blood-letting therapy by puncturing meridians. It is made of stainless metal, with a 14&#x02009;cm needle body. The tip and the body of the needle forms a 110&#x000b0; angle. The needle tip is a three-edge hook with a length of 3&#x02009;mm approximately, which makes it very subtle and easy for blood-letting and adherence dissection. It overcomes the limitations in superficial insertion and thus can be used to solve problems in deep tissue [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this trial, acupuncture group also involved blood-letting and therefore may regulate blood circulation and the levels of proinflammatory, inflammatory, and anti-inflammatory factors to further improve PAS symptoms. For these reasons mentioned above, we therefore can rule out the possibility that the difference between groups was solely generated by the placebo effect.</p><p>Taken together, this study demonstrated that the<italic> Feng Gou Zhen</italic>, the sharp-hook acupuncture needle helps us to relieve pain and restore shoulder function for patients with periarthritis of shoulder. The present trial added good evidence to support the use of the<italic> Feng Gou Zhen</italic> as add-on to conventional nerve block for the treatment of periarthritis of shoulder.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was financially supported by funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, Grant no. 2013BAI05B08, and funding from the Department of Science and Technology of Shanxi Province, Grant no. 20100311084.</p></ack><sec sec-type="conflict"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The authors declared no conflict of interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contribution</title><p>Laixi Ji conceived the trial.
