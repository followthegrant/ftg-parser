Many of these patients will undergo surgery, after which there is a high risk of postoperative complications and significant decline in physical function. A systematic review of exercise for people with cancer by Stevinson <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> found some evidence that those who exercised had better physical function compared with those who did not exercise, but there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate improvement in quality of life. In addition, they were not able to determine which type of exercise intervention was best or if any had long-term benefit. A more recent Cochrane review of exercise for people with cancer by Mishra <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> found that exercise initiated after completion of active cancer treatment (ie, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or hormone therapy) has a beneficial effect on health-related quality of life, although no parallel improvement in self-reported physical function was found. The exercise interventions included in this review varied greatly and included strength training, yoga, walking, cycling, tai chi and qi gong. However, due to the small number of studies available, these authors were not able to evaluate the effect of different modes and intensities of exercise. Furthermore, studies of exercise in the preoperative and early postoperative stages were not included in the review. Therefore, it is not known whether exercise, when commenced before the end of active cancer treatment, would have additional benefit on physical function for those undergoing surgery.</p><p>While there is growing evidence on the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise, resistance exercise training has received much less attention.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref> It is thought that resistance exercise training could act to aid recovery of muscle function.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It has long been established that resistance exercise training is effective in stimulating muscle anabolic processes and increasing muscle strength.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It may even counteract some of the metabolic pathophysiology associated with cachexia.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Furthermore, it can be performed with very little equipment and space and while patients are bed-bound in hospital or at home. Although there have been previous systematic reviews of the effects of exercise training, there have not been any that have specifically focused on resistance training.</p><p>Previous reviews, relating to exercise training for patients with cancer, have mostly focused on specific outcomes such as fatigue and quality of life,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> and most have centred on specific types of cancer.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;17</xref> Galv&#x000e3;o and Newton<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x0feff; published a review of exercise intervention studies for all cancers and a meta-analysis of exercise training interventions. However, their review included a heterogeneous group of studies including some that were not randomised or had no control group. Quality systematic reviews require critical appraisal of the quality of the reviewed studies and share accurate descriptions of the design, delivery and interpretation of what was done in the study. In some instances detailed description of these aspects is not available.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p><p>One of the main challenges in studying the effects of a resistance exercise programme on physical function in cancer surgery patients is in identifying an appropriate outcome measure. The review by Mishra and colleagues found no significant improvement in physical function as evaluated using self-report questionnaires, but they did not measure any index of physical performance.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Therefore, our aim was to undertake a systematic review of the literature on interventional studies investigating the effects of preoperative and postoperative resistance exercise training on recovery of physical function in patients undergoing abdominal surgery for cancer. The findings will provide clinicians and investigators a basis to choose exercise interventions for use in clinical practice or for future research.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines on systematic reviews were followed for this review.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

The participants in the preoperative study were aged 10&#x02013;15 years older than those in the postoperative study. In terms of gender, a higher proportion of men participated in both studies.</p><p>The preoperative intervention of Dronkers <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> included a twice-weekly supervised exercise programme and a home-based programme of walking or cycling for a minimum of 30 min per day for 2&#x02013;4 weeks before admission for surgery. In addition to a single set of resistance strengthening exercises of the leg (8&#x02013;15 repetitions at 60%&#x02013;80% of the one repetition maximum), the programme included inspiratory muscle training, aerobic training at 55%&#x02013;75% max heart rate (HR) or perceived exertion of 11&#x02013;13 Borg Scale for 20&#x02013;30 min, and functional activities. A full description of the resistance exercise was not published. Three of the intervention groups (13.6%) did not complete the study with their data analysed as intention to treat.</p><p>The postoperative intervention of Ahn <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> comprised a twice-daily 15 min supervised exercise programme performed by the participant until discharge from hospital (mean 8.87&#x000b1;2.28 days). In addition to resistance strengthening exercises of the chest, shoulder, arm, thigh and calf leg, the programme included stretching exercises for the neck, shoulder, wrist, ankle and pelvis, core trunk exercises and ambulation. In terms of the strengthening exercises, resistance was applied manually by the therapist initially and then using 1 lb free weights. During phase 2, one set of 10 repetitions was performed, and in phase 3, three sets of 12 repetitions were performed. Because these studies used different outcome measures, it was not possible to pool the data in order to analyse mean changes in physical function outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Risk of bias of included studies</title><p>The methodological quality of the two included studies was rated as moderate according to the GRADE criteria, that is, randomised studies with unclear bias or well-designed observational studies with large, consistent and precise estimates of the magnitude of an intervention effect. Difficulty in blinding trial participants and therapists to the intervention meant studies were not rated as high. Both studies scored 8 out of 11 on the PEDro scale. Block randomisation using prepared envelopes, stratified by age (60&#x02013;70 and &#x0003e;70) by someone independent of the study, was used in the preoperative study. Randomisation, at a 1-to-1 ratio, into study groups via minimisation to balance prognostic factors between groups (age and gender) was used in the postoperative study. In the preoperative study the gender distribution was similar in the control and intervention groups; however, in the postoperative study, twice as many men were randomised to the exercise group than the control group despite the minimisation procedures to balance gender between groups. In relation to the description of the intervention, some information was lacking in terms of equipment and methodology with regard to the aerobic and functional activity components of the preoperative intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Effect of strengthening exercise</title><sec id="s3d1"><title>Preoperative muscle strengthening</title><p>The mean difference and upper and lower 95% CI between the control and intervention group in the study by Dronkers <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> are shown in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>.

Two studies were included, which represented 73 patients (48 men and 25 women) undergoing abdominal surgery for cancer. One exercise programme was undertaken preoperatively and the other postoperatively until discharge from hospital. This represents insufficient evidence to determine whether this type of preoperative or postoperative resistance muscle-strengthening exercise programme improves or negatively affects functional outcomes in patients undergoing abdominal surgery for cancer.</p><p>The study by Dronkers <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> which investigated a preoperative exercise programme, was statistically underpowered with the exception of the functional measure derived from the quality of life scale. The programme included resistance strengthening of the lower limb muscle extensors and was performed for a mean of five sessions. This may not be sufficient to provide an adequate training stimulus to significantly increase muscle strength. Indeed, guidelines published by the American College of Sports Medicine recommend resistance exercise 2&#x02013;3 times per week with 2&#x02013;4 sets of 10&#x02013;15 repetitions to improve strength in middle-aged and older persons.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</p><p>In contrast, the study by Ahn <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> investigated a postoperative exercise programme, but this was also statistically underpowered and provides inconclusive evidence in support of the intervention and the use of particular outcome measures. The intervention was different from that of Dronkers <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> in that it used a progressive resistance programme involving the upper and lower limbs, together with stretching, functional balance strengthening and walking. Also, isometric strengthening exercises were commenced early postoperatively while the patient was still in bed and then progressed to &#x02018;resistance-through-range&#x02019; strengthening as well as balance strengthening exercises, until discharge from hospital. The mean hospital length of stay, for the study of Dronkers <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> was 7 days for the control group, and in the exercise group it was 8 days. Similarly, for the study by Ahn <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> it was 8 days of exercise, and it is likely that this will not provide an adequate training stimulus to significantly increase muscle strength and function.</p><p>There are some limitations to our review. We limited our inclusion by study design, only including randomised or quasi-randomised studies where there was a clear resistance muscle strengthening component as part of an exercise programme. It is possible that other studies have included muscle-strengthening exercises or functional exercises that will have an effect on muscle strength that have not been included in this review due to our inclusion criteria, and we advocate the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template guidelines for reporting exercise intervention studies.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The two studies included in the review recruited almost twice as many men as women, and the results may not reflect the general population. Future studies should focus on detailed descriptions of the exercise intervention, consistent outcome measures and longer intervention and follow-up times.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p><p>Our systematic review suggests that the use of resistance exercise interventions for recovery of physical function in patients undergoing abdominal surgery for cancer must be considered with caution. The small number of included underpowered studies and the inability to pool the results due to the heterogeneity of outcome measures mean that there is a lack of evidence for or against the use of this type of resistance muscle-strengthening exercise programmes to improve functional outcomes in these patients. While the studies give encouraging preliminary evidence that muscle-strengthening programmes may be feasible for abdominal cancer surgery patients, further large-scale, well-designed clinical trials are required to determine whether this type of exercise intervention is beneficial for this group of patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> DS, FH, KC performed the systematic review.
