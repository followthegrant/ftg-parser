One of the challenges in treating cryptococcosis is the development of resistance to azole antifungals. Previous studies linked azole resistance to elevated numbers of copies of critical resistance genes in aneuploid cells. However, how aneuploidy is formed in the presence of azole drugs remains unclear. This study showed that treatment with inhibitory concentrations of an azole drug, fluconazole (FLC), resulted in a significant population of cells with increased DNA content, through the following defects: inhibition of budding, premature mitosis, and inhibition of cytokinesis followed by replication in the mother cell. Inhibition of and/or a delay in cytokinesis led to the formation of cells with two or more daughter cells attached (multimeric cells). To investigate which part of cytokinesis fails in the presence of FLC, the dynamics of the actomyosin ring (AMR), septins, and Cts1, a protein involved in cell separation, were analyzed with time-lapse microscopy. Following the constriction of the AMR, septins assembled and the septum was formed between the mother and daughter cells. However, final degradation of the septum was affected. Enlarged cells with aberrant morphology, including multimeric cells, exhibited an increased potential to proliferate in the presence of FLC. These findings suggest that pleiotropic effects of FLC on growth and mitotic division lead to an increase in DNA content, resulting in cells less sensitive to the drug. Cells with increased DNA content continue to proliferate and therefore increase the chance of forming resistant populations.</p><p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> Azoles are antifungals that are widely utilized due to relatively low toxicity and cost of treatment.

For instance, development of aneuploidy is a common survival mechanism for cells under the selective pressure of adverse environmental conditions (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Aneuploidy is typical for malignant cells that strive to proliferate despite nutrient limitation and inhibitory effects of anticancer drugs (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Aneuploidy occurs frequently in pathogenic organisms that encounter harsh inhibitory conditions within the host and battle against therapeutic regimens; prominent examples include the protozoan <italic>Leishmania</italic>; an ascomycetous yeast, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>; and a basidiomycetous yeast, <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, the most common causal agent of fungal meningitis in AIDS and transplant patients (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). How can changes in chromosomal composition lead to improved survival? The key to this process is the selection favoring cells with elevated numbers of copies of specific genes that provide a growth advantage under particular inhibitory conditions. In most cases, retention of an entire additional chromosome or addition of an arm of a specific chromosome occurs in selected population of cells. Importantly, the environmental inhibitory effects not only select for organisms with specifically altered chromosomal composition but also often induce genomic changes by mechanisms that remain ill defined (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The resulting pool of cells with various karyotypes increases the chances of survival; individuals with beneficial chromosomal compositions are selectively favored under conditions of inhibitory pressure (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Prominent examples of fungal pathogens developing resistance to azole antifungal treatments are those observed with <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> and <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic>. The fungistatic azole drug fluconazole (FLC) targets lanosterol 14&#x003b1;-demethylase (Erg11), which is responsible for converting lanosterol to ergosterol in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Ergosterol is known to be an essential component for cell membrane permeability and fluidity, but the exact inhibitory consequences of ergosterol diminishment remain elusive (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Specific genes that confer resistance to FLC and thus determine the selection of a particular chromosomal configuration in <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> and <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> are well established (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). On the other hand, the mechanisms through which FLC potentially leads to changes in chromosomal composition in these human pathogens of significance remain poorly characterized. In a diploid yeast, <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic>, treatment with FLC leads to growth inhibition, premature nuclear and spindle cycles, and a failure in cytokinesis resulting in formation of multimeric cells (multimeras) containing tetraploid nuclei (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Tetraploid cells give raise to aneuploid populations; most of the fit individuals of those populations are selected under FLC inhibitory pressure, leading to FLC resistance (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The exact mechanism through which FLC inhibits cytokinesis in <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> remains unknown.</p><p>It is well established that the form of <italic>in vitro</italic> FLC-triggered drug resistance in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> called heteroresistance is a relatively rare occurrence and that its occurrence is based primarily on the formation of aneuploids (&#x0003c;1% of the FLC-treated population) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, the initial effects of FLC on the population of <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> have not been characterized and the mechanisms by which FLC triggers changes in chromosome number in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> remain unclear. Recent studies reveal several differences between <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> with respect to mitosis, which may suggest that the mechanism of FLC-dependent aneuploidy formation in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> may differ from previously described mechanisms in hemiascomycetous yeasts, including <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Here we investigated the mechanisms through which FLC affects ploidy in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic>. Our data suggest that exposure to inhibitory concentrations of FLC leads to a progressive diminishment of the ability to initiate budding and subsequent growth while permitting nuclear events. In addition, FLC inhibits cytokinesis, most likely by imposing a delay or a permanent block in the degradation of the primary septum. The resulting populations of cells with an increase in DNA content grow better in the presence of the inhibitory concentration of FLC, hypothetically increasing the chance of forming the aneuploids from which the most highly adapted cells are selected, giving rise to fully resistant populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s1.1"><title>FLC treatment results in an increase in DNA content in a significant fraction of cells.</title><p>At the concentration of FLC that is equal to the heteroresistance level, resistant colonies are aneuploids, initially with disomic chromosome 1 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). FLC could potentially act solely as a selection agent to allow growth of only a small fraction of the preexisting aneuploids that may be naturally present in a population. Alternatively, FLC may act as a driving force, stimulating the formation of aneuploids from which a small proportion is selected for proliferation in the presence of the inhibitory concentration of the drug, similarly to the recently proposed mechanism in <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> and as hypothesized in studies that involved <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). On the basis of the fact that <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> is predominantly haploid, development of aneuploidy could proceed through formation of diploid cells, in analogy to the aneuploid formation seen on the basis of a tetraploid intermediate described for <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). To test if FLC has an effect on DNA content of <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> during initial exposure to the drug, cells treated with FLC were fixed, stained with propidium iodide (PI), and examined using fluorescence flow cytometry. Strikingly, treatment of cells with 32&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml FLC at 24&#x000b0;C for 12 and 14&#x000a0;h resulted in levels of 20% and 88%, respectively, of the cell population with ploidy levels at or above 4N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The significant increase of the cell number with a ploidy level at or above 4N between 12 and 14&#x000a0;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>) was not consistent from experiment to experiment, as maximum ploidy was present in some cases at around 9&#x000a0;h, with no significant further change at later time points (data not shown). The longest incubation time tested was 18&#x000a0;h, with results that did not show a further significant increase in the ploidy level (data not shown). The maximum ploidy level in a significant population of cells observed under any of the test conditions was approximately 4N, although a smaller fraction of cells with ploidy levels beyond 4N was also present at inhibitory concentrations of FLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The fraction of cells with increased DNA content was proportional to the concentration of FLC. Taken together, these data suggest that FLC treatment at inhibitory concentrations leads to an increase in ploidy beyond 2N.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>FLC treatment results in an increase in ploidy in a significant fraction of cells. <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> cells treated with FLC were fixed, stained with propidium iodide (PI), and examined using fluorescence flow cytometry. Treatment of cells with 32&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml FLC at 24&#x000b0;C for 12 and 14&#x000a0;h resulted in ~20% and 88%, respectively, of the cell population showing ploidy levels at or above 4N, as indicated by the vertical line.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="sph0031722970001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s1.2"><title>Treatment with FLC causes inhibition of budding.</title><p>We tested whether FLC treatment resulted in any of the following cellular defects that might individually or collectively result in increased DNA content: (i) inhibition of growth coupled with rereplication; (ii) a defect in cytokinesis; (iii) unequal levels of chromosomal segregation during mitosis.</p><p>The inhibitory effect of FLC, similarly to that of other azole antifungals, has been associated with the depletion of ergosterol from the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The minimum level of ergosterol needed to sustain cellular growth is not clear. The <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> doubling time under unperturbed growth conditions in the laboratory is approximately 2&#x000a0;h (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, during the initial period of FLC treatment, we expect the growth of cells to be relatively normal, as the depletion of ergosterol from the membranes may take more than a doubling time. Consistent with this prediction, we found that treatment of cells with 32&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml FLC for 3&#x000a0;h resulted in a reduction of only ~20% in the level of new bud formation relative to the control results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). However, treatment for 6&#x000a0;h resulted in a more significant inhibition of budding (~50% reduction compared to the control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). These data suggest that the effect of FLC on growth is delayed, presumably due to the relatively low rate of exchange of ergosterol within the plasma membrane. If this were the case, we would expect that a further reduction in the exchange rate might lead to an even longer delay in the effect of FLC on bud initiation. Consistent with this possibility, the addition of actin depolymerizing agent latrunculin B (LatB) during the pretreatment of unbudded cells with FLC led to a further increase in the amount of time needed to significantly inhibit bud initiation; effective inhibition by FLC in combination with LatB was achieved by 14&#x000a0;h (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material). Cells treated with LatB for 18&#x000a0;h initiated budding when released into drug-free media, which indicated that prolonged exposure to LatB did not have any significant permanent adverse effects on cell growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that FLC treatment leads to inhibition of bud initiation and subsequent growth. However, the effect is delayed. We speculate that levels of plasma membrane ergosterol reach a critical minimum after longer incubation with FLC, resulting in significant inhibition of the initiation of budding and further bud growth.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="figS1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mSphere.00205-17.1</object-id><label>FIG&#x000a0;S1&#x000a0;</label><p>Pretreatment of cells with FLC and actin inhibitor latrunculin B leads to delayed inhibition of budding through FLC treatment.

To test this hypothesis, we assessed the morphology of FLC-treated cells. To differentiate between cells with normal DNA content and those with increased DNA content, we fixed the cells, stained the DNA with PI, and subsequently fractionated the cells using a FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) instrument. Fractions of cells with increased ploidy were collected, and the levels of morphology were scored under the microscope. Cells with a ploidy level close to 1N were predominantly unbudded or contained a single usually small bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). Fractions with higher ploidy levels were enriched in cells characterized by the presence of two or more daughter cells (multimeric cells).

A total of ~44% of the cells in the fraction with a ploidy level above 4N were multimeric cells. These results suggest that treatment with FLC leads to failure in cytokinesis. To rule out the possibility that multimeric cells result from cell fusion events, we mixed two strains, one that expressed histone H4 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and another that expressed H4 tagged with mCherry, and subjected the mixed-cell culture to FLC. While multimeric cells expressing either of the two fluorescent chimeras were frequent after longer incubations with FLC, we could not find multimeric cells that expressed both GFP and mCherry (data not shown). This is consistent with our hypothesis that multimeric cells result from cell division failure rather than from cell fusion events.</p><fig id="fig3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>FLC treatment leads to a defect in cell separation.

A delay or a complete block in cell separation during FLC treatment would potentially lead to an increase in DNA content in unseparated cells if the cell cycle were to continue and to result in subsequent rounds of replication. We tested this hypothesis further by subjecting a population of preselected unbudded cells to FLC treatment and assessing DNA content based on PI fluorescence using flow cytometry.

Additionally, the findings emphasize that enlarged, unbudded cells are potentially another factor contributing to survival. In order to better understand the role of enlarged morphology, cells were streaked in the middle of a plate containing 24&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml FLC medium. After 9&#x000a0;h, before the emergence of multimeras, 20 enlarged unbudded or budded cells were picked using a micromanipulator and placed on the same plate in known spots. A total of 20 cells of normal size were also placed as controls. Six of the 20 enlarged cells progressed into colonies, while 0 of 20 of the control cells of normal size grew. These data are not surprising; the cells that showed an increase in survival were able to grow or enlarge during the initial insult of FLC, whereas the nonsurvivors were unable to handle the stress imposed by FLC. The microcolonies formed by the six enlarged cells at 24&#x000a0;h were dissected, and the morphology and subsequent mitotic divisions were monitored for the succeeding 24&#x000a0;h. Cells that were already multimeras by 24&#x000a0;h exhibited the greatest chance of survival in the presence of FLC (formed microcolonies); ~89% of multimeras underwent further growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.&#x000a0;S5</xref>). In contrast, ~50% of budded cells and ~30% of unbudded cells formed microcolonies. The heterogeneity of the population with respect to FLC resistance is intriguing. It will be of interest to further explore the basis and the importance of the heterogeneity of the initial response to FLC.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="figS5"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mSphere.00205-17.5</object-id><label>FIG&#x000a0;S5&#x000a0;</label><p>Microdissection of colonies grown on FLC media.

What is most likely to account for the delay is the rate at which ergosterol is depleted in individual cells; however, other reasons cannot be excluded. For instance, relatively slow accumulation of a toxic by-product of the FLC-mediated inhibition of ergosterol synthesis may also be responsible for the delay (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Significant inhibition of budding of cells treated with 32&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml of FLC occurs at 6&#x000a0;h, a time when no significant increase of DNA content is yet observed in a heterogeneous population. However, it required only ~3&#x000a0;h for a significant population of cells corresponding to 3N to appear when the initial population was composed of unbudded cells. Thus, an initial increase in DNA content is likely to occur due to a lack of cell separation coupled with subsequent replication in the mother cell.</p><p>FLC inhibits cytokinesis in <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic>, but the actual mechanism of cytokinesis failure has not been explored (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). While we also find that FLC causes inhibition of cell separation in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic>, two main differences from <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> are apparent. First, the <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> multimeric cells resulting from FLC treatment consist of the mother cell and the daughters that remain connected via common cytoplasm (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Harrison et al. speculate that the cytoplasmic signaling connection between individual cells within the multimera is important for the formation of the tetraploid intermediate (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In contrast, we observed that multimeric <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> cells are formed on the basis of a failure of the final cell separation process despite septa being formed. Therefore, the mother cell and the first daughter do not share cytoplasm when the second daughter is formed, which is consistent with images of multimeras with discontinuous fluorescent cytoplasmic signal between the attached cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</xref>&#x000a0;in the supplemental material). A second clear distinction is that the multimeric cells in <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> are chains of cells resulting from growth of the second daughter cell (a granddaughter) out of the first daughter cell, while in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic>, both daughter cells grow consecutively from a single mother. We speculate that retention of the cytoplasmic connection in <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> and a lack thereof in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> account for this difference. Specifically, in <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic>, cell cycle signaling that normally triggers the next round of budding in the mother is acting within the first daughter, which results in a granddaughter. In <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic>, the mother cell of the multimera is isolated from the unattached daughter and the signaling triggers formation of a second bud within the mother. Indeed, we observed multimeras with two daughters attached to the mother and a single granddaughter, indicating a later time at which one of the daughters is &#x0201c;ready&#x0201d; to initiate budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>, purple arrow). It is interesting that, in contrast to <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic>, FLC treatment does not prevent septation in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic>. This may indicate that either the physical processes of AMR constriction and/or septum formation differ in these species or, alternatively, the differences in the signaling that triggers these events account for various effects of FLC in these species. Given that both species produce aneuploid progeny presumably based on multimeric cells, the issue remains of whether aneuploidy formation proceeds through distinct mechanisms in these unrelated yeasts. Alternatively, at least in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic>, these multimeric cells may not constitute a critical prerequisite to truly resistant aneuploids but rather a by-product of FLC inhibition that nonetheless increases the survival of cells in the presence of the drug. Addressing these issues will require further investigation.</p><p>Fern&#x000e1;ndez et al. demonstrated that cholesterol, the mammalian equivalent of ergosterol, was required for cytokinesis in a human HL-60 cell line and that sustained cholesterol starvation led to the formation of polyploid, multinucleated cells with mitotic aberrations (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). They hypothesized that the cell cycle perturbations and polyploidization observed in cholesterol-deficient cells are due to reduced Cdk1 activity. Furthermore, affected cells were able to partially traverse mitosis and to rereplicate DNA, which led to polyploidy (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the cell separation defect that we observed in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> was due to depletion of ergosterol. Our data suggest that FLC prevents cell separation in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> most likely via inhibition of the final degradation of the primary septum, as the primary septum was formed and the two other main events of cytokinesis, AMR constriction and septin assembly, were largely not affected. Surprisingly, none of the endochitinases encoded by the <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> genome are necessary for the final cell separation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> may not have an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes chitosan, a constituent of the primary septum. Therefore, daughter cell separation may proceed based on the increased flexibility and solubility of the chitosan (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). It is plausible that FLC disrupts the relative content of chitosan, leading to defects in cell separation. Alternatively, a delay in AMR constriction or other indirect effects of FLC may cause an interruption of a conserved RAM (regulation of Ace2 and morphogenesis) pathway that signals final cell separation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Several abnormal morphologies resulting from FLC treatment reflect its diverse effects on cell physiology. We propose that the variability in morphological defects results from the heterogeneity that exists in the population of cells that is initially exposed to the drug. In its simplest form, the heterogeneity may reflect cells that are at various stages of the cell cycle when they are initially exposed to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig.&#x000a0;9A</xref>). FLC treatment leads to a gradual depletion of ergosterol and an accumulation of toxic metabolic products. Consequently, cells are affected in various ways depending on when ergosterol levels reach the critical minimum with respect to the stage of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig.&#x000a0;9A</xref>). Interestingly, populations of cells exposed to FLC exhibit variability in the initial response to the drug (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.&#x000a0;S5</xref>). It will be of interest to investigate the basis for this heterogeneous response.</p><fig id="fig9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;9&#x000a0;</label><caption><p>(A) Model illustrating the effects of FLC on the cell growth, cell cycle progression, and cytokinesis that result in cells with increased ploidy, including single cells, multimeric cells, and cells with abnormal buds. According to this model, the resulting morphological defect for a given cell depends on the cell cycle stage during which the cell was exposed to FLC initially. (B) Model depicting the progression of the events that lead to formation of a multimeric cell during exposure to FLC. In this model, a multimera with equally distributed chromatin levels may transition to a stage during which more chromatin is present in the mother cell than in the daughters. While this seems to be the most prevalent type of multimeric cell, cells with other chromatin distribution patterns and mother cells with two nuclei were also found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="sph0031722970009"/></fig><p>Cells that fail to separate, and yet undergo DNA replication and subsequent initiation of budding and then proceed through additional rounds of mitosis (multimeric cells), most likely constitute a major group that accounts for the increased DNA content as detected via PI staining and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig.&#x000a0;9B</xref>). The fact that the mother cells undergo replication despite the failure in daughter cell separation is consistent with previous findings demonstrating that the timing of replication in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> is flexible with respect to the timing of the bud initiation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that inhibition of cell separation by FLC treatment may be sufficient to result in the next round of replication in those mother cells. Consistent with the contribution of multimeras to the fraction of cells with increased ploidy as detected by flow cytometry, we found multimeric cells with increased and unequally distributed chromatin levels as judged by the fluorescence of H4-mCherry. Currently, the mechanism through which FLC treatment leads to unequal distributions of histone H4 is unclear. This defect is likely associated with missegregation of chromosomes, as we also observed aberrant segregation of centromeres between mother and daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>). In <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae</italic>, increases in ploidy are associated with chromosomal instability (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Hypothetically, missegregation of chromosomes may be a direct mechanism through which aneuploids are derived. A nonexclusive alternative is that cells with increased ploidy may undergo stepwise chromosomal loss, leading to aneuploidy. FLC causes inhibition of budding, which, when coupled with subsequent replication, would lead to an increase in DNA content. In addition, we observed premature mitosis occurring within mother cells, which is consistent with the presence of unbudded cells in the fraction with increased ploidy. Thus, FLC treatment results in an increase in DNA content by affecting cellular growth and division via multiple mechanisms. The central issue is whether the cells with increased DNA content that are formed in the presence of FLC give rise to a population of aneuploids that increases the chance of producing resistant populations. Our results, which show that cells with increased size and aberrant morphology grow better in the presence of FLC, are consistent with this possibility.</p><p>While increased ploidy due to FLC treatment may not be sufficient to generate truly resistant aneuploids in the host, the presence of cells with increased DNA content may increase the chance for survival in the presence of the drug and may hypothetically lead to more persistent infections. Recent studies showed a <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> morphological variant of vastly increased ploidy and size called the Titan cell (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Titan cells are found during infection and are more resistant to stress and FLC. Additionally, they produce populations of more-resistant aneuploids (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). FLC treatment is not sufficient to produce Titan cells, and the mechanism through which FLC increases DNA content <italic>in vitro</italic> appears different from that associated with the ploidy increase seen in Titan cells during infection. However, FLC-treated mice infected with <italic>C.&#x000a0;albicans</italic> show morphologically changed yeast cells that likely stem from an inability to undergo cytokinesis (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Isolates of <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> obtained from clinical samples exhibited significant variation in susceptibility to FLC, and resistant clones with chromosomal disomy have been detected in brains of mice treated with FLC (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Thus, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest that during infection with <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic>, treatment with FLC may lead to an increase in DNA content in yeast cells through pleiotropic effects on cell division. Cells with increased DNA content would support microevolution of populations with an augmented potential to survive in the host environment.</p><p>As discussed by Cheong and McCormack, several studies demonstrated conflicting results regarding the correlation between the MIC values for FLC seen <italic>in vitro</italic> and the clinical outcomes (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The authors demonstrated that 30% of patients with cryptococcosis who have never been exposed to FLC showed evidence of reduced susceptibility to this antifungal (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Desnos-Ollivier et al. have recovered genetically related haploid and diploid strains from the same patients and demonstrated through experimental infections and quantitative PCR that ploidy changes can result from endoreplication and that switching between haploid and diploid states can occur, consistent with microevolution within the host (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that stress conditions in the host stimulate an increase in DNA content through inhibition of cellular division that is similar to the <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of FLC described here. Several genes have been described in <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae</italic> that are essential for viability of polyploid cells (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). It would be of interest to test if homologues of these genes in <italic>C.&#x000a0;neoformans</italic> are essential for viability of FLC-derived polyploids and formation of FLC-resistant populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Growth conditions.</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>.

The morphology was checked at various time points to confirm that no multimeric cells were present, and the cells were fixed and stained with PI for ploidy assessment using flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s3.4"><title>Microscopy.</title><p>Bright-field and fluorescence images were captured using a 100&#x000d7; objective with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) interfaced with AxioVision Rel 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Micromanipulation was performed using a SporePlay dissection microscope (Singer Instruments, United Kingdom). Unless otherwise stated, images were processed in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Zen blue (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) was used to measure the diameter of the bud of mitotic spindle-containing cells. ImageJ (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) was used to measure H4-mCherry nuclear fluorescence. This was done by flattening the Z-sections to project the maximum intensities from each section and outlining the fluorescence of the nucleus. To account for DNA compaction, the pixel value of the outlined area was multiplied by the area. To establish a criterion on which to base the grouping of cells according to their relative levels of H4-mCherry fluorescence, we first measured variations of the fluorescent signal in control cells (not exposed to FLC). Specifically, we found that the ratio of the fluorescent signals of the daughter and mother cell ranged between 0.7 and 1.6. On the basis of this variation, we decided to use a ratio of less than 0.7 and a ratio of more than 1.6 to define lower and higher levels of chromatin in the daughter cell than in the mother cell, respectively.</p><p>For time-lapse analysis of components of cytokinesis, cells were pretreated with 24&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml FLC in YPD or yeast nitrogen base (YNB) medium with 2% glucose at 24&#x000b0;C for ~6&#x000a0;h. Subsequently, cells were transferred to YNB&#x02013;2% glucose medium containing 24&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml FLC (300&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of 1.00 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>&#x000a0;cells/ml&#x000b7;cell suspension) and were placed in a chamber of a borosilicate 8-chamber slide (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). At each time point, images of 5 Z-sections spaced 1.20&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m apart were taken.</p><p>To visualize chitin, calcofluor white staining was performed. H99 cells were grown in YPD media and treated with either 24&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml or 32&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml FLC for 9&#x000a0;h. Cells were then harvested, washed with YNB media, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 1&#x000a0;h while the culture was aerated. Cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 1% Triton X (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 10&#x000a0;min. Finally, cells were incubated for 30&#x000a0;min after the addition of 1&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml of calcofluor white (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), washed, resuspended in YNB media, and visualized with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope.</p><p>For evaluation of budding, cell surface was biotinylated using EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (ThermoScientific) and stained with ExtraAvidin tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cells were washed three times with PBS and suspended to a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>&#x000a0;cells/ml. Subsequently, 4&#x000a0;mg/ml of sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin reagent was added. Cells were incubated at 24&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min. Cells were washed three times with YPD media. Biotinylated cells were released into 2&#x000a0;ml of YPD media with DMSO or 32&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml FLC, and after 3&#x000a0;h, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated in the dark with TRITC (1:200) for 10&#x000a0;min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and imaged. The cells were counted using the bright field. Then, the new buds (buds that were not stained) were counted using the rhodamine channel.</p><p>To assess the effect of the ergosterol exchange rate on budding inhibition, unbudded cells were selected via centrifugation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Cells were then incubated with either 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m LatB (Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) or 100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m LatB&#x02013;32 &#x000b5;g/ml FLC for various time periods. Cells were then washed and incubated for an additional 3&#x000a0;h in DMSO or 32&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml FLC. The percentage of budded cells was then estimated based on bright-field microscopy.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank Julie Nelson, Flow Cytometry Core Facility, Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Disease, University of Georgia, and Justin Scott, Clemson University Light Imaging Facility, for providing invaluable help with cell sorting using FACS analysis.
