Neonatal rats with spinal cord transection, however, exhibit spontaneous and significant recovery of micturition control. A previous study in which biotinylated-dextran amine (BDA) was used as an anterograde tracer demonstrated that primary afferent fibers from the fifth lumbar dorsal root ganglion (DRG) project more strongly and make more terminals in the ventral horn after neonatal spinal cord transection at the mid-thoracic level. In the present study, we injected BDA into the sixth lumbar (L6) DRG of neonatally spinalized rats to label primary afferent fibers that include visceral afferents. The labeled fibers projected to the intermediolateral nucleus (IML) in the intermediate zone on ipsilateral side of the L6 spinal segment, whereas no projections to the IML were observed in sham-operated or intact rats. The BDA-labeled fibers of neonatally spinalized rats formed varicose terminals on parasympathetic preganglionic neurons in the IML. These findings suggest that some primary afferent projections from the L6 DRG to the IML appear after neonatal spinal cord transection, and these de novo projections might contribute to the recovery of autonomic function such as micturition following spinal cord injury in the neonatal stage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0025">Spinal cord injury (SCI) in the adult causes sensorimotor and autonomic dysfunction, even leading to death in some cases (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Krassioukov et al., 2007</xref>). Despite numerous studies aimed at enhancing recovery from impairments caused by SCI, no therapeutic strategies for SCI have been established (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Mathias and Low, 2014</xref>). In experimental studies, thoracic spinal cord transection in adult rats and cats leads to severe bladder dysfunction in addition to paraplegia at spinal levels below the injury site (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">de Groat et al., 1998</xref>). Severe dysuria in rodents with complete SCI is usually managed by researchers manually pressing on the urinary bladder twice a day (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Herrera et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="par0030">Rats that undergo spinal cord transection at the neonatal period, however, exhibit far less motor dysfunction compared to those at the adult stage (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Stelzner et al., 1975</xref>, <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Takiguchi et al., 2015</xref>). We recently demonstrated that compensatory projections of primary afferent fibers to the intermediate zone and the ventral horn in the lumbar spinal segment are strengthened after neonatal spinal cord transection at the thoracic level, based on experiments in which biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), an anterograde tracer, was administered into the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Takiguchi et al., 2015</xref>). This plastic change in the primary afferent projections caused by neonatal spinal cord transection might be involved in the ameliorative effects on motor function because axonal regeneration of descending tracts through the injury site has not been confirmed in either the neonatal SCI model or the adult SCI model.</p><p id="par0035">In contrast to motor function, the mechanisms underlying the recovery of autonomic function after neonatal SCI have not been thoroughly investigated. In adult rats, several brain regions are important for controlling micturition. Among them, the pontine micturition center, also referred to as Barrington&#x02019;s nucleus, is considered mainly responsible for regulating micturition (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">de Groat et al., 1998</xref>). The descending projections from Barrington&#x02019;s nucleus to the lumbosacral spinal cord form by postnatal day (P5) in neonatal rats (<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Sugaya et al., 1997</xref>). When supraspinal projections from the pontine micturition center are interrupted in neonatal rats, primary afferent projections to the spinal cord may increase to compensate for urinary bladder dysfunction. In the present study, therefore, we examined whether primary afferent projections to the intermediolateral nucleus (IML) in the sixth lumbar (L6) spinal segment, which contains parasympathetic preganglionic neurons (PPNs), are increased in neonatally spinalized rats. We labeled primary afferent fibers by administering BDA into the L6 DRG, which contains visceral afferents from the urinary bladder. We then examined chemical markers of DRG neurons incorporating the BDA using double-labeling immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p id="par0040">Wistar rats neonates (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;45, Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) and Wistar rat dams (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4, Japan SLC) were used in the present study.

Briefly, under anesthesia with isoflurane gas (1.0%-2.0%), spinal cords were completely transected with small spring microscissors following partial laminectomy (T7-T9). Once bleeding stopped, the muscles, fascia, and skin were closed in layers using 6-0 nylon sutures. The rats were gently cleaned with gauze soaked in 70% ethanol to eliminate the smell of blood, then returned to their home cages after recovery from anesthesia. Sham-operated rats (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) from four litters underwent laminectomy, but no spinal transection. Intact rats (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;19) from four litters underwent no surgical treatments. These three groups were randomly allocated in almost equal proportions from each litter. All rat pups were returned to their dams.

The efficiency of BDA for labeling the central projections of primary afferents in comparison with other tracers has been confirmed (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Novikov, 2001</xref>). On the other hand, BDA injected into the DRG labels only one-third of the DRG neurons (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Novikov, 2001</xref>). In the present study, many BDA-labeled neurons were RT97-positive, and less than 2% were CGRP-positive in the L6 DRG, suggesting that BDA tends to be incorporated more in neurons with myelinated fibers than in those with unmyelinated fibers containing neuropeptides. Therefore, most of the BDA-labeled fibers in the spinal cord in the present study were considered to comprise myelinated fibers, with few unmyelinated fibers containing neuropeptides. The BDA-labeled fibers projecting to the IML in neo-ST rats are also considered to be mostly myelinated. Some CGRP-positive primary afferents reportedly project to the IML in neonatal mouse (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Funakoshi et al., 2003</xref>). It is possible that such projections are also present in rats but not labeled by BDA histochemistry, because BDA was not incorporated by most of the CGRP-positive DRG neurons.</p></sec><sec id="sec0085"><label>4.4</label><title>Functional significance of primary afferent projections to the IML</title><p id="par0130">The L6 dorsal root nerve contains the visceral afferents of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers from the urinary bladder, as well as somatic afferents from the skeletal muscles associated with the pelvic organs. In the bladder, myelinated A&#x003b4;-fibers respond to passive distension and active contraction, whereas unmyelinated C-fibers are not sensitive to bladder filling under physiologic conditions and respond to noxious stimuli, such as chemical irritation or cooling (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Fowler et al., 2008</xref>). Although myelinated A-fibers comprise only one-third of the bladder afferents in the rat, the normal micturition reflex is principally mediated by A-fiber afferents and the spinobulbospinal pathway via the pontine micturition center in the rat, as well as in the cat (<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">de Groat et al., 1981</xref>, <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">de Groat et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">de Groat and Yoshimura, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="par0135">Direct primary afferent projections to the PPNs are present, however, in rodents. These projections, which form in the prenatal stage in mouse and contain the neuropeptides CGRP and substance P, and transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1), are speculated to function in the prenatal spinal micturition reflex (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Funakoshi et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Funakoshi et al., 2006</xref>). In animals with spinal injuries that interrupt normal reflex pathways in the adult, the spinal reflex is activated through direct primary afferent projections to the PPNs, which leads to uncontrolled voiding (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">de Groat et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">de Groat and Yoshimura, 2010</xref>). This spinal micturition reflex is thought to be principally mediated by unmyelinated primary afferents (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Krenz and Weaver, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Zinck et al., 2007</xref>) positive for CGRP, substance P, and TRPV1 (<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">de Groat and Yoshimura, 2010</xref>). Although sprouting of primary afferents positive for the neurochemical markers CGRP and isolectin B4 might contribute to the recovery of bladder control (<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Zinck et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Zinck and Downie, 2008</xref>), later hyperexcitability of unmyelinated primary afferents makes bladder reflexes hyperreflexive (<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimura, 1999</xref>).</p><p id="par0140">In contrast, the present study suggests that <italic>de novo</italic> projections of myelinated afferents to the PPNs emerged following neo-ST. Myelinated bladder afferent fibers are activated at lower pressure thresholds than unmyelinated fibers (<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">de Groat and Yoshimura, 2010</xref>). Therefore, these findings raise the possibility that plastic changes of myelinated fiber projections significantly contribute to the recovery of micturition control following SCI in the neonatal stage.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fowler</surname><given-names>C.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffiths</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>de Groat</surname><given-names>W.C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The neural control of micturition</article-title><source>Nat.
