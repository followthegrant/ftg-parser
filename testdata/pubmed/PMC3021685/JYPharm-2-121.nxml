The influence of drug polymer ratio on drug release was studied by dissolution tests. Characterization was performed by fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffractometry. The optimized formulation was subjected to accelerated stability testing as per ICH guidelines. Release data were examined kinetically. SD with 1:4 and 1:5 ratio of drug to polymer obtained by solvent evaporation and cogrinding were selected as the best candidates suitable for prolonged-release oral dosage form of metformin.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cogrinding</kwd><kwd>metformin</kwd><kwd>methocel</kwd><kwd>solid dispersion</kwd><kwd>solvent evaporation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Metformin hydrochloride (MET) is an oral antihyperglycemic agent, highly water-soluble, whose low bioavailability and short and variable biological half-life (1.5&#x02013;4.5 h) needs frequent administrations to maintain effective plasma concentrations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] Unlike other biguanide drugs, metformin does not induce lactic acidosis. However, current metformin therapy is suboptimal as it is associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, seen in about 30% of the patients, thus making the development of sustained-release forms desirable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] An obstacle to more successful use of metformin therapy is the high incidence of concomitant gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, nausea and diarrhea, which especially occur during the initial weeks of treatment. Side effects and the need for administration two or three times per day when larger doses are required can decrease patient compliance. Sustained release (SR) formulation that would maintain plasma levels of drug for 8&#x02013;12 h might be sufficient for once daily dosing for metformin. SR products are needed for metformin to prolong its duration of action and to improve patient compliance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>]</p><p>Sustained or controlled drug delivery occurs while embedded within a polymer that may be natural or semisynthetic or synthetic in nature. The polymer is judiciously combined with the drug or other active ingredients in such a way that the active agent is released from the material in a predetermined fashion and released the drug at a constant rate for a desired time period.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Solid dispersion (SD), in which compounds are dispersed into water-soluble carriers, has been generally used to improve the dissolution properties and the bioavailability of drugs that are poorly soluble in water.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] SD has also been applied for the controlled release of drugs. Previous reports have shown that by using SDs containing a polymer blend, such as hydroxypropylcellulose (HPMC) and ethylcellulose, it is possible to precisely control the rate of release of an extremely water-soluble drug, such as oxprenolol hydrochloride.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] SDs of methylcellulose and carboxyvinylpolymer for phenacetin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] and Eudragit for diclofenac sodium.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] These studies have shown that there is a linear relationship between the rate of release of the water-insoluble drug and its interaction with the polymer.</p><p>A wide array of polymers has been employed as drug-retarding agents, each of which presents a different approach to the matrix concept. Polymers that primarily form insoluble or skeleton matrices are considered as the first category of retarding materials. The second class represents hydrophobic and water-insoluble materials, which are potentially erodible, and the third group exhibits hydrophilic properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>]</p><p>There are three primary mechanisms by which active agents can be released from a delivery system: diffusion, degradation and swelling followed by diffusion. The release of drug from the matrix depends on the nature of the polymer. Methocel K100M is a hydrophilic polymer that becomes hydrated, swollen and facilitates diffusion of the drug.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] In the present study, an attempt has been made to formulate metformin as SR SD with the addition of release-retarding polymer methocel K100M in different ratios. The effects of polymer loading on drug release were recorded and the release kinetics was evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>MET was kindly supplied by Indoco Remedies (Goa, India) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Methocel K100M) was obtained from Colorcon Asia Pvt.

The overall drug release is affected by the rate of water uptake and the diffusion rate of the drug through the swollen gel. High polymer content results in a greater amount of gel being formed. This gel increases the diffusional path length of the drug. Its viscous nature also affects the diffusion coefficient of the drug. As a result, a reduction in drug release rate is obtained. SM3 SD showed faster dissolution rate in an intermediate time of 2&#x02013;6 h, which did not match with the reference product. On increasing the quantity of HPMC in 1:4 and 1:5 ratio of drug, prolonged release of the drug was achieved, giving drug release of 95.31 and 92.63%, respectively, after 10 h and in the desired pattern. SM4 and SM5 SDs shows similar drug release pattern suggesting that further increasing the polymer ratio above 1:4 does not significantly reduce the release rate of MET.</p><p>The drug release from SDs by cogrinding after the first 2 h were 93.03, 88.13, 80.38, 60.34 and 55.08% for CM1, CM2, CM3, CM4 and CM5, respectively. As the ratio of drug to polymer increases, there is a significant decrease in the drug release from the SDs, reaching 90% of dissolved drug after about 3 and 4 h for CM2 and CM3. As the quantity of polymer increases further, there is also decrease in the amount of drug release from SD, giving an extended release up to 10 h for CM4 and CM5. The slow drug-release form SD, namely CM4 and CM5, can be attributed to the low permeability of the polymer, which posed a significant hindrance to fluid penetration and passive drug diffusion. Almost 100% drug is released after 8 h in all the SDs excluding CM5 SDs. After 8 h, the drug release from CM5 SDs was found to be 84.60%, showing compliance with the desired release profile.</p><p>The results indicate that there is reduction in drug release as there is increase in the amount of HPMC. However, it seems that there is no change in the release pattern as the amount of HPMC is increased further. DE values for SDs prepared by the cogrinding method were 92.82, 78.28 and 67.59% for CM1, CM4 and CM5, respectively, suggesting that there is reduction in drug release as there is increase in HPMC amount in SD.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Kinetic studies</title><p>The mechanism of drug release from hydrophilic SD after ingestion is complex, but it is based on diffusion of the drug through, and erosion of, the outer hydrated polymer on the surface of the SD. Typically, when the dispersion is exposed to an aqueous solution or gastrointestinal fluids, the surface of the dispersion is wetted and the polymer hydrates to form a gel layer around the drug. This leads to relaxation and swelling of the polymer, which also contributes to the mechanism of drug release. The core of the dispersion remains essentially dry at this stage. In the case of highly soluble drugs like metformin, this phenomenon may lead to an initial burst release due to the presence of the drug on the surface of the dispersion, which is evident by the dissolution data. The gel layer grows with time as more water permeates into the core of the dispersion, thereby increasing the thickness of the gel layer and providing a diffusion barrier to drug release. Simultaneously, as the outer layer becomes fully hydrated, the polymer chains become completely relaxed and can no longer maintain the integrity of the gel layer, thereby leading to disentanglement and erosion of the surface of the dispersion. Water continues to penetrate toward the core of the dispersion, through the gel layer, until it has been completely eroded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-17"><title>FTIR</title><p>The representative peaks of pure MET were unaltered in PM. The FTIR spectra of the solvent evaporation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>] and, even more so, of the cogrinding [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>] SDs presented appreciable shifts and reduction in intensity of the characteristic MET bands at 3369 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 3294 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which may be due to weak hydrogen bonding between the drug and polymer. The weak hydrogen bonding in case of solvent evaporation was less likely to be stronger than SD by cogrinding. The DSC thermographs of SDs revealed that slight downward shift in the endothermic peak of MET also implicit the interaction of MET with methocel. This may be due to the weak hydrogen bonding among NH, NH2 groups of MET and OH group of the methocel. It also suggests the presence of more or less intense solid-state interactions between the components.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-18"><title>DSC</title><p>Slight reduction of fusion enthalpy and lowering of melting temperature of MET observed in the solvent evaporation and, particularly, in the cogrinding SD, can be ascribed to some drug&#x02013;polymer interactions occurring during sample preparation. Because there is no complete disappearance of melting peak corresponding to both SDs, it indicates retention of the crystalline nature as a consequence of the absence of strong drug&#x02013;carrier interactions and/or drug inclusion complexation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-19"><title>PXRD</title><p>The significant decrease in the representative peak intensity height of SD comparatively with the physical mixture and pure MET clearly revealed the conversion of the crystalline nature of MET to the amorphous form.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-20"><title>Stability studies</title><p>Stability studies of the formulation showed that the SD were stable, with no significant change in the physicochemical characteristics. The improved stability of SD could be due to the hydrogen bonding between the drug and HPMC.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The proposed strategy of simultaneously exploiting the combination of the drug with a hydrophilic polymer such as methocel K100M and its SD was effective in adequately modulating the drug-release rate. Spectroscopic studies reveled the absence of interaction between drug and polymer. Release experiments demonstrate that the SR effects can be obtained by simply varying the relative amounts of the polymer in the dispersion. The actual effectiveness of SDs as extended release dosage forms is strongly dependent on the preparation technique used for obtaining SD. SDs prepared by solvent evaporation using methocel K100M were capable of prolonging the release of metformin for 10 h at 80% concentration and by the cogrinding method at 83% concentration of the polymer. The mechanism of drug release was observed to follow the Korsemeyer-Peppas model for SM4 and CM5 and the Higuchi matrix model for SM5 SDs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="CIT1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Farago</surname><given-names>PV</given-names></name><name><surname>Raffin</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name><name><surname>Pohlmann</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Guterres</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Zawadzki</surname><given-names>SF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Physicochemical characterization of a hydrophilic model drug-loaded PHBV Microparticles obtained by the double emulsion/solvent evaporation technique</article-title><source>J Braz Chem Soc</source><year>2008</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>1298</fpage><lpage>305</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>LD</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Q</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Preparation and <italic>in vitro/in vivo</italic> evaluation of sustained-release metformin hydrochloride pellets</article-title><source>Eur J Pharm Biopharm</source><year>2006</year><volume>64</volume><fpage>185</fpage><lpage>92</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16797948</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mandal</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Gowda</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bose</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhaumik</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Chatterjee</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Optimization of metformin hcl 500 mg sustained release matrix tablets using artificial neural network based on multilayer perceptrons model</article-title><source>Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)</source><year>2008</year><volume>56</volume><fpage>150</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18239298</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lordi</surname><given-names>NG</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Lachman</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Lieberman</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanig</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sustained release dosage forms</article-title><source>The theory and practice of industrial pharmacy</source><year>1990</year><publisher-loc>Bombay</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Varghese Publishing House</publisher-name><fpage>430</fpage><lpage>56</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Sunada</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Influence of water-soluble polymers on the dissolution of nifedipine solid dispersions with combined carriers</article-title><source>Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)</source><year>1998</year><volume>46</volume><fpage>482</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9549890</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ozeki</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Yuasa</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanaya</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Oishi</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Application of the solid dispersion method to controlled release of medicine.
