It is often difficult, however, to homologize cusps in taxa that are highly derived; too often remnants of a primitive tribosphenic pattern have been overprinted by millions of years of evolution. Lagomorphs (rabbits, hares, and pikas) represent such a case, and there has been considerable debate over the last century as to how the cusps of lagomorph teeth relate to the tribosphenic condition. Much of the discussion has revolved around a prominent central cusp that appears in the upper cheek teeth of fossil taxa, and for an ontogenetically brief period, in extant lagomorphs. The homology of that cusp has been viewed differently by many workers, and has, at times, been considered to be homologous to the paracone <xref rid="pone.0012838-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0012838-McKenna1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, amphicone <xref rid="pone.0012838-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, metacone <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0012838-LpezMartnez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, or considered an evolutionary novelty <xref rid="pone.0012838-Averianov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This confusion has been exacerbated because the ancestral stock from which lagomorphs likely evolved has remained unclear, and in turn, tracing the evolution of lagomorph teeth from a more typically tribosphenic ancestor has been difficult.</p><p>Understanding tooth cusp patterns within Lagomorpha is further complicated as both the upper and lower teeth of extant lagomorphs exhibit simple bilophodont morphology. The enamel surfaces of crowns are quickly worn away and are exposed as anterior and posterior lophs that are essentially enamel columns filled with dentine. This early crown wear erases cuspate structures, making the occlusal surface featureless. Despite this, both the central cusp and crescentic valley have long been recognized as prominent structures in fossil lagomorph teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, but see <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bohlin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, among others). In simplest terms, fossil lagomorph teeth exhibit a dominant central cusp (literally, centered lingual&#x02013;buccally and mesial&#x02013;distally) that is bordered lingually by a prominent enamel v-shaped valley (i.e. crescentic valley), and buccally by a similar, but smaller valley. The apex of the crescentic valley points lingually, while two prominent arms are present that project mesio- and distobuccally. The crescentic valley, often filled with cementum, persists in many taxa after the enamel surface of the crown has worn away. The degree to which the structure persists within the tooth column (i.e. the depth of the crescentic valley) varies significantly within Lagomorpha, and a pattern of decreasing persistence (i.e. decreasing valley depth) over evolutionary time is apparent from the fossil record <xref rid="pone.0012838-Sych1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Several authors have claimed the crescent disappears in certain lineages, particularly within extant taxa, but detailed study of unworn extant teeth <xref rid="pone.0012838-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Sych2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, histological sections of developing teeth <xref rid="pone.0012838-Sych3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and our own observations show that both the central cusp and crescentic valley can be found in all living taxa, albeit for a brief ontogenetic period. In short, the crescentic valley does not disappear in any taxa; it simply becomes less persistent. As prominent structures, the central cusp and crescentic valley should serve as landmarks to understand the overall cusp homology of lagomorphs, but it has been difficult to homologized them with tribosphenic structures, as supported by (<xref rid="pone.0012838-Bohlin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>:34)</p><disp-quote><p>

As is typical for brachydont mammals, the upper teeth of the earliest duplicidentates have an enlarged lingual root as compared to two smaller buccal roots. In the earliest duplicidentate taxa, however, increased crown heights occur largely on the lingual side of the tooth, as the buccal side of the crown remains low-crowned. This condition is accentuated in subsequent taxa and has been termed unilateral hypsodonty. The result is that in many stem lagomorphs the lingual root never closes. The lingual portion of the tooth becomes ever growing while the buccal portion remains low-crowned. Over the life of the animal this causes substantial tooth rotation in the coronal plane, and in turn, dramatically changes the shape of the occlusal surface during the life of the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Many workers have recognized these life history patterns (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0012838-Sych4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0012838-Tobien2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>), and more recently, a mathematical model was developed to illustrate the rotation of the tooth and its influence on the occlusal tooth pattern and shape <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bair1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The effect of this growth over the life of an animal is that lingual portion of the occlusal surface becomes greatly expanded via wear, and skews the relative positions of several prominent occlusal features, including the central cusp and crescentic valley. For all the reasons just outlined, it is imperative that any study focused on homologizing tooth cusps in duplicidentates use unworn or slightly worn teeth that not only allows for primary crown features to be observed, but also for various features to be understood in the their &#x02018;original&#x02019; positions before differential crown wear occurs and distorts these data.</p><p>The goal of this paper is to present a nomenclature for tooth cusps of all living and extinct duplicidentates, based on the tribosphenic pattern. The central aspect of this work is the use of newly described material of an exceptionally preserved mimotonid, <italic>Gomphos elkema</italic>, and stem-lagomorph, <italic>Dawsonolagus antiquus</italic>, that show clear tribosphenic patterning, as well as clear relationships to crown lagomorphs <xref rid="pone.0012838-Asher1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. We will use data from occlusion and wear facets to evaluate a hypothesis of cusp homology. We propose that the central cusp of lagomorphs is homologous with the tribosphenic metaconule, as well as apply tribosphenic terminology to all Duplicidentata crown structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Only Van Valen <xref rid="pone.0012838-VanValen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> has suggested that the central cusp of lagomorphs was the metaconule previously, and only tentatively, while recognizing the need for more corroborative evidence. Here were present that evidence in the form of 1) a tribosphenic nomenclatural system for mimotonids based on gross cusp topology and occlusal relationships, 2) a phylogenetic framework for duplicidentates that shows a clear ancestral-descendent relationship between mimotonids and lagomorphs, and finally, 3) extrapolations of the tribosphenic patterns recognized within mimotonids to stem- and crown-lagomorphs couched within this phylogenetic framework.</p><fig id="pone-0012838-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0012838.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Tribosphenic terminology proposed in this study for crown structures of Duplicidentata.</title><p>All teeth, buccal to top, mesial to left.

This is a complicated question, with a long and well-documented history (see <xref rid="pone.0012838-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, for a thorough overview), and certainly beyond the scope of this paper to summarize the entire breadth of these discussions. We recognize here, therefore, that homology is <italic>defined</italic> as similarity due to common ancestry. To <italic>diagnose</italic> homology, however, one must first demonstrate that the structures in question are similar in form, position, and development. We suggest that these criteria are much more attainable now, and more specifically, we use the fossil record to trace the evolutionary history of various cusps among duplicidentates. Recently discovered primitive duplicidentate taxa have teeth that clearly show a tribosphenic cusp pattern, and these taxa help to establish a well-supported duplicidentate phylogeny <xref rid="pone.0012838-Asher1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We also recognize that there is a disjunct between nomenclature and homology with respect to mammalian tooth cusps. We argue that this perspective is necessary, and that, at times, nomenclature does not (nor should) reflect homology. Finally, we recognize that a comprehensive treatment that includes crown lagomorphs is needed to apply tribosphenic nomenclature more broadly; this is our goal.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>History of Duplicidentate Cusp Nomenclature</title><p>While many authors have interpreted the central cusp of lagomorphs differently, it is an over simplification to merely list their preferred &#x02018;homology statements&#x02019; as they were almost always made within the context of extensive discussion. Most often authors would not explicitly state which tribosphenic cusp they inferred the central cusp to be (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bohlin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>), but rather, a likely homology was framed within various scenarios of the evolutionary origins of Lagomorpha. In this context, it is important to understand the basis upon which previous authors have inferred homology and denoted names to recognize how the evidence used to support these hypotheses (e.g., lagomorph ancestry) has often changed over the last century. We also note that the earlier tritubercular/tubercular-sectorial dentition patterns discussed in the Cope-Osborn theory were later renamed tribosphenic patterns <italic>sensu</italic> Simpson <xref rid="pone.0012838-Simpson1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Major <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> conducted the first substantial systematic treatment of lagomorphs, and within that monograph he spent considerable time describing the teeth and cusps of fossil and extinct taxa. While the tritubercular/tubercular-sectorial theory (i.e. tribosphenic) had been largely established by this time, Major <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> rarely made tritubercular homology statements regarding specific cusps; instead he most often referred to occlusal structures in his own alphanumerical nomenclatural system. This is partially a product of his documented disagreement with some foundations of the Cope-Osborn theory <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and therefore, Major <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> did not actually specify with which primitive cusp he considered the central cusp of lagomorph to be homologous. Major's perspective on the central cusp was largely influenced by his hypothesis that lagomorphs' ancestral stock came from within a <italic>Pelycodus &#x02013; Plesiadapis</italic> group <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. While he is explicit in this designation, and goes as far as to figure both <italic>Pelycodus</italic> and <italic>Plesiadapis</italic> upper molars to compare with an upper molar of <italic>Caprolagus</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0012838-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; plate 36, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g001">figs. 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g002"/>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g003">3</xref>), he does not use tritubercular terminology. This approach is interesting in that Major <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, at times, used tritubercular terms for lower teeth, yet not for upper teeth. Regardless, Major <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> did denote the central cusp in lagomorphs as &#x02018;6,&#x02019; and similarly denotes a cusp that would now be considered the protocone as &#x02018;6&#x02019; in both the <italic>Plesiadapis</italic> and <italic>Pelycodus</italic> figures. Though this is not an explicit statement that the central cusp within lagomorphs is the protocone, it implies that Major thought the central cusp to be homologous with the protocone in primates.</p><fig id="pone-0012838-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0012838.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Phylogeny of Duplicidentata based on Meng et al. <xref rid="pone.0012838-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>22</bold>]</xref>, Asher et al. <xref rid="pone.0012838-Asher1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>19</bold>]</xref>, and Wible <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wible1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>34</bold>]</xref>.</title><p>This work shows that a monophyletic Lagomorpha is nested within a paraphyletic Mimotonidae (here represented by <italic>Gomphos</italic>).

In his treatment of lagomorphs Osborn <xref rid="pone.0012838-Osborn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> largely agreed with Major's <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> homology of duplicidentate molar cusps with those of <italic>Pelycodus</italic>, implying that the central cusp is the protocone. The discussion is brief, and it is unfortunate that the <italic>Titanomys</italic> tooth figured (the 114<sup>th</sup> figure of <xref rid="pone.0012838-Osborn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>) seems to be grossly mislabeled, as pointed out by Bohlin <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bohlin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Osborn <xref rid="pone.0012838-Osborn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> did not discuss any other cusps, and only additionally figured the metacone and paracone (the paracone was incorrectly labeled as Major's cusp &#x02018;6&#x02019;). Osborn had for some time interpreted the &#x02018;primary&#x02019; tritubercular cusp as the protocone <xref rid="pone.0012838-Osborn2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0012838-Osborn3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, which he considered derived from the primitive reptilian unicuspid condition. His recognition of the central cusp of lagomorphs as the primary cusp was the basis for its identification as the protocone.</p><p>Ehik <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> was the first to outline a hypothesis of cusp homologies within lagomorphs in detail, for which he primarily referred to the fossil ochotonid <italic>Titanomys</italic>. In addition to naming the cusps, Ehik <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> came to the important conclusion that upper premolars and molars shared the same basic pattern. This was based on his recognition that the P<sup>3</sup> was &#x02018;primitive&#x02019; relative to the other upper cheek teeth, and the more complex cheek tooth morphology was derived from the primitive P<sup>3</sup> condition. Ehik <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> claimed that parts of P<sup>3</sup> and P<sup>4</sup> are easily recognized as homologous, and that the subsequent molars share the same pattern as P<sup>4</sup>. This insight is important because most, but not all, researchers have considered lagomorph premolars and molars to be homologous. The problem with Ehik's <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> system is largely, then, in his interpretation of the simplified three-lobed P<sup>3</sup>. Osborn <xref rid="pone.0012838-Osborn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> suggested that all tritubercular teeth shared an evolutionary history with a triconodont ancestor and Ehik's <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> interpretation of the lagomorph P<sup>3</sup> was based explicitly on this assumption. In simple terms, Ehik <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> homologized the central cusp of lagomorphs with the protocone, but this interpretation is flawed as he recognized the P<sup>3</sup> of <italic>Titanomys</italic> as derived from a triconodont tooth that he hypothesized had been rotated ninety degrees, where the three primary cusps are now aligned transversely rather than longitudinally. Not only is the proposed rotation unlikely on developmental and evolutionary grounds, subsequent authors have pointed out that the primary cusp of triconodonts is now considered to the paracone <xref rid="pone.0012838-McKenna1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Averianov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Nonetheless, Ehik's <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> assertion that lagomorph premolars and molars are based on the same pattern has gone largely unchallenged, with the exception of work to be discussed later <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bohlin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Ehik's <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> work was conducted within the context of the &#x02018;premolar analogy&#x02019; theory (see <xref rid="pone.0012838-VanValen3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> for a thorough review), which makes two important points: first, the primary (and first to develop) cusp of therian mammals is the paracone (and not the protocone, as had been previously thought); and second, molars are serially homologous with premolars. While Ehik <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> clearly argued the latter point, he also suggested that although the central cusp is the protocone, lagomorph teeth still supported the &#x02018;premolar analogy&#x02019; theory but had been modified (i.e., rotated) from that condition due to the unique demands of lagomorphs lateral mastication motion.</p><p>As the &#x02018;premolar analogy&#x02019; debate continued, Burke <xref rid="pone.0012838-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> homologized lagomorph cusps in a way that strongly supported the theory (e.g. the central cusp was interpreted as the paracone). One of his only statements regarding his reasoning, however, was that his system was &#x02018;&#x02026;more in accordance with the relationships of various molar elements in other orders of mammals, and more in keeping with observed evolutionary trends in the cheek teeth of the group itself&#x02019; (<xref rid="pone.0012838-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>:408), which was, in part, a response to the system proposed by Ehik <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Despite his strong statements, Burke <xref rid="pone.0012838-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> did not discuss the ancestry of lagomorphs, nor how the tooth morphology of lagomorphs is derived from a tritiberculate ancestor. His assessment is likely influenced by his acceptance <xref rid="pone.0012838-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> of the &#x02018;premolar analogy&#x02019; theory that recognized the primary molar cusp (or first to form) as the paracone, and not the protocone.</p><p>Wood <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> conducted an extensive survey of fossil lagomorphs, and strongly supported Ehik's <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> contention regarding the serial homology among lagomorph cheek teeth, and was primarily concerned with making homology statements for lagomorph cusps in comparison to other mammals. To this end, Wood (<xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, his 115<sup>th</sup> figure) identified the central cusp as the metacone, a position he continued to maintain for decades <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. His work, however, illustrates the need to carefully read discussions concerning cusp homology assessments (in particular, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>:351&#x02013;360). Although Wood <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> identifies the central cusp as the metacone, he explored the idea that only the protocone was representative of the primary tribosphenic cusps (e.g., protocone, paracone, and metacone), and rightly concludes, that if this were the case the &#x02018;premolar analogy&#x02019; theory would not hold for lagomorphs due to the absence of the paracone. Wood <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> also recognized that premolars experienced a &#x02018;delayed&#x02019; evolution as compared to the molars, and that this also had implications for the premolar analogy theory:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic>&#x02018;In some cases, however, premolar analogy cannot be applied, because the molars had already attained their full pattern while the premolars were still undifferentiated, and when the mechanical forces of mastication brought about the convergence of the premolars to the molar pattern, the teeth developed in whatever manner the genes and the mechanics of tooth function permitted at the time, which might be entirely different in its details from that followed by the molars, though leading to a similar pattern in the end.&#x02019;</italic>

This conclusion, however, came with the same hesitation as did Wood's <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Bohlin also spent considerable time discussing the premolars, including their deciduous precursors, and came to the broad conclusion that throughout lagomorph phylogeny premolars continued to &#x02018;progress&#x02019; until they reach a complexity seen in the molars. Interestingly, he also recognized that the progression within premolars was from posterior to anterior within individual tooth positions, and opposite in molar development. This assessment was specifically referring to the buccal expansion of the loph derived from the mesiolingual cusp, in P<sup>3</sup> at least. This also led Bohlin <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bohlin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> to suggest that the molars and premolars developed differently, and therefore, are not serially homologous. He reached this conclusion partially through his struggle to reconcile the evolution of the mesiobuccal portion of premolars. Bohlin's <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bohlin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> perspective on the differential presence of the paracone on P<sup>3</sup> and P<sup>4</sup> is, at times, difficult to follow, but it's clear that he is not sure whether the reduced paracone in some P<sup>4</sup>s is the result of the loss of a paracone, or the failure of it to fully develop (although he leans toward the second explanation).</p><p>In a brief treatment, Tobien <xref rid="pone.0012838-Tobien1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> suggested that the lagomorph central cusp might be homologized with the paracone.

The posterior cusp is homologized with the metacone, and the mesial buccal cusp is described as connected to the paracone via a paracrista (although he does not name that mesial buccal cusp).

They interpreted the central cusps of molars as the metacone based on its position relative to the talon, but also recognized that the cusp had shifted mesiolingually. The central cusp of the premolars was interpreted as the paracone or amphicone based on the study of P<sup>4</sup>s of <italic>Mimotona</italic>, which shows one primary buccal cusp in premolars.</p><p>Averianov <xref rid="pone.0012838-Averianov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> conducted one of the most thorough of the recent studies concerned with cusp homology among lagomorphs. In that work, the central cusp is interpreted as an evolutionary novelty, not homologous with other known tribosphenic structures. This interpretation is based, partially, on the unique mastication (with predominant lateral motion) mode within lagomorphs. Averianov <xref rid="pone.0012838-Averianov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> recognized the functional significance of the central cusp and the crescentic valley in this context, and argues that they arise due to the non-functional role of the paracone and metacone.

In his first treatment <xref rid="pone.0012838-VanValen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, he suggested that the central cusp of lagomorphs might be the protocone (or possibly, the metacone) based on the presence of two prominent buccal cusps, interpreted as the paracone and metacone. This was determined with comparisons to the insectivore <italic>Pseudictops</italic> and eurymylid <italic>Eurymylus</italic>, both of which he considered close to the ancestry of lagomorphs. This interpretation requires a significant buccal shift of the protocone, driven by the development of unilateral hypsodonty within lagomorphs. Van Valen <xref rid="pone.0012838-VanValen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> later suggested that the central cusp of lagomorphs could be the metaconule based on the presence of an enlarged metaconule in <italic>Mimotona</italic>.

The descriptions of facets here are based on three primary texts, Crompton <xref rid="pone.0012838-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, Butler <xref rid="pone.0012838-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and L&#x000f3;pez-Mart&#x000ed;nez <xref rid="pone.0012838-LpezMartnez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In the first, wear facets are described for Mesozoic mammals and compared to modern marsupials to better understand the origin and homology of tribosphenic teeth. Although the teeth of basal duplicidentates can easily be correlated to the tribosphenic type, several derived conditions within Duplicidentata differ significantly from the primitive tribosphenic condition and require careful study. These include the loss of a stylar shelf and the expansion of the distal portion of upper teeth to include a significant post cingulum/hypocone. Butler <xref rid="pone.0012838-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> specifically dealt with taxa that exhibited similar features, such as primates and rodents, and their functional and homological implications, but used a different wear facet nomenclature. L&#x000f3;pez-Mart&#x000ed;nez <xref rid="pone.0012838-LpezMartnez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> studied the wear facets of lagomorphs and their ancestors, using the nomenclature of Crompton <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bown1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, which we follow here, while incorporating additional facets for novel morphology (e.g. facet 7).</p><p>In general, mimotonid molar teeth share all of the primary wear facets of Crompton <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bown1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g004">figure 4</xref>. Due to the predominance of lateral motion within duplicidentates, the teeth are characterized by having several prominent lateral wear facets. The entire mesial width of upper molars becomes a wear facet as the protocone and the connected precingulum are worn against the distal wall of the trigonid of the corresponding lower tooth (combined facets 1 and 5). Although Butler <xref rid="pone.0012838-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and L&#x000f3;pez-Mart&#x000ed;nez <xref rid="pone.0012838-LpezMartnez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> recognized these facet in lagomorphs, the condition in mimotonids is more similar to the pattern described by Crompton <xref rid="pone.0012838-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, particularly where the buccal aspect of this feature is separated into two distinct facets, one high on the paracone (facet 1a) and one along the buccal extent of the precingulum (facet 1b). As a functional unit, these facets wear the distal border of the corresponding trigonid and mesiolingual portion of the talonid basin. <italic>Gomphos</italic>, as in other tribosphenic teeth, also have an additional wear facet 6 that projects distobuccally from the protocone and occludes with the area of the entoconid on the corresponding lower tooth. This feature is minor in molar teeth that have a hypocone, but more prominent in premolar teeth where the hypocone is absent. With wear, an additional facet emerges on the lingual side of the paracone that occludes with the area mesial to the hypoconid (facet 3). These relationships are consistent with the interpretation of the mesiolingual cusp in the molars, or the isolated lingual cusp in the premolars, as the protocone. The mesiobuccal cusp of molars is recognized as the paracone (the isolated buccal cusp on the premolars is discussed below). In occlusion, the protocone rests within the mesiolingual portion of the talonid basin of the corresponding lower tooth, in both molars and premolars. The paracone (in molars) also wears against the mesoconid and part of the hypoconid, as evidenced by wear facet 3.</p><fig id="pone-0012838-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0012838.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Drawings and SEM images of cheek teeth of <italic>Gomphos elkema</italic>.</title><p>A, upper and lower molar teeth line drawings showing major cusps and cingula.

This interpretation also recognizes two clear buccal cusps that represent the paracone-metacone complex, with the absence of a stylar region. Several mimotonids also show a slight inflation along the preprotocrista that marks a minor paraconule <xref rid="pone.0012838-Meng3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. While previous authors have considered the central cusp in mimotonids the metaconule <xref rid="pone.0012838-Meng4" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, that interpretation has not been applied to the &#x02018;central cusp&#x02019; of stem or crown lagomorphs (although see discussion below of <xref rid="pone.0012838-VanValen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>). Our interpretation of the lagomorph cusp as the metaconule is logically based on cusp positions, albeit remarkable in that in recognizes such an enlarged metaconule &#x02014; roughly equal in size to the paracone, metacone, and protocone. While the size is atypical, considering this cusp the metacone, as previous authors have done for lagomorphs, would also necessitate invoking the presence of an abnormally large cusp somewhere else on the crown. We argue that the simplest interpretation, based on topology, is that the central cusp within mimotonids is the metaconule.</p><p>In <italic>Gomphos</italic>, the metaconule also exhibits wear facets that are consistent with those of earlier tribosphenic mammals, although one major difference is observed with regard to occlusion. The metaconule occludes in resting position within the distobuccal portion of the talonid basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). More precisely, a minor saddle occurs along the distal border of the talonid between the hypoconulid and the hypoconid on which the premetaconule crista rests. This relationship is in contrast to nearly all other tribosphenic mammals, where the metaconule occludes just outside the talonid basin between the hypoconid-hypoconulid. While this is atypical, it is functionally necessary to compensate for an enlarged, and lingually shifted, metaconule as in <italic>Gomphos</italic>. The hypocone, then, occludes just distal to the distolingual portion of the lower tooth, where expected. The wear facets associated with these cusps are easily reconciled with the tribosphenic pattern, such that a prominent wear facet 4 is present along the metacone-metaconule complex that wears much of the distobuccal area of the talonids basin. As shown by Crompton <xref rid="pone.0012838-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> for tribosphenic mammals, the facet is found along the mesial slope of this crista. Crompton <xref rid="pone.0012838-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> also shows that the facet is primarily found between the metacone and metaconule, as is the condition in <italic>Gomphos</italic>.</p><p>In this interpretation, the distal portion of the molars is composed of a hypocone and a postcingulum that has expanded to the buccal margin of the tooth. The postcingulum includes a wear facet that is partially homologous with facet 2 of Crompton <xref rid="pone.0012838-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The facet extends, however, to the lingual portion of the tooth and wears against the anterior position of the trigonid of the next sequentially lower molar and the distal portion of the talonid of the next molar mesially. While the buccal portion of the upper molar tooth is homologous to wear facet 2, the lingual portion is homologous to L&#x000f3;pez-Mart&#x000ed;nez ' <xref rid="pone.0012838-LpezMartnez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> wear facet 7. Within rodents, Butler <xref rid="pone.0012838-Butler1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> recognized facets 1 and 5 along the distal length of the upper molars in sciurids, which have a hypocone, but the nomenclature of L&#x000f3;pez-Mart&#x000ed;nez <xref rid="pone.0012838-LpezMartnez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> is adopted here for mimotonids.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Duplicidentate premolars: the molarization of premolars and the trouble with cusp homology</title><p>The deciduous premolars of <italic>Gomphos</italic> (particularly specimen MAE BU 14425) are easily recognizable as tribosphenic teeth, being generally similar to molar teeth.

Specifically, this cusp occludes outside the talonid basin, between the hypoconid and hypoconulid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). A second line of evidence for interpretation as the metacone is the position of the buccal cusp relative to the lingual cusp. With respect to the mesiodistal axis of the tooth row, the buccal cusp is found significantly distal to the protocone, approximating the exact relative position of the metacone and protocone observed in molars. This interpretation, which suggests a distal shift of the &#x02018;ancestral&#x02019; paracone, is also consistent with the transformation seen in the lower premolars where the talonids are shorter then those of the molars due to the absence of a mesostylid and mesoconid.</p><p>If the original buccal cusp of mimotonids is, indeed, a distally shifted paracone, which becomes a metacone, this suggests that the second buccal cusp of lagomorphs has been added mesially to the primary buccal cusp. Although we will discuss cusp homology among stem lagomorphs later, it is important to look at these taxa now in regard to the evidence they show that supports a second buccal cusp is added mesially within duplicidentates. Within the crown group, the third and fourth premolars of leporids are fully molariform in that they exhibit two buccal cusps and two lingual cusps.

A survey of the AMNH collections has revealed several specimens that show a minor second buccal cusp that is mesial to the primary cusp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Although rare, these occurrences show that a second buccal cusp is incipiently present in <italic>Desmatolagus gobiensis</italic> P<sup>3</sup>s and supports the notion that a mesial cusp is added to an isolated buccal cusp evolutionarily.</p><p>The hypothesis that a mesial cusp was added to an isolated paracone, however, creates a nomenclatural conflict. Given that the primary buccal cusp of mimotonids evolved from the paracone of basal eutherians, our interpretation suggests that the distal buccal cusp in living and extinct lagomorphs should be considered the paracone, and the &#x02018;secondary&#x02019; buccal cusp (or that added mesially) is either a novel cusp, or another known tribosphenic cusp (e.g., parastyle). This is problematic in the context of topological nomenclature, which we support here, because it is clear that the primary buccal cusp shifts distally and becomes the metacone in both position and function.</p><p>Another alternative would be to name the isolated (i.e. primary) buccal cusp in duplicidentates the metacone. One could argue that this scenario suggests that the isolated buccal cusp of earlier eutherians should be renamed the metacone as well. We argue that this approach unnecessarily complicates the nomenclature, and is likely to confuse cusp homologies among premolars of earlier taxa. Ultimately, the situation is complicated because the evolution of buccal cusps within duplicidentates seems to be atypical from most other mammal lineages. Tribosphenic placental ancestors have an isolated buccal cusp, considered the paracone, and give rise to many lineages in which a second buccal cusp is added distally, called the metacone. Here we show that in rare instances, a second cusp is added mesially (as in duplicidentates), but that the secondary cusp functions exactly as the paracone, whereas the primary cusp has likely undergone a distal shift (relative to the protocone) and had begun to function as the metacone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).

We now know that the buccal cusp in the premolars of mimotonids should be considered the paracone based on the its clear evolution from a paracone in earlier lineages, but that a secondary buccal cusp is added mesially as premolars become molarized within stem lagomorphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). We argue here that this newly acquired second mesial cusp should then be considered the paracone (which is functionally and topologically supported), and the &#x02018;original&#x02019; buccal cusp in mimotonids should then be considered the metacone. This evolutionary scenario is nearly identical to the condition observed in the premolars of some lemurs <xref rid="pone.0012838-Jernvall1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, which the authors described as a <italic>discontinuity in cusp homology</italic>. In that study, Jernvall et al. <xref rid="pone.0012838-Jernvall1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> show convincingly that some bamboo lemurs (<italic>Hapalemur</italic>) exhibit premolars that are transitionally becoming molariform by adding a mesial cusp to the previously dominant isolated buccal cusp. As Jernvall et al. <xref rid="pone.0012838-Jernvall1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> also point out, both Van Valen <xref rid="pone.0012838-VanValen3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and Butler <xref rid="pone.0012838-Butler2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> showed that a similar discontinuity exists in the evolution of perissodactyl premolars where a second lingual cusp has been added mesially to a purported protocone in several lineages on the P<sup>3</sup>, where typically it has been viewed that a hypocone is added distally to a protocone. Combined, these studies suggest that, although rare, certain lineages add a second cusp mesially to the paracone or protocone, and that the fossil record does not support the assumption that secondary cusps are always added distally. While we agree that the scenario described in these lemurs closely matches that observed here in mimotonids, we believe that it is not a <italic>discontinuity in homology</italic>, as described by Jernvall et al. <xref rid="pone.0012838-Jernvall1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, but rather the unique character transformation seen in these lineages calls for a <italic>discontinuity in nomenclature</italic>. The homology itself, or which cusp becomes which, is nicely demonstrated at the population level by Jernvall et al. <xref rid="pone.0012838-Jernvall1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, and strongly reinforced via our example from the fossil record. The primary question that remains is how should cusp nomenclature best reconcile an increasingly better understanding of cusp evolution with a modern understanding of the plasticity of developmental systems that form these cusps? Or more bluntly, should we expect cusp nomenclature to reconcile these issues?</p><p>To this end, we outline here the details of this third alternative, that a nomenclatural shift should takes place similar to what Jernvall et al. <xref rid="pone.0012838-Jernvall1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> suggested for lemurs. Our argument is grounded in the assumption that <italic>cusp nomenclature should be strictly a topological consideration</italic>. Homology is a hypothesis most-often framed within a phylogenetic tree; whereas, we argue that names should describe morphology. In this scenario, the single buccal cusp of mimotonids should continue to be referred to as the paracone because this maintains the most historical consistency with older taxa (i.e., historical congruency). Once a second buccal cusp appears, as in the P<sup>4</sup> of stem lagomorphs (e.g. <italic>Dawsonolagus</italic>), the distal cusp should be considered as the metacone and the (newly acquired) cusp as the paracone. In addition, the isolated, single buccal cusp in P<sup>3</sup> of stem lagomorphs and ochotonids should also be called the metacone when a hypocone is present, as the appearance of hypocone clearly distinguishes the isolated mesial cusp as a metacone topologically. The incipient mesially placed buccal cusp in <italic>Desmatolagus</italic> should also be referred as the paracone. This solution maintains meaningful nomenclature, recognizing the evolutionary history of the buccal cusp with respect to older taxa, but also takes into account that there are different evolutionary pathways that create the &#x02018; same cusps,&#x02019; as demonstrated by the examples lemurs <xref rid="pone.0012838-Jernvall1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and horses <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Butler2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, recent experimental and quantitative modeling work in the development of tooth cusps supports the notion that small genetic changes may have wide ranging effects on tooth cusp morphology <xref rid="pone.0012838-SalazarCiudad1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Kangas1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Jernvall2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.

More relevant to our study, Jernvall et. al <xref rid="pone.0012838-Jernvall3" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> showed experimentally that, while mice and voles have nearly identical genetic control of initial cusp patterning, they exhibit different overall adult cusp positions due largely to the different position in which the second cusp in their lower first molar appears. In voles, the first and second cusps to develop are offset from one another laterally, whereas they are parallel in mice. These initial patterns have a cascade effect on the remaining cusp formation. In short, the parallel cusp patterning observed in mice seems to be the product of an initial mesial shift of their second cusp. Combined, these studies show that developmental mechanisms exist that could create the shift in cusp position observed in both duplicidentates and lemurs, and more importantly, how subsequent cusps could form around a shifted cusp in what is a typical tribosphenic pattern.

In this interpretation, this wear facet would extend from the &#x0201c;metacone&#x0201d; buccally to an unnamed cusp. Crompton <xref rid="pone.0012838-Crompton1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, however, recognized that such a facet extends from the metaconule to the metacone in tribosphenic mammals. Given the similarity to facet patterns and overall topology of cusps with mimotonids, it is more plausible to interpret the central cusp of lagomorphs as the metaconule, rather then to invoke a significant lingual shift in the metacone and the appearance of a novel cusp buccally, as L&#x000f3;pez-Mart&#x000ed;nez suggests <xref rid="pone.0012838-LpezMartnez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Some confusion has also been the result of the position of the <italic>central</italic> cusp. While the cusp is centrally located within the crowns of mimotonids and lagomorphs, the cusp is positioned at the distal border of the trigon, as formed by the primary tribosphenic cusps, and only appears in the central portion of the crown due to a significant expansion of the hypocone/postcingulum. Understanding this relationship also allows us to draw important conclusions regarding the buccal border of cheek teeth in stem lagomorphs. As is typical with wear, a tripartite structure is found along the buccal margin of lagomorph check teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). These structures have been problematic to interpret (or usually not recognized) as authors have been unclear how the buccal lophs are related to tribosphenic cusps. The three lophs represent the paracone, metacone, and buccal extension of the post cingulum, respectively, mesially to distally. This pattern is repeated throughout stem- and crown lagomorphs and is easily resolved with our interpretation of lagomorph tooth cusps. We, therefore, argue that the central cusp of lagomorphs is positioned topologically where the metaconule should be, functions as a metaconule with regard to wear facets (albeit, as discussed, has a slightly different occlusal position), and should be considered homologous with the metaconule in all living and extinct lagomorphs.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>The crescentic valley</title><p>Once the homology of the central cusp has been established, it is then possible to understand the crescentic valley (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) in light of its tribosphenic origin. The central cusp is found just buccal to the apex of the valley, and two prominent wings of the valley project mesially and distally to the buccal portion of the crown. The distal wing of the crescentic valley is here interpreted as the talon basin as it serves to separate the postcingulum from the metaconule/premetaconule crista. Indeed, with wear, the postcingulum is sometimes completely separated from the rest of the crown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, see <italic>Dawsonolagus</italic>).

The strongest trend in the lower teeth is the loss of a paraconid, a condition that occurs in many other mammalian groups, particularly rodent lineages. The simple two-lophed teeth of adult lagomorphs make it difficult to discern typical tribosphenic structures. As with upper teeth, however, once newly erupted and unworn teeth are studied, it becomes clear that the lower teeth of lagomorphs are typically tribosphenic.

Two strong cusps, the hypoconid and entoconid, are distinguished on the talonid. At the distal end of the talonid, the hypoconulid has transformed from a cusp to a loph. As pointed out in mimotonids, particularly within the molars, the mesial portion of the talonids has expanded to compensate for a mesoconid and mesostylid.</p><p>This study does not deal directly with the lower third premolar of lagomorphs, the evolution of which has played a significant role in the systematics of the group (see <xref rid="pone.0012838-LpezMartnez2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, for a summary). In contrast to other lower teeth, the P<sub>3</sub> seems to have undergone substantial evolution within the crown group, largely via the addition of several lophate structures. In that respect, much of this newly derived morphology are novel structures, and in our opinion, are not easily, or appropriately, identified as tribosphenic structures. Primitively, as indicated by mimotonids, the P<sup>3</sup> appears to be a simplified trigonid and talonid, with four prominent cusps (protoconid, metaconid, hypoconid, and entoconid). Stem lagomorphs then simplify their P<sub>3</sub>s, primarily through the reduction of the lingual portion of the trigonid, and loss of the metaconid. This gives the overall &#x02018;C&#x02019; shape that is typical for early lagomorphs.

In addition to important insights regarding the proper homology of duplicidentate cusps, we are able to outline several broad evolutionary trends in the evolution of duplicidentate dentitions. Most obvious among these is that duplicidentate cheek teeth are distinguished from more typical tribosphenic teeth by the loss of a stylar region and the development of a strong hypocone/post cingulum, first in molars, later in premolars. Mimotonids also show distinct differences between premolars and molars. Within their lower tooth row, their talonids (primarily within premolars) are generally shorter anteriorly via the absence of the mesostylid and mesoconid. The correlative condition in upper teeth is the absence of multiple cusps on the buccal margin of the premolars &#x02014; with no cusp that <italic>functions</italic> as the tribosphenic paracone within mimotonids. While the absence of the mesostylids and mesoconids is maintained in lagomorphs (and the condition is subsequently acquired in the molars), the appearance of a second buccal upper cusp in premolars has a complicated history, atypical for mammals. The second buccal cusp initially occurs within P<sup>4</sup>, and later in P<sup>3</sup> (leporids); however, certain lagomorphs (ochotonids) never develop a second buccal cusp in P<sup>3</sup>. Both Wood <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and Bohlin <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bohlin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> recognized delayed evolution of premolars relative to molars in the fossil record of lagomorphs.</p><p>Because the isolated buccal cusp of mimotonids functions as a metacone rather then a paracone, we propose a <italic>discontinuity in cusp nomenclature</italic> for duplicidentates, similar to that described in lemurs <xref rid="pone.0012838-Jernvall1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, where the isolated buccal cusp of mimotonids should be recognized as the paracone, but after appearance of a second buccal cusp, or a hypocone, the original buccal cusp should then be called the metacone. While this is conceptually complicated, the resultant system allows for the best resolution of the historical constraint of cusp terminology, recognizing that the buccal cusp within mimotonids evolved from the paracone of earlier branching ancestral mammals. Unlike most mammals, however, the original buccal cusp of lagomorphs has been shifted distally and becomes the metacone functionally. Our system considers the unique evolutionary history of each buccal cusp, while embracing the topological considerations of homology among lagomorphs as compared to other mammals. In short, we call it the metacone when it becomes the metacone topologically. Most importantly, however, this system recognizes the dynamic, and often disparate, developmental processes that may lead to the appearance of a new cusp. In short, our argument is that it is much more easy to discern topology of form then the underlying developmental and molecular processes that produce form, and therefore, a nomenclature based on topology will be much more stable, and in turn, more useful.</p><p>Based on the study of mimotonid material, it is clear that the prominent central cusp is homologous with the metaconule.

Despite this confusion, it's clear that both Averianov <xref rid="pone.0012838-Averianov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and Van Valen <xref rid="pone.0012838-VanValen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> recognized that the protocone is the mesiolingual cusp within lagomorphs and that the two buccal cusps are the paracone and metacone, but differ in their assessment of the central cusp.</p><p>Van Valen <xref rid="pone.0012838-VanValen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> suggested that an intermediary between <italic>Mimotona</italic> and lagomorphs is needed to clearly show the central cusp of lagomorphs is indeed the metaconule. While phylogenetic studies do not clearly show that <italic>Gomphos</italic> is this intermediary, a prominent metaconule is pervasive throughout Mimotonidae. Our work presented here, as well as that summarized by others, shows that the central cusp of lagomorphs functions as the metaconule in lagomorphs, and is topologically consistent with that interpretation given other prominent tribosphenic structures.</p><p>Averianov <xref rid="pone.0012838-VanValen2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> conducted the last study to deal specifically with cusp homology among lagomorphs, where he used occlusal patterns to suggest that the central cusp of lagomorphs was a novel structure. We agree with Averianov's <xref rid="pone.0012838-Averianov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> assessment that the central cusp is not one of the primary tribosphenic cusps (i.e., the protocone, paracone, or metacone), but do not think that this implies that the central cusp is an entirely new feature. Averianov <xref rid="pone.0012838-Averianov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> suggested that mimotonids do not have crescentic valley, and implies that this means the feature is newly evolved in lagomorphs. Given the clear relationship between mimotonids and lagomorphs, the mimotonid metaconule is available, and almost certainly evolved into the central cusp of lagomorphs. As we have shown here, the crescentic valley is also present within Mimotonidae in the form of the talonid and trigonid basins, but has not deepened yet to form the crescentic valley of Lagomorpha. The strong trend in increased unilaterally hypsodonty (leading to hypseledonty) within Duplicidentata facilitates the deepening of the talon and trigon basins to form a crescentic valley, and ultimately, the shallowing of this valley in living lagomorphs.</p><p>Several authors, in particular Averianov <xref rid="pone.0012838-Averianov1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, have given thorough discussions as to <italic>why</italic> lagomorphs have developed a central cusp. The question should now be similarly asked with regard to mimotonids; or more precisely, why have duplicidentates enlarged what is typically a minor cusp, the metaconule? As others have pointed out, lagomorph mastication differs from most other mammals in that their power stroke is in the lateral direction. This is evidenced by the jaw musculature in living leporids, which have a reduced <italic>temporalis m</italic>. (primary crushing muscle) and an enlarged <italic>pterygoid m</italic>. (primarily involved in lateral jaw motion) <xref rid="pone.0012838-Meng1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. This is in contrast to rodents, whose power stroke is most typically propalinal. As is well documented within rodents, many groups develop lophate teeth that serve to maximize the mastication efficiency via increasing enamel surfaces. In many ways, the metaconule and associated hypostriae serve a similar purpose for duplicidentates. The benefit of enlarging the metaconule is clear, but more importantly, the occlusion of the metaconule within the talonid basin along with the protocone has the additional advantage of making the lateral stroke more useful by putting more prominent cusps in direct contact with the talonid basin during a greater duration of the chewing motion. This is also the case for the deepening of the talon and trigon basins (i.e. crescentic valley). More derived lagomorphs also develop lingual hypostriae that increase the wear capacity of teeth, and the reduction of the depth of the crescentic valley is correlated with expansion of the hypostria <xref rid="pone.0012838-Sych1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>; both of which serve the same function. All of these structures, the metaconule, crescentic valley, and hypostria, are aligned so that they increase the efficiency of the lateral power stroke of duplicidentates. Their presence also highlights an important evolutionary trend within duplicidentates that is tightly correlated with the development of unilateral hypsodonty; that is, in evolutionary sequence, the enlargement of the metaconule, deepening of the crescentic valley, and finally, the development of a lingual hypostria. The metaconule's increased utility is the product of its increased size, whereas the development of the crescentic valley and the lingual hypostria necessitate increased height of the tooth column. This is accomplished initially by an increase in unilateral hypsodonty, and ultimately, by the evolution of hypseledonty in lagomorphs.</p><p>It is also important to revisit the work of Ehik <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, who was the first to suggest that there is serial homology among lagomorph cheek teeth. Topological comparisons strongly support this, as the teeth are nearly identical in crown lagomorphs. The only difference is the degree of molarization of the premolar. It now is clear that the &#x02018;J&#x02019; pattern of some fossil and extant lagomorph P<sup>3</sup>s is the result of the lack of development of a secondary buccal cusp, and the variable buccal expansion of the preprotocrista. We show that the evolutionary history of duplicidentates includes the delayed evolution of a secondary buccal cusp in premolars, as further supported by the incipient presence of a paracone in some stem lagomorphs. In general, Ehik <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> was correct in his assessment of the serial homology among lagomorph teeth, and his general recognition that the upper tooth row of lagomorphs shows varying degrees of molarization. More precisely, however, it's clear that the premolars and molars of duplicidentates have different evolutionary histories. It is difficult, if not impossible, to trace the history of duplicidentate molars to ancestors that do not have the primary tribosphenic cusp, and in turn, understanding the sequence of origin of those cusps in problematic. Because of this, it's unclear whether the evolutionary sequence is the same as that observed within premolars. What is certain is that the molarization of premolars happened much later in the evolutionary history of duplicidentates than it did in the molars. Wood <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> struggled with our inability to recognize whether molariform premolars and molars developed the same way, and were in turn, homologous, and his overall discussion of the evolution of lagomorph premolars was prescient:</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic>&#x02018;For the sake of simplicity, and in the entire absence of any evidence one way or the other, it has been assumed in the present work that the cusps of the premolars are actually homologous to those with which they appear to be homologous, but that they may not have passed through the same stages in reaching this ultimate pattern.&#x02019;</italic>
</p><p>(<xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>:355)</p></disp-quote><p>This begs the question: how do we actually recognize serial homology? We can diagnose it via topology; however, its definition is more complicated than recognizing the ancestry of lineages as we do for primary homology; we must identify the underlying processes that produced the structures, and show that they are similar. At the level of teeth, it's obvious that premolars and molars are serial homologous, but the serial homology of the detailed structures (i.e. cusps) is unclear as the developmental processes that likely produced them will remain unknown. For this reason, we defer to Wood's <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> quote above.</p><p>Given the system presented here, and the recent phylogenetic studies on duplicidentates, it is useful to review some of the historical treatments of lagomorph tooth cusp homology again. It seems that many early workers were framing their ideas of the homology of the central cusp based on which tribosphenic cusp was the primary cusp. Much of the disagreement homologizing it with the protocone <xref rid="pone.0012838-Major1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Osborn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> or the paracone <xref rid="pone.0012838-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012838-Ehik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> revolved around the advancement of the &#x02018;premolar analogy&#x02019; theory that shifted the focus from the protocone to the paracone. After that, Wood <xref rid="pone.0012838-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and Bohlin <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bohlin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> were the first to suggest the central cusp was the metacone. It is more important to note, however, that both of these workers presented expansive discussions regarding other homologies, and were both in strong agreement that the true homology of the central cusp would not be known until more primitive fossil lagomorphs were discovered. Bohlin <xref rid="pone.0012838-Bohlin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> also gave an interesting, but brief, discussion regarding the polarity of the loss/appearance of the paracone in lagomorph premolars. He rightly concluded that, given the present data, it was unclear whether the paracone had been lost, or had yet to evolve. It now seems apparent that the premolar paracone of lagomorphs is a derived feature relative to their ancestors, the mimotonids.</p><p>We present here the first tooth cusp nomenclatural system for duplicidentates that spans all living and extinct species and is based on well-resolved phylogenies and the examination of fossils that bridge the morphological gap between tribosphenic teeth and typical lagomorph teeth. We outline the evolutionary history of several important cusps, and in turn, highlight their homologies, but argue that a nomenclatural system should not always mirror a hypothesis of homology. While we present strong evidence that shows that the central cusp of lagomorphs is the metaconule, an understanding of the homology among premolars is complicated by an evolutionary history that seems atypical as compared to other mammalian groups. We are confident in our assessment of evolutionary history of premolar cusps, particularly the buccal cusps, but we present a nomenclatural system that serves to be functionally useful, yet also recognizes the complex history of premolars cusps. The evolution of buccal cusp within duplicidentates also shows that the tribosphenic pattern has evolved in several ways. We refrain from introducing new terminology for the P<sub>3</sub>s of lagomorphs, as it is apparent that, although the tooth is derived from a simple tribosphenic precursor, the complexity observed within crown lagomorphs is highly apomorphic and not reasonably homologized with tribosphenic structures.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Andrea Bair is thanked for providing original digital files to reproduce <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012838-g001">figure 1</xref>.
