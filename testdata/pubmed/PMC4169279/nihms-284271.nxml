Recent data highlight the delicate balance in higher mammals between energy utilization, robust immune defense against pathogens, and autoimmunity<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. In humans, loss of tolerance to self-antigens results in a number of diseases including type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Knowledge of the self antigens involved in autoimmune processes is not only important for understanding the disease etiology, but can also be used to develop accurate diagnostic tests. In addition, physicians may someday utilize antigen-specific therapies to target auto-reactive immune cells for destruction or quiescence.</p><p id="P6">Traditional approaches to identification of autoantibody targets largely rely on expression of fragmented cDNA libraries. Important technical limitations of this method include the small fraction of clones expressing in-frame coding sequences (with a lower boundary of 6%)<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, and the highly skewed representation of differentially expressed cDNAs. Nevertheless, expression cloning has led to the discovery of many important autoantigens<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Strides have been made to improve peptide display systems<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, but there remains an important unmet need for better display libraries and methods to analyze binding interactions.</p><p id="P7">Here, we have constructed the first synthetic representation of the complete human proteome, which we have engineered for display as peptides on the surface of T7 phage. This T7 &#x0201c;peptidome&#x0201d; library (T7-Pep) was extensively characterized and found to be both faithful to its <italic>in silico</italic> design and uniform in its representation. We combined our T7-Pep library with high-throughput DNA sequencing to identify autoantibody-peptide interactions, a method we call phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq). This approach provides several advantages over traditional methods, including comprehensive and unbiased proteome representation, peptide enrichment quantification, and a streamlined, multiplexed protocol requiring just one round of enrichment. We have applied PhIP-Seq to interrogate the autoantibody repertoire in the spinal fluid of patients with neurological autoimmunity and identified both known and novel autoantigens. We further demonstrate how PhIP-Seq can also be used more generally to identify peptide-protein interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Construction and Characterization of T7-Pep</title><p id="P8">We sought to create a synthetic representation of the human proteome. We began by extracting all open reading frame (ORF) sequences available from build 35.1 of the human genome (24,239; 23% of which had &#x0201c;predicted&#x0201d; status). When there were multiple isoforms of the same protein, we randomly selected one representative ORF. We modified the codon usage by eliminating restriction sites used for cloning and by substituting very low abundance codons in <italic>E. coli</italic> with more abundant synonymous codons. We parsed this database into sequences of 108 nucleotides encoding 36 amino acid tiles with an overlap of seven residues between consecutive peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), the estimated size of a linear epitope. Finally, the stop codon of each ORF was removed so that all peptides could be cloned in-frame with a C-terminal FLAG tag.</p><p id="P9">The final library design includes 413,611 peptides spanning the entire coding region of the human genome. The peptide-coding sequences were synthesized as 140-mer oligonucleotides with primer sequences on releasable DNA microarrays in 19 pools of 22,000 oligos each, PCR-amplified and cloned into a derivative of the T7Select 10-3b phage display vector (Novagen; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). We also generated two additional libraries comprising the N-terminal and C-terminal peptidomes (T7-NPep, T7-CPep), which encode only the first and last 24 codons from each ORF.</p><p id="P10">The extent of vector re-ligation, multiple insertions, mutations, and correct in-frame phage-displayed peptides was determined by plaque PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), clone sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), and FLAG expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) of randomly sampled phage from all subpools. Sequencing revealed that 83% of the inserts lacked frameshifting mutations. These data indicate that a much greater fraction of in-frame, ORF-derived peptides is expressed by our synthetic libraries compared to those constructed from cDNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P11">After combining 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> phage from each subpool and amplifying the final library, Illumina sequencing was performed at a median depth of 45-fold coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) and detected 91.2% of the expected clones. Chao1 analysis was performed to estimate the actual library complexity (assuming infinite sampling), which predicted that &#x0003e;91.8% of the library was represented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In addition, T7-Pep is highly uniform, with 78% of the library members within 10-fold abundance (having been sequenced between 10 and 100 times). These data suggest that our library encodes a much more complete and uniform representation of the human proteome than can otherwise be achieved with existing technologies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We next optimized a phage immunoprecipitation protocol for detecting antibody-peptide interactions within complex mixtures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). By combining this protocol with T7-Pep and deep sequencing DNA analysis, we have developed a new method to quantitatively profile autoantibody repertoires in patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PhIP-Seq analysis of spinal fluid from a PND patient with NOVA autoantibodies</title><p id="P13">Cancers often elicit cellular and humoral immune responses against tumor antigens which may limit disease progression<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. In rare cases, tumor immunity can recognize central nervous system (CNS) antigens, triggering a devastating autoimmune process called paraneoplastic neurological disorder (PND). Clinical presentations of PND are heterogeneous and correlate with the CNS autoantigens involved. PND has served as a model for CNS autoimmunity, and the application of phage display to PND autoantigen discovery has met with much success<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p id="P14">To assess the performance of PhIP-Seq for autoantigen discovery, we examined a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a 63-year-old female (Patient A) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented with a PND syndrome and was found to have anti-NOVA autoantibodies<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. The NOVA autoantigen (neurooncological ventral antigen, or &#x0201c;Ri&#x0201d;) is commonly targeted in PND triggered by lung or gynecological cancers, and results in ataxia with or without opsoclonus/myoclonus. A concentration of 2 &#x003bc;g/ml of CSF antibody was spiked with 2 ng/ml of an antibody specific to SAPK4 (positive control) to monitor enrichment of the targeted peptide on protein A/G beads. Despite extensive washing, 298,667 unique clones (83% of the input library) were found in the immunoprecipitate. A significant correlation was observed between the abundance of input clones and immunoprecipitated clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), likely due to weak nonspecific interactions with the beads.</p><p id="P15">To approximate the expected distribution of IP'ed clones&#x02019; abundances, we employed a two-parameter generalized Poisson (GP) model (as recently demonstrated for RNA-seq data<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and found that this distribution family fits the data well at various input abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We calculated the GP parameter values for each input abundance level<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and regressed these parameters to form our null model for the calculation of enrichment significance (p-values) of each clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Comparing the two PhIP-Seq replicates revealed that the most significantly enriched clones were the same in both replicas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), highlighting the assay`s reproducibility. This contrasts dramatically with a comparison of clones enriched by two different patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Performing PhIP-Seq in the absence of patient antibodies identified phage capable of binding to the protein A/G beads. We thus defined Patient A positive clones as those clones with a reproducible Log10 p-value greater than a cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, dashed red line), but not significantly enriched on beads alone (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>-3</sup>). Patient A positives included the expected SAPK4-targeted positive control peptide (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>-15</sup>), the expected NOVA1 autoantigen (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>-15</sup>), and six additional candidate autoantigens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We tested three of these predictions by expressing full-length TGIF2LX, DBR1 and PCDH1 in 293T cells and immunoblotting with patient CSF. TGIF2LX (TGFB-Induced factor homeobox 2-like, X-linked) was confirmed as a novel autoantigen, as we detected strong immunoreactivity at the expected molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Full-length DBR1 and PCDH1, while expressed well in 293T cells (not shown), were not detected by CSF antibodies. We observed two bands in the untransfected lysate migrating at approximately 50 and 62 KDa, representing endogenously expressed proteins that correspond either to untested candidates or to false negatives of the PhIP-Seq assay.</p><p id="P17">Strikingly, the hypothetical protein LOC26080 had seven distinct peptides that were significantly enriched, and they all appeared to share a nine residue repetitive motif. We used MEME software<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> to characterize this motif, which represents the likely epitope recognized by Patient A's autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>PhIP-Seq analysis of spinal fluid from PND patients with uncharacterized autoantibodies</title><p id="P18">Having established that PhIP-Seq could reliably identify known and novel autoantigens, we examined CSF from two additional patients who had suggestive PND presentations but tested negative for a panel of commercially available PND autoantigens. Patient B was a 59-year-old female with NSCLC, who presented with dysarthria, ataxia, head titubation and muscular rigidity. PhIP-Seq analysis yielded three particularly interesting candidate autoantigens: TGIF2LX, CTAG2 (cancer/testis antigen 2), and GAD65 (glutamate decarboxylase 2) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Both TGIF2LX and CTAG2 were confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Surprisingly, Patient B, like Patient A, was auto-reactive against TGIF2LX. The enriched peptide was distinct from, but overlapped the peptide enriched by Patient A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P19">CTAG2 is a member of a family of cancer/testis antigen (CTAG) proteins that are normally germ cell restricted, but frequently expressed in cancers and often elicit anti-tumor immune responses<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Several reports have described both humoral and cellular immune responses targeted against CTAG2<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. TGIF2LX is also testis restricted<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and may be a new CTAG family member. As a negative control, we found TGIF2LX reactivity to be absent in the CSF of three patients with non-PND CNS autoimmunity and oligoclonal Ig bands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Having confirmed TGIF2LX autoreactivity in two NSCLC patients, we wondered whether it could be a new biomarker for this disease. However, the serum of 15 additional NSCLC patients without PND did not contain TGIF2LX antibodies detectable by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Neither CTAG2 nor TGIF2LX is expressed in the brain, and thus are unlikely to explain the neurological syndrome experienced by Patient B. GAD65, however, is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. GAD65 is also a well-characterized autoantigen targeted in the autoimmune disorder Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS; OMIM ID 184850). Two non-overlapping GAD65 peptides derived from the domain known to be targeted by pathogenic autoantibodies in SPS patients<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> were enriched by Patient B's CSF. A commercial radioimmunoassay (RIA 81596; Mayo Medical Laboratories), confirmed the presence of high titer anti-GAD65 autoantibodies (5.12 nmol/L; &#x0003e;250 fold above the reference range). Surprisingly, direct immunoblotting with Patient B's CSF did not demonstrate reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), suggesting that denatured GAD65 epitopes are not recognized by Patient B's antibodies. Successful immunoprecipitation of GAD65 from the same cell lysate with CSF confirmed this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Patient C, a 59-year-old female with PND secondary to melanoma, had an unusual presentation that included horizontal gaze palsy. PhIP-Seq analysis of Patient C's CSF yielded five significantly enriched peptides from two homologous members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, TRIM9 and TRIM67 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Both candidate autoantigens were confirmed by immunoblotting lysates from TRIM9- or TRIM67-overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). TRIM67 is expressed in some normal tissues (including skin) and is often highly expressed in melanoma<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. TRIM9 has recently emerged as a brain-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase and has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease processes<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Based on their high degree of homology, our data suggest the possibility that tumor immunity targeting TRIM67 might have spread to, or cross-reacted with TRIM9 in the CNS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). TRIM9 and TRIM67 autoreactivity was not detected in the CSF of three patients with non-PND CNS autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P22">In total, 16 of the candidate autoantigens in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> were available to us as full-length Gateway Entry clones from the ORFeome collection<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Of these, 10 were not confirmed by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation of the full-length protein. We wondered whether this reflected a high rate of false positive discovery inherent to PhIP-Seq, or rather a requirement that the peptides be presented with intact conformation, as was the case for GAD65. We synthesized 9 of these 10 candidate T7 clones, plus 2 additional high confidence T7 clones, for validation in a dot blot assay. Each of these clones exhibited immunoreactivity above background with the appropriate patients&#x02019; spinal fluid as predicted by the PhIPSeq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). This finding indicates that PhIP-Seq analysis can have a low rate of false positive discovery, and supports the hypothesis that the 36 amino acid peptides retain a significant amount of secondary structure during display on the T7 coat.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>PhIP-Seq can be used to identify protein-protein interactions</title><p id="P23">The utility of T7-Pep is not limited to autoantigen identification.

We were again able to utilize the generalized Poisson method for determining the significance of phage clones&#x02019; enrichment. Whereas GST alone did not significantly enrich any library clones (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>-4</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>), PhIP-Seq with GST-RPA2 robustly identified the N-terminal peptide from the known interactor SMARCAL1 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>-14</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), among others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).

Peptides from four proteins known to contain this motif (UNG2, TIPIN, XPA and RAD52) were significantly disrupted by the positions of the breaks between peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). One peptide from UNG2 retained most of the motif and that peptide was correspondingly enriched (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>-5</sup>), demonstrating the power of this approach to identify linear interaction motifs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P24">We have developed a new proteomic technology called Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq), which is based on a synthetic phage library (T7-Pep) made to uniformly express the complete human peptidome on the coat of T7 phage particles. Combining T7-Pep with high throughput DNA sequencing enables a variety of innovative proteomic investigations. In addition to applications in autoimmune disease, PhIP-Seq can be utilized to identify peptide-protein interactions and can be a viable alternative to two-hybrid analyses. From a methodological perspective, the robust single-round enrichment signals and the ability to adapt the assay to 96-well format suggests the feasibility of performing automated PhIP-Seq screens on large sets of samples.</p><p id="P25">Antibodies bind protein antigens by a variety of mechanisms and several studies have uncovered some general themes underlying these interactions. For instance, antibody combining surfaces on natively folded proteins tend to be dominated by &#x0201c;discontinuous&#x0201d; epitopes, which are patches of ~4-14 amino acid side chains formed by two or more noncontiguous peptides brought into proximity during protein folding<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. If the protein is divided into it's constituent peptides, antibody affinity is expected to decrease due to 1) the loss of contacts contributed by noncontiguous residues, and 2) the increased entropic costs of binding a free peptide as opposed to the natively constrained peptide. The degree to which individual peptides are still able to interact with a given antibody is difficult to predict, and is expected to vary widely. While our study demonstrates the utility of 36 amino acid tiles, further work will be required to define the true false negative discovery rate inherent to the use of T7-Pep. Autoantibodies that target normally inaccessible epitopes have also been reported, such as those that recognize proteolytic cleavage products<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, misfolded proteins or protein aggregates<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. Antigen discovery with full-length, folded proteins may thus be less sensitive than tiled peptides in some such circumstances.</p><p id="P26">In our study, performing PhIP-Seq with CSF from a well characterized PND patient (Patient A), identified a known (NOVA1) and a novel, testis-restricted<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> autoantigen (TGIF2LX). Since we also found anti-TGIF2LX antibodies in the spinal fluid of a second PND patient with NSCLC, this protein may represent a new cancer-testis antigen family member, and should be further investigated as a biomarker for PND. PhIP-Seq analysis of CSF from two PND patients with uncharacterized antibodies (Patients B and C) uncovered likely neuronal targets of their autoimmune syndromes. In Patient B, high titer anti-GAD65 antibodies bound two distinct peptides from the region of the protein associated with Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). Interestingly, GAD65 targeting in SPS occurs more often in patients without cancer, raising the possibility that at least part of this neurological syndrome may have been unrelated to the patient's cancer. This finding highlights the utility of unbiased antibody profiling to distinguish between deceptively similar disease states<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>. In Patient C, we identified TRIM9 as a likely neuronal autoantigen and suggest the possibility of epitope spreading from tumor-derived TRIM67 as a potential mechanism. It should be noted that demonstration of a protein's autoreactivity is not evidence for its role in disease pathogenesis, since the autoantibodies might be incidental in nature, arise due to epitope spreading, or might simply exhibit non-cognate cross-reactivity.</p><p id="P27">Several interesting features of the T7-Pep + PhIP-Seq platform emerged during this proof-of-concept study. We found that patient antibodies targeting GAD65 robustly recognized two 36 amino acid peptides, but not the corresponding denatured full-length proteins, indicating that an important degree of conformational information is retained in the peptide library. Second, for proteins with known crystal structures, using tiled peptides can facilitate determination of the antibody clonality, as well as the location of the targeted epitope. Finally, the simultaneous quantification of a large number of peptide enrichments permits the discovery of epitope motifs. Autoantibodies from Patient A targeted seven peptides from a repetitive hypothetical protein, and we were thus able to calculate a motif that most likely represented the antigenic epitope, a task less easily performed with alternative technologies.</p><p id="P28">T7-Pep could be improved in several ways. The generation of longer oligos will decrease the complexity of the library, thereby increasing the sampling depth and making it possible to generate domain libraries that capture more protein-folding units. In addition, PhIP-Seq with libraries of peptides from human pathogens could permit rapid analysis of antibodies to infectious agents, thus aiding vaccine research and the diagnosis of infectious diseases.</p><p id="P29">We have taken a synthetic biological approach to develop a proteomic resource useful in translational medicine. When combined with high throughput DNA sequencing, our methodology permits unbiased and quantitative analysis of autoantibody repertoires in human patients. PhIP-Seq thus complements existing proteomic technologies in the study of autoimmune processes for which the relevant autoantigens remain unknown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S8"><title>METHODS</title><p id="P30">Detailed methods are available in the supplementary online materials at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology">http://www.nature.com/naturebiotechnology</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS284271-supplement-1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e600" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S9"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported in part by grants from the DOD (W81XWH-10-1-0994 and W81XWH-04-1-0197) to S.J.E., and in part by the NIH (K08CA124804), The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (3P30CA023100-25S8), Sontag Foundation Distinguished Scientist Award, and a James S.
