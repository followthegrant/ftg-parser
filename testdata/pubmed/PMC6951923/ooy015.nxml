The conventional problem-based infrastructure defines what data are employed to build this discourse and how it unfolds. Such a health care model tends to bias data for risk assessment and risk management toward problems and does not capture data about health assets or strengths. The purpose of this article is to explore and illustrate the incorporation of a strengths-based data capture model into risk assessment and management by harnessing data-driven and person-centered health assets using the Omaha System. This strengths-based data capture model encourages and enables use of whole-person data including strengths at the individual level and, in aggregate, at the population level. When aggregated, such data may be used for the development of strengths-based population health metrics that will promote evaluation of data-driven and person-centered care, outcomes, and value.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>strengths</kwd><kwd>risks</kwd><kwd>value-based care</kwd><kwd>health assets</kwd><kwd>health data</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Future of Nursing Scholar award</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="4"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In this era of health care, given resource constraints and new payment models, there has been a focus on the value of care, which can be defined differently based on the adopted perspective from payers, clinicians, health care industry, caregivers, or patients.<xref rid="ooy015-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> From an economic viewpoint, the value of care is the achieved health outcomes per dollar spent.<xref rid="ooy015-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> This need catalyzes a shift towards risk management to boost performance in health care that is applicable to payers, providers, and patients alike.

The Omaha System is a standardized vocabulary for health and health care.

The Problem concept terms and definitions are intended to be neutral.

Such whole-person data capture could inform clinical judgment regarding care for patients so that effective and person-centered approaches could be created and implemented in their care.

For example, frailty is a common metric used to predict health status for older adults, and such metrics include only problems and signs/symptoms.<xref rid="ooy015-B27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Metrics may better predict overall wellbeing if strengths are incorporated.</p><p>Behavioral and lifestyle changes have often been seen as influential factors on the outcomes of disease management.

Therefore, capturing a patient&#x02019;s strengths not only aligns with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendation to document data about social and behavioral factors in EHRs,<xref rid="ooy015-B4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooy015-B5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> but also presents a potential to better use patient strengths to improve their health outcomes and return in health care value. When health care is perceived to be driven by &#x0201c;care markets&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;<italic>homo economicus</italic>&#x0201d;), the health care return in value has more to do with solutions for problems by addressing &#x0201c;more markets, more complete markets, more perfect markets, more financialization, new technologies, new ways to monetize&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;abandons the project of individual or collective mastery of existence&#x0201d; (ref. <xref rid="ooy015-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, p. 28) . However, management of behavioral and lifestyle factors using patient strengths imply patient engagement, self-management, and personal responsibilities with the underlying principle that humans are essentially &#x0201c;caring people&#x0201d; (&#x0201c;<italic>homines curans</italic>&#x0201d;) and &#x0201c;care must be adequately and equally provided for all, and all must contribute their fair share to care&#x0201d; (ref. <xref rid="ooy015-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, p. 28). In this situation, care markets function within the contexts of interaction with patients. Patients&#x02019; behaviors impact their own health management and associated health care outcomes. Leveraging the use of their strengths may create positive results and better risk management.</p></sec><sec><title>A STRENGTHS-BASED DATA CAPTURE MODEL</title><p>To move beyond a problem-based data framework that correlates problems with health risks, we need a data capture model that generates whole-person information and knowledge to improve health outcomes. We propose a strengths-based data capture model that illustrates the necessary components of a data-driven approach to whole-person care. Data reflecting a whole-person assessment including social and behavioral determinants as well as problems and strengths must be routinely captured using a consistent terminology as described above. Adopting a consistent terminology will enable the use of sharable and comparable data for information exchange, data aggregation, and reporting. Large data sets generated based on this model may be mined to inform the development of metrics for value-based risk prediction models for various populations. Improved health management can then follow, using a data-driven approach to plan interventions that address risk and leverage strengths, in order to maximize health outcomes and value.</p><p>Person-centered, precision care research and services recognize and emphasize individual differences and partnership with patients.<xref rid="ooy015-B29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooy015-B30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> This is a paradigm shift divergent from traditional care perspectives toward personalization,<xref rid="ooy015-B28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> and results in a shift of responsibility in risk-based management from providers to patients. From this person-centered perspective, person-centered data capture should be present at the point of care and services, making patients full partners in data capture as well as care. Thus, a strengths-based data capture model assumes that patients will be involved as central partners in self-assessment of strengths and needs. Furthermore, focusing on the whole-person perspective in aggregate data will create opportunities to take a more inclusive and positive approach to the understanding of population health. Risk predictions based on risk assessments are usually produced by trending the aggregated data at the population level and applying as clinical guides and recommendations in patient care. When data standards that incorporate strengths and problems are used within EHRs, interoperable and sharable data between patients at both individual level and population level will facilitate both a person-centered approach and a scalable information management system. This model is envisioned by informaticians with the goal of using data to inform and improve health, and staying adaptable and scalable according to patient-specific needs and strengths.<xref rid="ooy015-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ooy015-B32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> It is incumbent upon all stakeholders including patients to work together to jointly define the notion of whole-person health for patients with multiple challenges and needs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The perspective presented in this article and illustrated through our research both exists today and is futuristic. There is a critical need for use of a strengths-based vocabulary for risk assessment and management to realize the potential of strengths and enhance health value. The Omaha System has been used to operationalize and capture data as described in this innovative model and care process. The whole-person model built upon both problem-based risk predictions and strengths will enable a paradigm shift from deficit to whole-person health that includes both problems and strengths. We recognize this as a major groundbreaking endeavor with regard to who, what, and how to define and use data to promote health, and prevent and manage disease, and we welcome conversation to advance and further develop the model across disciplines, populations, and settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The first author is a recipient of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Future of Nursing Scholar award for her PhD study in nursing at the University of Minnesota.
