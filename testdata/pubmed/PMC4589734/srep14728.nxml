A previous study demonstrated activation of the macroautophagic system in scrapie-infected experimental rodents and in certain human prion diseases, in which the essential negative regulator mTOR is severely inhibited. In this study, AMPK and ULK1 in the brains of hamsters infected with scrapie strain 263&#x02009;K and in the scrapie-infected cell line SMB-S15 were analysed. The results showed an up-regulated trend of AMPK and AMPK-Thr172, ULK1 and ULK1-Ser555. Increases in brain AMPK and ULK1 occurred at an early stage of agent 263&#x02009;K infection. The level of phosphorylated ULK1-Ser757 decreased during mid-infection and was only negligibly present at the terminal stage, a pattern that suggested a close relationship of the phosphorylated protein with altered endogenous mTOR. In addition, the level of LKB1 associated with AMPK activation was selectively increased at the early and middle stages of infection. Knockdown of endogenous ULK1 in SMB-S15 cells inhibited LC3 lipidation. These results showed that, in addition to the abolishment of the mTOR regulatory pathway, activation of the AMPK-ULK1 pathway during prion infection contributes to autophagy activation in prion-infected brain tissues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include Creutzfeldt&#x02013;Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie in animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. It is widely accepted that Prion diseases are caused by unconventional infectious agents termed &#x0201c;prions&#x0201d; that lack nucleic acids. During infection, a host-encoded glycoprotein PrP<sup>C</sup> becomes the misfolded conformer PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, which accumulates mainly in the central nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Spongiform change, neuronal loss and gliosis (astro- and microglia) are the neuropathological hallmarks of prion diseases.</p><p>During autophagy, cytoplasmic material, organelles and misfolded proteins are degraded and digested within lysosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Autophagy is activated by various environmental stresses and is rapidly up-regulated when cells need to generate intracellular nutrients and energy, for example, during starvation, growth factor withdrawal, or high bioenergetic demands. More than 30 different autophagy-related genes (ATG) have been identified. Autophagy is also associated with a range of human pathophysiologies, including cancer, neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Numerous Studies have provided the evidences that autophagy involves in the clearance of misfolded proteins and subsequently neuron damage during the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Among the autophagic pathways identified in cells are macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> is a negative regulator of autophagy while the BECN1-PIK3C3/Vps34 (vacuolar sorting protein34)-Vps15 (vacuolar sorting protein15) class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase core complex is a positive regulator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The serine/threonine protein kinase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) also positively regulates autophagy.</p><p>AMPK consists of three subunits: a catalytic <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-subunit and two regulatory <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>- and &#x003b3;-subunits, each of which is present in different isoforms (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1, <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>2, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2, &#x003b3;1, &#x003b3;2, &#x003b3;3). Phosphorylation of the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-subunit at Thr172 by upstream kinases in the activation loop is a prerequisite for AMPK activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. AMPK directly regulates autophagy by phosphorylating and thereby activating ULK1. Four phosphorylation sites within ULK1 (Ser467, Ser555, Thr574 and Ser637) have been mapped. These optimally match the AMPK substrate motif, which is conserved in higher eukaryotes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Ser757 within ULK1 (ULK1-Ser757) is also phosphorylated by mTOR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Although we have observed the alterations of ULK1 and p-ULK1 in prion infected cell models, the exact situations of AMPK and AMPK-ULK1 pathway in brain tissues of prion diseases remain unknown.</p><p>In our previously study, we showed that the macroautophagic system is activated in scrapie-infected experimental animals and in certain subtypes of human prion diseases, in which the essential negative regulator mTOR is severely inhibited<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. More recently, we found that FBXW7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7) is responsible for the induction of mTOR degradation and for the ability of endogenous autophagy to counteract prion replication in the scrapie infected cell line SMB-S15<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. As one of the important elements in autophagy induction, both ULK1 and ULK1-Ser555 are increased in hamsters infected with scrapie agent-263&#x02009;K and in SMB-S15 cells. Since ULK1-Ser555 is a target of AMPK, alterations in the former suggest that multi-kinase cross-talk and protein turnover pathways participate in the regulation of autophagy during prion infection.</p><p>In this study, we analysed AMPK and ULK1 in the brains of hamsters infected with scrapie agent-263&#x02009;K and in the scrapie infected cell line SMB-S15. Our results showed that autophagic flux was activated in SMB-S15 cells. AMPK, AMPK-Thr172, ULK1 and ULK1-Ser555 were markedly up-regulated in both experiment models. Additionally, LKB1, which is associated with AMPK activation, was selectively increased in the brains of the scrapie infected hamsters during the early and middle stages of infection. In SMB-S15 cells, the knockdown of endogenous ULK1 not only depressed ULK1-Ser555, but also inhibited LC3 lipidation. Thus, together with the abolishment of the mTOR regulatory pathway, activation of the AMPK-ULK1 pathway contributes to autophagy activation in prion-infected brain tissues.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Rabbit anti-AMPK<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1/2 (sc-25792) was purchased from Santa Cruz.

In animals experimentally infected with scrapie and in certain subtypes of human prion diseases autophagy is up-regulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Several signalling pathways are involved in the regulation of autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, including mTOR, a strongly negative regulator of autophagy in healthy animals. In hamsters with terminal-stage scrapie agent 263&#x02009;K infections, mTOR expression is strongly diminished whereas the activity of class III PI3K, a positive regulator of autophagy, is maintained<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In addition to these two pathways, AMPK activates autophagy by phosphorylating and activating ULK1. Conversely, the phosphorylation of ULK1 by mTOR inhibits its activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, which prevents its interaction with AMPK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. AMPK was shown to phosphorylate the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2), which inhibits mTOR pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we showed an up-regulated trend of AMPK in the brains of hamsters infected with the scrapie agent 263&#x02009;K beginning at the very early stage of infection and maintained for as long as 70&#x02009;dpi. In parallel with the increase in brain AMPK, brain levels of ULK1 and especially of its phosphorylated form ULK1-Ser555 increase over the course of a scrapie infection. Since phosphorylation of the conserved Thr172, located in the activation loop of the catalytic <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-subunit of AMPK, is a prerequisite for AMPK activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, the levels of AMPK-Thr172 were significantly higher in the prion-infected cell line SMB-S15 than in its normal counterpart SMB-PS. It is reasonable to speculate that the activity of AMPK was increased during prion infection <italic>in vitro</italic>. In line with the increased activity of AMPK, the levels of ULK1 and ULK1-Ser555 were significantly higher in SMB-S15 cells than in SMB-PS cells. Thus, the AMPK-ULK1 pathway is activated by prion infection <italic>in vitro.</italic> In addition to abolishing the interaction of mTOR, the activated AMPK-ULK1 pathway may also contribute to enhancing autophagic flux during prion infection.</p><p>Coincidental with the decrease of mTOR in hamster brains infected with scrapie 263&#x02009;K, the level of ULK1-Ser757, the downstream substrate of mTOR, increased transiently at the very early stage of infection but then quickly declined and was barely detectable at 70&#x02009;dpi. Phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser757 disrupts the association between AMPK and ULK1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In the brain tissues of the scrapie-infected hamsters, down-regulation of ULK1-Ser757 during the middle and late stages of infection reflected an activated AMPK-ULK1 pathway. In SMB-S15 cells, however, there was little change in ULK1-Ser757 despite a marked reduction in the ratio of ULK1-Ser757/ULK1. This difference in ULK1-Ser757 between prion infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> correlated well with mTOR levels under the two conditions. The weaker reduction in mTOR in SMB-S15 cells may be related to the relatively stable level of ULK1-Ser757 during prion replication <italic>in vitro.</italic> In addition to Ser555 and Ser757, other sites of ULK1 phosphorylation have been described, such as Ser467, Thr574 and Ser637<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Whether those sites are also altered during prion infection remains to be determined. Also unknown is whether, as in skeletal muscle, activated AMPK inhibits mTORC1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> in the brains of animals with prion disease.</p><p>LKB1, a tumour suppressor serine-threonine kinase also referred to as STK11<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, is expressed in the brain tissues of mammals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. CAMKII is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II that plays a fundamental role in learning and memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Both are positive regulators of AMPK via phosphorylation at Thr172<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. LKB1 expression was strongly increased in the brains of 263&#x02009;K-infected hamsters during the early stage of infection but decrease to the normal level during the mid- and late-stages, which suggests that AMPK is up-regulated by LKB1 immediately after scrapie infection of animal tissues. CAMKII-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and -<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> levels were fairly stable in the brain tissues of 263&#x02009;K-infected hamsters throughout the incubation period. However, along with the extensive neuronal degeneration at the terminal stage, CAMKII expression was reduced to extremely low levels. In contrast to the dynamic changes in LKB1 and CAMKII-<italic>&#x003b1; in vivo</italic>, in SMB-S15 cells the levels of both proteins remained relatively high during cell replication <italic>in vitro</italic>. We recently demonstrated that activated autophagic flux in SMB-S15 cells involves the clearance of PrP<sup>Sc16</sup>. Thus, the maintenance of elevated levels of LKB1 and CAMKII in prion-infected cells may help to reduce PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication to an acceptable level via autophagy.</p><p>AMPK is expressed in various metabolism-associated organs and acts as a sensor of the overall cellular energy level. As such, it regulates energy metabolism to maintain cellular homeostasis. When nutrient is sufficient, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP promotes the dephosphorylation of AMPK, resulting in its inactivation, while insulin and growth factors activate TORC1 through upstream kinases including AKT1 (protein kinase B) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK3-MAPK1 or ERK). In response to energy depletion, such as glucose starvation, TORC1 is inhibited by AMPK and autophagy is stimulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Our previous analyses of global gene expression profiles in brain tissues of humans with genetic TSEs showed that almost half of the affected cellular pathways are metabolism-associated, such as amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and lipid metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Neuronal defects in glucose uptake and metabolism following reductions in the glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) are commonly observed in various scrapie-infected rodent models and in the scrapie-infected cell line SMB-S15<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Those data strongly highlight a close linkage between activation of the AMPK-ULK1 pathway and energy preservation in brain tissues during prion infection.</p><p>Although the AMPK-ULK1 pathway was similarly altered during prion infection <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, differences were also observed, especially in brain samples collected at the terminal stage of infection. Thus, except for AMPK, ULK1 and ULK1-Ser555, the levels of the proteins examined in this study were almost undetectable in terminally infected brains whereas they were maintained in the prion-infected cultured cells. In prion-infected hamsters, prion replication and infection inevitably cause irreversible brain damage and death; during this process, the levels of many neuronal proteins decrease or disappear, along with the extensive loss of neuron. This conclusion is supported by similar changes at the transcriptional levels in the postmortem brain tissues of patients with fatal familial insomnia, another prion disease. However, in prion-infected cell cultures, prion replication does not cause cell death, such that proteins involved in the cell cycle and responsible for cell growth and viability are preserved. In fact, alterations in the AMPK-ULK1 pathway and the activation of autophagy were in some ways comparable in the prion-infected cell line and scrapie-infected brains collected at the early and middle stages of infection. However, in prion-infected brains, activated autophagy cannot compete with the fatal neurotoxicity of prion infection and may even aggravate neuronal damage through autophagic cell death (ACD) or type II programmed cell death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, whereas in the cultured cells it may help the host cells to balance prion replication and cell duplication.</p><p>In summary, this study presented evidence of an alteration in the AMPK-ULK1 pathway during prion infection, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, that contributes to the activation of autophagy. As important biological factors in many different tissues of mammals, AMPK and ULK1 have multiple functions. This study focussed on their regulation of autophagy.
