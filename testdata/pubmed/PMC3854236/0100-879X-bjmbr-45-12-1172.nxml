Thirty-four women were selected and divided into three groups: RE group (performing 60&#x02005;min of resistance exercises, N = 12), spinning group (performing 60&#x02005;min of spinning, N = 12), and control group (not exercising regularly, N = 10). In both exercise groups, lymphocytes and monocytes decreased after 1-h recuperation (post-exercise) compared to immediately after exercise (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Immediately after exercise, in both exercised groups, a significant increase in TBARS (from 16.5 &#x000b1; 2 to 25 &#x000b1; 2 for the spinning group and from 18.6 &#x000b1; 1 to 28.2 &#x000b1; 3&#x02005;nmol MDA/mL serum for the RE group) and protein carbonyl (from 1.0 &#x000b1; 0.3 to 1.6 &#x000b1; 0.2 for the spinning group and from 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.2 to 1.5 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x02005;nmol/mg protein for the RE group) was observed (P &#x0003c; 0.05). A decrease in antioxidant activities (non-protein sulfhydryl, superoxide dismutase, catalase) was also demonstrated with a negative correlation between damage markers and antioxidant body defenses (P &#x0003c; 0.05). These results indicate that an acute bout of intermittent or anaerobic exercise induces immune suppression and increases the production of reactive oxygen species, causing oxidative stress in middle-aged and trained women. Furthermore, we demonstrated that trained women show improved antioxidant capacity and lower oxidative damage than sedentary ones, demonstrating the benefits of chronic regular physical activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Intermittent exercise</kwd><kwd>Anaerobic exercise</kwd><kwd>Oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>Immune suppression</kwd><kwd>Middle-aged women</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="39"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p id="para2">With the aging process, especially in women after menopause, there is a natural increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accompanied by a decrease of the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>). However, it is well accepted that regular physical training up-regulates the antioxidant enzymatic systems and stimulates the immune system, which may have implications for attenuating the usual increase in aging-related oxidative stress and immune suppression in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>).</p><p id="para3">When physical activity induces muscle damage, the immune response becomes elevated, activating leukocytes and their differential cellular subtypes to release inflammatory signaling molecules. This culminates with the migration of inflammatory cells into the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref>). High-intensity exercises are associated with a biphasic change of circulating leukocytes. In the immediate post-exercise period, an increase in the total number of leukocytes is observed, which mainly occurs at the expense of lymphocytes, neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, of monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref>). After a recovery period, a decrease in lymphocyte numbers, which lasts 3 to 6&#x02005;h, has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B04">4</xref>). These alterations compromise the body's defense against infection and oncogenic agents, as well as allergic processes and auto-immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B04">4</xref>).</p><p id="para4">Thus, the intensity, volume, and frequency of exercise play a key role in determining the immune responses to an effort and may increase or reduce the immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B05">5</xref>). Regular exercise and/or physical training of moderate intensity improve the defense systems, represented by high levels of leukocytes preparing the body to fight against infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B06">6</xref>). On the other hand, intense training causes immune suppression with increased susceptibility to infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B06">6</xref>).</p><p id="para5">One explanation for the immune suppression, i.e., the fragility of the immune system (reduced number of leukocytes), which makes the body more susceptible to the invasion of pathogens in response to an intense physical exercise load, may be an increased use of body functions with exaggerated ROS production and increased oxidative stress in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>).</p><p id="para6">It is recognized that free radicals, besides being among the factors that cause damage to the body due to acute physical exercise, also influence the immune system and essential metabolic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref>). Oxidative stress occurs when the action of free radicals exceeds the activity of antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B09">9</xref>). The production of ROS in response to acute exercise sessions may help the organism to improve its antioxidant capacity chronically. However, if the body does not have the time necessary to recover, this high production of ROS may be harmful, negatively affecting the immune response.</p><p id="para7">Indirect assessment of oxidative stress involves the measurement of the more stable molecular products formed via the reaction of ROS with certain biomolecules. Some of the common molecular products are the concentrations of oxidation target products, including lipid peroxidation end-products, like malondialdehyde (MDA) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and oxidized proteins (protein carbonyls) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B09">9</xref>). Additionally, oxidative stress can be measured by observing alterations in the body's antioxidant defense system. This is typically done by measuring the redox changes in glutathione. Moreover, the activity of certain antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)] can be assessed as indicators of the oxidative stress imposed on the tissue. One of the main consequences of oxidative stress is lipid peroxidation and a possible damage to proteins and DNA, thus altering cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B09">9</xref>). On the other hand, the production of ROS, besides having the potential to increase the antioxidant capacity of the body, can act as a cell signal for protein turnover and synthesis, being beneficial to the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref>).</p><p id="para8">Moreover, in situations of poor periodicity of exercise, ROS can induce a condition known as overreaching, which is a disturbance of the metabolic and recuperative systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Overreaching is a desirable state that follows a high-intensity exercise bout, promoting an elevated activity of the immune response. It is also characterized by a fast recovery and a positive physiological adaptation phase in response to exercise. Overreaching can be easily reversed in a few days or weeks. This condition of change in performance occurs before a much more serious and harmful situation to the body, i.e., overtraining, which, in addition to specific signs of metabolic fatigue, induces severe neuroendocrine disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). A sustained and dramatic impairment of physical performance occurs with overtraining due to excessive exercise sessions (high-intensity or high-volume training) associated with inadequate recovery periods. The decreased activity of the antioxidant defense system only becomes worrisome if after a period of recovery the body does not restore the redox balance.</p><p id="para9">Today it is clear that acute aerobic and anaerobic exercise can potentially result in increased free-radical production, which may or may not result in acute oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, only a few single-study reports have so far compared the effects of anaerobic exercise and aerobic exercise on oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and no studies were found about intermittent intense aerobic exercise or comparing intermittent and resistance exercise protocols in terms of oxidative stress and immunological parameters in middle-aged women. Resistance exercise is characterized by the use of energy above critical power and supplied via the anaerobic metabolism, which results in high accumulation of lactic acid. Long periods of ischemia elicit high xanthine oxidase activation and low VO<sub>2max</sub> is required when compared to intermittent exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Intermittent exercise, such as spinning, is characterized by the use of aerobic metabolism with short periods of anaerobic metabolism, in which the energy is produced primarily by the use of oxygen (high VO<sub>2max</sub>), without much accumulation of lactic acid. The periods of reperfusion are longer than the periods of ischemia, generating less activation of xanthine oxidase when compared to resistance exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p id="para10">It is fairly well accepted that ROS production and the subsequent tissue damage resulting from aerobic exercise are mainly due to an increased flux of electron transport leading to an increased leakage of superoxide radicals, while the generation of ROS during and following anaerobic exercise may be mediated by a variety of other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). These include xanthine and NADPH oxidase production, ischemia-reperfusion, prostanoid metabolism, phagocytic respiratory bursts, disruption of iron-containing proteins, and excessive calcium accumulation, often resulting from the performance of muscle-damaging isotonic or eccentric biased muscle actions, which commonly produce muscle injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p id="para11">There is a lack of knowledge about the alterations that occur due to an acute session of resistance exercise as well as intermittent intense aerobic exercise in middle-aged women. This emphasizes the importance of this investigation mainly because health professionals are required to have a good understanding of the processes occurring in a woman's body during this period of life as well as in situations where physical abilities are required, as in the case of an exercise session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Thus, the present study can provide information for health professionals in order to avoid overtraining by recommending proper exercise.</p><p id="para12">In order to understand the potential health benefits or harmful effects that may be incurred by intensive exercise, the study of the biochemical variables involved in an exercise session in middle-aged women is extremely important. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of an intermittent exercise session and a resistance exercise session on blood cell counts and oxidative stress in middle-aged women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental group</title><p id="para13">Thirty-four healthy women aged 45 to 55 years were selected for this study.

On the other hand, it is well accepted that regular physical training upregulates antioxidant enzymatic systems and improves the immune system, which may have implications for attenuating the usual increase in aging-related oxidative stress and immune suppression in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>). However, until now, no studies have proposed to assess changes in blood cells compared to the production of ROS when analyzing intermittent intense aerobic and resistance exercises. This is the first study that aimed to analyze the effects of intermittent exercise and anaerobic exercise on cardiovascular, immunological and biochemical parameters in middle-aged women.</p><p id="para49">HR measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and Borg scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) have been used to determine exercise intensity. According to our results, both types of exercise produced significant increases in these parameters, showing that women felt extreme effort when performing high-intensity activities. Indeed, no significant changes in BP were detected. This was probably due to the time elapsed from placing the cuff on the person to completion of the measurement. According to Baum et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), the relaxation interval of 3&#x02005;s is sufficient to permit a prompt recovery of BP.</p><p id="para50">Glucose was analyzed in the postprandial state, explaining the high levels of this variable at rest in all groups. Indeed, the levels of the control group (117.50 &#x000b1; 11.8&#x02005;mg/dL) were significantly higher than those of the other groups (102.54 &#x000b1; 14.4 for the RE group and 113.11 &#x000b1; 14.3&#x02005;mg/dL for the spinning group) perhaps due to the sedentary lifestyle of the subjects. Mondazzi and Arcelli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) stated that a decline in blood glucose is expected after a bout of physical activity. However, our results showed no significant decrease, probably because these were trained women and their metabolism was already adapted. Cholesterol and triglycerides were lower in the trained women than in the sedentary ones, whereas HDL cholesterol was higher in trained women than in sedentary ones. The better values in women engaged in physical training may be explained by the adaptations to which the body is subjected due to the exercise practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Regarding body composition (body mass and BMI), the values of the control group are worse than those of the exercised groups. These results, although not statistically significant, seem to be related to physical training, as extensively reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p id="para51">In contrast to data available in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), we did not observe a significant increase in total leukocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, or lymphocyte counts immediately following the two types of exercise. Indeed, the cited studies were conducted on young populations, and perhaps the reason we did not find this increase was due to the fact that the women of our study are in the aging process and their cell defenses may not be responding as they should to such an aggressive stimulus. According to Olsen and Kovacs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), the low levels of estrogen observed in middle-aged women have been shown to attenuate the immune response and to predispose the organism to microbial invasion and infection. Nevertheless, in the present study, estrogen levels were not measured. Thus, further investigation is necessary to find a plausible explanation for the lack of changes in the amount of blood cells immediately after exercise observed here.</p><p id="para52">However, our results agree with Nieman and Nehlsen-Cannarella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>) who reported that intense exercise induced strong lymphocytopenia 30&#x02005;min after exercise. In our study, the last sample was collected 1&#x02005;h after exercise, when we found a major decrease in percentages of lymphocytes and monocytes after both exercises. This result shows that intense physical exercise could induce immune suppression, as already well documented by other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B06">6</xref>), although not in the population of our study. Our results also agree with Nieman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) who reported that leg squat exercise induced strong lymphocytopenia, similar in magnitude to the changes reported after endurance exercise. Despite differences in protocols, we can observe that intense exercises show similar responses in terms of the immune system. These responses are highly dependent on the ability of leukocytes to migrate from the blood to peripheral tissues at sites of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B09">9</xref>), in this case, provoked by exercise. Moreover, this immune suppression seems to be linked to the oxidative stress induced by exercise because there is an increased use of the functions of the organism with exaggerated production of ROS and increased oxidative stress in the tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref>).</p><p id="para53">The most common method used to indicate exercise-induced oxidative damage has been the assessment of lipid peroxidation through the contents of TBARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Our results showed an increase in TBARS in both exercises, corroborating similar findings in young humans with values typically returning to baseline 1&#x02005;h after exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), as also observed in our study.</p><p id="para54">Proteins are major targets for ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Increased protein oxidation, measured by the formation of protein carbonyls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), has been reported by several investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), and remains elevated for several hours after aerobic exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In our study, protein oxidation also increased after exercise and remained elevated after 1&#x02005;h of recuperation, in agreement with the cited studies.</p><p id="para55">The measurement of NPSH has also been routinely performed for the determination of exercise-induced oxidative stress, and typically a decrease in this biomarker has been reported following a variety of exercise protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>); the same result was observed in our study with both protocols. The reduction of NPSH as a result of an acute bout of exercise can be explained by the utilization of this antioxidant defense in an attempt to avoid oxidative stress damage to the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This was reinforced by the negative correlation between TBARS and protein carbonyl and NPSH in both groups immediately after exercise.</p><p id="para56">Free radical-scavenging enzymes such as SOD and CAT are the first line of cellular defense against oxidative injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref>). Our study showed high levels of these enzymes in trained women (RE and spinning groups) compared to sedentary ones (control group) at rest. This can be explained by the participant training level, which may have improved the endogenous enzymatic antioxidant defenses of trained women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), as observed by the high levels of these two enzymes. It is well established that regular physical training improves antioxidant defenses, making the body adapted to scavenging ROS more easily than in sedentary individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>).</p><p id="para57">As a consequence of the exercise performed by the participants, our study showed a decrease in these antioxidant defenses in both exercise groups, which continued to be reduced after 1-h recuperation. In this study SOD and CAT decreased immediately after exercise, as also reported by Watson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and Steinberg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). However, these studies showed an increase above basal conditions of these enzymes during the recovery period; results that differ from our study. According to Fisher-Wellman and Bloomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), in response to conditions of strenuous physical work, the body antioxidant capacity may be temporarily decreased since its components are used to quench the harmful radicals produced, and this decreased time depends on the intensity of exercise. In our study, the high intensity of both exercises can explain this decrease in enzyme activities. Another explanation for the suppression of SOD and CAT activities is the damage to the proteins that occurred as a consequence of high production of ROS after exercise in both groups, confirmed by the negative correlation with SOD and CAT, which remained even after 1-h recuperation. Furthermore, we observed synergism between the activities of these two enzymes, as described in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p id="para58">The same negative correlation was observed between TBARS and antioxidant enzymes immediately after exercise in both the spinning and RE groups. This result indicates that, as the antioxidant enzymes are suppressed probably by the damage to proteins, they cannot exert their effects, and ROS become more available to cause lipid damage. However, after 1-h recuperation, TBARS returned to baseline levels and enzyme antioxidant defenses did not show the same behavior and no significant correlations were detected. Taking this into account, other mechanisms must be investigated to explain why TBARS levels returned to the levels observed when subjects were at rest and protein carbonyl and enzyme activities did not. One of the explanations for these results may be related to the physical conditioning of the women, which could manage to prevent even more cellular damage, avoiding a prolonged lipid peroxidation.</p><p id="para59">Bloomer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) analyzed the effect of acute bouts of anaerobic and aerobic exercises on oxidative stress parameters and did not find differences between the exercise protocols tested, as was also observed in our study. Indeed, they found an indication of oxidative stress, which was not significant, justified by the training of the subjects. We found strong evidence of acute exercise-induced oxidative stress and our study was carried out on trained subjects. This discrepancy can be explained by the age of the individuals studied. A study conducted by Ratiani et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) shows that the decline of the female sex hormone estrogen was correlated with oxidative damage and inflammation. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the high ROS generation observed after workouts in the present study was also related to the aging process.</p><p id="para60">Unlike intermittent and aerobic exercises, where increased mitochondrial respiration is thought to be the primary target of increased ROS, it has been suggested that the increased radical production and subsequent oxidative stress observed during and following resistance exercise may be mediated to a large extent by the activities of certain radical-generating enzymes (xanthine and NADPH oxidase), prostanoid metabolism, phagocytic respiratory burst, disruption of iron-containing proteins, as well as altered calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion, resulting from intense muscular contraction as well as mechanical stress and/or muscle damage, are thought to be the mechanisms underlying the increase in ROS triggering the activity of radical- generating enzymes and initiating the migration of inflammatory cells to the affected area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Thus, this is the possible explanation for the formation of ROS through anaerobic activity and could be the link between oxidative stress and immune suppression verified in our study.</p><p id="para61">Thus, our findings indicate that, similar to aerobic exercises, although the mechanisms are not fully understood, anaerobic and intermittent exercises, when performed at high intensity, clearly have the ability to result in acute oxidative stress and immune suppression in middle-aged and trained women. Since 1&#x02005;h after exercise we observed a decrease in lymphocytes, a maintained decrease in the enzymatic body defense (SOD and CAT), and a maintained increase of protein carbonyl, we could infer that if this kind of exercise is done witt an insufficient recovery period, these metabolic changes, mainly in immunity, may become clinically relevant.</p><p id="para62">However, based on our data, the consequences of these alterations after a long period of recuperation following an acute exercise session are unknown. We suggest for further studies a larger investigation of whether the alterations induced by both bouts of intermittent and anaerobic exercises performed by the trained women might translate into a maladaptive response or if they could represent a positive adaptation for trained women. This type of investigation could also provide information about how long a sufficient period of recovery should be after different kinds of exercise in this population. In addition, the consequences of an acute bout of intense exercises cannot be extended to untrained individuals who probably do not have the same degree of antioxidant protection as the trained subjects in the present investigation.</p><p id="para63">Finally, our data comparing trained and sedentary women allow us to conclude that women engaged in intermittent or anaerobic exercise programs seemed to benefit from healthy blood lipid profiles and higher resting antioxidant levels ready to defend against ROS when needed, highlighting the benefits of regular physical activity in this population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p id="para64">Research supported by CNPq and CAPES.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nieman</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Nehlsen-Cannarella</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The immune response to exercise</article-title><source>Semin Hematol</source><year>1994</year><volume>31</volume><fpage>166</fpage><lpage>179</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8066473</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B02"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pialoux</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Leigh</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Friedenreich</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Poulin</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of cardiorespiratory fitness on vascular regulation and oxidative stress in postmenopausal women</article-title><source>Hypertension</source><year>2009</year><volume>54</volume><fpage>1014</fpage><lpage>1020</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19786647</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B03"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Walsh</surname><given-names>NP</given-names></name><name><surname>Gleeson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Shephard</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Gleeson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Woods</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Bishop</surname><given-names>NC</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Position statement.
