To achieve signal amplification in a gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow assay without an additional procedure or the need for complex fabrication, a new and simple method was developed for using a &#x0201c;stacking pad&#x0201d; configuration that adds an additional membrane between the conjugation pad and test pad to the conventional AuNP-based LFIA format. This design helps to accumulate the antibody and antigen on the stacking pad, hence extending the antigen/antibody binding interactions to enhance the test&#x02019;s detection sensitivity. With the enhanced lateral flow assay, as low as 1&#x02009;ng/mL of Protein A and 15.5&#x02009;ng/mL of C-reactive protein can be visualized with the naked eye. We also successfully applied the stacking pad system in the analysis of C-reactive protein in human serum and synovial fluid samples. These results suggest that this stacking pad LFIA can provide sensitive and on-site prognosis for detection in synovial fluid and serum samples in resource-limited settings.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a simple diagnostic device based on the chromatography-like migration of a labeled analyte through multiple membranes, including a sample pad, conjugation pad, detection pad, and absorbance pad, ending in the visible result of an immobilized captured reagent. The sample pad ensures the controlled flow of the test solution, which migrates to the conjugate pad where nanoparticles labeled with antibodies are stored. If the target analyte is present, the labeled antibodies will bind to it and continue to migrate to the detection pad, whereupon the materials are captured by immobilized antibodies at a test line (T-line) to form a coloured strip while a subsequent control line (C-line) is used to colorimetrically indicate that the solution has sufficiently migrated. Finally, the absorbent pad absorbs excess sample. The test solutions can be driven by capillary force through the porous network of the fibrous pads without the use of an external pump, enabling simple confirmation of the presence or absence of a target analyte by visually observing the signal intensity at the T- and C-lines. Due to this simplicity, LFIAs have been used in a variety of settings, including clinical, food safety, and environmental analyses. Compared to standard laboratory technologies, LFIAs are simple-to-use, rapid, low-cost, and portable, thus meeting the criteria for healthcare in resource-limited settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and have been widely used for the detection of various targets, such as tumor markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, bacterium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, nucleic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and pesticide residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, poor sensitivity limits the further application of this testing platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">While gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are the most common material conjugated with antibodies for colorimetric signaling purposes, one way of improving the detection sensitivity of a AuNP-based LFIA is by enhancing the readout signal with various amplification strategies. A simple and effective way of doing so involves the so-called silver enhancement technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, in which AuNPs are used as nuclei under a reducing environment for the deposition of metallic silver in order to amplify electrochemical signals. Although silver enhancement is widely used to improve AuNP-based LFIA systems, the reagents are relatively unstable and highly light sensitive. Another approach to enhance the assay sensitivity is by immobilizing and enabling the enzymatic activity of horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase on the surface of AuNPs to catalyze the conversion of chromogenic substrates (e.g., 3,3&#x02032;,5,5&#x02032;-tetramethylbenzidine, p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt, and 2,2&#x02032;-azinobis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]-diammonium salt) into darker colored products than AuNPs alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, the need to immobilize and store the enzymatic reagents at low temperature may hinder the platform for use in resource-limited environments. Dual AuNP conjugate-based lateral flow assays have also been reported that are based on the surface plasmon resonance effect of the AuNP-antibody conjugates for signal amplification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, cumbersome processing and longer incubation times are required to perform these tests.</p><p id="Par4">Other research groups have worked to improve the sensitivity of LFIAs by modifying the testing platform&#x02019;s architecture. For example, a dialysis-based concentration method integrated with an LFIA device has been developed for low concentration targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and two- and three-dimensional paper networks that are capable of multiple tasks, such as multiplexing, sample processing, and signal enhancement, have been embedded in different layers of the membranes that compose the platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, different types of geometries have been developed to manipulate the fluidic flow and to retain operational simplicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, the need for complex fabrication steps that limit scaling ultimately restrict the practical applications of such tests. Developing a one-step manually operated device that affords sequential delivery of multiple fluids for analyte detection remains a challenge.</p><p id="Par5">In this paper, we introduce an innovative &#x0201c;stacking pad&#x0201d; configuration by adding an additional membrane between the conjugation pad and test pad to the conventional AuNP-based LFIA format (sLFIA), which can accumulate the antibody and antigen on the stacking pad, hence extending the antigen/antibody binding interactions to enhance the test&#x02019;s detection sensitivity. This concept was adapted based on the function of the stacking gel in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), which allows for proteins to be packed in a concentrated area, thus enabling increased antibody/antigen interaction time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In this work, the incorporation of a similar &#x0201c;stacking pad&#x0201d; in a membrane-based platform was demonstrated to extend the binding interaction of antigens and antibodies. In addition, various membrane materials, including polyester, cellulose, and glass fiber, were examined as the stacking pad to further increase the detection limit of the colorimetric signal.</p><p id="Par6">In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed platform, we chose Protein A, a product of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, as a targeted biomarker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is one of the most important human pathogens and a major cause of surgically implanted device-related infection frequently responsible for prosthetic joint infection (PJI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, which remains a major clinical issue that resists even aggressive treatment by potent antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The standard protocol of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> diagnosis requires culturing of an isolated <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> on a blood agar plate and then a latex test to identify the bacteria&#x02014;a process that is both time- and resource-intensive. A better detection strategy involves the targeting of a characteristic protein of the bacteria. In this case, Protein A is a constituent of the cell wall of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and can be utilized as a targeted analyte. Additionally, for diagnosis of infection, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) is a simple and inexpensive test that is now widely used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. CRP is reflective of systemic changes in infection, and its level is the measurement of acute phase reactants, which can be specifically utilized to improve the specificity of the combined algorithm, given that its reasonably high sensitivity and acceptable specificity for detecting infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. To study the ability of our sLFIA platform to detect Protein A and CRP, we measured multiple threshold levels of the molecule in PBS buffer and determined the test can accurately visualize the target with a detection limit of 1&#x02009;ng/mL and 15.5&#x02009;ng/mL of Protein A and CRP, respectively, in as little as 20&#x02009;min. We also successfully validated the performance of our CRP assay in a small trial using the actual synovial fluid and serum samples to simulate the rapid diagnosis of PJI during operation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Protein A detection using the sLFIA</title><p id="Par7">Compared to the conventional LFIA device (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref>), the proposed sLFIA shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref> integrates an additional stacking pad between a detection pad that dry-stores the capture and control probes, and a conjugate pad that dry-stores the AuNP-anti-Protein A or AuNP-anti-CRP conjugates using 30&#x02009;nm AuNPs. The stacking pad configuration was adapted to mimic PAGE stacking gels, which allows for longer sample interaction with the AuNP-anti-Protein A or AuNP-anti-CRP conjugates. The test pad immobilizes the anti-Protein A or anti-CRP molecules and secondary antibodies at the T- and C-lines for capturing Protein A or CRP bound AuNP-anti-Protein A/CRP conjugates and AuNP-anti-Protein A/CRP conjugates, respectively. Finally, a cellulose fiber absorbent pad collects the waste sample at the end of the device. All parts were assembled according to Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Images and design of the lateral flow assay device.

Six different materials were tested from three categories, including polyester (SP1 and SP2), cellulose (SC1 and SC2), and glass fiber (SG1 and SG2), to examine their respective performance for Protein A detection. Additionally, to precisely and quasi-quantitatively study the detection performance of the different stacking pad substrates, the signal of the AuNP aggregates on the T- and C-lines were further measured via optical intensity analysis using ImageJ software. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the optical images and corresponding intensities of the T-line for 10&#x02009;ng/mL Protein A spiked in PBS buffer tests on the different stacking pad materials. Compare to the similar thickness of SP1 (0.5&#x02009;mm), SC1 (0.5&#x02009;mm), and SG1 (0.6&#x02009;mm), the results demonstrate that the SC1 cellulose substrate displayed the best performance, in which the intensity increased by almost 2-fold compared to the LFIA test without a stacking pad. However, not all materials can be used to enhance the response signal intensity in this system. Based on the results shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref>, the glass fiber-based membrane SG1 showed comparable performance to the conventional LFIA test, and the polyester-based membrane SP1 stacking pad not only did not enhance the sensing results, but the signal dramatically also decreased at the T-line compared to the LFIA without a stacking pad. This suggests that the AuNP conjugates were absorbed by the SP1 and unable to release to the subsequent test pad with the fluid flow, which causing the diminution of the signal at the T-line.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of various stacking pad materials used in the sLFIA test.

The test results of the normalized colorimetric signal intensity showed that the thinner cellulose membrane (SC1, 0.5&#x02009;mm) possessed 1.13-fold enhanced intensity compared to the SC2 which was 1&#x02009;mm thick (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref>). In addition, thinner membranes of polyester (SP2, 0.1&#x02009;mm) and glass fiber (SG2, 0.2&#x02009;mm) also displayed 70- and 1.38-fold enhanced intensity compared to thicker membranes of polyester (SP1, 0.5&#x02009;mm) and glass fiber (SG1, 0.6&#x02009;mm), respectively. These results can be attributed to the fact that SC2, SP1, and SG1 have larger capacity than SC1, SP2, and SG2 to accommodate the sample fluid; however, this may create a lower density of AuNP-anti-Protein A conjugates distributed throughout the membrane network. While the sample fluid flows through the conjugation and stacking pads, a larger amount of antibody-AuNPs-Protein A complexes can become trapped before they can be captured at the T-line.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characterization of the different stacking pad materials</title><p id="Par10">To investigate the effect of the stacking pad material, we characterized the morphology of these substrates using SEM (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The results showed that the cellulose-based stacking pads possessed the tightest fiber packing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(e,f)</xref>), followed by the polyester-based (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(c,d)</xref>), while the glass fiber substrates showed the loosest packing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(g,h)</xref>). The compact nature of the cellulose-based stacking pads (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(e,f)</xref>), with small pore sizes in the scaffold results in the lowest permeability, which may contribute to the slower flow rate of the Protein A spiked in PBS buffer solution, thus increasing the duration of the Protein A and AuNP-anti-Protein A binding reaction by diffusion at the conjugate pad. In addition, the stacking effect and the longer interaction time caused by the smaller pores in the cellulose stacking pads allows a much higher amount of target analyte to interact with the antibody at the conjugation pad, so signal enhancement of the test results is observed.</p><p id="Par11">Previous studies have also reported that the material of the stacking pad is an important parameter for lateral flow assays. The architecture and design of the selected paper can cause signal changes of the optical sensing system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Due to the good protein adsorption of polyester films, the analytes and probes remained on the stacking pad and the intensity on the nitrocellulose membrane was dramatically decreased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Moreover, nonspecific adsorption may occur on the surface of glass fiber with trace metal ions to slightly lower the signal intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. These results indicate that cellulose has superior surface property compared to polyester and glass fiber. Next, the effect of paper thickness was also examined using different materials for this lateral flow system. As the thickness of stacking pads increases in this analytical system, the diffusion of gold nanoparticles leads to low-density probes on the pads, which results in a decreased signal intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Based on the findings of previous literatures and our study, the moderate thickness of 0.5&#x02009;mm cellulose (SC1) for a stacking pad was selected.</p><p id="Par12">In addition, we also observed the liquid flow of the added sample solution passing through all the membranes by applying 1/100 diluted red Ponceau S dye solution to the sample pad to illustrate the stacking effect (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Fluid flow within a capillary network is driven by capillary pressure, <italic>Pc</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>cos<italic>&#x003b8;</italic>/<italic>R</italic>, in which <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> is the surface tension of the fluid, <italic>R</italic> is the capillary radius, and <italic>&#x003b8;</italic> is the contact angle of the liquid-air interface with the solid. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a)</xref> displays various reaction times, in which the Ponceau S solution entered the observation window after 5&#x02009;s for the convention LFIA without the stacking effect, while the flow time extended to approximately 15&#x02009;s using the stacking pad in the sLFIA device. The data shows that using the stacking pad results in longer migration time. However, the clear PBS buffer liquid front of the sample fluid enters the reading window approximately 7&#x02009;s in advance of the Ponceau S stain in the sLFIA device (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(b)</xref>). This demonstrates that the sample fluid can be efficiently held and concentrated at the interface between the conjugate pad and the test pad by the stacking pad, thus extending the reaction time and concentration of the Protein A and AuNP-anti-Protein A conjugates on the stacking pad to increase the binding opportunity. A schematic illustration of the flow field is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a)</xref> displays the conventional LFIA, in which the sample fluid simply flows through the conjugate pad and directly enters the test pad where the antigens behind the sample fluid do not contact the antibodies on the conjugate pad. Meanwhile, the stacking effect of the sLFIA device is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref>, in which the sample fluid dissolves the AuNP-anti-Protein A conjugates and enters the stacking pad due to the smaller pores of the scaffold, concentrating the AuNP-anti-Protein A conjugates and antigens in the stacking pad, and thus increasing the binding time and probability.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Migration distance as a function of time with and without the stacking pad.

The equation of linear regression for the calibration curve of the CRP spiked in PBS buffer solution is y&#x02009;=&#x02009;182.24x&#x02009;+&#x02009;922.95 with R<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.9965, in the concentration range of 15.5&#x02013;310&#x02009;ng/mL, where Y and X indicate the intensity and concentration, respectively. Recoveries were calculated by the comparison between different CRP levels measured by Hitachi LST008 and the intensity obtained from spiked CRP assay in human serum and synovial fluid samples. In the case of low concentration samples, CRP was undetected thus the recovery was not analyzed. The recovery of CRP in serum samples ranged from 34% to 193%, where the intensity of high CRP level (994.5&#x02009;ng/mL) may be saturated, and the concentration was underestimated. Therefore, for high-level CRP assay in serum, sLFIA was only 1.1-fold more enhanced to conventional LFIA. The recovery of CRP in synovial fluid sample ranged from 139% to 189%, where the recoveries of medium CRP level (50~100&#x02009;ng/mL) were similar for both samples. The results indicate that the increased matrix effect and viscosity can extend the duration of the flow time, which can increase the binding time of CRP and AuNP-anti-CRP, thus enhance the optical intensity. Our sLFIA device once again proved to be satisfactory for detection of these kinds of samples. The enhanced-sensitivity of the sLFIA device could potentially be used to quickly diagnose or reassure an individual about their infection status, and the simple design could be widely used as a clinical pre-screening kit.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Recovery of CRP in human serum and synovial fluid samples.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Sample</th><th>Measured concentration (ng/mL)</th><th>Observed by sLFIA (ng/mL)</th><th>Recovery (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="4">Serum (1/100x dilution)</td><td>994.5</td><td>335.4</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>103.4</td><td>183.9</td><td>178</td></tr><tr><td>53.7</td><td>103.6</td><td>193</td></tr><tr><td>&#x0003c;10</td><td>&#x0003c;10</td><td>n.a.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Synovial fluid (1/100x dilution)</td><td>108</td><td>188.9</td><td>175</td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td>105.9</td><td>189</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>37.5</td><td>139</td></tr><tr><td>&#x0003c;10</td><td>&#x0003c;10</td><td>n.a.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>n.a.: not analyzed.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par17">In this work, we developed an enhanced-sensitivity LFIA method for the detection of Protein A (characteristic of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>) and CRP without the need for additional operational steps to amplify the signal.

Not only does the stacking pad extend the interaction time but also increases the interaction probability between the target analyte and AuNP-labeled antibodies, thus enhancing the test performance. In addition to serum and synovial fluid samples, the stacking pad can be widely applied to other types of sample matrices, such as urine, and sweat, which feature lower viscosity than synovial fluid.
