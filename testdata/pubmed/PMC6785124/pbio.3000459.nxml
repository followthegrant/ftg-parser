Recently, such GTPases have been identified in prokaryotes too [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The soil bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> exhibits 2 types of motility&#x02014;adventurous gliding motility and social motility, which are essential for its normal life cycle [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The localization of motility complexes, and thereby the direction of movement, is determined by an oscillatory system, which includes Mutual gliding motility A (MglA), a small Ras-like GTPase, and <underline>M</underline>utual <underline>gl</underline>iding motility B (MglB), its GTPase activating protein (GAP) as major components [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mutual gliding motility (<italic>mgl</italic>) was identified as a locus essential for both social and adventurous motilities in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic>, comprising the 2 genes <italic>mglA</italic> and <italic>mglB</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Studies on MglA and MglB showed that these proteins exhibit a mutually exclusive localization pattern [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. MglA localizes to the leading pole presumably in its GTP-bound state [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], whereas MglB localizes at the lagging pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These studies [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] established the role of the prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPase in cell polarity determination and motility, which are functions analogous to its eukaryotic counterparts [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><fig id="pbio.3000459.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3000459.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Localization of cell polarity determining proteins in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic>.</title><p>Schematic showing the localization of MglA, MglB, and RomRX in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic>.

The reversal frequency is regulated by the chemosensory-like frizzy (Frz) pathway, which relays environmental signals to the downstream MglA-MglB polarity control system [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g001">Fig 1</xref>). High-resolution time-lapse experiments revealed that MglA and MglB relocalize sequentially during a reversal [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Importantly, the Frz system does not establish polarity, but its activity is required for inversion of the polarity axis. Another protein involved in the polarity control module is RomR, a protein with a response regulator receiver-like domain [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It was recently shown that RomR and its interacting partner RomX are essential for recruiting MglA-GTP to the poles [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Frz-signaling and RomR stimulates the pole-to-pole exchange of MglA and MglB [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All together, these proteins form a so-called gated relaxation oscillator, which functions to drive the polarity reversals in response to environmental signals [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Regulated reversals are centrally controlled by the MglA GTPase cycle. Though it is established that MglB functions as a GAP for MglA [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], proteins that function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for MglA were not identified until very recently [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The complex of RomR and RomX has been recently demonstrated to function as a GEF for MglA [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In vivo, the RomRX complex recruits MglA to the leading pole at the time of reversal. Between reversals, RomRX dissociates slowly and relocalizes to the lagging cell pole where RomR interacts with MglB [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, both GAP and GEF activities accumulate at the lagging cell pole, preparing the next reversal event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, at this stage, the cell will only reverse if signals from Frz are sufficiently strong. When this occurs, 2 response regulators FrzX<sup>P</sup> (phosphorylated FrzX) and FrzZ<sup>P</sup> (phosphorylated FrzZ) bind to opposite poles, which trigger the detachment of MglA from the leading cell pole and its relocalization to the lagging cell pole. MglB is subsequently detached and relocated to the opposite pole, completing the switch.</p><p>Many questions remain unaddressed concerning the exact sequence of events that take place at the poles. Specifically, the presence of antagonizing GAP and GEF activities at both cell poles requires that this balance be regulated. The accumulation of RomRX at the lagging pole is not sufficient to drag MglA to the lagging cell pole, most likely because the MglB GAP activity predominates. Accumulation of FrzX<sup>P</sup> at the lagging pole could switch this balance in favor of the GEF and provoke the switch. In this study, we show that MglB is in fact a bifunctional enzyme and that MglB regulation could be key for the control of this enzymatic balance at the pole.</p><p>Previously, biochemical and structural studies with homologous proteins from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> demonstrated that MglB is the GAP of MglA [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. MglA and MglB from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>thermophilus</italic> (TtMglA and TtMglB) share 62% and 29% sequence identities, respectively, with the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> counterparts. Unlike the majority of small Ras-like GTPases, both the active site residues of the GTPase were found within TtMglA itself (Arg53<sup>A</sup> and Gln82<sup>A</sup>; residue names with superscript &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; denote residues of MglA) instead of being contributed by the GAP [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A dimer of TtMglB interacts with a monomer of TtMglA. The structural studies revealed that &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> strand of TtMglA undergoes a screw-type movement during the interaction between TtMglA and TtMglB in the presence of GTP analogues [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

Our investigations led to the discovery of an allosteric pocket on the small Ras-like GTPase fold. Allosteric binding of the C-terminal helix (Ct-helix) of MxMglB on MxMglA facilitates nucleotide exchange. Thus, MxMglB plays a dual role in increasing the GTPase activity of MxMglA by orienting the catalytic residues (role of a GAP) and by facilitating exchange of GDP with GTP (role of a GEF). Furthermore, our study reveals that the Ct-helix plays an important role in regulating the mutually exclusive localization of MglA, MglB, and RomR. Accordingly, deletion of the helix in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> trapped MglA, MglB, and RomR at both poles of the cell and drastically affected motility. Importantly, the study reveals the integration of GAP and GEF activities into a single interacting partner of a prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPase.

Deletion of the helix resulted in the formation of MxMglAB complex in the presence of only GTP but not GDP. This prompted us to identify the structural features that enable MxMglB to bind MxMglA&#x02013;GDP. The &#x003b2;-screw movement (flipping of MxMglA &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> strand) appears to be essential for the interaction of MxMglB with MxMglA. This conformational change exposes residues that form a major part of MxMglAB interface.</p><p>An inspection of the MxMglAB&#x02013;GTP&#x003b3;S structure revealed that the switch 1 loop and the binding pocket of the Ct-helix are at the N- and C-terminal ends of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> strand of MxMglA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). Hence, we propose that the flipped state of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> strand that favors MxMglB binding can be achieved in 2 ways&#x02014;by interaction of either the &#x003b3; phosphate of GTP with the switch 1 loop or the Ct-helix with the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> to &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). The flipped state achieved by the Ct-helix interaction and the consequent stabilization by the Rbl/LC7 fold of MxMglB results in the formation of a complex with MxMglA&#x02013;GDP. As a consequence of the flipped state of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> strand, MxMglA in the MxMglAB complex will potentially possess a nucleotide-binding pocket that favors binding of GTP over GDP, consistent with our observations from the nucleotide exchange assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000459.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

Firstly, Rbl/LC7 domain of MxMglB stabilizes the flipped &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> strand interface, which orients the MxMglA catalytic residues favorably. Secondly, its Ct-helix, a flexible extension from the main Rbl/LC7 fold, retains the flipped state of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> strand post GTP hydrolysis and, consequently, stabilizes the MxMglAB&#x02013;GDP complex. This interaction results in a nucleotide-binding pocket that accelerates release of GDP from the complex and favors GTP-binding. Thus, by facilitating GDP-to-GTP exchange MxMglB enhances the rate of GTP hydrolysis by MxMglA, increasing its potency as a GAP. Indeed, our in vitro results show that MxMglB<sup>&#x00394;Ct</sup> exhibits reduced GAP activity, which we attribute to a defect in nucleotide exchange.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Role of Ct-helix and exchange activity of MxMglB in the polarity oscillation cycle</title><p>In vivo, we propose that the MxMglB Ct-helix is critical for the balance between GAP and GEF activities at the lagging pole. In absence of the Ct-helix, all 3 proteins&#x02014;MglA, MxMglB<sup>&#x00394;Ct</sup>, and RomR&#x02014;localize to both cell poles. Thus, the MxMglB Ct-helix is absolutely required to enable the cascade of interactions that establish polarity and permit its switch. Co-localization of both MxMglA and MxMglB<sup>&#x00394;Ct</sup> suggest that MxMglB<sup>&#x00394;Ct</sup> does not support its GAP function in vivo, despite exhibiting only a reduction in GAP activity in vitro. In between reversals in wild-type cells, MxMglB and RomRX stably co-localize at the lagging pole [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. MxMglA is efficiently excluded from the lagging pole, suggesting that the GAP activity of MxMglB predominates over the GEF activity of RomRX. Thus the MglB Ct-helix possibly overcomes the action of RomRX.</p><p>How could this function at the molecular level? Analysis of RomR revealed a stretch of negatively charged residues (Glu-rich) akin to that of MxMglB Ct-helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Thus, similar to MxMglB, the RomRX complex could facilitate GDP exchange from MxMglA by acting through the allosteric pocket on MxMglA. In this process, the C-terminal Glu-rich region of RomR might thus assist nucleotide exchange, whereas RomX could assist in stabilizing the flipped &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> strand of MxMglA. We tested this hypothesis by replacing the Ct-helix of MxMglB with the Ct-helix from RomR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s007">S7A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s007">S7B Fig</xref>) and carrying out GTPase activity measurements in the presence of the chimeric MglB (MglB<sup>Rhelix</sup>). Indeed, we observed that the chimeric construct accelerated the GTPase activity of MglA similar to that of wild-type MxMglB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s007">S7C Fig</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the Ct-helix of RomR is capable of binding at the allosteric pocket of MxMglA. At the lagging pole, the MxMglB Ct-helix and the RomR Glu-rich helix might compete for binding at the MxMglA helix-binding pocket, which would displace RomRX from MxMglA. When the MglB Ct-helix is deleted, RomRX could therefore interact with MxMglA thus blocking MxMglB<sup>&#x00394;Ct</sup> from exerting its GAP activity. This would allow RomRX to exert its GEF activity at the lagging pole too and stabilize the anchoring of MglA to both the poles.</p><p>Additional regulation of the Ct-helix must take place to determine the nucleotide specificity of MxMglB binding to MxMglA. Additional regulators in vivo will potentially determine the accessibility of the Ct-helix and thus the localization of MxMglA and MxMglB. At the pole, the exact molecular organization of the signaling complexes is not known. Other proteins that participate in the polarity switch and that are present at the lagging pole, for example, the MglB-like protein MglC, can potentially regulate the Ct-helix availability [<xref rid="pbio.3000459.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. During the switch, action of FrzX<sup>P</sup> could, for example, block the inhibitory effect of MglB on RomRX and thus initiate the switch. This possibility could be explored in the future. Further characterization of other polarity determining components and their interactions with MxMglAB are therefore essential to discriminate the GAP and GEF-active phases of MxMglB during the polarity reversal cycle.</p><p>Insights gained from the prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPase MxMglA and its interacting partner MxMglB highlight the dual role of MxMglB both as a GAP and a GEF. The novel mechanism of GEF action is based on an allosteric interaction with the small Ras-like GTPase. Based on sequence analysis, it appears to be a conserved mechanism among prokaryotic small Ras-like GTPases. The study also opens up a new avenue for design of compounds or factors that can modulate the enzyme activity by targeting the newly discovered allosteric binding pocket of the universal Ras-like fold.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec015"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><sec id="sec017"><title>Protein constructs, cloning, and overexpression</title><p>Genes corresponding to <italic>mglA</italic> and <italic>mglB</italic> were amplified from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>xanthus</italic> genomic DNA (obtained from DSMZ, Germany, catalogue number 16526) using suitable primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000459.s011">S4 Table</xref>) and cloned into <italic>pHis17</italic> vector (obtained from L&#x000f6;we lab, MRC LMB, Cambridge; refer Addgene plasmid #78201 for vector backbone) between the restriction enzyme sites <italic>Nde</italic>I (New England Biolabs Inc) and <italic>BamH</italic>I (New England Biolabs Inc).

The GTPase or ATPase hydrolyses the nucleotide while pyruvate (PEP) kinase (PK) uses GDP (or ADP) and phosphoenol pyruvate to produce GTP (or ATP) and pyruvate. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) utilizes NADH and pyruvate to produce NAD<sup>+</sup> and lactate. Because the utilization of NADH is equivalent to the GDP produced by the GTPase reaction, the actual read out is decrease in absorbance of NADH, which in turn estimates the GDP produced by the GTPase. The amount of NADH utilized in the reaction was measured by monitoring the NADH absorbance at 340 nm using a multiplate reader, Varioskan Flash (Thermo Scientific). A master mix was prepared in Buffer A50 containing PEP (1mM; Sigma), GTP (1mM; Jena Bioscience), NADH (600 &#x003bc;m; Sigma), and PK/LDH mix (approximately 25 U/ml; Sigma).
