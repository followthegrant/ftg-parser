Among them, the signaling pathway that leads to the activation of transcription factors of NF-&#x003ba;B has a crucial role in these processes (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B is also activated in response to variety of other stimuli such as CD40 or Toll-like receptors, therefore raising the possibility of the existence of signal-specific pathways for activation (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The common feature of signals that induce NF-&#x003ba;B is activation of an I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) complex consisting of two catalytic subunits, IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2;, and an essential regulatory subunit NF-&#x003ba;B essential modulator (NEMO)/IKK&#x003b3;. In the canonical pathway, IKK&#x003b2; activation results in phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I&#x003ba;Bs, thereby allowing NF-&#x003ba;B proteins to translocate to the nucleus (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). BCR signal largely utilizes this pathway to activate NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>Upon BCR-mediated signaling, protein kinase C (PKC)&#x003b2; is activated, which in turn is important for IKK activation (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). By other stimuli including IL-1 and TNF-&#x003b1;, TGF&#x003b2;-activated kinase (TAK)1, another protein kinase and a member of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 3 kinase family, has been reported to participate in IKK activation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition to PKC&#x003b2;, BCR stimulation requires adaptor molecules, CARMA1 (also known as caspase recruitment domain [CARD]11, Bimp3), Bcl10, and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)1, to activate NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Indeed, B cells lacking any of these proteins are defective in IKK activation in response to BCR stimulation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). CARMA1 contains a set of motifs (PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains) that define the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, peripheral membrane proteins that serve as molecular scaffolds by clustering different signaling and structural proteins into membrane subdomains (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In overexpression studies, CARMA1 directly binds to Bcl10 through CARD&#x02013;CARD interactions and Bcl10 interacts with MALT1 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Recently, MALT1 and Bcl10 have been shown to mediate IKK activation by facilitating the K63 polyubiquitination of the IKK&#x003b3; (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), although it remains obscure whether this polyubiquitination event suffices for IKK activation in the context of antigen receptor signaling.</p><p>Although adaptor proteins that participate in BCR-mediated IKK activation have been intensively identified, it remains unclear whether the PKC&#x003b2; and CARMA1&#x02013;Bcl10&#x02013;MALT1 complex connect and how, if any, these connections lead to IKK activation. Here, we report that BCR-induced phosphorylation of CARMA1, mediated by PKC&#x003b2;, contributes to bringing two key protein kinases, TAK1 and IKK, into close proximity. As a result, TAK1 is able to function as an upstream kinase for IKK activation in BCR signaling context.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>TAK1 is required for BCR-mediated IKK activation</title><p>Given the previous evidence that BCR-mediated IKK activation is impaired in protein kinase C (PKC)&#x003b2;- or CARMA1-deficient primary B cells (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), we examined whether requirement for these molecules is recapitulated in DT40 B cells. For this purpose, we established PKC&#x003b2;- or CARMA1-deficient cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, both of these deficient DT40 cells failed to activate IKK and degrade I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; upon BCR engagement. The defective NF-&#x003ba;B activation in PKC&#x003b2;- or CARMA1-deficient DT40 cells was not due to the decreased BCR expression (Fig. S1 B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20051591/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20051591/DC1</ext-link>). These observations allowed us to choose the chicken DT40 B cell system for elucidating the molecular connections between PKC&#x003b2; and IKK in BCR signaling. Expression of BCR and signaling molecules in various mutant DT40 B cell lines used in this study are presented in Fig. S1.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>PKC<bold>&#x003b2;</bold> and CARMA1 are essential for IKK activation in DT40 cells.

Such phosphorylation could be achieved through the action of an upstream kinase. If this is the case in BCR signaling, the aforementioned data suggest that PKC&#x003b2; or another kinase functions as the upstream kinase in IKK activation. In this regard, recent reports have implicated MAP3 kinases, including TAK1, as a candidate kinase (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). To address the role played by TAK1 in BCR-mediated IKK activation, we first examined whether TAK1 is indeed activated by BCR ligation. TAK1 was reported to be activated via autophosphorylation after exposure of cells to IL-1 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Therefore, TAK1 was immunoprecipitated from resting and activated primary murine B cells and we measured its in vitro autophosphorylation activity. TAK1 was activated at least 3 min after BCR cross-linking (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). Although we used this assay for DT40 B cells, enhancement of its in vitro kinase activity could not be reproducibly observed. To circumvent this potential difficulty in DT40 B cells, we took another approach. The status of serine/threonine phosphorylation of Flag-tagged TAK1 was monitored in DT40 B cells after BCR cross-linking. This tagged TAK1 underwent phosphorylation 3 min after BCR cross-linking, whereas its kinase-deficient mutant barely did (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D, top). Together, we conclude that TAK1 is activated by BCR ligation in primary B cells and probably in DT40 B cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>TAK1 is required for BCR-mediated IKK activation.

As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> B, BCR-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation was abolished in TAK1-deficient DT40 B cells. Effects of TAK1 on key MAP kinases, extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK), were also analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies (Abs) specific for their phosphorylated forms. ERK kinase in TAK1-deficient cells was activated normally by BCR cross-linking, but JNK phosphorylation was completely abolished (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C). Activation of IKK and JNK by BCR ligation was restored by introduction of wild-type TAK1 into TAK1-deficient cells, but not by its kinase mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> D). Thus, we conclude that TAK1 kinase activity is required for BCR-mediated IKK and JNK activation in DT40 B cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Normal PKC<bold>&#x003b2;</bold> activation in the absence of TAK1</title><p>As demonstrated before, TAK1-deficient DT40 B cells manifested the similar defect in BCR-mediated IKK activation to that in PKC&#x003b2;- and CARM1-deficient B cells, suggesting the functional interaction between TAK1 and PKC&#x003b2;/CARMA1. Thus, to elucidate the mechanism by which TAK1 participates in BCR-mediated IKK activation, we first examined the effects of deletion of TAK1 on PKC&#x003b2; and CARMA1. As for its effect on PKC&#x003b2;, the activation status of PKC&#x003b2; was, as judged by using anti&#x02013;phospho-PKC&#x003b2; Ab, not affected in TAK1-deficient DT40 B cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A). Thus, PKC&#x003b2; likely lies upstream of TAK1, thereby contributing to BCR-mediated IKK activation. As a readout of CARMA1 action, we considered the possibility that CARMA1 might undergo serine/threonine phosphorylation upon BCR engagement because a physical interaction between CARMA1 with PKC&#x003b8; was reported in nonlymphoid cells (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Indeed, CARMA1 underwent phosphorylation, as determined by anti&#x02013;phospho-serine/threonine Ab by BCR cross-linking in DT40 B cells. This CARMA1 phosphorylation occurred even in TAK1-deficient cells, but the extent was decreased by &#x0223c;20% at 3 min after stimulation when compared with wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Normal PKC<bold>&#x003b2;</bold> activation in the absence of TAK1.

These observations suggest that PKC&#x003b2;- and CARMA1-mediated events augment TAK1 activity during BCR signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of TAK1 with CARMA1</title><p>To further address the mechanism by which TAK1 leads to the activation of IKK, we analyzed whether TAK1 interacts with PKC&#x003b2; and/or CARMA1 in DT40 B cells that are unstimulated or stimulated. Efficient interaction between TAK1 and CARMA1 was observed in stimulated B cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). This inducible association was also observed in primary B cells after BCR stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Although fivefold higher amount of TAK1 was immunoprecipitated, we could not detect reproducible association of TAK1 with PKC&#x003b2; (unpublished data). To assess the functional importance of this association, we made TAK1 mutants and examined their functions. The COOH-terminal region of TAK1 (402&#x02013;579 amino acids) is thought to bind to a TAK1-binding protein, TAB2, in the IL-1 signaling pathway (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In contrast with the dB mutant, the dA mutant failed to associate with CARMA1 upon BCR engagement and to activate IKK (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;C</xref>). This failure was not due to its defective kinase activity because the immunoprecipitated dA TAK1 mutant, once overexpressed in 293T cells, exhibited the similar kinase activity to that of wild-type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> D). Therefore, we conclude that after BCR stimulation, TAK1 is recruited to CARMA1 directly or indirectly, which in turn contributes to subsequent IKK activation.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>TAK1 associates with CARMA1.

</title><p>Having demonstrated the necessity of interaction between TAK1 and CARMA1 in BCR-mediated IKK activation, next we determined how this association is formed. As CARMA1 was phosphorylated by BCR stimulation, we reasoned that BCR-induced interaction between TAK1 and CARMA1 might be associated with CARMA1 phosphorylation status. As shown before, phosphorylation of CARMA1 at 3 min after BCR stimulation occurred in TAK-deficient DT40 B cells. Thus, we considered PKC&#x003b2; as a key kinase for initiating phosphorylation of CARMA1 after BCR stimulation. In the absence of PKC&#x003b2;, the phosphorylation of CARMA1 was not induced by BCR ligation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A). Importantly, BCR-mediated interaction between TAK1 and CARMA1 was also greatly reduced in PKC&#x003b2;-deficient DT40 B cells. Thus, at 3 min after BCR stimulation, the CARMA1 phosphorylation status appeared to be well correlated with the interaction status between TAK1 with CARMA1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). Moreover, comparison of wild-type and PKC&#x003b2;-deficient DT40 B cells indicated that inducible association of CARMA1 with Bcl10 and MALT1 was also well correlated with the phosphorylation status of CARMA1 at 3 min after receptor ligation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> C). Together, these observations suggest that the initial phase of CARMA1 phosphorylation could contribute to its inducible association with TAK1 and Bcl10.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Interaction of TAK1 with CARMA1 is dependent on PKC<bold>&#x003b2;</bold>.

Assuming that CARMA1 undergoes phosphorylation on multiple serine and threonine residues upon BCR stimulation, one of the straightforward explanations for these observations is that the initial phosphorylation sites could contribute to association of CARMA1 with TAK1 and Bcl10, whereas the sites, being phosphorylated in the later phase (10 min after stimulation), could play a negative role in its association.</p></sec><sec><title>TAK1 is able to phosphorylate IKK</title><p>Given the importance of the CARMA1&#x02013;Bcl10&#x02013;MALT1 complex in IKK activation, the aforementioned data suggest that TAK1, when interacted with the phosphorylated CARMA1, gains access to its substrate IKK, which in turn transphosphorylates conserved serines located within the activation loop of IKK&#x003b2;/IKK&#x003b1;. Hence, to test this hypothesis, we examined whether IKK is associated with CARMA1 after BCR cross-linking and, if so, whether this association is dependent on PKC&#x003b2;. As demonstrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A, this inducible association was detected and dependent on PKC&#x003b2;.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>TAK1 is able to phosphorylate IKK.

The aforementioned data raised the possibility that either TAK1, or a kinase that may associate with the TAK1 immunocomplex, is one of the IKK kinases.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the importance of PKC&#x003b2; in BCR-induced IKK activation, the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. In this study, we provide several lines of evidence in support of the critical role of PKC&#x003b2;-mediated phosphorylation of CARMA1 in bringing two key enzymes TAK1 and IKK into close proximity with each other, thereby activating IKK by BCR stimulation. A model for the mechanism of PKC&#x003b2;-mediated activation of IKK during BCR signaling, based on the data presented here, is shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. Involvement of PKC&#x003b2; in BCR-mediated CARMA1 phosphorylation is clear; however, our data has not addressed the issue of whether PKC&#x003b2; phosphorylates CARMA1 after BCR stimulation, directly or indirectly. In this regard, as in T cells, PDK1 might facilitate the functional interaction between PKC&#x003b2; and CARMA1 in B cells (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>A model for BCR-mediated NF-<bold>&#x003ba;</bold>B activation. Stimulation of BCR leads to activation of proximal protein tyrosine kinases including Syk and Btk. Btk phosphorylates several tyrosine residues on phospholipase C-&#x003b3;2 (PLC-&#x003b3;2), and subsequent activation of protein kinase C&#x003b2; (PKC&#x003b2;). Activated PKC&#x003b2; phosphorylates CARMA1 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), directly or indirectly, which is able to recruit TAK1 to the phosphorylated CARMA1 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Meanwhile, the IKK complex probably through the Bcl10/ MALT1 complex is recruited to the phosphorylated CARMA1 (3 and 4). These interactions (CARMA1-IKK and CARMA1-TAK1) contribute to access of two key protein kinases, TAK1 and IKK, leading to activation of the IKK complex (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="20051591f8"/></fig><p>The initial phosphorylation of CARMA1 (3 min after stimulation) mediated by PKC&#x003b2; is most likely to cause its association with TAK1 and Bcl10/MALT1 complex, which is supported by two lines of our observations. First, the comparison between wild-type and PKC&#x003b2;-deficient DT40 cells clearly showed the well correlation between the inducible phosphorylation status of CARMA1 and its association with TAK1, Bcl10, and MALT1 at 3 min after BCR stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Second, BCR-mediated phosphorylation of CARMA1 still occurred in TAK1-deficient DT40 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B), implying that the initial CARMA1 phosphorylation precedes its association with TAK1 during BCR signaling.</p><p>Next, the question of how CARMA1 phosphorylation contributes to its association with Bcl10 and TAK1 arises. CARMA1 contains a set of motifs (PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains) that define MAGUK family proteins (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The best characterized member of this family, PSD-95, forms relatively stable, detergent-resistant, and microfilament-independent multiprotein aggregations at postsynaptic membrane densities in neurons (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the intramolecular interactions of PSD-95, such as between the SH3 and GUK domains, keep it in a closed, inactive conformation, whereas binding to a regulatory ligand could induce an opening of the conformation that would allow for subsequent intermolecular SH3&#x02013;GUK interactions and dimerization or multimerization. In addition to MAGUK-typical features, CARMA1 contains two additional protein&#x02013;protein interaction domains; a CARD domain and a coiled-coil domain. The CARD domain of CARMA1 is shown to mediate binding to Bcl10, whereas its coiled-coil domain is thought to mediate homo- and/or hetero-multimerization (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to anticipate that the initial phosphorylation of CARMA1 (3 min after stimulation), like the regulatory ligand, could induce the opening state from its closed conformation, thereby allowing CARMA1 to form homo-oligomerization and hetero-oligomerization with signaling molecules, including Bcl10 and TAK1. However, disparity between phosphorylation status of CARMA1 and its association with Bcl10 and TAK1 (10 min after stimulation) was also observed. These data suggest that CARMA1 might undergo phosphorylation on several serine/threonine residues with distinct time kinetics during BCR signaling and that the sites being phosphorylated with later time kinetics could contribute to terminating these associations.</p><p>Although endogenous Bcl10 and MALT1 can be coimmunoprecipitated from lysates of nonstimulated B and T cells, the physical association of Bcl10 and MALT1 is not clear (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In the case of DT40 B cells, we observed that this association was inducible (unpublished data). Given that Bcl10 undergoes phosphorylation in antigen receptor signaling (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), this phosphorylation might contribute to further association of Bcl10 and MALT1, thereby making a stable CARMA1&#x02013;Bcl10&#x02013;MALT1 complex upon BCR engagement. IKK&#x003b3; was recruited to CARMA1 after receptor ligation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> A). Thus, the IKK complex including IKK&#x003b3; might be directly associated with CARMA1&#x02013;Bcl10&#x02013;MALT. It is also possible that TRAF6 and/or ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in toll pathways) might function as a connecting molecule between CARMA1&#x02013;Bcl10&#x02013;MALT1 and the IKK complex (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p><p>Importance of phosphorylation of the activation loop serine residues of IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2; has been demonstrated in vivo as well as in vitro experiments (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). As these serine residues are not part of a PKC consensus phosphorylation site, two mechanistic ideas have been proposed. First, other serine/threonine residues of IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2; may serve as direct substrates of PKC&#x003b2;, thereby contributing to IKK activation. Alternatively, PKC&#x003b2; may regulate IKK indirectly through an intermediate kinase that would be directly or indirectly controlled by PKC&#x003b2;. Although the first possibility cannot be completely excluded, our data highly suggest that the second mechanism mainly operates in the BCR signaling context and that TAK1 corresponds to this intermediate kinase. First, consistent with a previous report using Jurkat T cells (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), TAK1 was demonstrated to play a critical role in BCR-mediated IKK activation in DT40 B cells. Second, because PKC&#x003b2; activation occurred normally in the absence of TAK1, TAK1 is likely activated downstream of PKC&#x003b2;. Third, immunoprecipitated TAK1, but not its kinase mutant, was able to phosphorylate activation loop serine residues of IKK&#x003b2; in in vitro conditions.</p><p>In contrast with wild-type DT40 cells, TAK1 activation status, as judged by antiphosho-serine/threonine Ab, was greatly decreased in both PKC&#x003b2;- and CARMA1-deficient cells, suggesting involvement of PKC&#x003b2;-mediated CARMA1 phosphorylation and probably subsequent association of CARMA1 and TAK1 in its activation. In this regard, the dA TAK1 mutant is thought to be devoid of a binding site to TAB2, an adaptor molecule linking TRAF6 and TAK1 in IL-1 receptor signaling (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Thus, TAB2 could be one of the candidates that contribute to association of CARMA1 with TAK1. In addition to TAK1 activation, substrate accessibility is important. Association of both TAK1 and IKK complex with CARMA1 and dependency of these associations on PKC&#x003b2; were clearly demonstrated by this study. Hence, these associations likely allow the activated TAK1 to phosphorylate IKK&#x003b2; in in vivo contexts. Furthermore, because MALT1 is reported to activate IKK by promoting the ubiquitination of the IKK&#x003b3; directly, or indirectly through TRAF6 (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), this IKK&#x003b3; ubiquitination may contribute to bringing IKK&#x003b2; into a state that is more susceptible to being phosphorylated by TAK1.</p><p>TAK1 was reported as a kinase coupling innate receptors, Toll-like receptors/IL-1 receptors, to IKK activation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Therefore, involvement of this kinase also in antigen receptor&#x02013;mediated IKK activation is somewhat surprising. Here, the relative lack of redundancy in BCR-mediated IKK activation in DT40 cells has enabled us to provide an insight into how TAK1 participates in adaptive immune receptor signaling such as through BCR. Phosphorylation of a specific scaffold molecule, CARMA1, recruits actions of two common NF-&#x003ba;B players, TAK1 and IKK, into the adaptive immune receptor signaling. Thus, the adaptive immune system in vertebrates may have evolved from the more primitive innate immune system through usurping the common key signaling components of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, including TAK1 and IKK, by using CRAMA1&#x02013;Bcl10&#x02013;MALT1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cells, mice, Abs, and reagents</title><p>Wild-type and various mutant DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO BRL and Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% chicken serum, 50 &#x003bc;M 2-ME (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and antibiotics.
