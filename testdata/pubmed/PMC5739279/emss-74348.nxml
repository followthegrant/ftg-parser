archaea has resulted in the development of effective anti-phage defence
mechanisms, including restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas systems. Here we
report on a new defence system, DISARM (Defence Island System Associated with
Restriction-Modification), that is widespread in bacteria and archaea. DISARM is
comprised of five genes, including a DNA methylase and four other genes
annotated as a helicase domain, a phospholipase-D (PLD) domain, a DUF1998 domain
and a gene of unknown function. Engineering the <italic>Bacillus
paralicheniformis</italic> 9945A DISARM system into <italic>Bacillus
subtilis</italic> has rendered the engineered bacteria protected against
phages from all 3 major families of tailed double-stranded DNA phages. Using a
series of gene deletions we show that four of the five genes are essential for
DISARM-mediated defence, with the fifth (PLD) being redundant for defence
against some of the phages. We further show that DISARM restricts incoming phage
DNA, and that the <italic>B. paralicheniformis</italic> DISARM methylase
modifies host C<underline>C</underline>WGG motifs as a marker of self DNA akin
to restriction-modification systems. Our results suggest that DISARM is a new
type of multi-gene restriction-modification module, expanding the arsenal of
defence systems known to be at the disposal of prokaryotes against their
viruses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The arms race between prokaryotes and the viruses that infect them, bacteriophages (phages), is driving a continuous and intensive evolution of attack and defence mechanisms<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.

Such systems, generally classified into four types, modify the self-genome on specific sequence motifs and degrade DNA in which such motifs are non-modified<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. R/M systems contain a restriction endonuclease activity, a DNA modification activity (most commonly methylation, not present in Type IV systems), and target recognition capabilities. These three activities could either be encoded on 3 different protein subunits (as in Type I R/M systems), two different subunits of restriction and modification, each carrying the target recognition domain (Type III and most of the Type II R/M systems), or on a single polypeptide (Type IIG)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p><p id="P5">Many genes involved in bacterial and archaeal defence were shown to be physically clustered in genomic loci termed &#x0201c;Defence Islands&#x0201d;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Genes of unknown function that are enriched in defence islands were hypothesized to be involved in defence as well, a concept that led to the recent discovery of the BREX defence system<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In this study we describe a new cassette of genes that is associated with defence islands in general, and R/M systems in particular. This 5-genes cassette, which we found in &#x0003e;350 sequenced genomes of bacteria and archaea, generally appears in two classes in nature, and encodes genes with helicase-related domains, a DNA methyltransferase, and a phospholipase D domain-containing gene. A representative system from <italic>Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> 9945a was experimentally demonstrated to confer defence against viruses of all 3 families of tailed phages, in a yet unknown mechanism of action that involves all five genes, methylates the self-genome on specific sequence motifs, and halts phage propagation in the early stages of infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification of DUF1998-containing gene cassettes in defence islands</title><p id="P6">We have focused our attention on the protein domain DUF1998 (pfam09369), which has no known function, as this domain was previously found to be enriched in prokaryotic defence islands and hence suggested to participate in anti-phage defence<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. As defence systems are frequently encoded by multiple genes working in concert that are co-localized in the genome, we attempted to characterize the genetic context in which DUF1998 genes are found.</p><p id="P7">To this end we searched the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> for genes whose only annotated domain is DUF1998. Within the 35,893 genomes we scanned, we found 1,369 such genes, encoded in 1,273 different genomes &#x02013; 3.5% of the scanned genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). We then analysed the immediate genomic vicinity of these genes and found that in the vast majority of cases (1,095/1,369, 80%) the DUF1998-containing gene was preceded by a large (~1,100-1,300 aa) gene with a pfam00271 domain, a domain that is a part of the catalytic core of DExx-box helicases<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Further structural modelling of this protein using Phyre2 (ref <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) confirmed structural homology to DExx-box helicases including the two essential catalytic domains<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. The only abundant annotated gene downstream to the DUF1998 gene was a gene with a phospholipase D (PLD) domain (pfam13091), appearing in 370 of the 1,369 cases (27%). The PLD domain is associated with enzymes that manipulate phosphoester bonds, such as kinases, phospholipases and endonucleases<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, and was shown to be the catalytic domain of some restriction endonucleases<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. As the combination of these three genes is the most abundant conserved genetic context of DUF1998, we defined these three consecutive genes as the core of our hypothesized system. We identified 351 such triplets in the analysed genomes (1% of the scanned genomes).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>An abundant 5-gene cassette represents a putative new defence system</title><p id="P8">We then characterized the genomic neighbourhood of this 3-gene core, and found that it
was almost always (324/351 of cases, 92%) associated with a gene containing a
DNA methyltransferase domain, marking it as a possible new type of
restriction/modification system. We therefore named this system DISARM (Defence
Island System Associated with Restriction Modification). In most cases, the core
gene triplet was adjacent to a DNA adenine N6 methyltransferase gene (pfam13659)
that is usually annotated in the restriction enzymes database REBASE<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> as a putative Type IIG R/M gene. In
these cases, which we define as Class 1 DISARM, the system is comprised of the
core triplet, the methyltransferase, and a fifth gene annotated as COG0553 SNF2
family helicase, containing SNF2-like ATPase (pfam00176) and helicase C-terminal
(pfam00271) domains<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Gene cassettes
containing the Class 1 DISARM system were found in 11 bacterial and 3 archaeal
phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">A second subset of systems did not contain the SNF2 helicase and the Type IIG R/M enzyme pair mentioned above, but instead contained a DNA 5-cytosine methyltransferase (pfam00145). We refer to these systems as Class 2 DISARM. These systems are mostly found in extremophilic bacteria and archaea and in Firmicutes, especially Bacilli. Unlike the larger Class 1 systems, these Class 2 systems are more compact. In most Bacilli and halophilic archaea, the systems contain another protein of unknown function sized ~800aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>DISARM confers protection against multiple phage types</title><p id="P10">We selected a Class 2 DISARM system for experimental validation, as this Class is more compact (spanning an average DNA size of 9.6kb vs 16.5kb spanned by Class 1 systems, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) facilitating easier engineering into a heterologous genome. To test whether the hypothesized DISARM system provides protection against phage infection, we have cloned the DISARM locus of <italic>Bacillus paralicheniformis</italic> 9945A, including the upstream and downstream intergenic regions, into the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> BEST7003 genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). We verified in advance that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> BEST7003 does not contain a DISARM system of its own by searching for homologs of each of the DISARM genes in its genome &#x02013; none was found. The correct insertion of the system into the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> genome was verified by whole genome sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). No change in growth dynamics was observed in the DISARM-containing bacteria compared to the control strain transformed with an empty plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We then challenged the DISARM-containing <italic>B. subtilis</italic> with phages from all 3 morphological families of the Caudovirales: the Siphophages phi3T, SPR, SPP1 and phi105, the Myophage SPO1 and the Podophages Nf and phi29. SPO1, SPP1, phi29 and Nf are obligatory lytic, while phi3T, SPR and phi105 are temperate phages. Infections were performed at 3 orders of magnitude of Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) &#x02013; 0.05, 0.5 and 5 phages per bacterium. Our results show that DISARM provided anti-phage protection against all phages, manifested by the delay or absence of culture collapse upon infection with phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). To quantify the protection, we measured phage efficiency of plating (EOP) on DISARM-containing bacteria vs. control cells. DISARM provided strong protection against most of the phages, with up to 7 orders of magnitude of protection observed. For two of the phages we observed intermediate levels of DISARM defence, with 2 orders of magnitude against SPO1 and one order of magnitude against SPP1. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To test whether the partial protection observed for some of the phages is due to a heritable trait such as resistance mutations or epigenetic modification in a subpopulation of the infecting phages, we isolated Nf and SPO1 phages from single plaques that appeared on DISARM+ cells. These isolated phages did not show increased resistance (measured via plaque assays) against DISARM+ cells as compared to their ancestor phages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that for these phages escape from DISARM+ is not due to genetic or epigenetic traits. Rather, a small proportion of these phages seem to be naturally able to propagate inside at least a fraction of the DISARM+ cells population.</p><p id="P13">One of the known phage defence paradigms is abortive infection, in which bacteria commit suicide upon infection, thus preventing the completion of the phage replication cycle<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. This prevents the release of phage progeny and the spread of infection to neighbouring cells. In this scenario, infection with an MOI&#x0003e;=1 is expected to cause the death or bacteriostasis of a large fraction of cells in the culture and an immediate stasis or reduction of OD upon infection. As DISARM-containing cultures infected with MOI = 5 did not stop growing or collapse upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>), we infer that DISARM does not provide protection through an abortive infection mechanism.</p><p id="P14">We also performed transformation efficiency experiments using an episomal <italic>Bacillus</italic> plasmid. We could not detect a reduced transformation efficiency in DISARM+ cells, suggesting that DISARM does not interfere with DNA import of this plasmid through the natural competence system of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>DISARM allows phage adsorption but prevents phage replication</title><p id="P15">To test if DISARM protects the bacteria by preventing phage attachment, we compared the rate of phage adsorption to DISARM-containing vs. DISARM-lacking bacteria. No significant difference was observed in the adsorption rates, indicating that DISARM provides protection without hampering phage adsorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). We further tested if the phage genome is replicated in DISARM-containing cells. We used Illumina sequencing to quantify the amount of phage DNA in comparison to bacterial DNA during infection with phi3T at MOI = 1. As the bacterial genome is not degraded during phi3T infection<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, the ratio between phage reads and bacterial reads can be used to quantify the number of phage genome equivalents per infected cell. The results show that while in control cells the phage DNA replicates during the infection process, in DISARM-containing cells it is not replicated but is rather depleted over time in comparison to the bacterial genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). In addition, phi3T was not able to circularize its genome or form detectible lysogens in DISARM-containing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c-d</xref>). This indicates that DISARM prevents phage DNA replication and lysogeny, and probably also causes phage DNA degradation. Moreover, as DNA circularization occurs soon after injection and is essential for both lytic and lysogenic cycles<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, our results indicate that DISARM stops the infection at a very early stage.</p><p id="P16">To further examine the dynamics of phage DNA decay in DISARM-containing cells, we used a previously established system that allows imaging of phage SPP1 infection<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. In this system, the SPP1 genome is modified to include a <italic>lacO</italic> array, and the infected cells express a LacI-CFP fusion protein. Upon phage DNA injection to infected cells, LacI-CFP proteins bind to the phage <italic>lacO</italic> array resulting in a clear focus. Foci were clearly observed on WT, DISARM-lacking cells, and once established the foci grew in size during phage DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Foci were also observed in infected DISARM-containing cells, but these foci did not expand and rapidly disappeared during the time course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These results further substantiate that DISARM does not block phage DNA injection into the infected cell, but cause intracellular phage DNA decay.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Essential components for DISARM anti-phage activity</title><p id="P17">To map the essential components of the DISARM system, we engineered a series of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> BEST7003 strains, each containing a DISARM system with a scarless deletion of each of the DISARM genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). These deletions were verified by whole genome sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). No growth impairment was observed in the deletion strains of <italic>drmE</italic>, <italic>drmA, drmB</italic> and <italic>drmC</italic> as compared to control cells or cells containing the full DISARM system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). We were not able to obtain a single-gene deletion for <italic>drmMII</italic> (see below).</p><p id="P18">We then tested the deletion strains by infecting each of them with phi3T, SPO1 and Nf phages. Deletions of <italic>drmA</italic> (helicase domain), <italic>drmB</italic> (DUF1998 domain) and <italic>drmE</italic> (unknown function) abolished DISARM protection against all phages tested, indicating that each of these 3 genes is essential for DISARM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, deletion of the PLD domain gene, <italic>drmC</italic>, had no effect on DISARM protection against phi3T and the &#x00394;<italic>drmC</italic> cells remained fully protected against it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7a-c</xref>). However, a reduction in protection efficiency against SPO1 and Nf phages was observed, such that &#x00394;<italic>drmC</italic> cells were less resistant than cells containing the full DISARM system, but still more resistant than DISARM-lacking cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e-f</xref>). Quantification via plaque assays further showed that the &#x00394;<italic>drmC</italic> reduced DISARM defence against Nf by 2-3 orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Variable protection in &#x00394;<italic>drmC</italic> cells was also observed in other phages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, <italic>drmC</italic> appears to be redundant for defence against some phages, while required for defence against others (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Discussion</xref>).</p><p id="P19">As DISARM contains a predicted C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methyltransferase (<italic>drmMII</italic>) we have performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing to look for its cognate methylation sequence motif. While in control <italic>B. subtilis</italic> no significant motif for 5-methylcytosine (5mC) was identified, in DISARM-containing cells the motif C<underline>C</underline>WGG (W=A or T) was methylated in the underlined cytosine (average methylation rate of 82% for sites covered by &#x0003e;5 reads). Bisulfite sequencing further validated that the same motif is methylated in <italic>B. paralicheniformis</italic> ATCC 9445A, in which the DISARM locus resides naturally. The same methylation motif was found in the genome of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> subsp. spizizenii str. W23 (ref <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), which also contains a similar Class 2 DISARM system. In that strain, this motif was attributed to the homolog of the DISARM methyltransferase (named M.BsuW23II), to which no cognate restriction enzyme was suggested<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>.</p><p id="P20">The above results suggest that <italic>drmMII</italic> methylates the DNA at CCWGG motifs. Presumably, other components of the DISARM system use non-methylated CCWGG motifs as a marker of foreign DNA akin to other known R/M systems. Consistent with this hypothesis, attempts to clone a <italic>drmMII</italic>-deleted DISARM system into <italic>B. subtilis</italic> yielded very low transformation efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Whole genome sequencing of three of the resulting transformed colonies showed massive deletions or frameshift mutations in the DISARM locus in addition to the intended deletion of <italic>drmMII</italic>. This suggests that in the absence of <italic>drmMII</italic> the DISARM system is toxic to the cells and only cells with a defective DISARM locus can survive. It is likely that in the absence of CCWGG methylation in the bacterial chromosome, the restriction components in the DISARM system attack the chromosome leading to the observed toxicity.</p><p id="P21">To further examine whether <italic>drmMII</italic> alone is sufficient for DNA methylation, we cloned this gene under a Pveg constitutive promoter in a WT <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Bisulfite sequencing validated that the <italic>drmMII</italic>-expressing strain is methylated on 97.7% of the reads mapping to C<underline>C</underline>WGG motifs, validating <italic>drmMII</italic> as the system&#x02019;s methylase.</p><p id="P22">To test whether C<underline>C</underline>WGG methylation is sufficient to protect phages against DISARM interference, we propagated phi3T on the <italic>drmMII</italic>-expressing strain, yielding methylated phages. Bisulfite sequencing verified that 75 of the 78 C<underline>C</underline>WGG sites in phi3T became methylated after propagation in the methylase-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 9a</xref>). The 3 sites that were not modified overlapped with GG<underline>C</underline>C sites that are known to be methylated by the native methylase M.Phi3TI encoded by phi3T (the same methylase methylates also G<underline>C</underline>NGC sites<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, while an additional methylase, M.Phi3TII, modifies T<underline>C</underline>GA motifs<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The DISARM+ strain still protected against the modified phages despite their high level of methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 9b</xref>). Moreover, DISARM also provided high level of protection against phage Nf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>) although the genome of this phage (GenBank accession EU622808) is devoid of any CCWGG site, which we also verified by whole genome sequencing of the Nf phage we used. These results suggest that DISARM probably uses an additional, yet unknown mechanism to identify invading phage DNA in addition to the methylation signature.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">Our results establish DISARM as a new defence system, providing protection against diverse phages. The DISARM system is widespread in defence islands across the microbial world, and contains 3 core genes (<italic>drmA</italic>, <italic>drmB</italic> and <italic>drmC</italic>) accompanied by a methyltransferase (<italic>drmMI</italic> or <italic>drmMII</italic>) and an additional gene (<italic>drmD</italic> or <italic>drmE</italic>). The existence of an R/M-related active methyltransferase, the toxicity caused by its deletion, and the depletion of phage DNA during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) suggest that DISARM represents a new composition of an R/M system that differs from other known such systems. While the modification module of DISARM is composed of a methyltransferase as in classic R/M systems, the restriction module seems to be unique and requires multiple components. The interaction between these modules and the exact mechanism through which DISARM restricts phage replication remain to be characterized. Moreover, since phage Nf does not contain a single CCWGG motif and is still restricted by DISARM, our results imply that the restriction module of DISARM may not rely solely on the presence of these motifs.</p><p id="P24">While DISARM was able to strongly protect against most of the phages tested, for two of
the phages (SPO1 and SPP1) protection only amounted to 1-2 orders of magnitude.
Phage SPO1 is known to have a heavily modified genome, containing
hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) in place of thymine in its genome<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. As CCWGG sites must contain the modified base on one of the
strands (W=A or T), it is possible that the modified base somehow partially
interferes with DISARM restriction. SPP1, which also partially escapes DISARM
protection, has no reported DNA modifications, but only contains one CCWGG motif. It
is possible that the lower level of DISARM protection against this phage can be
attributed to the single motif, although phi3T modified in all but 3 CCWGG motifs
was unable to overcome DISARM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>), and so did phage Nf which completely lacks this
motif in its genome.</p><p id="P25">We have shown that four of the five genes comprising DISARM are absolutely essential for its activity in phage resistance. The fifth gene, <italic>drmC</italic>, is partially required for defence against SPO1 and Nf, but is redundant against phi3T. The <italic>drmC</italic> gene has a PLD domain, a domain that was previously shown to be the catalytic nuclease domain in R/M systems such as BfiI and NgoAVII<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. However, due it its redundancy in defence against most of the tested phages, <italic>drmC</italic> is unlikely to function as the core restriction endonuclease of the system, and is more likely to take an auxiliary role. Indeed, while <italic>drmA</italic> is almost always associated with the DUF1998-containing <italic>drmB</italic> gene, <italic>drmC</italic> appears associated with this pair in only one third of the cases.</p><p id="P26">In this study we focused on the most prevalent genomic context of standalone DUF1998-containing genes (<italic>drmB</italic>) and showed that such domains preferentially occur in the context of DISARM systems. In DISARM, the DUF1998-containing <italic>drmB</italic> is found immediately downstream to <italic>drmA</italic>, a putative DExx-helicase (pfam00271). Interestingly, a fusion protein between DExx-helicase and DUF1998, named <italic>dpdJ</italic>, was recently demonstrated to be involved in the Dpd system, a new R/M system comprised of at least 12 genes that modifies the bacterial DNA with 7-deazaguanine derivatives and possibly restricts unmodified DNA<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. In the Dpd system, the abovementioned fusion gene <italic>dpdJ</italic> is followed by a PLD-containing gene named <italic>dpdK</italic>. The roles of these genes in the Dpd systems are unknown, but in light of our results it is possible that they take part in the Dpd restriction module similarly to the putative roles of <italic>drmABC</italic> in DISARM.</p><p id="P27">In line with the hypothesis that the DISARM components can interact with different modules of other R/M systems, it is worth noting that DISARM systems are often genomically associated with other methyltransferases and putative restriction endonucleases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). For example, in many cases Class 1 systems are accompanied by an additional predicted cytosine methylase (pfam00145) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 10a-b</xref>). DISARM systems are also frequently associated with a Res and Mod genes of a Type III R/M system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 10a</xref>). In other cases, both a cytosine methylase and an HNH endonuclease (pfam13391) accompany Class 1 DISARM systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). The association with multiple other restriction systems may reflect the general tendency of defence systems to cluster in defence islands<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, or, alternatively, might suggest that the function of the core DISARM genes can be combined with additional R/M modules and provide a synergistic defensive advantage.</p><p id="P28">Bacterial and archaeal systems that provide defence against foreign genetic elements have demonstrated time and again their profound diversity and rapid evolution. Despite over four decades of extensive research, it seems that the full spectrum of R/M systems in nature is yet to be completely documented. The discovery of DISARM, most probably representing a new kind of R/M systems, exemplifies this concept and suggests that additional new systems will be revealed in the future. Better understanding of the arsenal of defensive measures at the disposal of bacteria and archaea will bring us closer to understanding their arms race against their parasites, a major evolutionary driving force shaping prokaryotic genomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials | methods" id="S9"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Genomic identification and analysis of DISARM systems</title><p id="P29">The IMG database<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> was searched on June 2016 for genes containing the pfam09369 (DUF1998) domain with no additional domains. The pfam annotations of the neighboring genes of these DUF1998 standalone genes were retrieved from IMG, and examined in order to identify the most common neighbourhood. DUF1998 genes with a pfam00271 gene upstream and a pfam13091 gene downstream were collected as core DISARM genes and further analysed. DUF1998 genes with only a pfam00271 gene upstream were manually screened to identify possible misannotation of a downstream pfam13091 gene. The pfam00271, DUF1998 and pfam13091 containing genes were termed <italic>drmA</italic>, <italic>drmB</italic> and <italic>drmC</italic>, respectively.</p><p id="P30">To study the genomic neighbourhood of the identified core DISARM systems, the pfam and COG annotations of 30 genes upstream and downstream of the DUF1998 gene were retrieved from IMG and manually inspected. This led to the discovery of the additional related DISARM genes. Class 1 systems were defined according to the presence of pfam00176 and pfam13659 up to 30 genes upstream or downstream of the DUF1998 gene. Systems that contained a pfam00176 gene and Type III R/M genes (methylase with pfam01555 and restriction nuclease with pfam04851) were defined as Class 1, based on the assumption that the R/M system methylase replaces <italic>drmMI</italic>. Class 2 systems were defined according to the lack of pfam13659 and pfam00176 and the presence of pfam00145 gene. In Class 1 systems, the closest gene with pfam13659 relative to the DUF1998 gene was defined as <italic>drmMI</italic>, and the closest gene with pfam00176 relative to the DUF1998 gene was defined as <italic>drmD</italic>. In Class 2 systems, the closest gene with pfam00145 was defined as <italic>drmMII</italic>, and <italic>drmE</italic> genes were manually curated due to their lack of any annotated domain. As pfam13659 was recently cancelled and deleted from the Pfam database, some of the <italic>drmMI</italic> genes remained with no pfam annotation, but could be identified by their Superfamily SSF5335 (S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases) annotation and their size, and so were manually curated as <italic>drmMI</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Cloning of DISARM into <italic>B. subtilis</italic> BEST7003</title><p id="P31">A cloning vector for large fragments was constructed by assembling the p15a origin of replication (ori) from pACYCDuet-1 and the <italic>amyE</italic> integration cassette from plasmid pDR110, kindly provided by Ilana Kolodkin-Gal.

Both strains express LacI-CFP constitutively. SPP1 phages containing a LacO array (10<sup>5</sup> pfu/&#x000b5;l) were flowed into the device from t=15 minutes to t=45 minutes, and image was taken every 5 minutes. Upon injection of the phage DNA, a fluorescent focus of LacI-CFP is formed on the LacO array in the phage DNA. White arrows show foci in DISARM-lacking cells, which do not disappear and grow in size through the time course. Foci on DISARM-containing cells appear (full yellow arrowheads) but later disappear (empty yellow arrowheads). Scale bar is 5 &#x000b5;m.
