Patients were either attending an outpatient HIV care clinic or had been admitted to one of two public-sector hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe, because of fever and/or respiratory symptoms; hospitalized patients were subcategorized as having (1) a primary respiratory cause or (2) primary non-respiratory cause for admission. The first chest radiographs of patients (CR; obtained in the previous 6 months as part of routine HIV outpatient care or the first radiograph at or immediately following hospital admission) were reviewed; the CRs of five patients were of suboptimal quality and excluded.</p><p>Vertical HIV acquisition was considered the most likely mode by the study physician, based on clinical evaluation, history (growth failure, longstanding ill-health, maternal and/or sibling HIV infection) and no reported risk of sexual or parenteral exposure to HIV infection. Accurate demographic and clinical data were available in 59 hospital inpatients: clinical records were reviewed with specific reference to the presence of the following chronic respiratory symptoms (present for 3 months of the year in the last two years): (1) a non-productive cough, (2) a cough productive of sputum, and (3) a history of progressive breathlessness over the previous 3 months. The primary cause (respiratory versus non-respiratory) for admission and the numbers receiving highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were recorded. The study was approved by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe and the Institutional Review Boards of the Biomedical Research and Training Institute (Harare), The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (London), and the Institutional Review Boards at both participating public-sector hospitals (Harare). Informed consent was obtained from all inpatients but the need for consent from outpatients was waived.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Chest radiographic scoring</title><p>CRs were reviewed retrospectively by three independent observers blinded to clinical data. The observers were two thoracic radiologists (S.R.D., S.J.C., both subspecialty-trained, in clinical practice at teaching institutions in the UK and with &#x0003e;10 years experience in thoracic imaging) and a consultant chest physician (R.D.B. with 15 years clinical experience in pulmonary medicine but no prior experience of quantitative radiographic evaluation). Chest radiographic scoring was adapted from methods previously reported<xref rid="bib4 bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4,16</sup></xref> but observations were confined to standardized radiographic terminology.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The scoring system included an evaluation not only of the presence/absence of radiographic signs, but also the overall and proportional extents of chest radiographic patterns and the cranio-caudal distribution of disease. The following radiographic features were quantified and/or recorded: (1) the overall extent of abnormal lung was&#x000a0;graded semi-quantitatively on a five-point scale (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;normal; 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x02013;25% abnormal lung; 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;26&#x02013;50%; 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;51&#x02013;75% and 4&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;76&#x02013;100%). For quantification purposes, each lung projected on the CR was considered to represent 50% of the total. (2) The presence or absence of the following radiographic patterns (hereafter termed the &#x0201c;principal&#x0201d; patterns) was recorded: (a) consolidation (defined as an homogeneous increase in pulmonary parenchymal attenuation that obscures the margins of vessels and airway walls <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>); (b) reticular pattern (defined as a collection of innumerable small linear opacities that, by summation, produce an appearance resembling a net); (c) non-cavitating nodules (defined as a rounded opacity or opacities, well or poorly defined, measuring up to 3&#x000a0;cm in diameter; (d) cavitating nodules (a cavity was defined as a gas-filled space, seen as a lucency or low-attenuation area within a nodule; (e) ring/tramline opacities: believed to reflect airway abnormalities (i.e., bronchial wall thickening and/or bronchiectasis); (f) ground-glass opacification (defined as an area of hazy increased lung opacity within which margins of pulmonary vessels may be indistinct); and (g) masses (defined as any pulmonary lesion seen on CRs as an opacity greater than 3&#x000a0;cm in diameter). (3) The proportional extents of the principal radiographic patterns were quantified to the nearest 5% with the total extent (where more than one pattern was present) not exceeding 100%. (4) The cranio-caudal (upper, mid and/or lower) distribution of abnormalities was recorded: the upper-zone was defined as that region of the projected lung on a CR above the upper margin of the anterior second rib. The mid-zone was that region between the lower margin of the anterior second rib and the upper margin of the anterior fourth rib and the lower zone was defined as that region below the lower margin of the fourth rib.</p><p>The presence/absence of the following radiographic abnormalities (termed the &#x0201c;ancillary&#x0201d; patterns) was also recorded: (1) bullae; (2) paucity of vessels; (3) pleural effusion; (4) hilar and/or mediastinal lymph node enlargement; and (v) volume loss.</p><p>Discrepant observations were resolved by consensus review between observers: a difference in the overall extent of abnormal lung of greater than one grade, between any two observers, was resolved by consensus. Discrepant observations for the presence or absence of the principal radiographic patterns and their distribution were also resolved; a difference in the proportional extents of the principal patterns exceeding 20% was the threshold for consensus review.

The findings of the present study indicate that abnormalities are prevalent on CR; ring/tramline opacities and consolidation were the most common patterns. Consolidation was strongly associated with a respiratory admission to hospital. However, rings/tramline opacities (the predominant radiographic pattern) did not differ significantly in prevalence between patient subgroups, suggesting that this radiographic pattern might represent &#x0201c;chronic&#x0201d; lung disease. Moreover, the prevalence of ring/tramline opacities did not differ between patients with and without chronic symptoms. The present findings have a potential bearing on clinical management and future studies in this area: it seems likely that the presence or absence or chronic respiratory symptoms will not differentiate between patients with and without radiographic evidence of possible chronic lung disease.

In one study, of 28 HIV-infected children with a mean age of 3 years, persistent reticulonodular opacities were present in just over 50%.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In another study, of children with a median age of just under 2 years, consolidation, increased bronchovascular markings and reticulation and/or nodules were present in roughly one-third of a subgroup of 201 patients.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The most common chronic patterns, seen in 20% in this study, were an increase in bronchovascular markings or reticular densities. In contrast, the most prevalent &#x0201c;transient&#x0201d; or acute radiographic patterns were consolidation and increased interstitial markings.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p>When considering earlier chest radiographic series, issues related to the grouping of signs at analysis, the use of non-standard radiological terminology, and observer disagreement should not be overlooked. In the study by Norton and colleagues, bronchovascular markings and reticular densities were combined because of observer-related &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d;.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> This approach is problematic because different radiographic patterns are likely to reflect variable pathological processes. The use of non-conventional radiographic terms is also an issue because terms, such as &#x0201c;dense patchy opacities&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;interstitial markings&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;patchy opacification&#x0201d;, lack precision and are open to broad interpretation. There are two other concerns that apply to chest radiographic observations in general: first, differences in perception, and second, the level of observer experience.<xref rid="bib18 bib19 bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18&#x02013;20</sup></xref> These factors can contribute to inter- and intra-observer variability.</p><p>In the present study, observations were confined to the accepted definitions of radiographic patterns.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Furthermore, the radiographic patterns were evaluated and analysed separately. There are two further points in support of the radiological methods in the present study: first, observer disagreement for the key radiological signs was in the clinically-acceptable range. Second, the readings of the non-radiologist, with no previous experience of radiological scoring, accorded closely with those of two thoracic radiologists, indicating that the system is likely to be both applicable and robust for physicians involved in the management of adolescents with HIV-related lung disease.</p><p>Without serial chest radiography or high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), the extrapolation of plain radiographic patterns to the distinction between acute and chronic disease must be made with caution. However, the previously reported linkages between consolidation and acute disease,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and between ring shadows or increased &#x0201c;bronchovascular markings&#x0201d; (broadly comparable to the ring/tramline opacities in the present study) and chronic disease<xref rid="bib8 bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,10</sup></xref> are supported by the subgroup findings in the present study: consolidation was seldom present except in patients hospitalized with respiratory disease. In contrast, the similar prevalence of ring/tramline opacities in all patient subgroups and the lack of a linkage with acute respiratory illness suggest that this radiographic pattern is more likely to represent chronic disease. However, the important limitations of the present study must be mentioned. First, there is the potential for bias due to the retrospective design. Second, the relatively small numbers in the patient subgroups (particularly outpatients) is problematic as it could reasonably be argued that CRs in outpatients might have inadvertently &#x0201c;selected&#x0201d; patients with more acute (but not hospitalized) respiratory illness. These issues highlight the need for prospective studies of chronic lung disease in HIV-infected adolescents with serial chest radiography or, indeed, HRCT at their core.</p><p>The morphological basis of chronic lung disease in paediatric HIV infection is still debated. However, lymphocytic pulmonary infiltration, infection, and bronchiectasis are believed to be contributory.<xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7&#x02013;11</sup></xref> The ring/tramline opacities may be a manifestation of airway inflammation reflecting bronchial wall thickening and/or bronchiectasis. As regards the latter, there is an acknowledged link between bronchiectasis and HIV-infection<xref rid="bib7 bib21 bib22 bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,21&#x02013;23</sup></xref> with recurrent bacterial infections<xref rid="bib7 bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7,23</sup></xref> or HIV-infection <italic>per se</italic>, believed to play an aetiological role.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> However, with respect to bronchiectasis specifically, it should be noted that chest radiographic diagnosis is not straightforward, even for experienced observers: the lower sensitivity of chest radiography (particularly for mild disease) and the notoriously non-specific radiographic appearances are important limitations.<xref rid="bib24 bib25 bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24&#x02013;26</sup></xref> Again, in this regard, HRCT is likely to play a key role in future studies to define the morphological basis of chronic lung disease in this group of patients.</p><p>Given that the majority of patients in this study were inpatients, acute changes (characterized by consolidation) might have been expected to have been the commonest pattern; yet consolidation was only present in a minority of cases with ring/tramline opacities predominating. From the above, it is reasonable to conclude that larger population-based studies to identify chronic disease will be informative. However, here again, the current study provides an insight: the frequency of ring/tramline opacities did not differ between patients with and without chronic symptoms. It follows that in future population-based studies, the presence of chronic symptoms cannot be considered an accurate surrogate for HIV-related lung disease.</p><p>In summary, CR abnormalities are highly prevalent in adolescents with vertically-acquired HIV infection evaluated in secondary practice. The presence of ring/tramline opacities (the most prevalent radiographic pattern, which may represent chronic lung disease) is not related to respiratory symptoms. These findings highlight the potential importance of chest radiography and the limitations of clinical evaluation alone, both in routine management and in future studies of HIV-related lung disease.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and World Health Organisation (WHO)</collab></person-group><chapter-title>AIDS epidemic upadate: December 2007.
