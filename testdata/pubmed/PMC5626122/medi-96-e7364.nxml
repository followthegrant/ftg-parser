Metacarpal and phalanx defects with soft tissue loss usually were suggested to be reconstructed by vascularized bone flap.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> The iliac flap, the serratus anterior-rib composite flap, the medial femoral condyle flap, and the scapula flap have been described for the reconstruction of the metacarpal defect.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The fibular osteocutaneous flap has a similar shape to a metacarpal. It is easier to be dissected and may be the best option for metacarpal reconstruction.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> However, the size of the fibular is still a bit larger for metacarpal reconstruction. Recently, complications related to harvest of the osteocutaneous fibula flap are of concern,<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> including gait abnormality, ankle instability, and limited range of ankle motion. Thus, we attempt to retain the fibular continuity while harvesting the individualized fibular osteocutaneous flap with preoperative virtual planning.</p><p>Three-dimensional virtual planning has successfully applied in mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flap. This approach leads to greater precision of the surgical procedure and reduction of surgical time.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Recently, virtual surgical planning has applied in metatarsal defect reconstruction and metatarsal osteotomy.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>By combining 3-dimensional virtual planning, we harvested 3 fibular flaps on the posterior margin of fibula for reconstruction of metacarpal and phalanx defects (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We describe our early experience with this technical approach and illustrate the technique a typical case.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of defects and results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e7364-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Case report</title><p>Informed consent was obtained from each patient preoperatively after they were given a detailed explanation of the operative procedures. This study was approved by our ethics institutional review board (First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, ZheJiang University).</p><p>A 35-year-old male patient sustained a right-hand crush injury (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). In the debridement, the stump revisions of 3 to 5 fingers were performed. In the emergency 1-stage operation, osteotomies of the remnants of metacarpal and distal phalange were performed to obtain smooth osteotomy planes for reconstruction. There were extensive soft tissue defects on the palmar hand and right dorsal hand. There were more than 4&#x0200a;cm defect of the 1st metacarpal, involving the 1st metacarpophalangeal joint (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(A) A 35-year-old male patient sustained a right-hand crush injury.

The lower extremity was surveyed by color Doppler imaging to identify the location of the perforators. High-resolution computed tomographic scan of the hand is also performed for 3-dimensional rendering using Magics19.01 (Materialis). In the 3-dimensional hand model, the shape of bone segment was determined by superimposing the patient's contralateral 1st metacarpal. The length of the segment was about 4&#x0200a;cm. The degree of both distal and proximal obliquity of the segment were also determined. Then, according to the position of the perforator, the fibula bone segment was designed on the posterior margin of fibula (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B). The reconstruction plate and cutting guide were designed and prepared accordingly. Here, our team designed a fibula partial osteotomy cutting guide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A) (Video1).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(A, B) According to the virtual planning, the fibula bone segment was designed on the posterior margin of fibula.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e7364-g004"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(A) Fibula partial osteotomy cutting guide is designed in 2 parts (part A and B).

The peroneal artery was exposed and protected during the harvesting of the fibula. The fibular cutting guide was secured to the fibula segment to replicate the cuts that were planed previously. Two skin islands were included with the fibula segment. The fibula segment was placed in the planned position and fixed to the bone remnants using 1.5&#x0200a;mm locking plate. The soft tissue defects were covered by the skin paddle after the repair of the extensor tendon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C).</p><p>The hand was immobilized for 2 weeks when postoperative exercise started. The thumb tactile sensation and function were found satisfactory in the 3 months follow-up (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A and B). The Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire scores was 66 (Video 2).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>(A, B) The thumb tactile sensation and function were found satisfactory in the 3 months follow-up.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e7364-g006"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Discussions</title><p>Vascularized bone flaps have better healing quality and higher resistance to infections than nonvascularized bone grafts in metacarpal defects reconstruction.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> The free fibular bone flap initially described by Taloy to reconstruct bony defects of the long bones.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Since then, many cases involving metacarpal and phalangeal defects have been reported reconstructing with this method.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> The fibular osteocutaneous flap has a similar shape to a metacarpal. And it can provide a fasciocutaneous flap for soft tissue reconstruction. However, the fibular segment is still thicker than metacarpal and phalanx. In our measurement, metacarpal bone defects only need half the thickness of the fibula to reconstruct. The monolayer fibula cortex is also thick enough to provide sufficient strength. So in this method, we take only the necessary amount of fibula, leaving the rest to maintain the ankle stability. By this method, the fibular graft can be designed sizable even for phalanx reconstruction.</p><p>It has been commonly recommended to preserve 5 to 7&#x0200a;cm of distal fibula at the ankle and 4 to 6&#x0200a;cm at the knee to avoid donor site related complications.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> However, complications related to osteotomy of the fibula are of concern recently.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> In 6-month follow-up, there were no complications related to osteotomy of the fibula in the 3 cases. This method may improve to maintain the ankle stability to reduce complications. However, we still need more cases and longer follow-up to evaluate the incidence of complications. And it is possible to harvest bone graft lower than 7&#x0200a;cm of distal fibular without breaking the ankle stability by this method.</p><p>Three-dimensional virtual planning has been widely used in reconstructive and orthopedics surgery. The computer-planned fibular osteotomy can produce adequate margins without the need for intraoperative changes in surgical plan.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Fibular osteotomy is greatly accelerated because the need for intraoperative freehand contouring is eliminated.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> However, despite widely used in mandibular reconstruction, virtual planning is rarely reported for the metacarpal reconstruction. By this method, the fibular segment and metacarpal remnant are assembled with excellent bone-to-bone approximation. The thickness of the fibular segment is designed according to the metacarpal of the contralateral hand. So, the thickness of the fibular segment is consistent with physiological thickness. The virtual planning also includes the cutaneous flap. The distance between the perforator and the fibular segment will affect the pedicle length.</p><p>Fibular osteotomy of this method seems complicated. In fact, by using the cutting guide, the fibular osteotomy takes approximately 10 minute. The harvest of the cutaneous flap may take more time, because the peroneal artery is under the fibular. However, there is still sufficient space to expose the peroneal artery through the notch of the fibular bone. And the virtual planning minimized the adjustments needed for intraoperative inset. Finally, this method still saves considerable intraoperative time.</p><p>Our preliminary experience with the approach of 3-dimensional virtual planning in precise chimeric fibula free flap is practical and efficient. Although more cases and follow-up are needed to evaluate it, this approach is expected to benefit patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank National Natural Science Foundation of China (81471874 and 81501293) for the support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-96-e7364-s001.wmv" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e468" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-96-e7364-s002.mov" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e476" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="equal"><p>HS and X-qS contributed equally to the work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding/support: This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81471874 and 81501293).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>Supplemental Digital Content is available for this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>FC</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodriguez</surname><given-names>ED</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
