indicator of hospitalized patients&#x02019; prognosis. Although various methods with which to
conduct nutritional assessments exist, large hospitals seldom employ them to diagnose
malnutrition. The aim of this study was to understand the prevalence of child
malnutrition at the University Hospital of the Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto Medical School,
University of S&#x000e3;o, Brazil. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted to
compare the nutritional status of 292 hospitalized children with that of a healthy
control group (n=234). Information regarding patients&#x02019; weight, height, and
bioelectrical impedance (i.e., bioelectrical impedance vector analysis) was obtained,
and the phase angle was calculated. Using the World Health Organization (WHO)
criteria, 35.27% of the patients presented with malnutrition; specifically, 16.10%
had undernutrition and 19.17% were overweight. Classification according to the
bioelectrical impedance results of nutritional status was more sensitive than the WHO
criteria: of the 55.45% of patients with malnutrition, 51.25% exhibited
undernutrition and 4.20% were overweight. After applying the WHO criteria in the
unpaired control group (n=234), we observed that 100.00% of the subjects were
eutrophic; however, 23.34% of the controls were malnourished according to impedance
analysis. The phase angle was significantly lower in the hospitalized group than in
the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05). Therefore, this study suggests that a protocol to
obtain patients&#x02019; weight and height must be followed, and bioimpedance data must be
examined upon hospital admission of all children.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Child malnutrition</kwd><kwd>Prevalence</kwd><kwd>Bioelectrical impedance</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="26"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malnutrition can be defined as an imbalance between the need and intake of essential
nutrients. Both undernutrition and excess weight can impair growth and cognitive
development, increase the risk of infections, and prolong wound healing. Moreover,
malnutrition might have financial consequences for both the individual and health system
because of a lengthening of the hospital stay (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Therefore, this matter must be resolved worldwide.</p><p>The prevalence of malnutrition in hospitalized children varies largely among countries.
According to a Brazilian study, 16.3% of children aged &#x0003c;5 years at admission
exhibited undernutrition (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In Australia,
O&#x02019;Connor et al. (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) observed a malnutrition rate
of 5-27%. Joosten et al. (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) reported
malnutrition in 6-14% of children. In a review in England, 11-45% of the children were
found to have malnutrition (<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These differences
might be due to the lack of standardization in risk assessment methodologies and
screening of hospitalized children (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Anthropometric parameters enable the hospital staff to detect patients with malnutrition
at admission. However, it is important that basic and/or disease diagnosis procedures
and treatment protocols are used to recognize patients at high risk of developing
malnutrition despite having an adequate nutritional status at admission.</p><p>Traditional bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) involves predictive equations and new
approaches, such as bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) and phase angle (PA)
(<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) studies, which can be useful tools for
evaluating a patient&#x02019;s secondary nutritional status. Both BIVA and PA involve graphical
analyses. BIVA comprises four different parameters, namely eutrophic, lean, cachectic,
and obese and athletic (definitions of these parameters, provided by Piccoli et al.
(<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), do not follow the classic meanings), that
do not require data regarding weight. The PA, which evaluates how membrane integrity is
associated with prognosis, requires only the resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) values
(<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Nagano et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) suggested that the PA is a useful parameter for the nutritional
assessment of body cell mass in stable pediatric patients; however, PA studies in
children are scarce (<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>The Hospital das Cl&#x000ed;nicas, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, Universidade de S&#x000e3;o
Paulo (HCFMRP/USP) is a referral hospital in Brazil that mainly treats patients with
severe and chronic diseases. However, no investigations to date have addressed the
nutritional status of patients admitted to the pediatric wards. Malnutrition is a major
public health concern; therefore, reducing the number of individuals with this condition
is essential to improve patients&#x02019; prognosis and minimize hospitalization costs. The
primary aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malnutrition in the
pediatric wards of HCFMRP/USP. In the secondary analysis, we evaluated whether the
nursing staff performed anthropometric assessments in the wards by checking these data
in the hospital system. A third objective of the present work was to assess patients&#x02019;
nutritional status by BIVA and PA. We hypothesized that the prevalence of malnutrition
at our tertiary hospital would be approximately 30% based on previous literature (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This descriptive study (cross-sectional cohort) included children and adolescents aged 1
month to 18 years. All patients were evaluated within the first 48 h of admission to the
pediatric wards of HCFMRP/USP between February 2012 and February 2013 by a single
researcher to avoid bias (VN Pileggi). The numbers of beds in the pediatric wards were
as follows: 10 beds for gastroenterology, 9 for oncology, 7 for nephrology, 4 for
pneumology, 4 for cardiology, 2 for endocrinology, 1 for rheumatology, and 1 for
immunology. Concurrently, a control group comprising healthy children and adolescents
who were followed up in a childcare ambulatory unit near the hospital was used for
comparison purposes. The control group (aged 1 month and 18 years) was initially matched
for age, sex, and socioeconomic status. The number of hospitalizations in the previous 3
years and the estimated prevalence of malnutrition of 30% helped us determine the sample
size (n=292 for the hospitalized group).</p><p>The exclusion criteria were as follows: newborns, pediatric patients admitted to the
pediatric intensive care unit, data collection after 48 h, patients with edema (except
biochemically proven nutritional edema), patients with polytrauma, children in the
emergency room, and children whose parents refused their participation in the study.</p><p>The anthropometric data collection assisted us with the nutritional status assessment.
The patients&#x02019; history was obtained and recorded using a questionnaire (e.g., duration of
breastfeeding and maternal school age). The cutoff points for the body mass index
according to age (BMI/A) were determined according to the z-score of the WHO table of
parameters (+2 for overweight and -2 for undernutrition). BIVA and PA investigation were
performed using the bioelectrical impedance data. The BIVA classification was conducted
according to the position on the ellipse of the graph related to a pre-existing
reference population, which was described in the manual by Piccoli et al (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The PA was calculated using the following
formula: PA(&#x003a6;) = (Xc/R)&#x000d7;(180&#x000b0;/&#x003c0;).</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was calculated from an analysis of the number of hospitalizations
that occurred in HCFMRP-USP in the 3 years prior to the survey (2009-2011). Different
prevalence estimates and values for accuracy were considered. Accuracy is associated
with the amount (percentage) considering that the prevalence might be far from real.
We thus determined that a minimum sample size of 281 hospitalized children would be
required for an estimated prevalence of 30% and 5% accuracy.</p><p>Descriptive statistics are presented for all study parameters (mean, median, standard
deviation, minimum, and maximum). Parameters with a Gaussian or normal distribution
were compared by Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> -test (comparison of age, weight,
height, BMI, resistance, R, and PA). Some variables were considered logarithms to
meet the assumptions of this test (e.g., weight for males aged 5 to 19 years). The
software SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., USA) was used for this purpose.</p><p>The kappa coefficient was calculated to verify the agreement between the nutritional
status classifications according to the WHO criteria and the BIVA software.</p><p>Correspondence analysis (correspondence maps) was applied to determine whether
qualitative variables were spatially associated. This type of analysis involved a
multivariate technique that explores categorical data. In this analysis, an array of
non-negative data is graphically displayed as row and column points in biplots in
which the vector space has a smaller dimension than the original space. In this way,
we can interpret the relationships between lines and columns and between rows and
columns. The geometric and algebraic mean from the correspondence map belongs to a
family of available imaging techniques that are based on a lower position (i.e.,
singular decomposition value) in the matrix approach. In other words, the aim of this
analysis was to find the subspace that best fits the set (cloud) of points in the
Euclidean space. This adjustment of the subspace was performed by the weighted
least-squares method, in which the generalized Euclidean distance (weighted) was used
in a system of point masses.</p><p>Finally, analysis of covariance was used to eliminate confounding variables (i.e.,
sex, age, BMI, maternal education, type of delivery, and breastfeeding) that were
previously established in the classification of nutritional status. The same software
(SAS 9.2) was used for all of these tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical aspects</title><p>The Research Ethics Committee of the HCFMRP-USP approved this study. Signed informed
consent was obtained from all participants&#x02019; parents and/or guardians. Children aged
&#x02265;7 years also provided signed assent.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The WHO criteria for BMI/A were used to classify all children according to the collected
anthropometric data. The prevalence of malnutrition among hospitalized children (n=292)
was 35.27%, and 16.10% and 19.17% of the subjects exhibited undernutrition and excess
weight, respectively. Of all participants, 93.15% and 80.82% had their weight and
height/length, respectively, measured by the ward staff (nursing technicians or nurses)
according to data in the hospital system. All patients (100%) in the control group
(n=234) were eutrophic according to the WHO criteria. The characteristics of the
variables of interest of the two groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>

</p><p>We were able to use the data from 447 individuals (237 pediatric ward patients and 210
controls) for the BIVA classification. It was necessary to exclude patients aged 4-23
months because no reference population existed in the program or literature at the time
of analysis. In the hospitalized group, 55.45% of the patients were classified as having
malnutrition (classified as thin, cachexic, or obese). More specifically, 51.25%
presented with undernutrition and 4.20% had edema/obesity. Among the children in the
control group, 23.34% were malnourished; 20.95% had undernutrition, and 2.39% presented
with edema/obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Example of the bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) classification

necessary to create three cluster categories (i.e., eutrophic, overweight, and
undernourished). After the construction of clusters, we calculated weighted kappa
coefficients using z-scores of -1 and -2. The methods did not show agreement because the
weighted kappa coefficients for z-scores of -1 and -2 were 0.189 and 0.227,
respectively.</p><p>All comparisons of PAs differed considerably. The mean differences in weight, height,
and BMI were statistically different between the hospitalized and control groups in
children aged 1 month to 5 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</xref>). The
PA was significantly different between the hospitalized and control groups after
correcting for confounding variables (i.e., sex, age, BMI, maternal education, type of
delivery, and breastfeeding) by covariance analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t03">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>

group) and their nutritional status at the time of hospital admission according to their
BMI is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</xref>. By performing this
correlation, we were able to identify the ward with the most malnourished patients.
Patients who were staying in the endocrinology ward more frequently exhibited obesity.
Patients admitted to the cardiology and gastroenterology wards more frequently exhibited
severe thinness and slimness. Furthermore, patients were often classified as eutrophic
in the rheumatology, oncology, and pulmonology wards. The correlation map indicated that
breastfeeding was related to a normal weight (same point on the correspondence map).
Patients who were not breastfed more often exhibited severe thinness (same point on the
correspondence map) and had a risk of becoming overweight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Map of correspondence for nutritional status according to body mass index for

the pediatric wards of HCFMRP-USP. To analyze the patients&#x02019; nutritional status in this
study, we used calculation of the PA and performance of BIVA as complementary methods.
In this investigation, children in the pediatric wards of HCFMRP-USP were compared with
an unpaired control group. Patients who were selected for this study had a wide age
range (1 month to 18 years), which increased our sample size and made the study findings
more reliable.</p><p>Analysis of the percentage of weight (93.15%) and height (80.82%) conducted by the
nursing professionals in the pediatric wards allowed us to determine that data were
lacking from the medical records, especially information regarding length; when it was
not possible to perform both measurements, the staff did not even report estimated
values. Nevertheless, the percentage of length recorded in this study was more effective
than that reported in other Brazilian studies (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Measuring weight and height is
extremely important because these measurements can help classify a child&#x02019;s nutritional
status and determine the subsequent nutritional approach. Unfortunately, as mentioned in
several studies, classification of the nutritional status of hospitalized children is
often neglected (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Furthermore, many authors
have highlighted the need to appropriately intervene when patients experience some kind
of deficit in their nutrition (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Joosten et
al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) stated that it is crucial to screen
children at admission to prevent complications.</p><p>The prevalence of malnutrition verified in this study was similar to that of other
countries. According to the literature, the prevalence of malnutrition currently ranges
from 5%-27% in developed countries (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,). The
prevalence of malnutrition in hospitalized children of the Ibero-American countries
(<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) is as follows: Colombia, 27%
undernutrition and 6.3% overweight; Mexico, 12.2%; Cuba, 33.3% undernutrition and 10.9%
overweight; and Argentina, 49.6% undernutrition and 1.9% overweight.</p><p>The aforementioned prevalence data have led to considerations about the nutritional
transition within the HCFMRP-USP. In absolute numbers, the HCFMRP-USP has the lowest
undernutrition rate among the above-mentioned studies. In contrast, excess weight is a
great concern. According to data regarding the prevalence of malnutrition in a healthy
Brazilian population in 2008/2009, there was an observed transition from nutritional
deficit to overweight (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The National Center
for Health Statistics estimates that 16.9% of children and adolescents aged 2-19 years
in developed countries are obese (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Notably,
this phenomenon can be alarming from a public health standpoint; similarly to cases of
undernutrition, excess weight during childhood may have negative consequences for the
prognosis of any disease and may favor the onset of chronic diseases in the future
(<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Therefore, these results lead us to
suggest that it is essential to provide some nutritional education (i.e., information on
food types and games that increase the understanding of how and why children and
adolescents should eat better) to patients at the time of hospital discharge to improve
or solve the problem of malnutrition.</p><p>With respect to the use of BIA in children, Farias et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) employed a standardized PA (obtained by using the PA corrected
for sex and BMI for a reference population) to assess nutritional risk in 2012. These
authors attained promising results and concluded that this tool was able to detect
changes in the study population (patients with bone marrow transplantation) more
sensitively than could the WHO criteria for BMI/A (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We were unable to directly compare our results with those of Farias et
al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) because the PA values were not
standardized in our study. However, we can state that PA is a promising tool with which
to assess the nutritional status in these transplanted children without requiring weight
or height measurements. This tool also proved to be more sensitive for detecting body
changes associated with undernutrition.</p><p>PA measurements in children have been used in a few published studies. However, many
studies have shown that PA measurement is a good alternative method for predicting
malnutrition in adults (i.e., low PA value) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Kyle et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) examined ways to associate the PA with other malnutrition assessment
methods for screening adults. These authors concluded that the PA is a useful tool for
identifying nutritional risk at hospital admission (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>The importance of using different tools to evaluate the nutritional status of children,
as we have proposed, was also reinforced in a Brazilian study involving an indigenous
study population (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Guida et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) demonstrated that BIVA is not comparable with
BMI/A (using the WHO graphics) in children aged 8 years, especially when they are
overweight. These authors highlighted that appropriate BIVA cutoff points are not yet
available and stated that combining analytical tools could assist in the dietary
treatment of hospitalized children (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>In 2012, Hartman et al. (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) conducted a review of
different screening tools for malnutrition and attempted to establish a correlation
among the methods to unify them. However, these authors found no consensus regarding the
standardization of methods, indicating that attention to nutritional status is easily
overlooked.</p><p>There have been many discussions regarding the application of screening methods tailored
for each specialty. BIVA is an inexpensive and current tool that is widely used at our
hospital. Likewise, PA measurements can be easily calculated using the above-mentioned
formula.</p><p>According to the correlation maps, the various pediatric wards should adopt distinct
approaches for managing malnutrition. For example, patients in the endocrinology ward
should receive nutritional education, whereas the staff in the cardiology ward should be
concerned with undernutrition. This strategy could make the pediatric wards more
effective. As observed in the correlation map, breastfeeding is beneficial for children
with any disease. Nevertheless, the underlying diseases should not be ignored during the
assessment of nutritional status in these patients.</p><p>In the present study, the authors were able to develop and propose a protocol that
requires validation and subsequent implementation. The proposed screening method can
improve the service in pediatric wards and aid the performance of other studies that
will consistently standardize and verify whether the prevalence of malnutrition in
hospitalized children is different among wards. The screening protocol has been tailored
to HCFMRP-USP, and it combines the WHO methods with BIVA/PA to screen hospitalized
children at admission (Supplementary Material).</p><p>The prevalence of malnutrition at the HCFMRP/USP, Brazil, is consistent with our
hypothesis; however, it is possible to improve these data using other tools (i.e., BIVA
and PA) despite disagreeing with anthropometry. According to our study findings, weight,
height, and bioimpedance can be evaluated at admission in all children. These measures
should enable early intervention in terms of diet therapy and thereby reduce the length
of hospital stay. BIVA and PA should also be used in series to easily evaluate any
changes in their values. Similar studies must be conducted in the future to establish
new perspectives and improve the pediatric wards.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><media id="suppl4861" mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="1414-431X-bjmbr-1414-431X20155012-S1.pdf" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to the computer technician Vitor Padovan for his constant help.
