Inner ear malformation, such as enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), is a characteristic feature of Pendred syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder defined by hearing loss and goitre. Pendrin, also known as sodium-independent chloride/iodide transporter, is an anion exchanger protein that in humans is encoded by the <italic>SLC26A4</italic> gene (solute carrier family 26, member 4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Pendrin was identified as a causative gene of Pendred syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and non-syndromic hearing loss with EVA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Various mutations in the <italic>SLC26A4</italic> gene associated with Pendred syndrome and non-syndromic hearing loss with EVA have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. While Pendred syndrome patients do not exhibit serious symptom in the kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, pendrin is predominantly expressed in the inner ear, thyroid and kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Some reported mutations on <italic>SLC26A4</italic> cause an impaired pendrin transporter function, others affect protein folding, localization, or trafficking of pendrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Roughly 50&#x02013;80% of patients with EVA, have mutations in <italic>SLC26A4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Genetic inactivation of <italic>Slc26a4</italic> in mice established a causative role of pendrin on inner ear dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although Pendred syndrome is autosomal recessive, mono-allelic mutations of <italic>SLC26A4</italic> are often found in patients who are diagnosed with Pendred syndrome or non-syndromic hearing loss with EVA. Moreover, some patients diagnosed with Pendred syndrome do not carry any mutations of the <italic>SLC26A4</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that compromised pendrin regulatory machinery may result in hearing loss, however, the regulator of pendrin remains elusive.</p><p id="Par4">Eph receptors constitute the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and interact with plasma-membrane-bound ephrin ligands. Ephrins are divided into two subclasses, A subclass (ephrin-A1-A5 in mammals), which are tethered to the cell membrane by GPI-anchor, and B subclass (ephrin-B1-B3), which are characterized by a transmembrane domain, followed by a short cytoplasmic domain. Ephs are divided on the basis of sequence similarity and ligand affinity into A (EphA1-A8 and A10) and B (EphB1-B4 and B6) subclasses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In the nervous system, Ephs are known to be involved in axon guidance, neural crest cell migration, compartment boundary formation and synapse formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Ephs and their ligands also play important roles in vascular development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We have previously shown that ephrin-B2 and EphBs binding regulate vascular morphogenesis. EphB/ephrin-B2 regulates vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 2 and 3 internalization in endothelial cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, suggesting functional roles of Eph/ephrins in transmembrane protein localization. Eph/ephrin interactions also govern the compartmentalization of cells in epithelial tissue formation. Loss of ephrin-B2 in the epithelium results in abnormal morphology of the inner ear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here we identify <italic>EPHA2</italic> as another causative gene of Pendred syndrome with <italic>SLC26A4</italic>. Pendrin is identified as a binding partner of EphA2. <italic>EphA2</italic> knock out (KO) mice exhibit abnormal structures in epithelial tissues with mislocalization of pendrin, including in the inner ear and thyroid. Given the phenotypic similarity of inner ear epithelial ephrin-B2 deficient mice with pendrin loss of function mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, we re-examine the binding of ephrin-B2 with EphA2. Although it is assumed that the ligands of class-A Eph receptors are generally ephrin-As, we find that ephrin-B2 forms a complex with EphA2. Stimulation of EphA2 with ephrin-B2 induces internalization of EphA2 and pendrin from the plasma membrane leading to weaker autophosphorylation of EphA2 than that with ephrin-A1. We find that a subset of mutated forms of pendrin identified from Pendred syndrome patients do not bind to EphA2 and is not regulated after stimulation of EphA2 with ephrin-B2. Moreover, we identify EphA2 mutations in patients diagnosed with non-syndromic hearing loss with EVA carrying mono-allelic mutation of <italic>SLC26A4</italic>. Induction of the identified EphA2 mutations reveals a compromised binding ability of EphA2 with ephrin-B2, but not ephrin-A1. As a result, ephrin-B2 induced pendrin internalization is impaired. Our result reveals an unexpected relationship between the Eph/ephrin system and Pendred syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of pendrin as a binding partner of EphA2</title><p id="Par6">EphA2 is highly expressed in epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In the kidney, immunoreactive signal against an EphA2 antibody was confirmed in the lectin Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) positive collecting duct (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Strong expression of EphA2 in the basement membrane of the kidney epithelium in the collecting duct was observed, which was diminished in kidney sections from <italic>EphA2</italic> knock out mice (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b, c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a specific signal corresponding to EphA2 was also seen in dot-like structures at the apical region of the epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). To gain further insight into the role of EphA2 in epithelial cells, we carried out an interactome analysis of EphA2. Immunoprecipitation of EphA2 from the mouse kidney tissue using a specific antibody against EphA2 was examined. Western blotting analysis has shown that 80% of total EphA2 in the lysate was precipitated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). After confirmation of specific precipitation by silver staining (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), the eluted proteins were analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), compared to an IgG control using label free quantification. Given the important role of Eph/ephrin system as a regulator of co-receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we focused on transmembrane proteins for further analysis. Among them, <italic>Slc26a4</italic> (pendrin) protein was identified with the highest enrichment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). To confirm the interaction of EphA2 and pendrin, a tagged version of both proteins was overexpressed in HEK293T cells. When myc-tagged pendrin was immunoprecipitated with an anti-myc-tag-antibody, V5-EphA2 was co-precipitated (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). Moreover, the intracellular domain of EphA2 with the transmembrane domain was co-precipitated with myc-tagged pendrin but not a construct containing the extracellular domain of EphA2 with the transmembrane domain (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>). In addition to its expression in the kidney, pendrin is known to be expressed at the apical surface of the cells in the spiral prominence of the cochlear duct in the inner ear and in the follicular cells in the thyroid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

While the ligands of EphAs are assumed to be ephrin-As, EphA4 has been shown to bind to ephrin-B2.

To confirm the interaction of EphA2 with ephrin-B2, we calculated the Kd value between extracellular domains of the ephrin-B2 and the EphA2. The fc-fusion protein of the EphA2 extracellular domain was immobilized onto the ELISA plate and binding of that of ephrin-B2 was examined. The Kd value between ephrin-B2 and EphA2 was 85&#x02009;nM (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>), while that between EphA2 and ephrin-A5, the classic ligand of EphA2 was 2&#x02009;nM (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). The binding of ephrin-B2 with EphA4 as a ligand has also been analyzed with a previous observation by Bowden et al. determining the Kd values of EphA4/ephrin-B2, EphA4/ephrin-A4, and EphA4/ephrin-A5, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

While tagged versions of EphA2 G355R and EphA2 T511M were effectively precipitated with Fc-fusion ephrin-A1 compared to EphA2 WT, Fc-fusion ephrin-B2 failed to pull down EphA2 G355R and T511M (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Consistently, internalization of EphA2 G355R and EphA2 T511M with pendrin induced by ephrin-B2 but not ephrin-A1 was suppressed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b, c</xref>). On the other hand, the mutated forms of EphA2 did not affect their ability to bind to pendrin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>Identified EphA2 mutations affect its ability to bind ephrin-B2 but not ephrin-A1.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Pulldown assay using ephrin-A1 or ephrin-B2 Fc fusion proteins with V5-EphA2 and V5-mutated EphA2.

Various previously identified pendrin mutations cause pendrin cytoplasmic localization. A subset of these mutations, such as H723R, are known to cause mis-folding of the protein, leading to accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Low temperature incubation and salicylate treatment of cultured cells, which are thought to help with protein-folding processes, rescues the membrane localization of H723R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. On the other hand, mis-localization of pendrin A372V from the plasma membrane is not restored by these treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, suggesting these mutations may affect pendrin trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane but not protein-folding. Here, we found that pendrin A372V, L445W, Q446R, and G672E did not bind to EphA2. Given the fact that loss of EphA2 disturbs pendrin apical localization in vivo and cell surface presentation in vitro, the binding of pendrin with EphA2 might be critical for pendrin recruitment to the apical membrane in the inner ear and the thyroid. Thus, loss of the ability of pendrin to bind EphA2 may cause delocalization of pendrin from the plasma membrane. Additionally, we examined the binding ability of EphA2 to four membrane located forms of mutated pendrin. None of the mutants had impaired interaction with EphA2. However, S166N, which is known to have an intact transporter activity and membrane localization in cultured cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, showed compromised endocytosis after ephrin-B2 stimulation. Multiple types of ephrin-A are expressed in the inner ear during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, meanwhile inner ear epithelial cell specific <italic>Efnb2</italic> KO mice exhibit EVA-like malformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. While the function of ephrin-A5 in the inner ear was investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, no reports have shown that any ephrin-A single KO mice show inner ear malformation. These observations suggest an indispensable role of ephrin-B2 in the morphology of the inner ear. In the EphA2 KO mice kidney, pendrin was also observed at the epithelial-epithelial contact sites. Interestingly, Eph/ephrin interaction would presumably occur at the cell-to-cell contact sites. Thus, EphA2 might also be important to exclude pendrin from cell-to-cell contact sites and contributes to the restricted pendrin localization at the apical surface (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Furthermore, we have also identified two <italic>EPHA2</italic> mutations from patients carrying mono-allelic <italic>SLC26A4</italic> mutation. The induction of mutations, identified in the patients carrying the mono-allelic <italic>SLC26A4</italic> mutation, into EphA2 impaired its binding ability to ephrin-B2 but not ephrin-A1. While the effect of the substitution of pendrin Ala434 to Thr on molecular activity or localization is not known, the substitution of Thr410 to Met is known to result in mis-localization of pendrin from the plasma membrane and loss of iodide efflux ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. We could not access the sequence of the patient&#x02019;s father, but her healthy mother carried the mono-allelic <italic>EPHA2</italic> mutation and did not have any mutation in the <italic>SLC26A4</italic> gene implying a synergistic effect of dual mutations on <italic>EPHA2</italic> and <italic>SLC26A4</italic> on symptoms. Mono-allelic <italic>EPHA2</italic> mutation with the hetero-pendrin mutation may cause pendrin recruitment to the basolateral region in the patients, resulting in the insufficient amount of apical located pendrin and causing functional deficiencies (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>). Although pendrin localization might be controlled by a tissue-dependent mechanism, our results may suggest at least two potential roles of EphA2 in Pendred syndrome: (1) recruiting pendrin to the cell surface (2) excluding membrane localized pendrin from the basolateral region (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a</xref>). Pendred syndrome is the congenital hearing loss, suggesting the importance of development of the inner ear. The gene deletion of <italic>Efnb2</italic> with a constitutive cre driver line in the inner ear epithelial cells cause malformation at E15.5 likewise <italic>Slc26a4</italic> KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, it is likely that EphA2 KO mice may have the inner ear defects at E15.5. Further analysis is warranted.</p><p id="Par18">Given the fact that the identified amino acid substitutions, G355R and T511M are not located in the LBD, it would be interesting to reveal how these two mutations affect ligand-binding specificity between ephrin-B2 and ephrin-A1 to EphA2. As the substitutions replace relatively small residues with bulky residues, it could greatly influence the structural flexibility or rigidity between the surrounding domains. It is worthy noting that EphA2 has been hypothesized to adopt distinct overall structures, &#x0201c;upright&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;flat&#x0201d; with respect to the plasma membrane, depending on cluster density to exert different signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Since ephrin-A and ephrin-B are anchored to the plasma membrane in different ways and differ in the distance from the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, the identified mutations may alter the preference of the overall EphA2 complex structure and may explain the ligand-class-specific effect. Another interesting model to be considered is the hypothetical hexameric form of the EphA4/ephrin-B3 complex&#x03000;reconstructed from crystal lattice assembly, whose distinct asymmetrical conformation at FN1-FN2 linkage necessitates the flexibility in the region (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8b, c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, while it would not be necessary for the trimer of the EphA4/ephrin-A5 complex and for the dimer of the EphA2/ephrin-A5 complex (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8d, e</xref>). Some protomers of EphA4 need to take on an extended FN1-FN2 conformation while the other protomers bend at FN1-FN2 linkage to alter for all the protomers to attach to the surface of flat membrane (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8c</xref>). While oligomerization interfaces are not completely conserved among EphAs and the above model of EphA4 does not necessarily support similar clustering of EphA2-ephrinB2, distinct clustering structures imposed by ephrin-A and ephrin-B and their differential requirement for the flexibility in domain-linkage is another possible scenario.</p><p id="Par19">Some of congenital deafness patients, such as Alport Syndrome, Marshall Syndrome, Stickler Syndrome, and Norrie disease, are associated with cataracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Interestingly, EphA2 is also known as a causative gene of cataracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. It has been shown that homozygous deletion of EphA2 in the KST085 mouse line or the C57Bl/6/129 mouse line backcrossed with the FVB/N background mice are reported to develop progressive cortical cataracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. On the other hand, we did not observe cataracts in our KO mice, which were generated and kept in the C57Bl/6/129 line. This might be due to the different genetic background of mice. Although the two patients carrying <italic>EPHA2</italic> mutation identified this study do not have cataracts, dominant pathogenic variants of human <italic>EPHA2</italic> have been reported and the subjects carrying these variants have cataracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. <italic>EphA2</italic> KO mice are shown to have more susceptibility to microbial infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, however, we did not observe any symptom related to this mouse phenotype in the patients. Reported cataract-related <italic>EPHA2</italic> mutations are either located in the intracellular kinase domain or the SMA domain, causing EphA2 loss of function. Conversely identified EphA2 mutations affecting ligand class specificity of ephrins, might cause more restricted effects.
