</p><p>The WHO has also developed a global strategy for programmes that involve PCC in integrated care to deal with the barriers encountered by current health systems such as demographic transition, highly prevalent chronic diseases and subsequent economic burden.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> As defined by the WHO, integrated care is &#x02018;bringing together inputs, delivery, management and organisation of services related to diagnosis, treatment, care, rehabilitation and health promotion&#x02019;.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p><p>Several healthcare associations and organisations including the Canadian Nurses Association, Canadian Medical Association and Health Action Lobby have identified PCC as one of the five foundations for integrated care, along with access, relational continuity, management continuity and information continuity.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 11 12</xref> Moreover, ascribing a significant role to PCC in oral healthcare, several oral healthcare organisations in Europe, Australia and North America have introduced PCC as a core element in the evaluation of integrated healthcare services.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4 13&#x02013;15</xref> The PCC model of integration of oral healthcare within primary health has been highlighted to be effective in addressing oral health disparities among Indigenous communities.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Moreover, the role of PCC becomes imperative in the case of Indigenous populations considering historical trauma due to colonisation and assimilation policies.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These historical traumas included loss of homeland, loss of family for children in residential schools, loss of traditional cultural practices as well as mistrust, distress and fear towards the intentions of non-Indigenous people.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> Hence, consideration of Indigenous patients&#x02019; cultural values, beliefs and preferences, as well as their holistic vision of health, is essential in the implementation of PCC in Indigenous populations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p><p>According to the recent WHO report there is still lack of evidence focusing on the application of people-centred integrated care in primary healthcare settings.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, as highlighted in a systematic review by Mills <italic>et al</italic> in 2014, there is still a gap in regard to the application of PCC concepts from patients&#x02019; perspectives and in oral health research.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Also, Harnagea <italic>et al</italic> emphasised in a recent scoping review the lack of evidence on the outcomes of integrated primary oral healthcare programmes among disadvantaged populations.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore patients&#x02019; perspectives and experiences in regard to patient-centred integrated oral healthcare in a primary healthcare organisation serving a northern Quebec Cree population.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This collaborative study was part of a larger Canadian Institutes of Health Research&#x02013;funded project entitled &#x02018;Oral Health Integrated into Primary Care: Participatory Evaluation of Implementation and Performance in Quebec Cree Communities&#x02019;.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> We adopted a multiple case study design within a qualitative approach and developmental evaluation methodology.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> The case study design allows an in-depth understanding of a single or small number of &#x02018;cases&#x02019; in their real-world context&#x02019;.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>

</p><p>This study was conducted in four Cree communities that were purposefully selected based on population size as well as on geographical, cultural, healthcare and oral care characteristics. We used maximum variation sampling and snowball techniques to identify and recruit adult patients (&#x02265;18 years) in need of oral healthcare and who attended the local dental clinic in 2016&#x02013;2017. In-depth audio-recorded interviews, on average 60&#x02009;min long, were conducted in English or French by two research team members trained in qualitative methods. These team members had no existing relationship with the participants. We designed the semistructured interview guide based on the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> Data collection and analysis were performed concurrently until data saturation was reached.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> Data saturation was reached after the 11th interview; nevertheless, data collection was continued up to 14th interview to ensure the saturation level.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis included transcription, debriefing, codification, data display, thematic content analysis and triangulation.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> We used the eight Picker Principles of PCC and Valentijn&#x02019;s Rainbow Model of Integrated Care as conceptual models to guide exploring and determining the scope of elements of PCC within the integrated care network.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31 34</xref> Picker&#x02019;s principles comprise: respect for patient&#x02019;s preferences, information and education, access to care, emotional support, involvement of family and friends, continuity and transition, physical comfort and coordination of care.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The domains of the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care are characterised by three categories: scope, types and enablers of integration. Scope comprises person-based and population-based care; types include system, organisational, professional and clinical integration; and enablers include functional and normative integration.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> We performed a combination of deductive and inductive thematic content analysis using ATLAS.ti V.1.6.0&#x000a0;software (ATLAS.ti, GmbH; Berlin, Germany).<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The deductive approach encompassed the creation of provisional categories derived a priori from the conceptual models. This was embedded with an inductive approach, which consisted in adapting these provisional categories into new categories and themes based on the content of the transcripts.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 35</xref> Two research trainees (RS, NK) independently performed the analysis and then discussed the emerging codes in detail until they achieved a consensus on emergent categories and themes.

They highlighted the importance of respecting their perspectives in clinical decision making, integrating Indigenous personnel in dental teams, optimising care coordination, providing a supportive environment and oral health promotion. The emphasis on culturally sensitive care, development of a more supportive environment and parental engagement for oral health promotion were also linked to addressing the historical impacts such as intergenerational trauma, loss of cultural practices, fear and mistrust and loss of parenting skills.</p><p>We used Picker&#x02019;s principles of PCC for analysing the results due to their relevance, comprehensiveness and ability to conceptualise various elements of PCC.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Our findings support these principles as essential elements in delivering PCC in integrated oral health care<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).
