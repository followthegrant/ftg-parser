The Gem1 protein may play a role in regulating ERMES function. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> strains lacking any of Mmm1, Mdm12, or Mdm10 are known to show a variety of phenotypic defects including altered mitochondrial morphology and defects in the assembly of &#x003b2;-barrel proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane. Here we examine ERMES complex components in <italic>N. crassa</italic> and show that Mmm1 is an ER membrane protein containing a Cys residue near its N-terminus that is conserved in the class Sordariomycetes. The residue occurs in the ER-lumen domain of the protein and is involved in the formation of disulphide bonds that give rise to Mmm1 dimers. Dimer formation is required for efficient assembly of Tom40 into the TOM complex. However, no effects are seen on porin assembly or mitochondrial morphology. This demonstrates a specificity of function and suggests a direct role for Mmm1 in Tom40 assembly. Mutation of a highly conserved region in the cytosolic domain of Mmm1 results in moderate defects in Tom40 and porin assembly, as well as a slight morphological phenotype. Previous reports have not examined the role of Mmm2 with respect to mitochondrial protein import and assembly. Here we show that absence of Mmm2 affects assembly of &#x003b2;-barrel proteins and that lack of any ERMES structural component results in defects in Tom22 assembly. Loss of <italic>N. crassa</italic> Gem1 has no effect on the assembly of these proteins but does affect mitochondrial morphology.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) grant: MOP-84284 to FEN.

Recently, interactions between proteins in the ER membrane and the outer mitochondrial membrane that could act as tethers between the two organelles have been described. In mammals, two sets of interactions have been reported. The first involves an interaction between the ER calcium channel IP<sub>3</sub>R (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor) and the mitochondrial VDAC (voltage dependent anion channel) protein that also involves a chaperone <xref rid="pone.0071837-Szabadkai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the second, ER-localized Mfn2 tethers mitochondria to the ER by homotypic and heterotypic interactions with mitochondrially localized Mfn2 or Mfn1 <xref rid="pone.0071837-deBrito1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the ER-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) has been shown to tether the two organelles <xref rid="pone.0071837-Kornmann2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The ERMES is composed of four interacting structural proteins: the ER membrane protein, Mmm1; two mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) proteins, Mmm2 (Mdm34) and Mdm10; and the cytosolic bridge protein, Mdm12. The Gem1 protein has also been reported to co-purify with the ERMES and it may play a role in regulating the size, organization, and function of the complex <xref rid="pone.0071837-Kornmann3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Stroud1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, a different study concluded that Gem1 is not involved in ERMES assembly or maintenance <xref rid="pone.0071837-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The genes encoding the four structural ERMES proteins of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were originally identified in genetic screens for mutants with defects in mitochondrial distribution and morphology <xref rid="pone.0071837-Sogo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Dimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Youngman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Localization studies and analysis of mutants have suggested that each of the proteins is involved in several cellular functions. Strains lacking any one of the four proteins were found to contain large spherical condensed mitochondria, exhibited defects in mitochondrial inheritance, showed loss of mtDNA, and had altered ratios of mitochondrial phospholipids <xref rid="pone.0071837-Kornmann2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Sogo1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Dimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Youngman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Hanekamp1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Osman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Mdm10, Mdm12, and Mmm1 were also required for mitochondrial motility mediated by attachment to the actin cytoskeleton <xref rid="pone.0071837-Boldogh1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Boldogh2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Specific mutant alleles of MDM10 and MMM1 have also been found to increase the rate of mtDNA migration to the nucleus <xref rid="pone.0071837-Hanekamp1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Unexpectedly, mutants lacking Mmm1, Mdm12, or Mdm10 were also shown to have defects in the assembly of &#x003b2;-barrel proteins into the MOM <xref rid="pone.0071837-Meisinger1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Meisinger2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Wideman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The process of &#x003b2;-barrel assembly is accomplished by the TOB complex (topogenesis of &#x003b2;-barrel proteins), which is also known as the SAM complex (sorting and assembly machinery). The Mdm10 protein has been shown to associate with the TOB/SAM complex <xref rid="pone.0071837-Meisinger1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Meisinger2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Wideman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Lackey1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> in addition to being a component of the ERMES. The outer membrane protein Tom22, which has one &#x003b1;-helical membrane spanning domain, has also been identified as a TOB complex substrate <xref rid="pone.0071837-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Thornton1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and defects in the assembly of this TOM complex protein have also been noted in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains lacking Mdm10 <xref rid="pone.0071837-Meisinger2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In other fungi, such as <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, <italic>Podospora anserina</italic>, and <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, alterations in mitochondrial morphology have been observed in mutants affecting the orthologues of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ERMES proteins <xref rid="pone.0071837-Wideman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-JametVierny1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Koch1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Prokisch1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

In this regard, it has been shown that in a strain containing a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>mmm1</italic>, &#x003b2;-barrel assembly defects precede morphological alterations following a shift from the permissive to the restrictive temperature <xref rid="pone.0071837-Meisinger1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Similarly, mitochondria containing low levels of an Mdm10 mutant protein had Tom40 assembly defects, but normal levels of phospholipids and only minor changes in mitochondrial morphology <xref rid="pone.0071837-Yamano1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Another study concluded that the primary function of ERMES was to maintain the link between ER and mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0071837-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the absence of this link, mitochondrial morphology is altered which leads to secondary effects on mitochondrial inheritance. In the present study we have reasoned that if ERMES proteins are involved in different functions, then it should be possible to define domains in each protein responsible for at least some of those functions. We have examined the effects of mutations in two regions of the <italic>N. crassa</italic> Mmm1 protein with respect to mitochondrial morphology and TOB complex function. In addition, since there is currently controversy as to the role of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Gem1 protein in ERMES composition and function <xref rid="pone.0071837-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Kornmann3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Stroud1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> we have also examined a <italic>&#x00394;gem1 N. crassa</italic> with respect to phenotypes characteristic of ERMES mutants. We extended our analysis to a strain lacking Mmm2 since, to our knowledge, mitochondrial protein import/assembly defects have never been examined for mutants lacking this ERMES complex member.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Strains and growth of <italic>N. crassa</italic>

Z-stacks (16 images, 0.2 &#x000b5;m spacing, ASI Nanodrive) were acquired for each hyphae. Digital images were obtained with a Hamamatsu Orca R2 camera, controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Post image processing and mitochondrial measurements were performed manually using Metamorph offline software (Molecular Devices). The length of individual mitochondria varied, therefore, to obtain width measurements of long mitochondria (&#x0003e;2 microns), multiple lines approximately 1 micron apart were drawn perpendicular to the long axis of the mitochondria. Optical planes used for width measurements of individual mitochondria were chosen based on maximum fluorescence intensity of MitoTracker. Measurements of mitochondria were obtained from at least four hyphae for each experiment.

We wished to investigate the location of Mmm1 in <italic>N. crassa</italic> by cell fractionation. Since no antibody to <italic>N. crassa</italic> Mmm1 is available, we constructed a plasmid containing the <italic>N. crassa mmm1</italic> gene with a C-terminal triple hemaglutinin (HA) epitope-tag expressed from the endogenous <italic>mmm1</italic> promoter.

These data are consistent with the notion that Mmm1 is an ER-membrane protein that interacts with MOM proteins but do not exclude the possibility that it is a MOM protein that interacts with the ER. To distinguish between these two alternatives we examined mitochondrial OMV for the presence of Mmm1-HA. If Mmm1 was a bona fide MOM protein it would fractionate with OMV. On the other hand, if Mmm1 was an ER protein, then it seemed likely that its association with gradient purified mitochondria in our fractionation experiments would be due to small patches of ER membrane that stay associated with mitochondria at ERMES attachment points during isolation and gradient purification. However, since OMV are isolated by shearing the MOM from mitochondria followed by purification based on density in sucrose gradients <xref rid="pone.0071837-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, membrane fragments containing both MOM and ER would be expected to separate from fragments made up solely of MOM. Western blot analysis of OMV prepared from Mmm1-HA3 revealed the presence of the MOM protein Tom40, whereas Mmm1-HA, the inner mitochondrial membrane protein Tim23, and the intermembrane space protein Tim8 could not be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071837-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This result is consistent with the observation that Mmm1 was undetectable in <italic>N.crassa</italic> OMVs by mass spectrometry <xref rid="pone.0071837-Schmitt1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Conversely, we have previously shown that Mdm10, another ERMES component, does fractionate with mitochondrial OMVs <xref rid="pone.0071837-Wideman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Here we have also shown that Mdm10 only fractionates with gradient purified mitochondria and not the PMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071837-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Mmm1 is an ER protein. During subcellular fractionation, fragments of ER membrane appear to stay attached to mitochondria at ERMES junctions. They also suggest that there are two populations of Mmm1. One population is tightly associated with mitochondria while the other is not, and fractionates with the PMP.</p><fig id="pone-0071837-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0071837.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Subcellular localization of HA-tagged Mmm1.</title><p>A.

Though it seemed unlikely, it was conceivable that the mutant protein was not properly integrated into the ER membrane. To test this possibility we performed alkali extractions on crude mitochondria from strain A116-124. The protein exhibited similar behavior to the control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0071837.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Despite the fact that the mutant protein was readily detected in crude mitochondrial preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071837-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), only much reduced amounts were seen in flotation gradient purified mitochondria (compare ratios of Mmm1 in A116-124, Mmm1-HA8, and Mmm1-HA5 in the crude mitochondrial preparation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071837-g005">Figure 5A</xref> to those in the gradient purified mitochondrial fraction of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071837-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).

This conclusion is supported by the observation that the Cys residue at position five of the protein is predicted to occur in the oxidizing environment of the ER lumen and is involved in disulphide bond formation. The C5S mutation results in loss of the disulphide bond and a Tom40 assembly defect. However, no other characteristics of strains lacking Mmm1 were observed in the C5S strain. This demonstrates that the set of typical phenotypes observed in cells lacking ERMES components can be separated, at least for Mmm1, and that defects in Tom40 assembly are not secondary to other aspects of the phenotype. Furthermore, since the <italic>&#x00394;mmm1</italic> strain has defects in Tom40, porin, and Tom22 assembly while the C5A mutation affects only Tom40, an effect on specific aspects of Tom40 assembly is implied for the Cys mutation.</p><p>The mechanism whereby a missing disulfide bond in the ER lumen affects Tom40 assembly in the MOM may be related to the structure and topology of Mmm1. Our findings suggest that disulphide bond formation results in an Mmm1 homodimer. Dimerization in the ER lumen would keep two subunits in close proximity. Subunits acting in tandem may be important for interaction with other ERMES components or other possible Mmm1 functions. A problem in assessing how Mmm1 could directly influence TOB complex function is based on simple physical constraints. ERMES in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are reported to occur in only a small number of punctae in fluorescence microscopy studies <xref rid="pone.0071837-Kornmann2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071837-Kornmann3" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, whereas the TOB complex would be expected to have a more random distribution throughout the MOM. However, the distribution of the ERMES and its components has not been investigated in <italic>N. crassa</italic> and it is conceivable that the arrangement is different in the organism. Furthermore, it has been recently suggested that there may be many smaller ERMES in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> than previously thought <xref rid="pone.0071837-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The phenotype of the A116-124 mutant is complex. No transformants expressing the mutant protein at the level of the control HA-tagged Mmm1 protein could be identified. Furthermore, the amount of Mmm1 in crude mitochondrial preparations from the mutant strain is reduced even further upon gradient purification of mitochondria. This may be due to reduced stability of the protein and/or reduced binding to mitochondria. Surprisingly, even though the A116-124 mutation occurs in the cytosolic domain of Mmm1, it eliminates disulphide bond formation in the ER lumen domain. Perhaps conformational changes in the cytosolic domain are communicated through the ER membrane to the lumen domain, preventing Cys bond formation. Despite the much reduced level of the protein observed in purified subcellular fractions, it still partially rescues the mitochondrial morphology, Tom40 assembly, and porin assembly defects seen in the <italic>&#x00394;mmm1</italic> strain, while fully rescuing the Tom22 assembly defect.</p><p>Although Mmm2 has been recognized as an ERMES component, it has not been previously examined with respect to mitochondrial import/assembly. Here we show that deletion of the gene results in a defective assembly phenotype for Tom40 and porin that resembles the defects seen in <italic>mmm1</italic> or <italic>mdm12</italic> mutants of <italic>N. crassa</italic>. We have also shown that mitochondria isolated from cells lacking any of the ERMES structural components are defective in the assembly of Tom22. This differs from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> where mitochondria lacking Mdm12 were shown to assemble Tom22 normally <xref rid="pone.0071837-Meisinger2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>The mechanisms by which ERMES components affect the assembly of TOB complex substrates are not known, though models exist for the role of Mdm10 in Tom40 assembly. One suggests that Mdm10 is involved in the release of the Tom40 precursor from the TOB complex <xref rid="pone.0071837-Yamano1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This model is based on the observations that both deficiency of Mdm10 or overexpression of Mdm10 result in Tom40 assembly defects, while only overexpression results in a porin assembly defect. It was suggested that Mdm10 competes with &#x003b2;-barrel precursors for binding sites on the TOB complex and that the precursors have different affinities for these sites. Tom40 can be detected in association with the TOB complex as intermediate I during assembly assays, implying a relatively strong association. The porin precursor is not detected as such an intermediate in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, implying weaker binding. Thus, Mdm10 is required to release Tom40, but not porin, from its binding site on the TOB complex. On the other hand, overexpression of Mdm10 inhibits assembly of both precursors because the precursor binding site on the TOB complex is blocked by excess Mdm10. We previously suggested that <italic>N. crassa</italic> Mdm10 has a general effect on TOB complex function <xref rid="pone.0071837-Wideman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Interestingly, our model fits with certain aspects of the one described above since <italic>N. crassa</italic> strains lacking Mdm10 do have a porin assembly defect <xref rid="pone.0071837-Wideman1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and a stable intermediate for porin assembly can be detected in <italic>N. crassa</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0071837-Hoppins1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.
