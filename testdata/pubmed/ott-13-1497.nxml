In the HCC environment, different players, such as HSCs, MDSCs, and Tregs, contribute to HCC progression by building a negative network that leads to immune escape.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the last decade, many researchers have focused on understanding the modulation of the tumor microenvironment to reveal the mechanism of liver cancer.<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The tumor microenvironment that consists of liver-resident cells (e.g., liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and HSCs) and infiltrating immune cells (e.g., DCs, T cells, MDSCs, NK cells, Treg, and macrophages) is known to play an important role in HCC development in the liver. These cells promote HCC growth by the formation of negative immune responses.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> T cells (namely cytotoxic T cells), NK cells, and macrophages have the ability to kill tumor cells and eradicate established tumors.<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> DCs as antigen-presenting cells stimulated T-cell activation. However, in the tumor microenvironment, their abilities were generally suppressed by MDSCs and Tregs. HSCs exist in the space of Disse for the storage of vitamin A and play a central role in liver fibrosis and HCC development. In the liver cancer microenvironment, activated HSCs are capable of shaping an immunosuppressive environment through inducing an accumulation of MDSCs and inhibiting T-cell proliferation and function. However, the underlying mechanism was not entirely clear. In this study, we found that C3 plays an important role in HSC-mediated HCC progression. We demonstrated the capability of C3 to suppress BM-derived DC differentiation, enhance MDSCs and their subset expansion, promote T-cell apoptosis, and inhibit the proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro. We also investigated the role of C3 in HSCs in the mouse model of HCC (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In a previous study, HSCs were found to induce G-MDSC expansion but not Mo-MDSC expansion through the COX2-PGE2 pathway.<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> However, there was no study on the effects of C3 in HSC-mediated HCC progression before our study, and for the first time, we reported the immunomodulatory roles of C3 produced by HSCs in liver cancer.<fig id="F0005" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the stimulatory effect of C3 produced by HSCs in HCC. In the HCC microenvironment, HSCs produced C3 to induce T-cell apoptosis and reduced the inhibition of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proliferation. In addition, HSCs induced MDSCs expansion via C3; HSCs attenuated DC activity through C3 by the decreased expressions of CD11c, CD80, CD86, and MHCII, and slightly increased CD274 expression. HSCs disrupted the immunological balance in HCC, resulting in dominant immunosuppression and tumor progression.</p></caption><graphic content-type="print-only" xlink:href="OTT-13-1497-g0005"/></fig></p><p>MDSCs are one of the most important regulators of immune responses in liver cancer.<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> MDSCs expand in pathological conditions, such as cancer, infections, sepsis, trauma, transplantation, and some autoimmune disorders.<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> MDSCs could be induced from mature human monocytes through HSCs dose-dependently.<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Furthermore, activated human hepatic stellate cells induce myeloid-derived suppressor cells from peripheral blood monocytes in a CD44-dependent fashion.<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Bone marrow cells cultured with HSC-CM express lower levels of CD11c, CD80, CD86, and MHCII (<xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that HSCs inhibit the differentiation of IMCs into mature myeloid cells and increase the expansion of MDSCs. These results were consistent with our previous results and those of other researchers.<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, knockdown of C3 in HSCs reverses this effect. Notably, knockdown of C3 in HSCs decreased the expansion of Mo-MDSCs but had no effect on G-MDSCs. Previous results showed that HSCs induced MDSCs and G-MDSCs via a COX2/PEG2-dependent pathway,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> which seemed to suggest that HSCs induced expansion of G-MDSCs via a COX2/PEG2-dependent pathway, but increased the expression of Mo-MDSCs through C3 signaling.</p><p>HSCs also influence immune suppression by promoting T-cell apoptosis via the C3 pathway.<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The effect of C3 on the immune response is dual. Local C3 secretion by macrophages leads to IL-17A-mediated inflammatory cell Th17 cell infiltration into the kidney.<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, macrophages from C3<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice showed a reduced capability to stimulate an alloreactive T-cell response.<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Human plasma C3 is not essential for the development of T cells.<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> However, our results demonstrated that C3 derived from HSCs had a suppressive effect on T-cell proliferation. The inconsistent effect of C3 on immune response may be due to other cell populations or coexisting factors in the local inflammatory environment, which could directly or indirectly modulate C3 signaling on immune cells. In this study, the role of C3 was in accordance with that reported in islet transplantation.<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In addition, C3 is produced by hepatocytes and is abundant in the liver;<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> thus, why C3-deficient HSCs lose their immunosuppressive abilities in vivo is of special interest. In theory, the C3 expression of HCC cells would affect the DCs and T cells. Interestingly, the local environment theory showed, in many circumstances, such as the regulation of T-cell response<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and osteoclast differentiation,<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> that the effector complement components are locally produced by related cells, not by systemic complement components produced by hepatocytes. Another possibility is that HSCs produce a C3 isoform that is different from that produced by hepatocytes in structure and function. A more thorough investigation of the isoform of C3 is needed to support this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data showed that HSCs promoted HCC progression, which suggests that the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the immunomodulatory activity of HSCs are required to provide more insight into the progression of HCC and boost the development of therapeutic strategies for HCC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank our colleagues for their valuable efforts and comments on this article.
