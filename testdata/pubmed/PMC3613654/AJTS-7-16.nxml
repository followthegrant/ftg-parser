Similarly blood donor laboratory records from 1<sup>st</sup> January-31<sup>st</sup> December 2006 and during 1<sup>st</sup> January 2008-31<sup>st</sup> December 2009 were reviewed.</p><p>Prior to 2007 conventional tube techniques using red cells suspended in normal saline were routinely used for antibody screening using two group O screening cells. Antigen coverage included D, C, E, c, e, Fy<sup>a</sup>, Fy<sup>b</sup>, Jk<sup>a</sup>, Jk<sup>b</sup>, Le<sup>a</sup>, Le<sup>b</sup>, Mi<sup>a</sup>, M, N, K, k, S, s, P1, Lu<sup>a</sup>, Lu<sup>b</sup> and Di<sup>a</sup>. Antibody identification was performed using a panel of eleven group O cells. Antibody screening and antibody identification panel cells were provided by the Thai National Blood Centre (NBC) of Thai Red Cross.</p><p>The indirect antiglobulin tube technique was used for antibody screening. Antibody identification techniques included a room temperature incubation phase, a 37&#x000b0;C phase and indirect antiglobulin phase using polyspecific anti-human globulin (containing anti-IgM, anti-IgG and anti-C3d which was manufactured by the Thai NBC).</p><p>Column agglutination technology was introduced into routine laboratory techniques for ABO and RhD grouping, antibody screening and antibody identification in 2008. All blood grouping and antibody screening was performed using an automated platform (AutoVue Innova&#x02122;, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, USA). ABO and RhD groups were tested using BioVue ABO-Rh/Reverse Grouping cassettes (Ortho BioVue<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> System, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, USA). Standard reverse grouping cells were A<sub>1</sub> and B cells (0.8% Affirmagen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, USA).</p><p>Antibody screening was performed using BioVue Poly cassettes (Ortho BioVue<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> System). Three group O screening cells were used in the antibody screen. 2 screening cells were obtained from Ortho Clinical Diagnostic (0.8% Selectogen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, USA). Antigens covered included: D, C, E, c, e, Fy<sup>a</sup>, Fy<sup>b</sup>, Jk<sup>a</sup>, Jk<sup>b</sup>, Le<sup>a</sup>, Le<sup>b</sup>, M, K, k, S, s, N, P<sub>1</sub>, Lu<sup>b</sup>, Kp<sup>b</sup>, and Js<sup>b</sup>. In addition a third group O screening cell which was Mi<sup>a</sup> and Di<sup>a</sup> positive, was provided by the Thai NBC. 0.8% cell suspensions of this screening cell were made in low ionic strength salt solution (LISS) supplied by Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (Ortho<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 0.8% red cell diluent).</p><p>Antibodies were further identified by manual CAT techniques using either DiaMed ID LISS-Coombs micro typing cards (DiaMed, Switzerland) or BioVue Poly cassettes (Ortho BioVue<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> System, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, USA) using a panel of eleven group O red cells provided by the Thai NBC. The CAT indirect antiglobulin technique was employed and performed at 37&#x000b0;C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Selective red cell antigen typing for the corresponding blood group alloantibody(ies) was performed following antibody(ies) identification.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>During 2006 when conventional tube techniques were used for antibody screening and antibody identification 220 out of 18,627 (1.2%) patients were identified with positive antibody screens [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Anti-Mi<sup>a</sup>, anti-Le<sup>a</sup>, anti-E, anti-Le<sup>b</sup>, anti-c and anti-D respectively were most frequently detected. While in the transfused patient population studied, the frequency of alloantibodies was 0.8% [0.28% were immune alloantibody(ies)]. In this group of subjects, the most frequent alloantibodies were anti-Mi<sup>a</sup>, anti-E, anti-Le<sup>a</sup>, anti-c, anti-Le<sup>b</sup> and anti-D respectively.</p><p>When conventional tube techniques were used, the overall frequency of alloantibodies in patients and donors was 0.7% with the most frequent alloantibodies being anti-Le<sup>a</sup>, anti-Le<sup>b</sup>, anti-Mi<sup>a</sup>, anti-P<sub>1</sub> and anti-E respectively. 0.9% of transfused patients had alloantibodies and 0.15% of patients had immune alloantibody(ies). In this group, in order of frequency, the most common antibody specificities were anti-Le<sup>a</sup>, anti-Mi<sup>a</sup>, anti-Le<sup>b</sup>, anti-P<sub>1</sub> and anti-E respectively.</p><p>The alloantibody specificities detected by conventional tube technique were consistent with previous reports in Central Thai patients. In Central Thais, the frequency of detected alloantibodies was 4.91% and the most frequent alloantibodies were anti-Le<sup>a</sup> (35.4%), anti-Le<sup>b</sup> (28.36%), anti-P<sub>1</sub> (21.83%), anti-Mi<sup>a</sup> (6.4%) and anti-E (3.88%).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Another study reported the frequency of alloantibodies ranging between 2.2 to 3.9%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Again anti-Le<sup>a</sup> (26.3%), anti-Le<sup>b</sup> (19.4%), anti-Mi<sup>a</sup> (16.4%), anti-P<sub>1</sub> (6.7%) and anti-E (5.3%) were the most common alloantibodies.</p><p>The frequencies of alloantibodies detected and the rank of antibody frequency in these studies were different from other studies. Possible explanations include different techniques, temperatures, and cells used for antibody screening and identification. Incubation at cooler temperatures would detect more cold reactive antibodies with fewer warm reactive alloantibodies. To our knowledge this would be the first report of alloantibody(ies) frequency in Thais using CAT for antibody screening and identification.</p><p>Following introduction of CAT for antibody screening and identification into our laboratory the incidence of anti-Mi<sup>a</sup>, anti-E, anti-c, Kidd and Duffy antibodies were more frequent than that associated with conventional tube techniques. Immune alloantibody(ies) were detected nearly twice as frequently when CAT was used compare to that of conventional tube techniques (0.28% v/s 0.15%). The reasons may include the increased sensitivity of CAT, or the improved quality of the antibody screen or panel cells. Anti-Le<sup>a</sup>, anti-Le<sup>b</sup> and anti-P<sub>1</sub> were less common in CAT compared to tube techniques again this was likely due to incubation at 37&#x000b0;C only for CAT.</p><p>Anti-Mi<sup>a</sup> is a very common antibody in Thais, Chinese and Taiwanese while there are no reports in Caucasians.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The Miltenberger antigen (Mi<sup>a</sup>) is commonly found in up to 15% of Chinese and South East Asian populations whereas it is far less common in other populations (&#x0003c;0.01%).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Antibodies to variant MNS antigens (Mi<sup>a</sup>) are common and behave like other MNS blood group antibodies. Most of these antibodies detected with Mi positive cells are IgM and tend to react best at cold temperatures. However, there are some that are IgG, active at 37&#x000b0;C reactive and clinically relevant. The frequency of anti-Mi<sup>a</sup> in Central Thais was previously reported as 9.72%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In this study we found that anti-Mi<sup>a</sup> was very common. The frequency of anti-Mi<sup>a</sup> varied depending on the detection technique used. For tube techniques anti-Mi<sup>a</sup> comprised 15.2% of alloantibodies detected, whereas when using CAT and screening cells that were Mi<sup>a</sup> positive, anti-Mi<sup>a</sup> was the most frequent antibody detected (32.4%). Again this difference may be due to different techniques and antigenic make-up of screening cells used. Anti-Mi<sup>a</sup> is clinically significant with reports of haemolytic transfusion reaction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] and haemolytic disease of the newborn.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Therefore in Asian Mongoloid populations it is extremely important that Mi<sup>a</sup> positive antibody screening cells and a number of those cells used for antibody identification are Mi<sup>a</sup> positive. Anti-c and anti-E were also frequent immune alloantibodies detected in Southern Thais. Both of these antibodies are clinically significant and have been associated with haemolytic transfusion reactions and mild to moderate haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Anti-D (3.9%) was not frequent in the Thai population due to the low frequency of RhD negative (&#x0003c;1.0%) within the Thais population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Although anti-D is rare in Thais, it often causes problems in clinical transfusion and severe haemolytic disease of the newborn because it is not well recognized by many clinicians.</p><p>There are differences in antibody specificities between Caucasian and Asian Mongoloid. Anti-K is a very clinically significant alloantibody in both clinical transfusion and haemolytic disease of the new born.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] and is found frequently in Caucasians but is very rare in Thai populations. In our study anti-K was not detected. Bejrachandra <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] found anti-K in only 1 out of 100,308 Central Thais tested. This may be due to the fact that most Thais are homogeneous kk[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] thus the rate of alloimmunization is very low.</p><p>Although there are increasing intermarriages between Thai women and Caucasian men there are no reports of HDN due to anti-K in the Thai population at this point in time. However, prenatal antibody screening is not included in the standard antenatal testing in most pregnancies throughout Thailand, the majority of pregnant women are only tested for ABO and RhD.</p><p>Anti-Jk<sup>a</sup> and anti-Di<sup>a</sup> were frequent in multiply transfused patients such as thalassemic patients in our study (unpublished observation). Di<sup>a</sup> antigen is one of the antigens with low incidence among Caucasians but it is a relatively higher incidence among Asian-Mongoloid population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Anti-Di<sup>a</sup> has been reported of causing haemolytic transfusion reaction and haemolytic disease of the newborn.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>In this study antibodies were detected against antigens within the Rh, Kidd, Duffy, MNS and Diego systems. These are clinically significant alloantibodies (anti-D, -C, -c, -E, -e, -Fy<sup>a</sup>, -Fy<sup>b</sup>, -Jk<sup>a</sup>, -Jk<sup>b</sup>, -M (active 37&#x000b0;C), S, -s, -U and -Di<sup>a</sup>) and patients must receive antigen negative blood for transfusion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] and pregnant women screened for these antibodies due to the risk of HDN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The overall frequency of alloantibodies in Southern Thais was 0.44% identified by CAT while the incidence in patients was 0.8%. The most frequent alloantibodies were anti-Mi<sup>a</sup>, anti-Le<sup>a</sup>, anti-E, anti-Le<sup>b</sup> and anti-c. Anti-D and anti-Jk<sup>a</sup> were also identified but less frequently while anti-K was not detected at all. Anti-Mi<sup>a</sup> was very frequently identified in Southern Thais while anti-Di<sup>a</sup> was not as common. However, Mi<sup>a</sup> and Di<sup>a</sup> antigens should be incorporated in antibody screening cell panels for Asian-Mongoloid
