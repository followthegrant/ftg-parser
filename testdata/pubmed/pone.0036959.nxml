Bacteria are key players in ecosystems and it is therefore crucial to understand the effect of disturbances on bacterial communities and how they respond to them, both compositionally and functionally. The main aim of this study was to test the effect of differences in disturbance strength on bacterial communities. For this, we implemented two independent short-term experiments with dialysis bags containing natural bacterial communities, which were transplanted between ambient and &#x02018;disturbed&#x02019; incubation tanks, manipulating either the intensity or the frequency of a salinity disturbance. We followed changes in community composition by terminal restriction fragment analysis (T-RFLP) and measured various community functions (bacterial production, carbon substrate utilization profiles and rates) directly after and after a short period of recovery under ambient conditions. Increases in disturbance strength resulted in gradually stronger changes in bacterial community composition and functions. In the disturbance intensity experiment, the sensitivity to the disturbance and the ability of recovery differed between different functions. In the disturbance frequency experiment, effects on the different functions were more consistent and recovery was not observed. Moreover, in case of the intensity experiment, there was also a time lag in the responses of community composition and functions, with functional responses being faster than compositional ones. To summarize, our study shows that disturbance strength has the potential to change the functional performance and composition of bacterial communities. It further highlights that the overall effects, rates of recovery and the degree of congruence in the response patterns of community composition and functioning along disturbance gradients depend on the type of function and the character of the disturbance.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Disturbances are discrete events in time that cause changes in resources or in the physical environment and, thus, influence community structure.

Bacteria are the main contributors to the flow of carbon and nutrients in nature <xref rid="pone.0036959-HornerDevine1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and therefore important key players in ecosystems. Thus, more knowledge is needed towards the understanding of the effect of disturbances on bacterial communities.</p><p>In general, a community can respond to disturbances in different ways regarding composition and function <xref rid="pone.0036959-Allison1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Grimm1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. With the main focus on microbial community composition, a community can be resistant, i.e., withstand disturbances without any changes in composition <xref rid="pone.0036959-Bowen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It can be resilient, i.e.; recover from a disturbance-induced change and regain the original state <xref rid="pone.0036959-Shade1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. More types of responses can be observed when also functions are included in the studies <xref rid="pone.0036959-Marxsen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Reed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A community is functionally redundant if a change in community composition is not accompanied by a change in a function provided by the communities after the disturbance <xref rid="pone.0036959-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Wertz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Alternatively, a community might have a high functional plasticity: only functions but not community composition change after the disturbance <xref rid="pone.0036959-Agrawal1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, with the possibilities of functional recovery or functions remaining altered once the disturbance ceases. Thus, there is no general pattern for the community composition &#x02013; function relationship. Moreover, some studies have suggested that this relationship might depend on the level of the studied function <xref rid="pone.0036959-Comte1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Langenheder1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Allison and Martiny (2008) reviewed the available literature on soil microbial communities and found that microbial composition is generally sensitive to disturbances, and that most microbial communities do not return rapidly to their original state, i.e. show low degrees of resilience. However, not many studies have addressed resilience <xref rid="pone.0036959-Allison1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It has been suggested that the effect of disturbance on bacterial community function might depend on the function measured, the type of disturbance <xref rid="pone.0036959-Bressan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, as well as the temporal patterns of the disturbance <xref rid="pone.0036959-GarcaMolinos1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Most of the described patterns regarding responses to disturbances are based on macroorganisms and there is currently a lack of understanding about how bacterial communities respond including their ability to resist and recover from disturbances that differ in strength. It is therefore essential to investigate effects of differences in disturbance intensity and frequency on bacterial communities using controlled experimental studies. Salinity, being a physiological stress factor, has been shown to be a strong structuring factor for bacterial communities, affecting functional performance and growth rates and leading to shifts in composition <xref rid="pone.0036959-Bouvier1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0036959-Jocque1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. As such, it has been shown that salinity is the most important factor explaining global distribution patterns of bacteria as well as other microorganisms <xref rid="pone.0036959-Lozupone1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Auguet1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Here, we implemented two independent short-term experiments where we manipulated either the intensity or the frequency of a salinity disturbance affecting a rock pool bacterial community. Moreover, bacterial communities in rock pools experience natural fluctuations in salinity at more or less regular intervals so that communities inhabiting them are frequently exposed to salinity disturbances and may therefore have some degree of tolerance to salt <xref rid="pone.0036959-Jocque1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Langenheder4" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The experiments were implemented using dialysis bags that were transplanted either into tanks with several levels of increased salinity (intensity experiment) or swapped between one high salinity tank and the control tank at different intervals (frequency experiment). In both cases bags were moved back to the control tanks after the disturbance period to measure the ability of short-term recovery after the applied disturbance regime. To be able to detect rapid changes in response to the disturbance, we specifically analyzed the composition of the active fraction of bacterial community by 16S rRNA based terminal restriction fragment analysis <xref rid="pone.0036959-Inagaki1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. At the same time we studied several community functions.</p><p>Here we specifically address: (1) How bacterial community composition (BCC) and several functions provided by the communities change along a gradient of increasing disturbance intensity and frequency, (2) whether resilience, i.e. the ability to recover from the disturbance is related to disturbance intensity and frequency, respectively; and finally, (3) if there are concurrent response patterns occurring in BCC and community function along the disturbance strength gradient. Since salinity fluctuations occur naturally in rock pools, we hypothesize that bacterial community composition as well as function will be resistant to low and infrequent salinity increases. Moreover, if resistance is not found, we hypothesize that communities will recover to a greater extent at low compared to intermediate or high levels of disturbance intensity and frequency. Finally, we hypothesize that functional redundancy among taxa in the community will be high so that disturbances will have stronger effects on community composition than on function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>No specific permits were required for the sampling and activities performed in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Experimental set-up</title><p>Water from a freshwater rock pool (temperature: 4.7&#x000b0;C, salinity: 0.2 psu) was collected in October 2009 on the island of Gr&#x000e4;s&#x000f6;, Sweden (60.498 N, 18.430 E). Water (250 L) was taken and stored in a constant temperature room (4&#x000b0;C) until the experiment was started one month later. The water was either filtered through A/E glass fiber filters (1.2 &#x003bc;m, Pall Life Science, NY, USA) to remove big particles and used to fill 6 tanks of 40 L, or through GF/F filters (0.7 &#x003bc;m, Whatman, UK) to additionally remove bacterial grazers and used to fill dialysis bags. Dialysis membrane tubing with a length of 50 cm and a width of 45 mm (ZelluTrans, Dialysis tubular membrane T4, Molecular Weight Cut Off: 12000&#x02013;14000 Daltons, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) were filled with 150 mL water. The tubing was closed at both ends with universal dialysis tubing closures (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., The Netherlands). Two transplant experiments were implemented where either disturbance intensity (Experiment 1) or disturbance frequency (Experiment 2) were manipulated. Both experiments were implemented at constant temperature (20&#x000b0;C) and incubated in the dark.

PCR amplification was conducted using the HEX-labeled forward bacteria-specific primer 8F (5-AGRGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3) and the reverse universal primer 519R (5-GWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG-3). Each 20-&#x003bc;L reaction consisted of 1 U Biotaq<sup>TM</sup> DNA polymerase (Bioline, London, UK), 200 nM of each primer, 250 &#x000b5;M of each dNTP (Invitrogen) 1.5 mM MgCl (Bioline) and up to 10 ng of target DNA in 1&#x000d7;NH<sub>4</sub> buffer (Bioline).

Two replicates per sample were pooled after PCR amplification and digested with Mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs) and purified using AcroPrepTM 96-well filter plates 30 K Omega (Pall, NY, USA). Fluorescently labeled PCR products were then subjected to digestion with the restriction enzyme <italic>Hae</italic>III (New England Biolabs) for 16 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Each digestion reaction contained approximately 30 ng of DNA, 4 U of each respective restriction enzyme in a final reaction volume of 10 &#x000b5;L. Fluorescently labeled terminal-restriction fragments were separated and detected by an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer running in GeneScan mode (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) together with an internal size standard (GeneScan-500 ROX; Applied Biosystems). T-RFLP peaks were finally determined by using the program GeneMarker v 1.70 (SoftGenetics, State College, PA, USA). GeneMarker analysis included fragments with lengths ranging from 50&#x02013;500 bp and an initial peak detection threshold of 100 relative fluorescent units. Peaks less than 0.5 bases apart from each other were merged.

The fact that no clear and consistent predictive pattern can be observed in disturbance-diversity relationships has been attributed to the fact that various traits such as intrinsic growth rates, competition, predation and environment productivity influence the relationship <xref rid="pone.0036959-Haddad1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p><p>In both experiments we found that different functions showed differences in their response patterns to increasing disturbance strengths. Abundance and production decreased with increasing disturbance strength, probably due to direct physiological effects of salinity on bacteria which reduces their growth rates <xref rid="pone.0036959-Bouvier1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Gasol1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. This is also in congruence with previous studies reporting similar effects of disturbances on abundance, biomass and productivity of other organism groups <xref rid="pone.0036959-Mccabe1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0036959-Flder1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In the intensity experiment, bacterial abundance and production had a tendency to recover at all levels by the end of the experiment, in particular in most of the low disturbance intensity treatments, but not in the frequency experiment. Even though it is not possible to compare the two experiments directly, these results nevertheless show clearly that effects of disturbances on communities are highly context dependent, which is also in agreement with the wide range of different response patterns observed in the literature mentioned above for macroorganisms.</p><p>The tCSURs showed a different pattern than bacterial abundance and production and were not at all affected by different disturbance frequencies. This might have been the result of a combined effect of the number of substrates utilized and the rates at which they were used. More specifically, at the end of the experiment, communities exposed to low frequencies tended to use relatively few substrates, but they probably used them at high rates resulting in tCSUR values similar to those found in communities exposed to high frequencies where, on the contrary, more substrates were used, but probably at lower rates. On the contrary, very variable response patterns were observed regarding the significant substrate guilds, ranging from gradual decreases, bell shape responses or even increases, therefore effects on the different guilds are difficult to predict. At the end of the experiment, tCSURs showed a bell-shaped response pattern to differences in the applied disturbance intensities, indicating that negative effects were strongest at low and high disturbance intensities and that intermediate levels of disturbance may enhance tCSURs. This is in congruence with predictions made by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis <xref rid="pone.0036959-Connell1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> that suggests that highest diversity is maintained at intermediate disturbance levels. We further observed, that at least for some substrates guilds, higher utilisation rates also occurred at intermediate disturbance intensities, providing further support that certain community functions peak at intermediate rates of disturbance intensity. The tCSUR results also show that there was a remarkably fast recovery of the overall substrate utilization rates, which in some cases even exceeded the control values at the end of the experiment, supporting the idea that disturbances might enhance community function under some circumstances <xref rid="pone.0036959-Mulder1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Grman1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p>The fast recovery and/or overcompensation (Experiment 1), the general lack of sensitivity of tCSURs (Experiment 2) as well as the increase in the number of utilized substrates (both experiments, see above) with increasing disturbance strength might be related to the increase of disturbance tolerant, &#x02018;weedy&#x02019;, fast growing taxa that became dominant at high disturbance strengths <xref rid="pone.0036959-Haddad1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Fried1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Alternatively, disturbance-induced changes in community composition may have modified the extend and character of competitive interactions among taxa in the community resulting in new selective pressures which &#x02018;forced&#x02019; taxa to widen their substrate range or switch to other substrates, resulting in an overall increase in the number and rates with which they were utilized.</p><p>Even though most of the measured functions were affected by increases in disturbance strength, an important conclusion of this study is that the overall effects and rates of recovery varied between the different functions. Other examples of this phenomena have been reported <xref rid="pone.0036959-Bouvier1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Mulder1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Furthermore, differences between patterns of different functions have been related to the fact that they might assess different levels of the community (from individual cells to community level) <xref rid="pone.0036959-Comte1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> or depend on how specific the function is <xref rid="pone.0036959-Langenheder1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Langenheder5" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. In our study important differences were observed between the patterns described by bacterial production and tCSURs. Bacterial production measurements are based on the incorporation of a single widely available substrate, whereas tCSUR incorporates several and also more specific substrates. Moreover, differences might also be of methodological nature, since bacterial production is a short-term measurement of the <italic>in situ</italic> activity of the communities, whereas tCSUR measurements involve a cultivation step and do therefore rather provide a long-term metabolic fingerprinting.</p><p>As a further result of the varying response patterns of different functions to increasing disturbance strength, correlations between BCC and functions showed a high degree of differences as well. In general, higher correlations were observed between BCC and bacterial production than between BCC and tCSUR or the number of utilized substrate guilds. This indicates that the use of a single, widely used substrate, such as leucine, better follows the patterns observed in BCC than composite functional measurements based on a variety of substrates, which instead lead to more complex responses and therefore a wider variety of patterns.</p><p>Interestingly correlations between community composition and functions were in most cases, when occurring, rather weak. The fact that we did not observe stronger relationships might be due to the following reasons: (1) plasticity <xref rid="pone.0036959-Comte2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, (2) functional redundancy <xref rid="pone.0036959-Comte3" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> or (3) due to a time lag in the responses. Our results suggest that functional redundancy was important for some functions that either did not change at all after the disturbance (e.g. tCSURs in frequency treatment) or were similar to the unperturbed control at the end of the experiment (e.g. tCSUR in intensity experiment) even though there were persistent changes in composition. It has, however, been pointed out that the relationship between community composition and functioning is very dynamic and that absolute patterns between community composition and functions are often not correlated whereas their rates of changes along environmental gradients are <xref rid="pone.0036959-Comte3" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. This is similar to what we observed here since we also found weak correlations regarding the absolute patterns, but often, strong changes in both community composition and functions along the disturbance gradients.</p><p>There are also a few methodological issues that could explain the overall weak relationships between community composition and functions. It is well documented that T-RFLP is a method that detects only the most abundant taxa in a community <xref rid="pone.0036959-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and therefore might miss rare taxa that are functionally important. Moreover, there are recent studies that show that functional traits or genes might be better suited than species composition to explain the assembly and functioning of bacterial communities <xref rid="pone.0036959-Barbern1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. In the study of Burke et al. <xref rid="pone.0036959-Burke1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, for example, complex host-associated microbial communities had a consistent pool of functional genes whereas taxa-level community composition was highly variable. Thus, future studies should investigate whether we see stronger links between composition and functioning when looking at functional groups instead of taxa.</p><p>Moreover, asynchronies in response patterns were observed in the intensity experiment where clear functional changes occurred already after the disturbance period, whereas changes in the composition of the active community were not significant until the end of the experiment, which is in congruence with other studies that showed that there is often a higher sensitivity in functional measurements than in community composition <xref rid="pone.0036959-Widenfalk1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. A second explanation could be that the salinity disturbance had a strong filtering effect leading to the selection of species with a wide range of salt tolerance that then further increased in activity and abundance once the disturbance had ceased. In case of the frequency experiment, changes in function and composition occurred more synchronized in direct response to the disturbance. However, in this case disturbance periods were shorter and the communities were regularly exposed to freshwater conditions in between the disturbance(s), which might have induced more pronounced shifts in community composition already during the disturbance period. Previous experiments have reported that both functions <xref rid="pone.0036959-Saikaly1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0036959-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, as well as community composition <xref rid="pone.0036959-Marxsen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036959-Ager1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> can change over relatively short time periods, i.e. within hours or days, but there are, as in our study, also observations of slower changes in BCC compared to bacterial activity after pesticide addition on sediments <xref rid="pone.0036959-Widenfalk1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> or asynchronous changes at community level physiological profiles (CLPP) and genotype levels after different management treatments in agricultural soil <xref rid="pone.0036959-Chaer1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. One possible explanation for such asynchronies in our study could be that active BCC and bacterial production detect the <italic>in situ</italic> situation whereas tCSURs are obtained after an incubation step, which might explain why higher correlations were observed between BCC and production than between BCC and tCSURs.</p><p>Our study shows, moreover, that disturbance responses can be case dependent since the lag between the functional and compositional response was only observed in the intensity but not in the frequency experiment. It also highlights time as a generally very important aspect when studying disturbances and how bacterial communities respond to them. In particular, to properly address resilience in functional properties as well as community composition longer recovery times and more sampling points would be required during and particularly after the perturbation to be able to describe different states, e.g. a partly altered, maximal altered, and, if applicably, a partly recovered and totally recovered community.</p><p>To summarize, our study suggests that (1) bacterial community composition changes gradually along disturbance gradients, showing no resistance to any level of salinity intensity or frequency. The response pattern to changes in disturbance strength varied depending on the type of function and differed in response to changes in disturbance intensity or frequency, respectively. Further, (2) the potential recovery of BCC could not adequately be assessed, however, there were some indications that communities recovered functionally to greater extents from low compared to medium and high disturbance intensities, whereas no tendency of short term recovery was observed in response to manipulations of disturbance frequencies. Finally, (3) whether congruent response patterns in BCC and functions along the disturbance gradients were observed depended on the type of function and the type of disturbance, respectively. Our results therefore highlight that effects of disturbances on the resistance and resilience of bacterial communities are complex and highly context dependent, which is something future studies need to take into account.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0036959.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
