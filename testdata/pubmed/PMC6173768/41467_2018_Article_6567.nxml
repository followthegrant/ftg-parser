Here, we study CNAs as potential biomarkers of bevacizumab (BVZ) response in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We cluster 409 mCRCs in three subclusters characterized by different degrees of CIN. Tumors belonging to intermediate-to-high instability clusters have improved outcome following chemotherapy plus BVZ versus chemotherapy alone. In contrast, low instability tumors, which amongst others consist of <italic>POLE</italic>-mutated and microsatellite-instable tumors, derive no further benefit from BVZ. This is confirmed in 81 mCRC tumors from the phase 2 MoMa study involving BVZ. CNA clusters overlap with CRC consensus molecular subtypes (CMS); CMS2/4 xenografts correspond to intermediate-to-high instability clusters and respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy plus mouse avastin (B20), while CMS1/3 xenografts match with low instability clusters and fail to respond. Overall, we identify copy number load as a novel potential predictive biomarker of BVZ combination therapy.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Increased copy number alterations, indicative of chromosomal instability, is associated with poor cancer outcome.

Almost half of patients diagnosed with CRC develop metastatic disease (mCRC). Current treatment for RAS mutant mCRC includes 5-fluoruracil-based standard of care chemotherapy (e.g., monotherapy, XELOX/FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, and FOLFOXIRI) combined with the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab (BVZ). Results from phase III clinical trials have indeed demonstrated that the addition of BVZ to chemotherapy improves response rate and prolongs survival of mCRC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, only a subset of patients respond, and overall clinical benefit of BVZ is limited with most patients ultimately succumbing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, BVZ therapy is associated with a specific side effect profile and high treatment costs. Although we<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> have previously proposed several novel genomic entities as putative BVZ response predictors, to date no robust validated biomarker for BVZ in CRC has emerged. Thus, understanding BVZ resistance mechanism(s) and identifying unambiguous biomarkers to predict patient outcome remain clinically relevant questions.</p><p id="Par4">To address these issues, we have drawn on knowledge emerging from recent efforts to characterize the complex genomic alterations that underpin CRC aetiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Arguably, the most comprehensive studies have emerged from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which has identified multiple driver genes and CRC genetic phenotypes including hypermutators (12% MSI; 5% <italic>POLE/POLD1</italic>), chromosomal instability [CIN] (65&#x02013;70%) and CpG island methylator (15%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This led to the identification of novel biomarkers to predict response to targeted therapies, such as <italic>KRAS</italic> for anti-EGFR therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and more recently, high tumor mutational burden for anti-PD1/PDL1 checkpoint immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Additional studies have focused on reclassifying CRC based on tumor expression data, resulting in a new Consensus Molecular Subtype (CMS) classification system of CRC, which is now poised to significantly impact future clinical stratification and CRC subtype-based targeted intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, the ANGIOPREDICT (APD) consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.angiopredict.com">www.angiopredict.com</ext-link>) studies chromosomal instability (CIN) and its impact on treatment outcome in mCRC. Specifically, we explore how tumors cluster based on the genome-wide distribution of copy number alterations (CNAs) and define 3 CNA clusters. We correlate each of these clusters with tumor and clinical characteristics, tumor mutation burden, CMS subtypes and treatment outcome. We show that tumors belonging to clusters with intermediate-to-high instability have improved outcome after BVZ combination therapy, whereas tumors characterized by low instability derive no further benefit from BVZ. Finally, we also functionally confirm our findings in mouse xenografts.

Overall, CIN results from defects in mitosis and pre-mitotic replication stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, with mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> and other genes having a permissive role. Somatic CNAs that give rise to CIN are evident in 85% of invasive CRCs, where their stepwise accumulation is known to stimulate tumor initiation and progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, either by activating oncogenes or inactivating tumor suppressors genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Efforts to understand the implications of CNAs in CRC have led to important discoveries with respect to disease prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, but their role in predicting response to therapy remains largely unexplored. We therefore specifically assessed the relevance of CNAs in predicting outcome of BVZ combination therapy in mCRC.</p><p id="Par25">First, we used CNA profiles from 908 CRC patients to classify tumors in 3 distinct CNA clusters using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Characterization of these clusters revealed that cluster 1 is enriched for tumors carrying an excess of somatic mutations, including amongst others MSI tumors and tumors with <italic>POLE</italic> and <italic>POLD1</italic> mutations, and is characterized by a low number of CNAs. The number of tumors classified to cluster 1 was substantially lower for mCRC tumors (10.2%) compared to all 908 CRC tumors involving different stages (18.7%)&#x02014;a direct result of the lower proportion of MSI tumors that acquire a metastatic phenotype. Indeed, only 3&#x02013;5% of mCRC tumors are expected to be MSI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. This provides further proof that cluster 1 does not solely consist of MSI tumors but is also characterized by non-MSI copy number stable tumors.</p><p id="Par26">Next, we observed that copy number instable mCRC tumors demonstrated improved survival compared to copy number stable tumors. When focusing on mCRC patients receiving BVZ, we noticed a markedly decreased HR at the level of PFS and OS in patients from clusters 2 and 3 relative to patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Likewise, when stratifying patients according to cluster, tumors belonging to cluster 1 did not benefit while for tumors belonging to clusters 2 and 3 a significant increase in survival was observed when receiving BVZ combination therapy. Similar effects were observed when considering a CIN threshold of 25%, both in our discovery and replication cohort. Importantly, determination of CNA cluster membership or CIN using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing can be achieved quickly, reliably and cost-effectively using, even when degraded tissue. Indeed, with the advent of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis this technique is routinely used in the diagnostic setting.</p><p id="Par27">CMS is currently the most robust classifier for CRC based on gene expression profiling. Additionally, there is accumulating evidence that these subtypes may predict clinical outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Our analysis revealed an overlap between CMS subtypes and CNA clusters, with an enrichment of CMS1/3 in CNA cluster 1 and CMS2/4 in CNA clusters 2 and 3. The mesenchymal subgroup, known as CMS4, is characterized by tumors with a high CNA load and more pronounced VEGF and VEGFR activation levels, hence displaying a pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. This was confirmed in pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes in cluster 2 or 3. It is therefore conceivable that the anti-angiogenic BVZ is more effective in these subtypes. To indeed confirm the predictive effect of CNA and CMS subtyping on BVZ outcome, we employed a panel of CRC cell lines for which CMS subtype was previously determined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and for which we a priori assessed CNA cluster membership. We observed a significantly enhanced response to the anti-angiogenic B20 or FOLFOX plus B20 compared to FOLFOX alone in grafted CMS4 and CMS2 cell lines. Notably, all these cell lines were also classified as CIN-high tumors. These experimental xenograft data thus confirm our findings in BVZ-treated patients. Remarkably, Lenz et al. recently revealed that CMS1 colon cancer benefits more from BVZ-based treatment than cetuximab-based treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Although the latter study compares BVZ effects to different control groups than in this study (wild-type RAS patients treated with cetuximab versus standard-of-care chemotherapy-treated patients in this study), these findings highlight the need for additional studies to confirm our findings.</p><p id="Par28">Recently Le et al. showed how MSI mCRC tumors, which typically are associated with high tumor mutational burden, respond extremely well to PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab, ultimately leading to the pan-cancer approval of anti-PD-1 therapy for MSI tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Nowadays, MSI tumors will therefore first receive anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, rather than BVZ combined with chemotherapy. Our data, which show that tumors characterized by low copy number burden do not benefit from BVZ, thus seem to confirm that anti-PD-1 therapy is a better treatment option for these patients. Furthermore, our data suggest that other CNA cluster 1 tumors that are not MSI, also do not benefit from BVZ therapy and might therefore also be treated with anti-PD-1 therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Although this needs to be confirmed in follow-up prospective clinical studies, the use of copy number load as an additional biomarker to tumor mutational burden, might become clinically useful. Additionally, our data provide additional insights into the recent observation that chromosome 18q11.2&#x02013;18q21.1 loss predicts response to BVZ in mCRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Indeed, our findings suggest that genome-wide instability, rather than the specific loss of one chromosomal region, underlies the association of CNAs with response to BVZ.</p><p id="Par29">One limitation of this study is the lack of available information with respect to tumor sidedness. Right-sided stage III-IV tumors are associated with inferior prognosis, and based on the clinical and biologic characteristics of right-sided tumors, we know that these are more likely to be MSI, carry <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations and represent hypermutators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. It is likely that CNA cluster 1 might be enriched for right-sided tumors, whereas CNA clusters 2 and 3 could vice versa be enriched for left-sided tumors. Future studies are warranted to confirm these hypotheses. Other limitations are the retrospective nature and potential selection bias in our sample population.</p><p id="Par30">In conclusion, by considering genome-wide CNAs in CRC and by applying subsequent unsupervised clustering, we were able to classify mCRC tumors into CNA subtypes and to relate their response to outcome after BVZ combined with chemotherapy. Tumors that are classified in CNA clusters 2 and 3, and therefore likely correspond to CMS2 or CMS4 subtype tumors, show additional benefit from BVZ treatment when compared to patients from the same cluster receiving chemotherapy only. Hypermutator phenotypes, such as tumors with <italic>POLE</italic> or <italic>POLD1</italic> mutations or micro-satellite instable tumors show no additional benefit from BVZ treatment and importantly also MSS tumors with a stable copy number profile show no additional benefit from BVZ treatment. We therefore propose that high copy number load represents a potential novel biomarker for BVZ response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample collection</title><p id="Par31">Patients with advanced (locally irresectable or metastatic) CRC commencing combination chemotherapy involving BVZ between July 2004 and April 2012 were included in this study.

The ASCAT algorithm version 2.0.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> was used to segment the raw data and estimate tumor percentages and overall ploidy. Subsequently, GISTIC v2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> was used to identify the most frequent and overrepresented chromosomal aberrations in tumors. A region was considered deleted if the logR value was &#x0003c;&#x02212;0.1 and amplified when the logR was &#x0003e;0.1. A cutoff q-value of 0.25 was used to select significantly overrepresented SCNAs. SCNAs spanning &#x0003e;70% of a chromosomal arm were defined as whole-arm SCNAs, while SCNAs spanning &#x0003c;70% of a chromosomal arm were considered focal SCNAs. Significant amplified or deleted regions were assigned as homozygous deletion, loss, diploid, gain, or amplification for each sample based on LogR signal and GISTIC output threshold values (<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;1.3; &#x02212;1.3&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x02212;0.1; &#x02212;0.1&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.1; 0.1&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.9; <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.9 respectively).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Whole-exome sequencing</title><p id="Par38">After confirmation of successful library construction, whole exome enrichment was performed using the SeqCapV3 exome enrichment kit (Roche) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions.

As an input, we used recurrent CNAs identified from the GISTIC analysis by applying a subsampling size of 80% with 500 repetitions. In the discovery cohort, multivariate survival analysis between and within the different clusters was performed using a Cox regression analysis considering TNM staging and age as numerical factors while gender, cluster membership or CIN as well as chemotherapy backbone were considered categorical variables. A similar analysis was performed comparing CIN-high with CIN-low patients. In the replication cohort, cluster membership or CIN, absence or presence of synchronous metastases, maintenance therapy with BVZ and surgery were used as categorical factors.</p><p id="Par40">For cluster characterization <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>APC</italic>, <italic>POLE</italic>, <italic>POLD1</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation status was based on the presence of damaging mutations based on exome sequencing data or data available from TCGA. A hyper-mutator was defined as having more than 10 mutations per 10<sup>6</sup> bases. Tumors were considered MSI if they had either an immunohistochemical loss for known MMR proteins or damaging mutations in known MSI genes based on exome-sequencing data or data available from TCGA.

Fishers exact test (two-sided <italic>P</italic>-values; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) was used to test whether clusters were significantly enriched for certain mutations, MSI-status or a hypermutator phenotype. To test which clinical variables were enriched in particular clusters a ChiSquare test was used (two-sided <italic>P</italic>-values; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5). Random forest classification was performed using the R-package &#x0201c;randomForest&#x0201d;. We performed a 10-fold cross-validation on the original dataset to determine the accuracy of the model. Hereto, we divided the 472 mCRC samples used for the original clustering ten times at random, each time in a training set (90% of the samples) and validation set (10% of the samples) in such a manner that each sample is presented only once in the whole of ten validation sets. Next a random forest classifier was generated using the training data. We then applied this classifier to the validation data to determine the models&#x02019; accuracy. For each tree, the prediction error rate on the out-of-bag portion of the data is recorded. Then the same is done after permuting each predictor variable.
