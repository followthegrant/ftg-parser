To investigate this hypothesis, we used our mouse model of diabetic complications. Mice on a high-fat diet developed hypercholesterolemia, and exposure to streptozotocin rendered hypercholesterolemic mice diabetic. Immunohistochemical images show increased macrophage infiltration and BIGH3 protein in the kidney cortices of hypercholesterolemic and diabetic mice.

Introduction</title><p id="P2">Advances in clinical treatments and strong emphasis on diabetes education have played significant roles in prediabetic and diabetic health care management. However, a continued increase in the number of clinical cases of diabetic complications has increased in recent years. Moreover, a greater percentage of minority individuals experience clinical level diabetic diseases of the renal, vascular, and ocular systems when compared to individuals in the non-minority population, highlighting a health disparity element in diabetes [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. When poorly controlled, diabetes mellitus types I and II promote harmful complications in targeted organs and tissues, including the renal system. Even with modern therapeutic interventions, dysregulated cell signaling, changes in ECM turnover, and apoptosis promote kidney damage and end-stage renal disease, highlighting a need for a more complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying diabetic nephropathy. Development of diabetic nephropathy generally involves monocyte/macrophage infiltration, an increase in the local production of cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased apoptosis, and accumulation of ECM molecules. The latter is explained, in part, by cytokine-induced changes in the expression of genes that encode for the ECM molecules fibronectin, collagen types I and IV, laminin and proteoglycans [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 activates the gene <italic>TGFBI</italic>, which encodes the ECM molecule called BIGH3 (Transforming Growth Factor <underline>BI</underline>nduced <underline>G</underline>ene <underline>H</underline>uman Clone <underline>3</underline>), also known as beta-ig, TGFBI, and kerato-epithelin. BIGH3 is a cell adhesion-class protein that comprises a cysteine-rich domain, four fasciclin-1 (FAS1)-like repeats, and in the C-terminal portion EPDIM and RGD integrin-binding sequences [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In its secreted full-length form (minus the secretory sequence) SDS PAGE analysis estimates a mass of 69 kDa. The C-terminal portion of the 69-kDa BIGH3 becomes cleaved, yielding a stable 60-kDa BIGH3 protein, and generating C-terminally derived integrin-ligand peptides that appear to act as competitive inhibitors of the pro-survival ECM-integrin interactions [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These BIGH3-derived C-terminal peptides induce apoptosis, giving rise to the term BMA (BIGH3-mediated apoptosis), which we use in this study. Several different laboratories have reported BMA on retinal pericytes [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], retinal endothelial cells [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] the osteosarcoma cell lines MG-63 and Saos-2 [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], transformed corneal epithelial cells [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Chinese hamster ovary cells, and other cell types [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], thus the rationale to classify BIGH3 as a proapoptotic ECM protein.</p><p id="P3">Although macrophages play important roles in tissue homeostasis, they are also major contributors to diabetic progression, promoting metabolic stress and interstitial fibrosis, leading to loss of renal function [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In rodents, blocking macrophage infiltration attenuated kidney tubular epithelial cell apoptosis [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similarly, deleting <italic>CCL</italic>2, which encodes monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, attenuated renal tubule cell damage [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and suppressed development of diabetic nephropathy in streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Macrophage-derived soluble molecules, <italic>i.e.</italic> NO, ROS, have been implicated in rodent glomerular mesangial cell apoptosis [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Macrophage ingestion of apoptotic bodies <italic>in vitro</italic> induce macrophages to secrete TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], accounting for at least some of the TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 in tubulointerstitium and glomeruli of diabetic patients [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These same loci, <italic>i.e.</italic>, tubulointerstitium and glomeruli, in adult diabetic rat show an increase in BIGH3 protein [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], suggesting that in diabetic humans and animals, macrophage-derived TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 stimulates BIGH3 protein synthesis. Here we document a previously unrecognized relationship involving macrophages, macrophage-derived TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1, an increase in BIGH3 synthesis, and an increase in BMA of renal cells. Discussed is a potential positive feedback mechanism that promotes BMA and diabetic nephropathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>2.

TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 strongly upregulates expression of the BIGH3 gene, thus a logical expectation is that a greater quantity of macrophages and BIGH3 protein would be evident in kidney cortex of diabetic mice when compared to non-diabetic kidney cortex. To test this hypothesis, we utilized our previously characterized mouse model of diabetic complications [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Immunohistochemical analysis detected few, if any macrophages in the kidney cortex of healthy mice fed a MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(A)</xref>). In distinction, an increase in macrophage number was observed in the kidney cortex of HFD dyslipidemic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(B)</xref>). When STZ rendered HFD mice diabetic, hereafter referred to as HFD + diabetic mice, a further increase in macrophage number was evident when compared to kidney cortices of mice on a MD and HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(C)</xref>). Anti-BIGH3 antibody revealed little staining of BIGH3 protein in kidney cortex of mice on a MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(D)</xref>). Unexpectedly, BIGH3 staining was markedly increased throughout the cortex of mice on a HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(E)</xref>), suggesting BIGH3 protein is a potential prediabetic biomarker (discussed below). Similarly, broad, extensive BIGH3 protein staining was evident in kidney cortex of HFD + diabetic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(F)</xref>). In kidney cortices of mice on a HFD, and in HFD + diabetic mice, BIGH3 was observed at or near pericellular and interstitial matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(H), Figure 1(I)</xref>, long arrows) in greater quantities than in mice on a MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(G)</xref>). Also noted are macrophages at or near BIGH3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(H), Figure 1(I)</xref>, short arrows), raising the question of whether BIGH3 serves as a substratum in macrophage recruitment and adhesion (see discussion). Here we conclude that HFD and diabetic conditions promote macrophage infiltration and BIGH3 protein synthesis in kidney cortices.

Briefly, macrophages were first pre-incubated for 24 hours with RPMI basal medium containing high (25 mM) glucose and high (100 &#x000b5;g/ml) LDL. This high glucose and LDL basal medium was aspirated, and macrophages were washed in RPMI and then used to condition serum-free RPMI for 24 hours to generate dMCM. Therefore, the dMCM used in experiments contained macrophage-derived soluble factors, but not high glucose or LDL. An identical procedure generated MCM, albeit macrophages were pre-incubated in RPMI basal medium without high glucose and LDL. Human RPTEC were maintained in REGM. For experiments, RPTEC were cultured for up to 48 hours in conditions where 25% of REGM was replaced with dMCM, MCM or RPMI. Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> show that dMCM induced an acute increase in BIGH3 transcript synthesis in RPTEC. Three hours post-exposure to dMCM, BIGH3 mRNA levels had increased 2.5 fold. RPTEC exposed to MCM increased BIGH3 mRNA synthesis initially. At 3 hours post-exposure to MCM, BIGH3 mRNA level decreased and then gradually increased 0.5-fold by 24 hours. In both conditions the increase in BIGH3 mRNA was transient, approaching the REGM/RPMI control baseline throughout the remaining 24 hours of the assay.

These results agree with previous mass spectrometry analysis showing that BIGH3 protein is cleaved within its C-terminus, generating 62- and 60-kDa BIGH3 proteins, and Western blots showing the 62- and 60-kDa proteins as closely-spaced bands [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We conclude that 1) macrophages in a HFD or diabetic environment provide soluble molecules that increase BIGH3 gene transcription and translation and 2) RPTEC cleave the C-terminus of BIGH3 to generate a 60-kDa mature protein and C-terminally-derived peptides. A logical hypothesis is that in MCM and dMCM, TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 is the soluble factor that increases BIGH3 gene transcription and translation, followed by BIGH3 secretion and BIGH3 C-terminal cleavage (see discussion).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Blocking TGF-&#x003b2;1 receptor signaling inhibits BIGH3 transcript expression</title><p id="P19">To test whether macrophage-derived TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 in dMCM and MCM induce BIGH3 gene transcription, we used the pharmaceutical small chemical inhibitor SB-431542 that selectively blocks TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> type I receptor kinase signaling. Results show that 13 nM SB-431542 blocked BIGH3 gene transcription by 50% and 53% respectively in REGM plus 25% dMCM, and REGM plus 25% MCM, when compared to vehicle only controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

These results show that 5 &#x000b5;g/ml BIGH3 is sufficient to induce a significant increase in renal cell BMA. A 24-hour exposure to high glucose (25 mM) and LDL (100 &#x000b5;g/ml) (without exogenous dMCM, MCM and BIGH3) did not increase BMA of RPTEC when compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6(l)</xref>) indicating that <italic>in vitro</italic> the signal promoting BMA is independent of glucose and LDL <italic>per se</italic>.

Discussion</title><p id="P24">The results of this study agree with the principle that a hyperglycemic environment promotes macrophage infiltration and kidney damage. This report extends this principle, showing that macrophage-derived TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 promotes renal cell apoptosis by stimulating expression of the gene <italic>TGFBI</italic>, which encodes the extracellular matrix protein BIGH3. In the diabetic kidney cortex RPTEC are a probable source of BIGH3 [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. BIGH3 in the cortical interstitial matrix is likely derived from resident mesenchymal cells. Macrophages and BIGH3 protein were broadly distributed in diabetic kidney cortices of our mouse model of diabetic complications [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, immunological analysis unexpectedly revealed an increase in macrophage number, and BIGH3 protein, in the HFD dyslipidemic kidney when compared to non-diabetic kidney cortex. This result indicates a metabolically-stressed renal environment itself stimulates macrophage infiltration and BIGH3 protein expression, supporting the prospect that macrophage TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 and BIGH3 protein are prediabetic biomarkers. Indeed, others and we have reported that TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1, and BIGH3, are at significantly higher levels in the urine of diabetic patients when compared to urine of non-diabetic individuals [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p id="P25">RPTEC in REGM control medium (without exogenous TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1, BIGH3, or MCMs) expressed relatively low-levels of BIGH3 and exhibited BMA. BIGH3 antiserum and SB-431542 blocked the BMA observed in control medium, raising the possibility that in a healthy normoglycemic environment BIGH3 protein is involved in apoptosis in physiological cell turnover. In this perspective, healthy kidney cells synthesize a low level of new BIGH3 protein that induces modest, low-level BMA, which sustains cell turnover. Along this line of reasoning, this study supports the hypothesis that increased and accumulating BIGH3 protein in kidney cortex is an indicator of a prediabetic state [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Extending this view, a prediabetic environment promotes TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 signaling [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] BIGH3 synthesis, and BMA, and continues as disease progression develops DN.</p><p id="P26">It is well established that under physiological conditions BIGH3&#x02019;s C-terminus is cleaved, generating C-terminal fragments less than 3 kDa that induce BMA [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In contrast, a recombinant BIGH3 protein that did not undergo C-terminal cleavage failed to induce apoptosis [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], indicating that C-terminal cleavage is a requisite for BMA. C-terminally cleaved BIGH3 protein has been found <italic>in vivo</italic> in cornea, skeletal muscle and tendon [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The peptidases serine protease high-temperature requirement A1 [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], plasmin [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and matrix metalloproteinase 9 [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] have been implicated in BIGH3 cleavage. However, the extent of cleavage, and which proteases cleave kidney cortical BIGH3 <italic>in vivo</italic>, in healthy tissue, and in metabolically stressed conditions, remains unclear.</p><p id="P27">We show here that TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1-treated and untreated RPTEC cleave endogenous BIGH3, and thus these cells would be expected to cleave exogenous recombinant BIGH3, explaining the increase in BMA in BIGH3 protein add-back experiments. However we also note that some BIGH3 is cleaved when isolated from Sf9 medium, indicating Sf9 cells cleave BIGH3. Therefore the apoptosis quantified in add-back experiments may have been induced from BIGH3 already cleaved by Sf9 cells (recombinant BIGH3 containing uncleaved and cleaved BIGH3 that was used in add back experiments) and also by RPTEC cleaving the uncleaved BIGH3 recombinant protein that was added back. Mass spectrometry and biochemical analysis revealed C-terminal cleavage accounts for lower mass BIGH3 proteins [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which we have previously shown to migrate on Western blots as a 62-kDa intermediate band and a stable 60-kDa lower band [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. C-terminal cleavage generates peptides that likely comprise the integrin-binding sequences EPDIM (residues 615 &#x02013; 619) and RGD (642 &#x02013; 644). Both of these integrin-binding sequences have been implicated in BMA, and introduced point mutations in EPDIM and RGD have blocked BMA in various different cell types [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="P28">The data presented in this study frame a potential feedback mechanism. Firstly, injured kidney cortex recruits monocyte-derived macrophages. These macrophages provide TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 that stimulates RPTEC to synthesize and secrete BIGH3. Secondly, C-terminal cleavage generates integrin ligand peptides. In a paracrine or autocrine mechanism the peptides induce BMA, presumably involving integrins. Thirdly, an increase in the number of apoptotic cells promote phagocytic cell infiltration, increasing macrophage number, macrophage-derived TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1, and BMA. Macrophage ingestion of apoptotic bodies induce macrophages to release additional TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and moreover, stimulates macrophages themselves to synthesize and secrete BIGH3 protein [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. RNA-Seq data from TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 stimulated human kidney epithelial cells compared with microarray data from human DN renal biopsies revealed 179 genes presumed to be upregulated by TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 signaling. The BIGH3 gene was the most significantly upregulated gene in a TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 induced transcriptional profile [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In addition to RPTEC BMA shown here, evidence suggests that BIGH3 negatively regulates E-cadherin transcription and translation in human renal epithelial cells [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and dissociate VE-cadherin junctions between endothelial cells [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], thereby promoting epithelial myofibroblast transdifferentiation (EMT) and providing myofibroblast-derived TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].
