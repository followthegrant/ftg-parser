GSCs are able to expel antitumor drugs to the extracellular medium using the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) transporter. Tacrolimus (FK506) has been identified as an MRP1 regulator in differentiated glioblastoma (GBM) cells (non-GSCs); however, the effect of FK506 on GSCs is currently unknown. The objective of the following research is to evaluate the effect of FK506 on the MRP1-related chemo-resistant phenotype of GSCs. For this, U87MG and C6 glioma cell lines were used to generate non-GSCs and GSCs. mRNA and MRP1-positive cells were evaluated by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry, respectively. A Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate (CFDA)-retention assay was performed to evaluate the MRP1 activity. Apoptosis and MTT assays were employed to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of FK506 plus Vincristine (MRP1 substrate). GSC-derived subcutaneous tumors were generated to evaluate the in vivo effect of FK506/Vincristine treatment. No differences in transcript levels and positive cells for MRP1 were observed in FK506-treated cells. Lesser cell viability, increased apoptosis, and CFDA-retention in the FK506/Vincristine-treated cells were observed. In vivo, the FK506/Vincristine treatment decreased the tumor size as well as ki67, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), and nestin expression. We conclude that FK506 confers a chemo-sensitive phenotype to MRP1-drug substrate in GSCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ATP-binding cassette transporter</kwd><kwd>glioblastoma stem-like cells</kwd><kwd>multiple drug resistance</kwd><kwd>multidrug resistance-associated protein 1</kwd><kwd>tacrolimus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-ijms-19-02697"><title>1.

Currently these treatments involve a trimodal therapy, which consists of surgical resection of the tumor followed by radio- and chemotherapy [<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, patients subjected to these treatments do not exceed, on average, ~15 months of survival [<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At the same time, the incorporation of new strategies such as anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic, and immunological therapies have not achieved a great improvement in survival rates [<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], so the search for new therapeutic alternatives for GBM has become highly relevant in recent years [<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies from ours and other laboratories have found that the main factor that leads to the failure of chemotherapy in GBM is the expression and activity of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One of the most relevant and mostly studied of these is multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) [<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which is able to extrude several antitumoral drugs to the extracellular medium [<xref rid="B11-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], promoting the multiple drug resistance (MDR) phenotype to GBM cells [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In turn, recent work has shown that a cell subpopulation known as glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) presents a greater expression and activity of MRP1 and has been proposed as the principal population responsible for the generation and maintenance of the extreme chemo-resistance phenotype in GBM [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Because of this, the search for new molecules that modulate the expression and activity of MRP1, especially in GSCs, has emerged in recent decades [<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. One of the molecules identified as a chemo-sensitizing agent is the immunosuppressive drug tacrolimus (FK506), which at subtherapeutic concentrations (15 ng/mL) decreases both the expression and activity of MRP1 in GBM differentiated cells (non-GSCs), promoting chemo-sensitization to the antitumoral drug Vincristine (Vc) [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the effect of FK506 on the expression and activity of MRP1 in GSCs has not been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of FK506 in subtherapeutic concentrations on the chemo-resistant MRP1-associated phenotype in GSCs using in vitro and in vivo assays.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijms-19-02697"><title>2.

FK506 Decrease MRP1 Activity in Glioblastoma Stem-Like Cells</title><p>The effect of FK506 on in vitro MRP1 expression was evaluated in non-GSCs and GSCs of U87MG (human glioblastoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines. Cells were incubated for 24 h with FK506 at concentrations of 7, 15, and 30 ng/mL. No differences were observed in MRP1 mRNA transcript levels under FK506 treatment in both non-GSCs and GSCs of U87MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) and C6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Similarly, no differences were observed in MRP1-positive cells under FK506 treatment in non-GSCs and GSCs of U87MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f001">Figure 1</xref>C) and C6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f001">Figure 1</xref>D) cell lines.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of FK506 on MRP1 activity in U87MG and C6 cell lines, the intracellular accumulation of a fluorescent substrate of MRP1 Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate (CFDA) was measured [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Taken together, these results demonstrate that FK506 decreases MRP1 activity in both non-GSCs and GSCs, suggesting that the chemo-sensitizing effect of this drug is due to changes in the activity of the transporter and not its expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-19-02697"><title>2.2. FK506 Promotes Apoptosis and MRP1-Dependent Chemo-Sensitization to Vincristine in GSCs</title><p>To evaluate the effect of FK506 as a chemo-sensitizing agent for GSCs in vitro, the antitumoral drug Vc, a substrate of MRP1 [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], was tested in cell viability and apoptosis assays. Cells were incubated with FK506 (15 ng/mL) and/or Vc (0.1 &#x003bc;M) for 24 h. Treatment with FK506 did not affect cell viability measured by MTT on non-GSCs and GSCs in U87MG and C6 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). Vc treatment decreased cell viability up to 23% only in U87MG non-GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), but Vc in combination with FK506 decreased cell viability in both non-GSCs and GSCs of U87MG and C6 up to ~40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B), suggesting a chemo-sensitization effect of FK506. To complement these results, trypan blue exclusion staining assay was performed in U87MG (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-19-02697">Figure S1A</xref>) and C6 (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-19-02697">Figure S1B</xref>) GSCs under FK506 and/or Vc treatment. A decrease in cell viability using FK506 alone and associated with Vc was observed in both U87MG and C6 GSCs (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-19-02697">Figure S1</xref>). To evaluate apoptosis, Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) and Bad (pro-apoptotic) protein ratio was measured by Western blot in U87MG GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f003">Figure 3</xref>C) and C6 GSCs (D) treated with FK506 and/or Vc [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A decrease in the Bcl-2/Bad ratio was observed under FK506/Vc treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D). Similarly, an Annexin V/Propidium Iodide staining assay demonstrated that Vc increases the apoptotic C6 GSCs population up to 18% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). Additionally, the combination of FK506 with Vc increased the percentage of apoptotic C6 GSCs up to 21% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). Finally, cleaved caspase-3 was evaluated in U87MG GSCs, and was found to increase in the FK506 treatment in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-19-02697">Figure S2A</xref>). The cleaved caspase-3 increased 2.6- and 3.2-fold when using the Vc and FK506/Vc treatments, respectively (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-19-02697">Figure S2B</xref>). These results suggest that FK506 is able to induce a cytotoxic/pro-apoptotic effect and revert the chemo-resistance in GSCs with an antitumoral drug substrate of MRP1.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-19-02697"><title>2.3. FK506 Promotes MRP1-Dependent Chemo-Sensitization In Vivo to Vincristine in GSC-Derived Tumors</title><p>The in vivo chemo-sensitizing effect of FK506 was evaluated using an allogeneic model of a GSC-derived subcutaneous tumor in Sprague-Dawley rats [<xref rid="B21-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. At day 10 post-GSC inoculation, animals were treated with FK506 and/or Vc for seven days. The tumor size was measured every three days and immunohistopathological analysis was performed at day 17 post-GSC inoculation. Animals treated with FK506 and FK506/Vc combination had smaller tumors compared to those treated with Vc either alone or with a vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Treatment with FK506 alone reduced tumor growth by up to 4 times compared to the vehicle-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Animals treated with the FK506/Vc combination stopped tumor growth, resulting in these being up to ~2- and ~5-fold smaller than the tumors of the Vc- or vehicle-treated groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Immunohistopathological analysis revealed that treatment with FK506 and FK506/Vc decreased the expression of Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation [<xref rid="B22-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], by 33% and 35%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In turn, the expression of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) as a marker of differentiated astroglial cells, and nestin as a marker of neuronal stem cells [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], was evaluated in the tumor samples of treated animals. It was observed that under Vc treatment, GFAP did not change its expression, whereas under FK506 and FK506/Vc treatments GFAP levels decreased by 26% and 47%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In the case of nestin, no differences in expression were observed under the Vc and FK506 treatments, but a decreased expression was observed in the FK506/Vc combination treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f005">Figure 5</xref>). As expected, MRP1 transporter expression did not change in treatment with FK506 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f005">Figure 5</xref>); however, in Vc and FK506/Vc treatments, MRP1 expression increased up to 73% and 36%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-19-02697-f005">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that FK506 is able to chemo-sensitize GSC-derived subcutaneous tumors to Vc treatment in vivo though MRP1 downregulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-ijms-19-02697"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>GBM is the most aggressive glioma, characterized by its chemo-resistant phenotype given by a subpopulation of cells with stem-cell like properties, which express transporters that extrude drugs to the extracellular medium. Because of this, studies have focused on reducing the expression and activity of these transporters. For example, the drug FK506 which has shown a chemo-sensitizing effect due to its ability to modulate the accumulation of certain chemo-therapeutic drug substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), and MRP1 [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Previously, we demonstrated that the use of FK506 downregulates the expression and activity of MRP1 in T98 non-GSCs [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, in this study a similar effect was observed for the first time in GSCs, a very important finding considering that GSCs are the main responsible cells for tumor recurrence and chemo-resistance [<xref rid="B16-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here we demonstrate the chemo-sensitizing effect of FK506 on GSCs in vitro and in vivo through the modulation of the expression/activity of MRP1; we even use subtherapeutic concentrations, which would make it easier to scale up to preclinical studies. Nevertheless, in vitro no differences were observed in MRP1 transcript and total protein levels under different concentrations of FK506, neither in GSCs nor non-GSCs. However, it was also observed that MRP1 activity decreased in treatments with 15 ng/mL FK506 for GSCs and 7 ng/mL for non-GSCs in vitro, suggesting that cells with stem-cell like properties have a higher resistance to the action of this drug, maybe due to the higher MRPs levels. At 15 ng/ml of FK506 alone, MRP1 activity decreases but does not inhibit cell proliferation. This can be explained by the decreased MRP1 levels that are not enough to induce cell death in vitro, unlike the treatment in combination with Vc where cells become sensitive. However, in in vitro assays in T98 non-GSCs it was demonstrated that FK506 decreased the mRNA and protein expression of MRP1 [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but in this article we worked with U87MG and C6 cells, suggesting that the effect could be dependent on the cell line. Despite this, in T98, U87MG, and C6 cells the activity of MRP1 decreases with FK506, which is what matters the most for the chemo-sensitizing effect rather than its protein levels. However, the decrease in MRP1 activity caused by FK506 in U87MG GSCs was greater than that in C6 GSCs, possibly because U87MG cells are O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)-negative and C6 cells are MGMT-positive. We suggest that the presence of MGMT in C6 cells is affecting MRP1 function, because the hypermethylation induced by MGMT can inactivate the expression of several genes and could in this case inactivate a negative regulator of MRP1 or another MRP, so its inhibition with FK506 may not be enough to significantly reduce its activity. It was described that FK506, like Ciclosporin A and Verapamil, interacts with the P-gp transporter binding site, inhibiting its activity [<xref rid="B24-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This suggests that something similar could be happening with MRP1 regulation. It was also evidenced that FK506 inhibits BCRP transporter in MCF-7 cells, displacing the iodoarylazidoprazosin (IAAP) substrate binding [<xref rid="B26-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. On the other hand, it is suggested that immunophilins as FKBP (FK506 binding protein) could act as modulators of the ABC transporters, specifically preventing the interaction between FKBP12 and P-gp [<xref rid="B27-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. FK506 reduces MRP1 activity by almost half, but cell death does not increase significantly in cells treated with FK506 as a Vc chemo-sensitizer. These results suggest that the effect could be MRP1-independent, because U87MG GSCs express other multiple resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), such as multiple resistance-associated protein-3 (MRP3). MRPs are very similar and have specific substrates, as Teniposide for MRP3 and Doxorubicine for MRP1, while also sharing substrates as Vc, which can also be extruded by MRP3 to a lesser extent [<xref rid="B15-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This could further induce MRP3 expression and activity as a compensatory effect when MRP1 is downregulated. Despite the low level of viability, it is observed that FK506 is able to activate caspase-3, which suggests that the effect could be independent of MRP1 through FKBP, since it has been demonstrated that the binding of FK506 to FKBP promotes oligomerization with pro-caspases, thus promoting its activation [<xref rid="B29-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, this has not been proven for GSCs and it would be an interesting subject for study. Despite these mechanisms, FK506 has a dual role as an immunosuppressant, which can be complicated considering that it is not advisable to decrease the immune response against the tumor in cancer patients. However, the mechanism of action of this drug inhibits FKBP by decreasing the levels of IL-2, thereby decreasing the inflammatory microenvironment and the immune response in the tumor [<xref rid="B5-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this context, this effect could be counterproductive since the immune response is of major importance for the outcome of the disease; however, the inflammatory microenvironment that can promote the expression of MRPs and grow factors through the overproduction of adenosine [<xref rid="B16-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] is even more important. Despite these effects, FK506 concentrations used in this article are at subtherapeutic levels, which have not been shown to have an immunosuppressive effect [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite these possible mechanisms, in the in vivo tests we observed changes in MRP1 expression in treatment with FK506, so it is possible that the lower transporter activity is due to a decreased protein expression. It has been described that treatments with FK506 and Vc decrease cell viability by enhancing apoptosis [<xref rid="B30-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These results suggest that FK506 has a chemo-sensitizing effect, which had already been tested in different cancer cell lines, including GBM, but not in GSCs [<xref rid="B19-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, the in vivo assay demonstrates that treatment with FK506 and Vc decrease MRP1 levels, compared to Vc treatment alone. MRP1 levels induced by Vc have been previously described in different cell lines, suggesting a resistance mechanism [<xref rid="B3-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. FK506 is capable of reversing this mechanism, as the treatment of FK506 in combination with Vc showed, reducing tumor volume as well as reducing GFAP, nestin, and Ki67 levels, which are associated with GBM aggressiveness [<xref rid="B35-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We proposed that FK506 and Vc can act synergistically because FK506 potentiates the antitumor effect of Vc. Vc decreases proliferation by itself in different cellular models; however, if cells express high levels of MRP1, as GSCs do, Vc may not decrease cell viability by itself and can even induce MRP1 expression. In addition, the combined treatment with FK506 could reverse this effect by decreasing the levels of MRP1, killing the cells and also potentiating the effect of Vc when there is no transporter that extrudes it to the extracellular medium. On the other hand, in vivo treatment with FK506 alone decreased the tumor size. Yet, we suggest that it was not due to the decrease in MRP1, since MRP1 would not influence tumor development by itself, but only in combination with a substrate antitumoral drug such as Vc. We propose that the effect of FK506 alone decreased tumor size because it is an immunosuppressant that diminishes the inflammatory microenvironment within the tumor and decreases the concentration of interleukins that promote tumor growth. Because the mechanism of action by which FK506 inhibits the activity of MRP1 is unknown, we propose that the effects produced by FK506 could be due to a direct link to the transporter, acting as a competitive inhibitor, or through binding to FKBP, preventing MRP1 translocation to the cell membrane. Finally, as a projection, it would be recommendable to perform intrathecal models because subcutaneous models present some disadvantages, mainly concerning the cerebral microenvironment and the absence of the blood-brain barrier. This is a relevant factor in the action of some drugs, because several antitumoral drugs such as Vc present a poor penetration to the blood-brain barrier due to the action of P-gp [<xref rid="B37-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-19-02697" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Despite this, with the subcutaneous model, we demonstrated the chemo-sensitizing effect of FK506 on the treatment of GSC-derived tumors using Vc.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-19-02697"><title>4.

Conclusions</title><p>In this study, a cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, and chemo-sensitizing effect of FK506 through MRP1 downregulation in GSCs was shown for the first time. Previously, its effect had been demonstrated for non-GSCs. However, due to the importance of the stem-like cell subpopulation, it is necessary to find drugs that can decrease chemo-resistance in most subpopulations within the tumor. Despite this, FK506 was not able to decrease MRP1 transcript and protein levels in vitro in GSCs; however, the transporter activity decreased, and the cells became more susceptible to treatment with Vc, inducing apoptosis. On the other hand, in vivo tests in allogeneic models showed that tumors derived from GSCs and treated with FK506 were more sensitive to Vc treatment, as immunohistochemistry showed that the levels of MRP1 decreased in vivo. These results suggest that the chemo-sensitizing effect of FK506 in vivo is produced by the downregulation of MRP1 levels, which finally decreases its activity of extruding Vc to the extracellular medium. All of these results support the idea that many of the current treatments that are ineffective can be complemented with chemo-sensitizing drugs such as FK506.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thanks to John James Finnolli for his help in proofreading and editing.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-ijms-19-02697"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>Supplementary materials can be found at <uri xlink:href="http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/9/2697/s1">http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/9/2697/s1</uri>.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ijms-19-02697-s001"><media xlink:href="ijms-19-02697-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>C.Q. designed the project; &#x000c1;.T., J.I.E., M.d.l.&#x000c1;.T., and V.A., performed in vitro experiments; V.A. and J.D.R. performed flow cytometry analyses; &#x000c1;.T., C.C., and V.A. performed in vivo experiments; C.O., V.A., I.N., and &#x000c1;.T. analyzed the data; &#x000c1;.T. and I.N. created figures and illustrations; &#x000c1;.T., C.Q., I.N., and J.I.E. wrote the paper.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by grants from Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x000ed;fico y Tecnol&#x000f3;gico (FONDECYT N&#x000b0; 1160777 and 1121121 to C.Q.) and Direcci&#x000f3;n de Investigaci&#x000f3;n y Desarrollo (DID) from Universidad Austral de Chile.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-ijms-19-02697"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cloughesy</surname><given-names>T.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cavenee</surname><given-names>W.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mischel</surname><given-names>P.S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Glioblastoma: From molecular pathology to targeted treatment</article-title><source>Annu.
