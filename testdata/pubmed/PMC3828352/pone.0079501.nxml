Onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with chronic deregulation of behavior and emotions, including psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), emotional flattening and cognitive dysfunctions. Affective symptoms and anxiety are also regarded as key findings in this complex disorder <xref rid="pone.0079501-Dernovek1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The etiology of schizophrenia is thought to have a neurodevelopmental basis that disrupts neuronal plasticity and transmission, but the identification of disease mechanism has proven difficult, not least due to the phenotypic heterogeneity and polygenetic contributions. Still, alterations in immunity-related processes in schizophrenia have been documented in both epidemiological and genetic studies conducted over the past decades <xref rid="pone.0079501-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079501-Sullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. While it is clear that complex genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease risk <xref rid="pone.0079501-Lichtenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, the effect of specific immune-related genes on neuropsychological behaviors remains to be elucidated.</p><p>We previously found that the activity of complement-related factors (including complement component C3) was induced during long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength in the hippocampus of awake rats &#x02013; a mechanistic model of learning and memory <xref rid="pone.0079501-Hvik1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Since dysfunction in synaptic activity and cognitive abilities has been recognized as a primary and enduring core deficit in schizophrenia, we examined a set of complement control-related genes as potential susceptibility factors in schizophrenia, and identified statistically strong genetic associations to the homologous genes <italic>CSMD1</italic> and <italic>CSMD2</italic>, as well as to the <italic>CR1</italic> locus (C3 receptors) <xref rid="pone.0079501-Hvik2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In parallel, the Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Consortium (<italic>PGC</italic>) identified <italic>CSMD1</italic> as one of only seven verified loci in a large schizophrenia GWAS-based meta-analysis involving about 18.000 patients and 34.000 controls <xref rid="pone.0079501-Schizophrenia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>CSMD1</italic> gene encodes a complement control-related protein with multiple copies of CUB and Sushi, a single transmembrane domain and an intracellular signaling peptide. The function of the CSMD1 protein is sparsely described, but inhibition of complement C3 activation is demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0079501-Kraus1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079501-EscuderoEsparza1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Although a possible relevance of <italic>CSMD1</italic> has been reported in autoimmune disease (neonatal lupus) <xref rid="pone.0079501-Ramos1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, the precise role of <italic>CSMD1</italic> in immune responses remains to be further described. Distinct from a role in classic immunological pathways, it has also become clear that complement activity is tightly controlled in the brain, regulating C3/CR3-dependent axonal pruning by phagocytic microglia. This mechanism ensures precise wiring of neuronal circuits in the visual system during development <xref rid="pone.0079501-Schafer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It is therefore believed that deregulation of complement could lead to aberrant synaptic elimination also in other parts of the brain, which may influence the risk of both neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders <xref rid="pone.0079501-Schafer2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Further suggesting a role of <italic>CSMD1</italic> in psychopathology, GWAS studies on bipolar disorder (BIP) and major depressive disorder (MDD) also include nominal significant associations of genetic markers in <italic>CSMD1,</italic> which can be found in supplemental data in relevant literature <xref rid="pone.0079501-Sullivan2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0079501-Baum1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. BIP, MDD and schizophrenia are presently regarded as related disorders <xref rid="pone.0079501-Lichtenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079501-Schulze1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> with partial overlap of symptom spectra including emotional flattening, depressive features and anxiety. It is postulated that the etiology of related psychiatric disorders depends on heritable endophenotypes that partially penetrate across disease borders, as well as on genetic risk factors that are selective to a particular disease <xref rid="pone.0079501-Kendler1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. We have suggested that the complement control-related <italic>CSMD1</italic> may affect shared symptomology in several psychiatric disorders <xref rid="pone.0079501-Hvik2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the specific effect of complement factors on neuropsychological behavior is not known, and is very difficult to dissect in humans. We therefore sought to investigate the relevance of the <italic>CSMD1</italic> expression on neuropsychological endophenotypes using gene knock out (KO) mice. In the current study, we describe a constitutive <italic>Csmd1</italic> KO mice and determine the effect of <italic>Csmd1</italic> expression on behaviors using a selection of classical neuropsychological tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Constitutive Disruption of <italic>Csmd1</italic> Expression in Mice</title><p>To investigate the functional relevance of <italic>Csmd1</italic> in the regulation of neuropsychological behaviors, we used a constitutive gene deletion to disrupt <italic>Csmd1</italic> gene expression in mice. The Reference Sequence collection describes mouse <italic>Csmd1</italic> as a 1.65 Mb long and 72 exon-rich gene, which encodes a 14 kb mRNA. To block expression through a minimal transgenic manipulation, a constitutive knockout (KO) of a 1 kb sequence from <italic>Csmd1</italic> exon1/intron1 was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079501-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

In the KO mice, depletion of <italic>Csmd1</italic> mRNA and protein expression was documented by QPCR (exon1&#x02013;2 junction-specific assay) and immunoblotting (custom-made goat anti-Csmd1 antibody) on cortex samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079501-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

We used TopHat 1.3.3 <xref rid="pone.0079501-Trapnell1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> to map the RNA-seq reads to the mouse (mm9 assembly) genome, with Refseq transcripts as reference gene model, by allowing a mismatch of 2 nt. Novel transcripts were constructed using the Cufflinks <xref rid="pone.0079501-Trapnell2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

Mice were housed individually 2 weeks before start of the first test. Tests were performed in the following sequential order, starting at the age of 10 weeks: 1<sup>st</sup> week: open field (OF); 2<sup>nd</sup> week: novel object recognition test (NORT); 3<sup>rd</sup> week: startle reflex and prepulse inhibition test (PPI); 4<sup>th</sup> week: tail suspension test (TST); 5&#x02013;6<sup>th</sup> week: comprehensive cage monitoring system (CCMS). Testing was performed in the first phase of the light cycle between 6 AM and 12 PM, and standard acclimation procedures were applied for each behavioral test. The experiment was recorded and motion tracked by Viewpoint where applicable. Elevated plus maze test (EPM) was performed on a separate colony of female littermate mice, obtained from a heterozygous breeding strategy (8 <italic>Csmd1</italic> KO and 13 WT mice) and was tested for a period of 6 minutes in the EPM arena at 12 weeks of age.
