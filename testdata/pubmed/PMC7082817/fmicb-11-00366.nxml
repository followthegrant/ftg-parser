The main function of CISs is to deliver genetic materials and effectors into both prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). The structure, assembly, and mechanism of typical CISs, such as the contractile tail of bacteriophage T4, have been extensively investigated. This intracellular cell puncturing nanomachine consists of an inner tube capped by a spike, a contractile sheath, and a baseplate complex located at the base of the sheath (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Leiman and Shneider, 2012</xref>). In addition, T6SSs are widespread in bacteria and can be used both for eukaryotic host cell attack and for interbacterial competition (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Most T6SSs are located in the cytoplasm, anchored to the inner membrane, and deliver toxin effectors to eukaryotic cells or bacteria (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Jani and Cotter, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The &#x0201c;<italic>Photorhabdus</italic> virulence cassettes&#x0201d; (PVCs) produced by <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> spp. are distinct from intracellular CISs, which can be directly secreted into the medium and confer insecticidal activity against the wax moth (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). CISs with this type of action mode are defined as &#x0201c;extracellular CISs&#x0201d; (eCISs) (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Ghequire and De Mot, 2015</xref>). The eCISs can be released outside of the bacteria to interact with the targeted cell surface. For example, the R-type pyocins secreted by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> could function through pore formation in the envelope of competing bacterial cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nakayama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Michel-Briand and Baysse, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In previous work, we reported the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of an intact PVC particle from <italic>Photorhabdus asymbiotica</italic> ATCC43949 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). We demonstrated that the PVC device resembled a simplified T4 phage tail, comprising a hexagonal baseplate complex with six fibers and a capped 117-nm sheath-tube complex. A comparison of the structure and assembly process of PVC and other CISs indicated that PVC may be an evolutionary intermediate between the T4 phage and T6SS (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). Compositional and structural analysis of PVCs has increased our understanding of eCISs. In the following work, we identified the PVC effectors and attempted to determine the function of the effectors in eukaryotic cells.</p><p>Multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) toxins are effector delivery platforms playing critical roles in numerous Gram-negative bacteria. The MARTX toxins are composed of conserved repeat regions in N- and C-terminus and an autoprocessing protease domain to deliver the effector domains into eukaryotic cells (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Egerer and Satchell, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gavin and Satchell, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Satchell, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Generally, one single MARTX toxin possesses a repertoire of up to five effector domains, organized in a characteristic modular fashion (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Prochazkova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2009</xref>). Several effector domains of MARTX have been characterized, such as the Rho GTPase-inactivation domain (RID) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sheahan et al., 2004</xref>), actin cross-linking domain (ACD) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fullner and Mekalanos, 2000</xref>), and Ras/Rap1-specific endopeptidase domain (RRSP, also known as DUF5) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Antic et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The RRSP domain was identified in different <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic> isolates and other pathogens and specifically cleaved the switch I domain of the Ras and Rap1 proteins in eukaryotic cells (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Antic et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic>, we found a gene encoding a protein with homology to RRSP (RRSP<sub>Pa</sub>), which located downstream of the PVC cluster. The literature proved that the PVC can deliver the corresponding effectors in proximity to the locus (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Vlisidou et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that the RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> could be potential PVC delivered effector. It is well established that the RRSP domain in MARTX toxin from <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> targets Ras for processing causing ERK1/2 dephosphorylation in HeLa cells (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Antic et al., 2015</xref>). In this report, we showed that the RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> protein was associated with inhibition of cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis and death of HeLa cells. We demonstrated that RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> induced cell cycle alteration, delayed cell mitotic progression, and led to regression of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. In addition, we found that RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> targeted the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) protein and inhibited the CDK1 Thr161 phosphorylation in HeLa cells, which partially explained the crucial role of this effector domain in cell mitosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions</title><p>The <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic> ATCC43949 strain was cultured in Luria&#x02013;Bertani (LB) medium at 30&#x000b0;C. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains were cultured in LB broth at 37&#x000b0;C unless indicated.

These findings represent an additional aspect of RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> function during the cell cycle.</p><p>Cell rounding was observed in cells expressing RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> and homologs from other bacteria toxins (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Antic et al., 2014</xref>), while the mechanism for this phenotype remained unclear. We found that cell rounding may partially due to the cell mitotic defects induced by RRSP<sub>Pa</sub>. During live imaging, it was observed that the &#x0201c;round stage&#x0201d; of the RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> expressing cells was much longer than the control cells. When transfected with EGFP, cells rounded up and then entered to anaphase within 30 min whereas the EGFP-RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> expressing cells experienced at least 2 h of the &#x0201c;round stage.&#x0201d; Moreover, commonly after abscission phase, the EGFP expressing cells returned to normal morphology in short time, whereas the RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> expressing cells remained the rounding morphology for long time. Together, this may interpret the phenotype of cell rounding induced by RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A&#x02013;C</xref>).</p><p>Besides the rounding morphology, the confocal microscopy images also demonstrated increased membrane blebbing in cells producing EGFP-RRSP<sub>Pa</sub>. Since the membrane blebbing indicates cell necrosis (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nagarajan et al., 2019</xref>), this observation was consistent with the cell death (late apoptosis and cell necrosis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D&#x02013;F</xref>) detected through flow cytometry.</p><p>CDK1 is a universal mitotic regulator (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Nurse, 1990</xref>) and drives cell cycle progression when bound to its partner cyclin B (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Murray, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mishima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Zhu and Jiang, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Estey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Mathieu et al., 2013</xref>). In this work, we demonstrated that RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> influenced the CDK1 Thr161 phosphorylation in HeLa cells. As documented previously, CDK1 was related to cytokinesis failure and cell apoptosis, which partially explained the crucial role of this effector for cell mitosis. Thus, the RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> induced cell cycle alteration and apoptosis would ascribe to the CDK1 down-regulation by RRSP<sub>Pa</sub>. It was shown that the results of H485A mutation were significantly different from the negative control of pcDNA3.1 and pEGFP, besides the protein&#x02013;protein interaction analysis showed that the H485A mutation did not affect the interaction with CDK1. These data demonstrated that RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> association with CDK1 was independent of cleavage of Ras and Rap1, revealing an additional mechanism of action for the Ras/Rap1 protease.</p><p>It was reported that CDK1 controls proteins involved in DNA replication and chromosome segregation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Enserink and Kolodner, 2010</xref>). Actually, we have observed the chromosome abnormalities induced by RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> through confocal imaging of cells in anaphase and telophase, such as the centrophilic chromosome, lagging chromosome, and misaligned chromosomes (data not shown). Since the chromosome abnormalities are related to cytokinesis failure and cell death during mitosis (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Normand and King, 2010</xref>), the cell mitotic catastrophe may not only result from the inhibition of CDK1 Thr161 phosphorylation but also the chromosome defects due to premature activation of CDK1. Hence, the detailed molecular mechanism of RRSP<sub>Pa</sub> induced mitotic catastrophe is comprehensive and remains to be further elucidated.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed that several putative effectors encoded by genes downstream of the PVC clusters were homologous to effectors of type III secretion systems (T3SSs). For example, the gene encoding the YopT homologous protein was located downstream of the same PVC cluster as <italic>RRSP</italic><sub>Pa</sub> (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). In pathogenic <italic>Yersinia</italic> species, the YopT effector protein can be delivered through a T3SS into host cells and functions as a cysteine protease to cleave Rho family GTPases (RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Shao et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, a gene encoding homologs of the T3SS effector GogB is also present in the <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic> genome. A recent finding suggest that a cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) homologous protein, Pnf, could be delivered by the PVC needle complex to exert its effect (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Vlisidou et al., 2019</xref>). Given this finding, we hypothesized that the PVC structure proteins and effectors evolved from different ancestors, as the structure of PVC is considered to be an evolutionary intermediate between the T4 phage and T6SS (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>), while the effectors may be horizontally transferred from other secretion systems, such as T3SSs or other systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>XW, FJ, and QJ conceived the study and designed experimental procedures.
