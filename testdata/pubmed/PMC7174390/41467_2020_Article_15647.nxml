Important sub-structures in the lung include the conducting airways, responsible for filtering and delivering inhaled and exhaled air, the bronchovascular bundles, conduits for air, blood, and lymphatics, and the alveolar region, responsible for gas exchange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Collagens play central roles in maintaining the organization and structural integrity of these distinct anatomic features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Perturbation of collagen homeostasis is an important contributor to common lung diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. However, the cells responsible for normal collagen production in each of these regions and for excess accumulation of collagen in fibrotic lung diseases have not been well characterized. It has been widely assumed that there is a single cell type, often called a myofibroblast and characterized by expression of the contractile protein alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA), that is the major collagen-producing cell in the lung. However, previous work by ourselves and others suggest that &#x003b1;-SMA is an inconsistent marker of collagen-producing cells in in normal murine lungs and in murine models of pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. To enhance progress in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying normal collagen homeostasis and fibrotic lung diseases, a better understanding of the cells responsible for collagen production is urgently needed.</p><p id="Par4">The development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to evaluate the heterogeneity of tissue cell types with markedly improved precision. Several recently published studies have used this approach to characterize some of the mesenchymal populations in the lung. Zepp et al. identified mesenchymal alveolar niche cells and myogenic progenitor cells by using Axin2-CreER/Pdgfra-GFP/Wnt2-CreER reporter mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Xie et al. collected mesenchymal populations more broadly by sorting CD31, CD45, and Epcam-negative cells, and described 6&#x02013;7 mesenchymal populations in normal and fibrotic murine lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Another recent study performed scRNA-seq on all cells obtained with a single digestion protocol from fibrotic human lungs, but the overwhelming majority of cells obtained and analyzed were leukocytes and epithelial cells, with very few cells that were characterized as fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Overall, no studies to date have specifically focused on the cells responsible for production of collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and the anatomic location of these cell types in normal and fibrotic lungs.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we perform scRNA-seq of cells obtained with a protocol designed to capture all of the collagen-producing cells from normal and fibrotic mouse and human lungs. We use gene expression signatures to classify fibroblast subpopulations based on their anatomical localizations, and developed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) strategies to purify those populations. Through this approach, we identify molecularly distinct populations of fibroblasts that populate distinct anatomic locations, in the walls of conducting airways (peribronchial), surrounding bronchovascular bundles (adventitial) and embedded within the alveolar regions of the lung (alveolar). We also identify a unique population of <italic>Cthrc1</italic> (collagen triple helix repeat containing 1)<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts, which are mostly found in fibrotic lungs in both mice and humans and expresses the highest levels of type 1 collagen and other ECM genes. Purified <italic>Cthrc1</italic><sup>+</sup> fibroblasts are more migratory than other subsets of collagen-producing cells and demonstrate an enhanced capacity to colonize the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice. These findings identify the distinct gene and cell surface protein expression patterns that characterize fibroblast subsets with distinct anatomic localizations. The <italic>Cthrc1</italic><sup>+</sup> subset we describe is likely to play an important role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis in mice and humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>scRNA-seq of murine lung cells in normal and fibrotic lungs</title><p id="Par6">We used <italic>Col1a1</italic>-EGFP (Col-GFP) reporter mice to harvest all of the collagen-producing cells in murine lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We induced lung fibrosis by intratracheally instilling bleomycin into two Col-GFP mice, and prepared a single cell suspension from the lungs 14 days after the bleomycin treatment. Two untreated Col-GFP mice were used as control. In addition to GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, we sorted GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells to compare gene expression patterns in the cells responsible for collagen production to pattern seen in other cell types. We performed scRNA-seq of each sample using the 10x Genomics platform (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). After quality filtering, we obtained 25953 cell profiles from all the GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> samples. We performed dimensionality reduction with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) subspace alignment and performed unsupervised clustering (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Analysis of representative markers identified clusters of endothelial, epithelial, and mesothelial cells as well as hematopoietic cells including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and lymphocytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). To characterize the heterogeneity of collagen-producing cells in higher resolution, we focused on the cells from GFP<sup>+</sup> samples and removed all clusters with lineage markers, which did not consistently express <italic>Col1a1</italic> except a small cluster of mesothelial cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Re-clustering of <italic>Col1a1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> cells revealed 12 clusters from 12,855 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). All the clusters included cells from both bleomycin-treated and untreated lungs except clusters 8 and 11, which were mostly from bleomycin-treated lungs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). The clusters were categorized into two superclusters: one composed of clusters 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 with higher <italic>Col1a1</italic> expression, and the other composed of clusters 3, 5, 7, 9 with higher <italic>Acta2</italic> expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>).

The PLISH signal is observed as bright dots, which represent the cellular locations of target mRNA. In normal lungs, Col-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were mainly detected at alveolar walls and adventitial cuffs surrounding large airways and arteries in bronchovascular bundles (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). We found that Col-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in alveoli expressed both <italic>Npnt</italic> and <italic>Ces1d</italic>, markers for clusters 0, 1, 2, 10 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

Our results confirm that smooth muscle cells and pericytes express low levels of collagen in both mice and humans, but that there are unique populations of cells that express higher levels of collagen and reside in distinct anatomic locations&#x02014;the walls of conducting airways, surrounding the bronchovascular bundles, and embedded within the gas-exchanging alveolar region. We speculate that each population plays unique functional roles in organizing and maintaining the unique structures of each of these regions and in fibrotic responses to regional insults.</p><p id="Par25">By comparing scRNA-seq results between normal and fibrotic lungs, we were also able to identify a unique population of cells that expressed the highest levels of collagens and other known components of the pathologic ECM, and were marked by high levels of expression of <italic>Cthrc1</italic> in both mice and human.

Further support for this interpretation comes from our observations that levels of collagen expression progressively increased from populations of alveolar fibroblasts seen mainly in normal lungs, to populations of alveolar fibroblasts seen mainly in fibrotic lungs, to the <italic>Cthrc1</italic>-expressing cells. In parallel, expression of several markers shared by normal alveolar fibroblasts, including <italic>Pdgfra</italic>, <italic>Tcf21</italic>, and <italic>Npnt</italic> decreased progressively over this same continuum. Interestingly, both alveolar fibroblasts and adventitial fibroblasts purified from normal lungs and transferred back into the lungs of mice treated with intratracheal bleomycin were able to colonize the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice and markedly upregulated expression of <italic>Cthrc1</italic> after transfer, suggesting substantial plasticity of these populations in response to a fibrotic in vivo environment.</p><p id="Par27">Myofibroblasts were first identified as contractile fibroblasts in granulation tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

Amongst the PDGFRB stromal cells, expressing was normalized with SCTransform 0.2.0 for the top 10,000 defined variable genes to regress out signals associated with the fraction of mitochondrial transcripts and the overall number of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), using seed:7. Variable features were selected with Seurat 3.1.0 using the &#x0201c;mean variance plot&#x0201d; method, with a mean expression cutoff range between 0.15 and 4, and dispersion cutoff between 0.8 and 7. Amongst selected variable genes, only genes normalized by SCTransform were selected for PCA analysis under the default Seurat parameters. The top 6 dimensions were used for UMAP embedding with a neighborhood size of 20, a minimum distance of 0.1, for 1000 epochs. UMAPs featuring gene expression show the log((TPM/100)+1) values of expression per cell.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Sequencing data processing for publicly available data sets</title><p id="Par41">Gene expression matrices of Peyser et al.
