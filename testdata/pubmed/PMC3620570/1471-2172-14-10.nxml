Afflicting mostly young people at an age when they are most active both in their private and professional life, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents an important public health problem affecting the patients education, working abilities, social life and quality of life. The cause of IBD is multiple and so far not completely understood. However, genetic factors, environmental factors and the gut bacteria play a role in disease development.</p><p>Conventional therapy of active IBD pre-dominantly target anti-inflammatory immune responses, largely due to cytokine release within the intestine. Thus, therapeutic treatment mainly includes anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, biologic agents, and antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, these agents may cause severe adverse effects and are therefore not suitable for long-term treatment of IBD. Moreover, conventional drugs block manifestation or consequences of inflammation in acute disease. Thus, there is a necessity for therapeutic strategies that target improvement of impaired barrier function in remission. Suitable candidates are dietary supplements and food components such as colostrum. Although natural therapies are commonly associated with lower toxicity and fewer side effects than conventional drugs, the scientific proof of their effectiveness and safety is demanded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Colostrum, the secretion produced by the mammary glands during the first three days post-partum, contains many functional nutrients. These include immunoglobulins, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides. The potential of colostrum to affect gastrointestinal infections and to reduce the incidence of immune-mediated diseases is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In accordance with this, we recently demonstrated the protective effect of orally applied colostrum in a murine colitis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Beneficial effects were characterized by improvement of clinical colorectal inflammation symptoms and by the induction of immunoregulatory mechanisms, predominantly of the innate immune system arm. Thus, identification of factors responsible for preventing experimental colitis might provide the basis for developing a long-term treatment regimen.</p><p>In IBD patients, local production of polymeric IgA (pIgA) is altered and this affects both immunological homeostasis and humoral immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. IgA does not activate the classical complement pathway and inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thereby maintaining mucosal integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. SIgA preparations from colostrum are active against various microbial antigens and inhibit adhesion and invasion by enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Colostral sIgA influences the development of the gastrointestinal immune system in milk-fed infants; however, little is known about the effectiveness of oral sIgA in maintaining gut barrier functions in adults.</p><p>Another colostral peptide with a broad range of immunomodulatory properties is lactoferrin (Lf), a member of the iron-binding glycoprotein family. Lf is predominately found in mucosal secretions and neutrophilic granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Lf concentration and iron saturation differ among species; bovine (bLf) and human (hLf) Lfs show strong sequence homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. BLf has been reported to stimulate mucosal and systemic immune responses when given orally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, there is experimental evidence that Lf reduces the severity of colitis in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we explored the potential of orally applied colostral bLf and sIgA for modulating immune responses and recovery from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced murine colitis. Whole bovine colostrum (BC) improved the clinical severity of colitis, whereas bLf had no effect. SIgA influenced DSS-mediated immune cell redistribution and specifically altered colonic cell infiltration. Therefore, it might be an interesting candidate for promoting regeneration from acute colitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Therapeutic application of colostrum and sIgA improved clinical recovery from colitis</title><p>After a single seven-day treatment of 5% DSS in drinking water, the mice showed signs of acute colitis including weight loss, bloody stools, and diarrhea.

BC and bLf showed only marginal differences from the control groups (NaCl, IgG, BSA). Since BSA-fed mice showed the most dramatic weight loss, up to 20% at day 14, the BC- and sIgA-induced recovery was not simply attributable to a feeding effect (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Therapeutic application of colostrum or colostral components had no effect on histopathological severity of colitis</title><p>In contrast to the clinical benefit, BC and sIgA did not reduce colon shortening at day 15 after DSS challenge.

Histological examination of the colon at day 15 revealed no significant differences in total histological score or in grade and extent of inflammation (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Therapeutic application of sIgA affected immune cell redistribution</title><p>The induction of colitis is characterized by a reduced number of mature CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD83<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs) in the periphery and spleen and by a raised level in the mesenteric lymph nodes.

Inflammation-induced elevation of DCs in mesenteric lymph nodes was exclusively found in NaCl controls; their numbers were not altered in the therapeutic groups (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A).

However, except in the case of IgG, therapeutic application of BC or Lf did not significantly alter the DSS-mediated cell redistribution (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B).

These findings, seemingly contradictory to our study, could be attributed to the fact that in these studies, human Lf with 7% iron saturation level was applied perorally twice a day. In contrast, we used Lf derived from bovine colostrum, and the level of iron saturation of bovine Lf was in range of 5 to 30%. Therefore, the discrepancy might be due to the therapeutic regimen rather than to the iron saturation level. Thus, increasing the number of Lf injections per day might have beneficial effects on the course of colitis. However, this was beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>Another remarkable finding of our study was the effect of immunoglobulins on those immunological effector cells that most probably promote disease recovery. Mature DCs (CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD83<sup>+</sup>) and immunoregulatory <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> TCR<sup>+</sup> T cells were almost normalized in lymph nodes and spleens in the sIgA and IgG groups. Similar data were obtained in the prophylactic setting. SIgA almost normalized the DSS-mediated cell redistribution (CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells, <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> TCR<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD83<sup>+</sup> mature dendritic cells) in lymph nodes and spleen.</p><p>Although <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells are important in intestinal inflammation, the functional role of this cell population remains unknown. Under physiological conditions, they represent a minor subset within lymph nodes and spleens; however, they are induced in mice and men by inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Peripheral human <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells exert regulatory functions and suppress T helper cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, the specific effects of sIgA on immune cell distribution can be regarded as favorable immune modulation of DSS-induced inflammation. In addition, colostral sIgA but not IgG influenced colonic cell infiltration. Just as whole BC is effective in preventing DSS-induced colitis, so sIgA treatment was characterized by massive increases in colonic CD11c<sup>+</sup> and CD83<sup>+</sup> DCs as well as <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> TCR<sup>+</sup> T cells. Thus, the increase of local regulatory cells after BC prophylaxis was most likely to have been due to colostral sIgA rather than IgG. Activated <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells have been shown to promote epithelial cell growth via the production of keratinocyte growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and to regulate intestinal homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], while depletion of <italic>&#x003b3;&#x003b4;</italic> T cells worsened inflammation in mouse models of colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore, in accordance with these studies, the enhanced recovery from colitis was most probably mediated by immune cell modulation through colostrum and in particular colostral sIgA.</p><p>In our previous study, we hypothesized that MDSCs contributed to the clinical benefit of prophylactically applied colostrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Here again, sIgA prophylaxis specifically increased the number of splenic CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> MDSCs. Although the function of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> MDSC in intestinal inflammation remains unclear, MDSCs accumulated in the bone marrow and spleen of DSS-exposed mice, and intravenous transplantation of DSS-induced splenic CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells in C57Bl/6 mice resulted in advanced mucosal healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We therefore conclude that the strong induction of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> cells by sIgA contributed to the enhanced recovery from weight loss at later time points.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we tested the immunomodulatory potential of sIgA and bLf for improving the severity of DSS-induced murine colitis. SIgA but not bLf was identified as a colostral component that altered immune responses and promoted weight gain in colitic mice. Further studies are required to explore how this natural colostral compound modulates the colitis-induced immune cell redistribution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Female outbred NMRI mice were purchased from Harlan Winkelmann GmbH (Melderslo, Netherlands) at the age of four to six months.
