To address this limitation, we developed a novel LM-PCR method, termed Cyclic Digestion and Ligation-Mediated PCR (CDL-PCR). The novelty of this approach involves the design of new adapters that cannot be digested after being ligated with the restriction fragment, and cyclic digestion and ligation may be manipulated to block the circularization or multimerization of the target restriction fragments. Moreover, to improve the generality and flexibility of CDL-PCR, an adapter precursor sequence was designed, which could be digested to prepare 12 different adapters at low cost. Using this method, the flanking sequences of T-DNA insertions were obtained from transgenic rice and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The experimental results demonstrated that CDL-PCR is an efficient and flexible method for identifying the flanking sequences in transgenic rice and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Transgenic plants</kwd><kwd>Plant molecular biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the National Science and Technology Major Projects (grant number 2016ZX08001004), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (grant number 2019JJ40207), Hunan Science and Technology Major Project (grant number 2018NK1010)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Hunan Science and Technology Talent Lift Project (grant number 2019TJ-Q08), Hunan Science and Technology Major Project (grant number 2018NK1010), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 3167166)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the National Science and Technology Major Projects (grant number 2016ZX08001004),Technology Innovation Project of Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences (grant number 2017ZD02)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Identification of flanking sequences has often been employed to determine the location of T-DNA insertion in genomic DNA.

Ligation-mediated PCR includes three major steps: (i) restriction enzyme digestion of the genomic DNA and ligation of specific adapters; (ii) PCR of restriction fragments using specific primers designed from known sequences and adapter sequences; (iii) analysis of the amplified fragments using gel electrophoresis and sequencing. Owing to the use of specific primers in PCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, ligation-mediated PCR has been one of the preferred approaches to identify flanking sequences with high sensitivity and specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, ligation-mediated PCR requires adapter ligation to generate an artificial priming site at the ends of restriction fragments. There exist common limitations due to the inherent characteristics of this method, such as reduced success rates caused by circularization or multimerization of the restriction fragment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, less flexibility, and high expenses, resulting in only one adapter being used with a group of restriction enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Here, we report a novel method, developed based on ligation-mediated PCR and termed as cyclic digestion and ligation-mediated PCR (CDL-PCR), to circumvent the limitations mentioned above.

The precursor sequence was synthesized and then seamlessly cloned into pMD18-T vector for the PCR template using the SSEA method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>; the template plasmid was named pMD18T-APS. The adapter precursor sequences were enriched via PCR and digested respectively using the integrated 12 restriction sites to generate 12 kinds of adapters with different overhang ends. The adjacent bases of complementary sequences, ligated to the restriction fragment, were optimized so that every adapter could ligate to both ends of the restriction fragments digested by a group of isocaudomers, and the ligation products could no longer be cut by the same enzyme owing to the removal of the original restriction site. For example, adapter2 was generated by cutting the adapter precursor sequence with Sau3AI and the two adjacent nucleotides of the recognition site were C and G (C<underline>GATC</underline>G) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); therefore, no original restriction site would be produced if adapter2 ligated to the restriction fragments digested using BamHI, BglII, or BclI.

(2) The adapter precursor sequence was amplified via PCR and an appropriate restriction enzyme was selected (based on the recognition site integrated in the adapter precursor sequence) to digest it for the preparation of adapters. (3) The restriction fragments were ligated with the adapter. Products mainly included the target ligation products formed by adapters and target restriction fragments, circularized restriction fragments, multimerized restriction fragments, invalid ligation products formed by adapters and non-target restriction fragments, and dimerized adapters. (4) Based on the compatibility of endonuclease buffer and ligase buffer, cyclic digestion and ligation manipulation were introduced to block the target restriction fragments from circularization or multimerization. Although the target ligation product could no longer be digested by isocaudomers, the circularized or multimerized target restriction fragments could be cut and ligated with the adapter to form target ligation products.

The two lines were planned to be subjected to an environmental release trial, which is one of the four tests for assessing GM safety in China. Therefore, it was important to get information on the T-DNA insertion sites in the rice genome; CDL-PCR was applied to retrieve the flanking sequence adjacent to the insertion sites of lines DR24 and MDH13. First, we analyzed the restriction sites in the T-DNA region of transformation vectors of the two lines. On the basis of restriction site information, we selected adapter2 and adapter6 as appropriate adapters for subsequent experiments, and designed specific nested primers LSP1/LSP2 and MSP1/MSP2 in the upstream ltp promoter sequence of <italic>DsRed</italic> gene and downstream sequence of <italic>ZmMDH</italic> gene (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Next, the APS was amplified via PCR and cut by Sau3AI and HpaII to make adapter2 and adapter6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Genomic DNA of DR24 was separately digested by isocaudomers of BamHI, BclI, and BglII, whereas that of MDH13 was separately digested by isocaudomers of BstBI, ClaI, and NarI. The above 2 categories of restriction fragment libraries, with same overhang ends, were ligated with adapter2 or adapter6, respectively. Thereafter, cyclic digestion and ligation reactions were conducted, which translated the circularization or multimerization of target restriction fragments to the target ligation products. Nested PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis were conducted to obtain the target sequence. Finally, 3 clear bands of &#x0003e; 500&#x02009;bp, indicated by arrows in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, were recovered for sequencing. The PCR band obtained from lane 1 was 803&#x02009;bp and was sequenced using the primer LSP2; the bands obtained from lanes 4 and 6 were 2102&#x02009;bp and 532&#x02009;bp, respectively, and were sequenced using primer MSP2 and its walking primer. After sequence alignment analysis, the sequence of lane 1 contents was observed to contain partial ltp promoter sequences, vector boundary sequences, and a DNA sequence reverse complemented with Chr.9: 16788680&#x02013;16789099 in the rice genome (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>); the sequence of the lane 4 product contained part of <italic>ZmMDH</italic> cDNA sequence, 35&#x02009;S terminator sequence, vector boundary sequences, and a DNA sequence from Chr.9: 10844986&#x02013;10846153&#x02009;in the rice genome (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>); and the sequence of the lane 6 product only covered vector border sequences, with no rice genome sequence (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).Therefore, according to the sequencing results, the T-DNA insertion site of DR24 was between 16789099&#x02009;bp and 16789100&#x02009;bp on Chromosome 9 of the rice genome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), and the T-DNA insertion site of MDH13 was between 10844985&#x02009;bp and 10844986&#x02009;bp on Chromosome 9 of the rice genome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).

Currently, TAIL-PCR and ligation-mediated PCR are used for the identification of flanking sequences in complex genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and the application of reverse PCR has become less frequent. Despite several improvements and optimizations, TAIL-PCR still has a lower success rate in practical application due to the non-specific products or short product fragments. In the beginning of the experiment, a modified TAIL-PCR, named hiTAIL-PCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, was used to analyze the insertion sites of transgenic rice lines DR24 and MDH13; however, it was not successful. The classical LM-PCR, termed Loop-linker PCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, was used next; however, no flanking sequence could be isolated from DR24 and MDH13 due to the success rate being reduced by circularization or multimerization of restriction fragments harboring the T-DNA. Therefore, a cyclic digestion and ligation reaction was introduced, based on the compatibility characteristics of NEB restriction enzyme and ligase buffer, to avoid circularization or multimerization of restriction fragments. The purification step after genome digestion could be omitted to simplify the entire operation. To achieve the above objective, an adapter precursor sequence was designed by nucleotide optimization, and the precursor was digested to prepare 12 different adapters with overhang ends, each of which could no longer be digested after being ligated to the restriction fragment. Furthermore, the 12 adapters could be combined with 12 groups of isocaudomers, including 35 restriction enzymes, thus greatly improving the versatility of the method and reducing its cost. Using the new and improved method, CDL-PCR, flanking sequence and insertion site information of transgenic rice and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> was easily obtained.</p><p id="Par10">In our experience, there are 3 key points for using CDL-PCR. First, selecting a group of isocaudomers with no corresponding restriction sites on the vector or sites farther away from the designed specific nested primers. For example, the isocaudomers of BamHI, BclI, and BgII have no corresponding restriction sites in the vector while the nearest restriction site of BstBI, ClaI, and NarI is more than 2&#x02009;kb away from the specific nested primers MSP1 and MSP2. Second, some studies have suggested the cocktail of isocaudomer digestion to be able to obtain shorter restriction fragments for subsequent PCR extension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, although the shortest restriction fragment is determined by only one of the enzymes, just like the barrel theory, in which the maximum water capacity of a barrel depends on the shortest wood board. On the contrary, mixed digestion may result in insufficient enzymatic cleavage, thus influencing the final success, since the amount of a single enzyme is reduced. Therefore, separate digestion is better than mixed digestion when a group of isocaudomers are used to digest genomic DNA. Third, the success rate of CDL-PCR is limitied by the nearest distance between the restriction site and the inserted T-DNA region, if a sample failed to obtain results with one set of isocaudomers, success may be obtained with another set of isocaudomers.</p><p id="Par11">In conclusion, CDL-PCR is an efficient, reliable, and cost-effective method for identifying flanking sequences in transgenic rice and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>; although it is complicated to operate, it may be anticipated to be applied in more genome walking applications in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Adapter preparation</title><p id="Par12">The adapter precursor sequence was amplified from pMD18T-APS plasmid templates using Phanta Max Super-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Vazyme Biotech) with primers APS-F and APS-R (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
