Unlike other mammals, they efficiently reabsorb amino acids from urine, periodically activate muscle contraction, and their adipocytes differentially responds to insulin. The contribution of myocytes to the reduced atrophy remains largely unknown. Here we show how metabolism and atrophy signaling are regulated in skeletal muscle of hibernating grizzly bear. Metabolic modeling of proteomic changes suggests an autonomous increase of non-essential amino acids (NEAA) in muscle and treatment of differentiated myoblasts with NEAA is sufficient to induce hypertrophy. Our comparison of gene expression in hibernation versus muscle atrophy identified several genes differentially regulated during hibernation, including Pdk4 and Serpinf1. Their trophic effects extend to myoblasts from non-hibernating species (including C. elegans), as documented by a knockdown approach. Together, these changes reflect evolutionary favored adaptations that, once translated to the clinics, could help improve atrophy treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Translational research</kwd><kwd>Experimental models of disease</kwd><kwd>Molecular medicine</kwd><kwd>Skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>Cell signalling</kwd><kwd>Mechanisms of disease</kwd><kwd>Systems biology</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd><kwd>Proteome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>TransCard PhD fellowship</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gotthardt</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Muscle wasting accompanies a range of human conditions such as aging, prolonged bed rest, space flight, malnutrition and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Studying how these animals preserve muscle mass despite the challenges of hibernation could teach us how to preserve muscle mass in humans. Contrary to humans and mice, bears lose far less muscle mass and strength during hibernation, a period of 5 to 7 months of restricted caloric intake and immobilization, sufficient to cause almost twice as much muscle loss in bed-ridden or malnourished humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, hibernating bears efficiently reabsorb urea from their urine, which decreases the need to mobilize amino-acids from muscle protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Finally, periodic neural stimulation of muscles in the form of shivers during hibernation has been proposed to help conserve muscle mass. However, hibernating bears are resistant to muscle atrophy even after denervation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, suggesting that intramuscular changes contribute to atrophy resistance. Accordingly, we interrogated the skeletal muscle proteome and transcriptome to reveal the molecular changes that limit atrophy in hibernating bears and evaluated the conservation of these pathways between species as well as their potential as therapeutic targets using an <italic>in vivo</italic> knockdown approach in C. elegans and a murine cell-based atrophy model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Proteomic and transcriptomic changes in skeletal muscle during hibernation relate to metabolism and growth signaling</title><p id="Par4">To identify genes that protect grizzly muscle from atrophy and understand the underlying changes in metabolism and cell signaling, we used a complementary proteomics and transcriptomics approach.

After <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly by homology to human transcripts, we quantified reads mapping to 4873 annotated genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). These genes associate with a diverse set of KEGG pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis using NOIseq identified 208 genes regulated in hibernation (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, predictive-score &#x02265; 0.8). A KEGG enrichment analysis correcting for identification bias revealed changes in more biological processes than the proteomic data with little overlap between the two data sets. We attribute the limited overlap to the relatively lower coverage of the proteomics data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). While the majority of the regulated proteins are metabolic enzymes, the majority of the regulated transcripts are associated with signal transduction through the Pi3k-Akt pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>; Suppl. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), which plays a pivotal role in regulating organ growth and metabolism across species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Changes on the transcript level were mapped to the corresponding human Pi3k-Akt KEGG pathway (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and suggest an overall increase in pathway activity: The insulin-sensitive insulin receptor substrate Irs-1 is upregulated during hibernation, while the less insulin-sensitive homologue Irs-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> is suppressed. This is accompanied by increased levels of its downstream effector Ip3r3, and decreased levels of depTOR - an inhibitor of the Irs downstream effector mTor. In a published set of insulin-sensitive individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> IRS1, PIK3R3 and FAS were similarly regulated, suggesting that insulin-sensitivity is increased in skeletal muscle during hibernation. Consistently, transcripts of the Irs-binding protein Grb2, as well as Angpt4 (upstream of Irs- signaling) were increased. An additional component of this signaling pathway is Sgk1, which is upregulated to protect hibernating squirrels from muscle atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In our dataset, Sgk1 was below the detection limit of RNAseq or MS analysis. Another set of enriched genes are frequently mutated in cardiomyopathies. Many of these are structural proteins of the sarcomere and their upregulation at the mRNA level would be consistent with increased hypertrophy and reduced atrophy signaling during hibernation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Proteomic changes and metabolic modeling predict an increase in non-essential amino acid levels (NEAA) in hibernating bear muscle and a decrease in aging humans</title><p id="Par7">Changes in glucose metabolic enzymes were the most prominent on the protein level and resulted in the segregation of bear samples into two main groups active and hibernating upon unsupervised clustering (two-way ANOVA; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). These changes are largely within the tricarbocylic acid (TCA) cycle and extend to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The decrease in the alpha and beta subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdh), which produces acetyl-CoA and the increased levels of its inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4), suggests a decrease in the production of the TCA cycle substrate acetyl-CoA. This is accompanied by a decrease in the majority of TCA cycle enzymes, which process acetyl-CoA confirming prior art<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition to providing energy equivalents, glycolysis-, gluconeogenesis- and TCA cycle intermediates serve as precursors for NEAA synthesis and the availability of NEAAs directly affects the ability of muscle to maintain protein levels. Thus, we modeled the effect of hibernation-induced changes in protein expression on the NEAA level. Based on the relative changes in muscle protein levels, we constructed two activity-dependent metabolic models building on the human metabolic network Recon2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We then optimized for maximum NEAA production as well as for that of their precursors, glycerate-3-phosphate (3&#x02009;pg) and alpha-ketogluterate (a-KG). The relative changes in steady state levels of NEAA during hibernation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) indicate an increase in six of 11 NEAAs. We used the identical approach to learn how NEAAs and their precursors are affected in aging human muscle as an example of a physiological atrophy response to reduced activity and calorie intake. The choice of aging humans as a reference was based on the similarity in physiological changes as compared to hibernating grizzly bears (reduced food consumption with unchanged blood glucose levels and reduced activity), which nevertheless lead to less muscle wasting in the latter. To build the age-dependent models we used publicly available transcriptional data from skeletal muscle of young and older women (GSE674)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Enzymes related to glucose metabolism are regulated at the protein level in skeletal muscle during hibernation.

Alpha-ketogluterate, the TCA cycle-derived precursor was also decreased while glycerate-3-phosphate remained unchanged.

These changes in NEAA availability could be advantageous to muscle growth during hibernation. We did not find a significant increase in NEAA-rich proteins during hibernation, suggesting that the production of NEAAs might not simply increase substrate availability for protein synthesis. Rather, NEAAs might exert a direct effect on trophic signaling as supported by an increase in phospho-S6k levels during hibernation, which implies that atrophy signaling via the mTor pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> is regulated to maintain muscle mass. Indeed, supplementing differentiated C2C12 cells with NEAAs increased myotube thickness, which was accompanied by a similar increase in phospho-S6k levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4j,k</xref>) and decreased mRNA levels of the E2 ligase Ube2b, as well as the oxidative-response protein MT-1, which both have been reported to increase in multiple cases of muscle atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">Since<italic> C. elegans</italic> has successfully been used as a model for neuromuscular disease with the perimeter largely determined by the worm&#x02019;s muscle mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, we tested the effect of NEAA supplementation on <italic>C. elegans</italic> diameter in both agar and liquid cultures.

Genes regulated only during hibernation, could help explain the bears&#x02019; ability to preserve muscle mass under conditions that are detrimental in other species. Similar approaches in hibernating squirrels have led to the successful identification of genes such as Sgk1 as regulators of muscle size in non-hibernating mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Unfortunately Sgk1 was not detected on the transcriptional or protein level in our samples making it difficult to determine whether it also plays an important role in preserving hibernating muscle mass in bears. We found that the expression of structural proteins (Mybpc1, Tnni3, Myh7b) was increased, while expression of the actin-severing protein gelsolin (Gsn) was decreased. This is consistent with transcriptional changes that favor muscle-building.</p><p id="Par22">To prioritize potential therapeutic targets, we investigated the differentially regulated genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as evolutionary conserved pathways would provide the most robust candidates for therapy. Indeed, knockdown of metabolic genes such as the homologues of Cyc1 and Scd decreased worm perimeter. A human condition in which CYC1 levels are decreased due to protein instability is accompanied by growth retardation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) and Scd is expressed at higher levels upon exercise suggesting that these genes are evolutionary conserved regulators of muscle size. The strongest reduction in body size resulted from the knockdown of Rora - an effect, which has already been reported in mice and could in part relate to metabolism through an associated decrease in Scd-1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">Among the genes not previously associated with muscle growth and had no effect on worm perimeter, we confirmed the role of Pdk4 and Serpinf1 on atrophy signaling in a tissue culture model of muscle atrophy.

The increase in size was accompanied by a decrease in Murf1 in differentiated myotubes. Murf1 binds to and regulates the ubiquitination of cytoskeletal and metabolic enzymes that constitute a large fraction of myotube mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. It thus appears favorable to reduce Pdk4 levels in atrophy-promoting conditions, which is indeed what we observed on the mRNA level. However, in hibernation we and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> find an increase in Pdk4 protein (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). An important difference between the culture system and hibernation is the limited availability of circulating NEAA during hibernation, while culture medium has an abundance of it. It is thus possible that in conditions where an autonomous increase in NEAA is desirable such as hibernation, post-transcriptional mechanisms that increase PDK4 protein levels might be evolutionarily important to counter those that decrease it at the mRNA level. The downregulation of Serpinf1 mRNA during hibernation would also help preserve muscle mass, as its suppression in myotubes reduces atrophy signaling and increases muscle size. While the exact mechanism by which Serpinf1 affects muscle mass is still unknown, it might involve Nf&#x003ba;b-signaling, which enhances muscle wasting and has been linked to Serpinf1 activity in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.
