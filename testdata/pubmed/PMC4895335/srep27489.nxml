However, the effects of these genes and their regulation of bacterial drug resistance in several mycobacterial species, including the fast-growing <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>, the pathogen <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. avium</italic> have not been clearly characterized. We identified Ms4022 (MSMEG_4022) as a novel TetR family regulator that activates the expression of seven transport-related genes and affects drug resistance in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Overexpression of Ms4022 inhibited <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> growth and enhanced mycobacterial resistance to the anti-tuberculosis drug rifampicin (RIF). By contrast, the Ms4022-deleted mycobacterial strain has shown sensitive to RIF. Ms4022 recognized three 19&#x02009;bp non-palindromic motifs containing a 9&#x02009;bp conserved region at their 5&#x02032; end and it directly regulated seven transport-related genes, which affects mycobacterial resistance to RIF. Overexpression of three of seven transport-related genes (Ms1448, Ms1613, and Ms5278) inhibited the growth of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. This study improves our understanding of the function of mycobacterial transport-related genes and their regulation of bacterial drug resistance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The occurrence and spread of bacterial drug resistance, especially multi-drug resistance (MDR), in several important human pathogens (e.g., <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>) pose a serious threat to human health worldwide. Recent studies have indicated that the existence of drug efflux systems, which can pump drugs out of bacterial cells and result in bacterial resistance to drugs, is one of the important causes of bacterial antibiotic resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. However, the regulatory mechanisms of bacterial drug resistance involving drug efflux remain unclear.</p><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (MTB), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), continues to be a major global health problem<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Several mycobacterial species have different efflux pump genes associated with resistance to multiple drugs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. For example, LfrA is a multidrug efflux pump and activates the multidrug efflux in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The <italic>iniBAC</italic> operon encodes a typical efflux pump and could function as an MDR pump system in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains frequently exhibit increased expression of this efflux system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Many drug transporter regulatory proteins, including activators and repressors, have been identified in recent years. TetR family transcription factors regulate diverse physiological functions in bacteria. They control physiological processes, such as catabolic pathways, biosynthesis of antibiotics, and osmotic stress, in the pathogenicity of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The members of this family are often employed as negative regulators that inhibit the expression of target genes. For example, EmrR in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and QacR in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> negatively regulate MDR pumps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.

Interestingly, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> is also a suitable model for the study of the regulatory mechanism of mycobacterial drug resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In particular, more than 500 potential regulatory factors and 600 transport-related genes are encoded by the genome of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (GenBank accession number CP000480). However, the physiological roles of these regulators and transport-related genes and their relationships with bacterial drug resistance remain unknown.</p><p>In this study, we characterize a new TetR family transcriptional factor, Ms4022, as a positive regulator in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Ms4022 activates the expression of seven transport-related genes and affects the RIF resistance and growth of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, the Ms4022-overexpressing strain (Ms/pMV261-Ms4022) grew slower than the control strain (Fig. 1B, left panel), and Ms/pMV261-Ms4022&#x02009;showed increased resistance to RIF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, right panel).

When the mixture of Ms4022 and its promoter was co-incubated with DNaseI, two protected regions of Ms4022 promoter were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The first region <underline>AATCAGCAC</underline>T<underline>GTG</underline>TG<underline>GATT</underline> extended from positions &#x02212;57 to &#x02212;39 (relative to the Ms4022 start codon).

Two defective palindromic motifs were separated by two nucleotides (AA). All three motifs had the similar sequence 5&#x02032; -AATCAGCAC -3&#x02032; in protected regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>).

The expressions of <italic>lacZ</italic> connected with all four promoters (Ms1448p, Ms4886p, Ms5051p, and Ms6909p) were down-regulated in Ms/&#x00394;Ms4022 compared with Ms/wt. However, the expressions of <italic>lacZ</italic> connected with the strong promoter <italic>hsp60</italic> had no difference in Ms/wt and Ms/&#x00394;Ms4022. Similar results were obtained when the promoter was substituted by the negative control promoter Ms4121p. Again, <italic>lacZ</italic> connected with the null promoter exhibited no signal of galactosidase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p><p>These results show that Ms4022 can function as a transcriptional activator and positively affect the expressions of transport-related genes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Seven transport-related genes overexpressing <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>is strains showed significant RIF resistance</title><p>We transformed the overexpression plasmids of 14 transport-related genes in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and detected the growth and drug susceptibility of these recombinant strains.

We proved that the overexpression of Ms4022 caused RIF resistance in <italic>M. smgmatis</italic> through elevated levels of transport-related genes.</p><p>The genomes of both fast-growing <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and pathogenic <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> encode many putative drug transporters and membrane proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Several regulators and transporters involved in mycobacterial multidrug resistance have been demonstrated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. For example, <italic>M. tuberculosis iniBAC</italic> is involved in the tolerance to INH and EMB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. A histone-like protein Lsr2 negatively regulate the expression of <italic>iniBAC</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In addition, LfrA was the first efflux pump described in <italic>M. smegmatis,</italic> belonging to the major facilitator family (MFS) protein. LfrA overexpression contributes to the resistance of fluoroquinolones. LfrR, a TetR family transcriptional repressor, inhibits the expression of LfrA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The deletion of <italic>lfrR</italic> resulted in resistance to several drugs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Usually, TetR family transcription factor binds a conserved palindromic sequence and represses the expression of target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Unlike LfrR, Ms4022 acts as an activator and recognizes three19&#x02009;bp non-palindromic sequence motifs (motif 1 from &#x02212;39 to &#x02212;57, motif 2 from &#x02212;238 to&#x02212;256 and motif 3 from &#x02212;258 to &#x02212;277) in its own promoter proved by EMSA and footprint assays. We got 315 potential target genes positively regulated by Ms4022. By analyzing the binding motif position of these genes, we found 95% (133/140, motif 1), 96% (130/136, motif 2) and 92% (68/74, motif 3) were outside the &#x02212;35 region which is the RNA polymerase recognition site. The binding of Ms4022 to promoters may located upstream of ribosomal binding site, and thus enhance the transcription of target genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. For this case, transcriptional factor usually functions as an activator. For example, Ms6564 is a TetR family activator broadly affects the expressions of diverse genes in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Compared with the conserved region in target genes&#x02019; motif, only 9&#x02009;bp shown high similarity. Therefore, the binding pattern of Ms4022 may be affected and regulated by its long C-terminal non-conserved region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). Ms4022 binds to those target promoters may favor the RNA polymerase to promote transcription of target genes.</p><p>In this study, we identified a TetR famlily regulator Ms4022 and seven transport related genes contributing drug resistance to RIF, but not to INH and EMB in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. They are Ms1448 (sulfate permease), Ms1613 (polar amino acid transport system permease), Ms2727 (glutamate transport system substrate-binding protein), Ms3310 (integral membrane protein), Ms5051 (major facilitator superfamily protein), Ms5278 (transmembrane protein), and Ms6909 (amino acid ABC transporter permease). The possible mechanism would be a substrate preference to RIF. Transport related genes always show preference to a certain type of substrates. Based on the range of substrates, transporters can be divided into two categories. One is multi-substrates efflux system which shows broad substrate specificity. The other is single-substrate efflux system which tends to transport structural analogs. It is possible that 7 target genes of Ms4022 belong to single-drug efflux systems. Specific transport proteins have also been reported. For example, <italic>E. coli</italic> TetB can extrude tetracycline and a narrow range of close structural analogs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, BC4707 show a more specific role in the efflux of norfloxacin, and MmpL7 is a INH efflux in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Drug-specific response transcription factors also exist. Such as, FurA, OhrR and Ms0535 showed specific drug resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In addition, Ms1448, Ms1613, and Ms5278 overexpressed strains could partially inhibit the growth of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. It appears that these target genes may be important in determining the RIF resistance of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> only when their expression is increased. Interestingly, a homologous protein of Ms4022, MAV_1977, was also found in the pathogen <italic>M. avium</italic>. Six transport-related genes (except Ms3310) have their homologs in pathogen <italic>M. avium</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Therefore, our findings in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> provided important clues for further understanding of the function of transport-related genes and their regulation of bacterial drug resistance in pathogenic mycobacteria. Unexpectedly, Ms4022 has no homolog in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The regulation of target genes remains to be identified in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>In sum, we presume that Ms4022 is a novel TetR family transcription factor that contributes to the RIF resistance of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of transport-related gene regulation and drug resistance in mycobacteria.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Liu, H. <italic>et al.</italic> Novel TetR family transcriptional factor regulates expression of multiple transport-related genes and affects rifampicin resistance in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis.
