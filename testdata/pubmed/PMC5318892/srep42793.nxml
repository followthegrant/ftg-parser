However, an effective means to assess the fate and distribution of transplanted cell sheets in a serial and noninvasive manner is still lacking. To investigate the feasibility of tracking Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) sheet <italic>in vivo</italic> using ultrasmall super-paramagnetic Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles (USPIO), canine ADSCs were cultured and incubated with USPIO and 0.75&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) for 12&#x02009;h. Labeling efficiency, cell viability, apoptotic cell rate were assessed to screen the optimum concentrations of USPIO for best labeling ADSCs. The results showed ADSCs were labeled by USPIO at an iron dose of 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml for a 12&#x02009;h incubation time, which can most efficiently mark cells and did not impair the cell survival, self-renewal, and proliferation capacity. USPIO-labeled ADSCs sheets can be easily and clearly detected <italic>in vivo</italic> and have persisted for at least 12 weeks. Our experiment confirmed USPIO was feasible for <italic>in vivo</italic> labeling of the ADSCs sheets with the optimal concentration of 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/ml and the tracing time is no less than 12 weeks.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Cell sheet technology has been widely applied in the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering for the past few years. In the absence of a biomaterial scaffold, it requires the non-enzymatic harvesting of cultured cells and creates a contiguous sheeting structure with extracellular matrix (ECM) and intact cell-cell junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Because they are highly bioactive and can be easily handled and manipulated, cell sheets can be used to build 3D soft tissues or organs and avoid the defects such as significant cell loss due to trypsinization and difficulty controlling the location of the transplanted cells caused by direct cell injection. The time and thickness of cell sheet formation are closely related to the capability of cell proliferation and cell type.</p><p>Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are one of the most common stem cell types to be applied in autoplastic transplantation. Compared with other mesenchymal stem cell types isolated from cartilage and bone marrow, ADSCs possess the highest proliferation potential and exhibit high tolerance to serum deprivation-induced cell apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Adipose tissue contains a high content of ADSCs and quantities of 0.7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> ADSCs can be obtained per gram of adipose tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Furthermore, adipose tissue is abundant in body and there is no effect on the body function after removing a small amount of fatty tissue. Recently, ADSCs sheet transplantation has shown the potential to be used for repair and reconstruction of damaged tissues and organs, including myocardial infarction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, diabetic ulcers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and full-thickness defect wound healing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. However, an effective means to assess the fate and distribution of transplanted cell sheets in a serial and noninvasive manner is still lacking.</p><p>To track cell sheet survival and migration <italic>in vivo</italic>, it is important to be able to provide serial images from weeks to months after transplantation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers an established and high-resolution approach to dynamically and persistently detect a small fraction of labeled cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and vivo. Thus it can be used as an ideal tracer method. At present, there are two main groups of paramagnetic contrast agents used for MRI, gadolinium (Gd) based chelates and iron oxide (Fe) based particles. Gadolinium rhodamine dextran (GRID) is the most commonly used MR contrast agents in clinical practice. However, GRID significantly increases the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and affects cell proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Iron is a basic element in cellular metabolism, and involved in a series of crucial physiological events, such as oxygen transport, mitochondrial respiration, and DNA synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Many studies have shown labeling with optimized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) does not trigger cell apoptosis, and does not impair cell survival or proliferation capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. SPIOs are divided into three main categories according to different hydrodynamic diameters, including oral SPIO, standard SPIO, and ultrasmall SPIO (USPIO). For USPIO, the hydrodynamic diameter size of nanoparticle is less than 50&#x02009;nm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. MR signal enhancement is closely associated with particle size, and the smaller iron oxide provided greater signal enhancement and prolonged signal enhancement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. From early reports, USPIO has been evaluated as an MR contrast agent for imaging cells and scaffolds <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Nevertheless, there has been no report on USPIO-labeled cell sheets and their use to further obtain non-invasive imaging information on transplanted USPIO-labeled cell sheet <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, we chose ADSCs as seed cells and describe a simple protocol to label ADSCs sheets using USPIO at optimized concentration and demonstrate the feasibility of noninvasive imaging of labeled ADSCs sheet after transplantation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Materials</title><p>Ferric citrate, ferrous (II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O, 99%) and NaOH were purchased from by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

The USPIO nanoparticles were prepared by a hydrothermal method using FeSO<sub>4</sub>&#x000b7;7H<sub>2</sub>O, ferric citrate and ascorbic acid as raw materials. In brief, 10&#x02009;mL FeSO<sub>4</sub>&#x000b7;7H<sub>2</sub>O solution was added to a 30&#x02009;mL ferric citrate solution in a molar ratio of 2:1 under strong stirring at room temperature. 0.6&#x02009;mmol ascorbic acid as antioxidant was dissolved in the mixture, and then the pH of the solution was brought to 10 using a 1.5&#x02009;M NaOH solution. Subsequently, the obtained precursors were poured into a 50&#x02009;mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was kept at 200&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;h and then returned to ambient temperature. The resulting solution was dialyzed by MWCO 14&#x02009;kDa of dialysis bag for 24&#x02009;h. To remove bacteria, the above Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticle solution was then filtered through a 0.22&#x02009;&#x003bc;m nylon filter. The crystallinity of the synthesized USPIO was determined with an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku, Japan) using Cu K&#x003b1; radiation at 1.5418&#x02009;&#x000c5; at a scanning rate of 5&#x000b0; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Zeta potential measrements were carried out using a NICOMP 380 ZLS &#x003b6; potential/particle sizer (PSS Nicomp, USA). Transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit Twin, Czech Republic) was used to observe the crystal structure and sizes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell cultures</title><p>As a common large experimental animal, canines were used in our study for abundant subcutaneous fat, their similarity to human physiology and strong disease resistance.

After general anesthesia, primary ADSCs were obtained from fat tissue in the groin of beagle dogs, then digested with 0.1% collagenase I for 1&#x02009;h at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The digested cells were collected after filtration through a cell strainer. The primary ADSCs were maintained in low glucose Dulbecco modified Eagles (DMEM, Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, NY, USA), 100&#x02009;U/mL penicillin (Gibco, NY, USA), 100&#x02009;mg/mL streptomycin sulfate (Gibco, NY, USA). The culture medium was replaced every 2&#x02013;3 days.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell sheets preparation and labeling</title><p>Canine ADSCs at passages 2 were grown in 12-well plate until cell growth reached 80&#x02013;90% confluence. The polyamine poly-L-lysine (PLL) hydrobromide (Sigma, St Louis, Mo, 175,000&#x02009;MW) was used as the transfection agent. Canine ADSCs were incubated with USPIO and 0.75&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml PLL. These culture media containing the USPIO-PLL complex were added to the ADSCs such that the final concentration of Fe in USPIO was 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL, 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL, 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL, 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL, 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, unlabeled ADSCs were used as control. The cell cultures were incubated for 12&#x02009;h at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. After incubation for 12&#x02009;h, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and further cultured in low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For cell sheet labeling, ADSCs at 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup> per cm<sup>2</sup> were seeded in a 60&#x02009;mm Temperature-Responsive Cell Culture Surface (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) until the cell growth reached 90%-100% confluence (2&#x02013;3 days). Then, the optimum concentration of USPIO was used to label the ADSCs. Vitamin C catalyzes the hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues in the collagen polypeptide chains, allowing interaction of the collagen subunits, adding structural stability to the collagen fibers, thus it plays a vital role in the production of collagen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In this study, the secretion of extracellular matrix were stimulated with 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL vitamin C (Sigma, St.Louis, USA) for 3 days, and then 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL vitamin C (Sigma, St Louis, USA) for 18 days to form the cell sheet.

Cells were fixed for 15&#x02009;minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then incubated for 25&#x02013;30&#x02009;minutes with 10% potassium ferrocyanide, rewashed twice with PBS, and counterstained with nuclear fast red for 10&#x02009;minutes. Cells containing intracytoplasmic blue granules were defined to be Prussian blue staining positive (PB-positive). Cells labeled with varying concentrations of USPIO were trypsinized and washed 5 times with PBS, then detached, counted and resuspended in a 37% HCl solution. The iron content per cell was obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS, MICI, Suisse). Three replicates at each concentration were measured for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cellular cytotoxicity assessment</title><p>CCK-8 is a sensitive non-radioactive colorimetric assay for detecting the number of viable cells in cytotoxicity and cell proliferation assays<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were used to observe the crystal structure and sizes. TEM images showed the monodisperse USPIO nanoparticles were approximately spherical with an average diameter of 10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) of a representative USPIO was observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>. The lattice distance was measured to be 0.486&#x02009;nm, consistent with the standard cubic Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The USPIO were further characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The XRD diffraction peaks of the as-synthesized USPIO were also shown to be due to the cubic Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> structure (JCPDS no.19&#x02013;0629). The excellent saturation moment of the USPIO nanoparticles was ~71&#x02009;emu&#x02009;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, indicating that the synthesized USPIO are superparamagnetic, which facilitate the magnetic resonance imaging of medical diagnosis. The hydrodynamic size of nanoparticles in water was approximately 10.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.169&#x02009;nm (PDI&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.122), which was slightly bigger than the size in TEM. It may be attributed to the hydration of the ligand on the surface of USPIO in ultrapure water, in accordance with the published literature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p><p>USPIO nanoparticles have attracted considerable interest due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability and excellent magnetic properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. An ideal tracer agent requires high detection sensitivity while not having an influence on the activity of cells. There is considerable differences in the doses of USPIO reported in literature. Chen <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> showed labeling endothelial are progenitor cells with USPIO at a concentration of 28&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL for 24&#x02009;h was nearly 100% efficient and did not affect cell viability. Paik <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> showed that iron nanoparticles used at a concentration of 1% were non-toxic to the bone marrow cells and both the secretion of cytokines and expression of cell surface markers will not be affected. Oude-Engberink <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> confirmed that incubating human monocytes with USPIOs (1000&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL) results in efficient labeling detectable on MR images and does not affect cellular activity and activation markers such as cytokine production and cell migration. Furthermore, it has been proven that iron nanoparticles induce a significant increase in the production of ROS and subsequent microtubule remodeling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Overproduction of ROS have been shown to be associated with various pathologic changes, such as cell structural damage, carcinogenesis, inflammation, radiation and reperfusion injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The uptake of iron oxide particles by cells is highly dependent on the cell types, cell size, surface charge, and coating of the particles. There is no single standard dosage that is appropriate for all cell types, thus we firstly explore the optimum concentration of USPIO for canine ADSCs labeling. As a cationic polymer, PLL can effectively boost the intracellular uptake of the nanoparticles through electrostatic interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Compared with iron oxide alone, the iron nanoparticles and PLL mixture is more effective in achieving desired relaxation time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Various concentrations of PLL have been used in the literature reports, from 0.375&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL to 1.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Excessive PLL can form toxic aggregates and inhibit the nano-sized iron oxide incorporation in the cells, thus we chose a moderate concentration of PLL of 0.75&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL. In this study, the zeta potential of 0.75&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL PLL was detected as 5.33&#x02009;mV, and it gradually dropped from 4.81&#x02009;mV to 2.79&#x02009;mV with mixing the increasing concentrations of USPIO from 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL to 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL. The positive lysine charges of the PLL/USPIO complexes balance the negative phosphate charges on the cell membrane, and further enhance the cell endocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, which could contribute to the iron nanoparticles uptake and obviously reduce the dosage of USPIO.</p><p>The iron content per cell increased with increasing incubation time, and reached saturation at 12&#x02009;h of incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Data 2</xref>). After incubation for 12&#x02009;h with varying concentrations of USPIO nanoparticles, the labeling efficiency was detected by Prussian blue staining, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>. The USPIO-labeled ADSCs exhibited an increasingly strong blue staining with the increasing concentrations of USPIO from 5&#x02013;100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL. Intracellular blue spots represent spread USPIO nanoparticles and mostly concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm. ICP-MS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref> showed the average iron content was 0.17&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.036&#x02009;pg/cell for 0&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL, 5.29&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.225&#x02009;pg/cell for 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL, 6.63&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.117&#x02009;pg/cell for 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL, 17.07&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.325&#x02009;pg/cell for 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL, 28.48&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.806&#x02009;pg/cell for 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL,42.42&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.843&#x02009;pg/cell for 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL. This indicated the iron content per cell is proportional to the iron concentrations in a range of 5&#x02013;100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).</p><p>CCK-8 assay was used to detect the proliferation of USPIO-labeled cells and assess the cellular cytotoxicity of USPIO. The growth curves labeled cells with varying concentration of USPIO and unlabeled cells ware shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>. The data indicate, compared with unlabeled cells, no cellular cytotoxicity due to USPIO was found in the iron concentration range of 5&#x02013;50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml and cells incubated with PLL alone, p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05. The OD value of 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL labeled cells was significantly lower than unlabeled cells (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). These results suggested that USPIO was not cytotoxic with good biocompatibility to ADSCs with a final iron concentration of less than 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml.</p><p>Furthermore, annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was performed to analyze the proportion of apoptotic cells in the varying concentration of USPIO-labeled and unlabeled cells. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. The proportion of apoptotic cells in the USPIO-labeled cell samples was (2.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.50)% for 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml, (2.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.32)% for 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml, (3.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.36)% for 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml, (3.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.25)% for 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml, (8.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.75)% for 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml, whereas the proportion of apoptotic cells in the unlabeled cell (0&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml) samples was (2.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.42)% and cells incubated with PLL alone was (2.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.46)%. Although the populations of apoptotic cells increased with concentration of USPIO, no significant difference was observed between the unlabeled and labeled cells at an iron concentration of 5&#x02013;50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml, p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05. Furthermore, the difference between unlabeled cells and cells incubated with PLL alone was not found to be statistically significant, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.892. Compared with unlabeled cells, a statistically significant increase of apoptosis rate was apparent at 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/ml concentrations, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01. Thus, according to the labeling efficiency, cellular cytotoxicity and cellular apoptosis rate assessment, we chose to use USPIO at a Fe concentration of 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml for a 12&#x02009;h incubation, which can most efficiently mark cells and did not impair the cell survival, self-renewal, and proliferation capacity, and this concentration was screened to use for further experiments.</p><p>After 12&#x02009;h incubation with an iron concentration of 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/ml, the uptake of USPIO particles into the cells was investigated using transmission electron microscopy. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>&#x02013;D, similar to unlabeled ADSCs, the cellular structure and morphology of USPIO-labeled ADSCs were integral and clear, and the cell membrane did not appear to be damaged. USPIO was taken into cell through a membrane adsorption process and subsequent intracellular (non-nuclear) localization is found in endosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Dark black spots indicate USPIO particles. A fraction of USPIO particles were found to be adhered to the cell plasma membrane and with no distribution in the nucleus, while most of them were incorporated into intracellular and aggregated in large lysosomes.</p><p>Several studies have suggested labeling stem cells with iron oxide in an appropriate concentration does not adversely affect the cell differentiation ability, including chondrogenic differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, myogenic differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, adipogenic differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> and neural differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. However, the biological effects of iron nanoparticles on osteogenic differentiation of stem cells remain controversial. Xiao <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> demonstrated that superparamagnetic iron oxide could promote osteogenic differentiation of rat ADSCs, while Fan <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> showed the osteogenic and adipogenic potential of ADSCs were inhibited after SPIO labeling. One possible reason is that SPIOs can influence cell mobilization, involve the activation of relevant signaling pathway and further affect osteogenic differentiation ability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. High iron nanoparticle loads could have negative effects on cell viability and differentiation, thus it is important to choose the appropriate concentration. In our study, the USPIO-labeled ADSCs maintained a good differentiation potential and no significant difference was observed in the myogenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>), osteogenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6E</xref>) and adipogenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6F</xref>) differentiation ability <italic>in vitro</italic> between the USPIO-labeled and unlabeled groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>To test the detectability in MRI, 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> varying concentrations of USPIO-labeled and unlabeled ADSCs were placed in 1.5&#x02009;mL tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref>) and were detected as strongly hypointense areas on T2-weighted images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7B</xref>). A good correlation between the image grey-scale value and the concentrations of USPIO in the MR images was observed. Lighter gray represents lower iron concentrations and darker gray represents higher iron concentrations. There are significant differences in the gray value among varying concentrations of USPIO. Moreover, the gray difference can be easily identified by the naked eye at concentrations greater than or equal to 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/ml. These results indicated that MRI can efficiently detect USPIO-labeled ADSCs and that the intensity of the signal is proportional to the concentrations of USPIO.</p><p>Vitamin C was added to culture medium to accelerate native ECM secretion and generate a three dimensional tissue-like and contiguous cell sheets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Various types of ECM and membrane proteins penetrate into the cell sheets and play a role as adhesive agents to limit cell distribution and migration. Thus cell sheets are intact whole before and after transplantation. Furthermore, MR imaging is applicable to continuously track the migration and location of transplanted cells, even for a small number of labeled cells (5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup> to 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> or single cell images<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. For cell sheets, the cell number is very large. The number of initial seeding cells is 1.05&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> cells per sheet in our experiments. The characteristics of large quantities of cells are favorable for detection of USPIO-labeled cell sheet by MRI imaging. For USPIO, the effect of MR contrast agents is not observed directly on the image, but the change of the relaxation rate of water protons is detectable by MRI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Thus, iron oxide nanoparticles are seen as hypointensity or negative contrast on T2-weighted and T2*-weighted images and often referred to as &#x0201c;negative&#x0201d; contrast agents. <italic>In vitro</italic> MR imaging showed, compared with unlabeled cells or PBS, a visible hypointense signal can be provided at the concentrations of 25&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/mL.</p><p>For <italic>in vivo</italic> MR imaging, the USPIO-labeled cell sheet &#x0201c;pellets&#x0201d; implants were visible as a hypointense area at the transplantation site and three-dimensional images could be further provided. Several studies have suggested the use of iron oxide nanoparticles <italic>via</italic> cell labeling as an effective MR contrast for detecting grafted cells and tissue over long times in animal experiments. Bulte <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> showed SPIO-labeled oligodendroglial progenitors can be readily detected <italic>in vivo</italic> for 6 weeks after transplantation. Neri <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> proved that low numbers of viable SPIO-labeled human neural precursor cells (5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>3</sup> to 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup>) could be efficiently detected in the adult murine brain after transplantation, and it could be tracked for at least 1 month <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, Guzman <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> detected the targeted migration and distribution of SPIO-labeled clusters of cells up to 18 weeks. For monitoring of cell sheet transplantation, we further localize USPIO-labeled cell sheet by MRI after transplantation in the subcutaneous area of nude mice for at least 12 weeks. At 1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after transplantation into the subcutaneous area of nude mice, we explored whether USPIO-labeled ADSCs sheet &#x0201c;pellets&#x0201d; could be localized by MRI, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7C</xref>. One week after implantation, regions of hypointense signal in T2 images were found in the transplantation sites of 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/ml USPIO-labeled ADSCs sheet &#x0201c;pellets&#x0201d; and no MRI signals were detected when similar volume unlabeled ADSCs sheet &#x0201c;pellets&#x0201d; were transplanted. The signal was visualized up to 4 weeks and even 12 weeks after transplantation. Thus, our result showed USPIO-labeled ADSCs sheets can be easily and clearly detected <italic>in vivo</italic> and has persisted for at least 12 weeks. However, compared with 1 week after implantation, grey-scale value and area of hypointense signal nearly remain the same at 4 weeks after implantation and deceased at 12 weeks.</p><p>Histological analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8A</xref> revealed that USPIO particles were a granular brown substance which was located mainly in the cytoplasm and there was no difference in cell morphology between labeled and unlabeled cells in the HE stained section. Prussian Blue staining revealed positive stained granules exclusively in the transplants of USPIO-labeled cells and presented an even distribution within the cell sheet. However, the blue-stained iron particles in the cytoplasm decrease gradually from week 1 to week 12 when these were transplanted into subcutaneous area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8B</xref>). Signal intensity was well correlated with iron accumulation. In our study, over 12 weeks the signal intensity of USPIO-labeled cell sheet reduced gradually with time, which was also proven by Prussian Blue staining. We analyzed the possible cause of the changes of signal intensity, including: 1) A fraction of the USPIO-labeled cells gradually migrating out of the cell sheet. 2) The iron particles in the magnetic labeled cells can be passed to offspring cells, and the concentration of iron particles can be diluted and decrease during cell division. 3) Iron oxide loading has been shown proved to increase activity of lysosomal cathepsin D, and the latter induces the cellular iron to gradually degrade in lysosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Although most of the iron particles remains intact in the endosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, some amount of the nano-sized iron oxide can be released from the labeled cell by exocytosis with time.</p><p>In addition, the osteogenic, adipogenic and myogenic differentiation were measured to evaluate the cell differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8C</xref>). The result showed, apart from brown iron particle deposited within USPIO-labeled cell sheets, no spontaneous cell differentiation towards bone, fat and muscle was observed in both USPIO-labeled and unlabeled ADSCs sheets. Our study certified the feasibility of tracking ADSCs sheet with USPIO <italic>in vivo</italic> for a long time (12 weeks), however, due to the xenoplastic transplantation of ADSCs sheet, it is hard to detect the cell migration in this study, and further studies may focus on the cell sheet migration towards deep anatomical sites in homoplastic transplantation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the ADSCs sheet can be effectively labeled with 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g Fe/ml USPIO and 0.75&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL PLL.
