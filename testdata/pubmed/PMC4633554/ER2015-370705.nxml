Introduction</title><p>
There are concrete evidences to prove that numerous environmental toxicants, including lead, have potential to induce neurotoxicity by their strong interference in the neurotransmission function of the central nervous system [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Lead nitrate is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Lead (Pb; Latin: plumbum, atomic number 82) is another ubiquitous toxic metal detectable practically in all phases of the inert environment and biological systems [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Lead is frequently used in the production of batteries, metal products (solder and pipes), ammunition, and devices to shield X-rays leading to its exposure to the people working in these industries. Use of lead in gasoline, paints and ceramic products, caulking, and pipe solder has been dramatically reduced in recent years because of health concerns. The most susceptible population to lead poisoning is children, particularly soldiers, infants in neonatal periods, and the fetus [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Lead poisoning (also known as saturnism, plumbism, Devon colic, or painter's colic) is a medical condition caused by increased levels of lead in the blood [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>This metal does not have any known useful function in the human body and produces harmful effects once it enters the body through inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Lead replaces other useful divalent metal ions involved in key physiological functions of the body and interferes with the cholinergic systems resulting in impairments in central nervous system including cognitive behavior [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Lead in the chemical form of lead nitrate is a potential oxidant and recognized as a carcinogenic element to humans. Due to its hazardous nature, the limited applications of lead nitrate are under constant scrutiny. Other industrial applications of lead included heat stabilization in nylon and polyesters, and in coatings of photothermographic paper. Around the year 2000, lead nitrate has begun to be used in gold cyanidation. Lead is generally more toxic and it binds readily to thiol groups of proteins/peptides and tends to disrupt their functions by inactivation or precipitation [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7), also known as AChE or acetylhydrolase, is a hydrolase that catalyses hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (Ach). AChE is found mainly at neuromuscular junctions and cholinergic brain synapses, where its activity serves to terminate synaptic transmission. It belongs to carboxyl esterase family of enzymes. It is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is then exported towards the cellular surface, where its different molecular/globular forms may be anchored in plasma membrane, attached to the basal lamina (asymmetric collagen-tailed forms), or secreted as soluble molecules (nonglobular) forms [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is reported that dimeric (G) AChE forms are present in the human erythrocytes [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Erythrocyte AChE has been found to be firmly attached to the membrane components and therefore it is more difficult to solubilize than brain [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The most widely adopted solubilization methods for mammalian brain AChE have involved the application of detergents, particularly Triton X-100, a nonionic detergent [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. AChE has been widely exploited as a primary target of action by organophosphorus compounds such as nerve agents [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As a reliable indicator, it is used in the diagnosis of poisoning caused by reversible and irreversible inhibitors including heavy metals and pesticides. The proper binding mechanism of the ACh with AChE has been well documented by kinetics as well as molecular modeling studies with different inhibitors.</p><p>Lead induced neurotoxicity in the people engaged in different occupations and exposed to this heavy metal has received wide attention but very little studies have been carried out to monitor occupational neurotoxicity directly using biochemical methods. Since AChE in erythrocytes is one of the typical extra neural AChE enzymes and exhibits similarities in its several properties with that of neuronal enzyme, we have used it as a surrogate biomarker to assess the lead mediated neurotoxicity and the mechanism of its action on the enzyme<italic> in vitro</italic>. In present study, the enzyme has been characterized to demonstrate its cellular localization and biophysical and biochemical properties with special reference to interaction of lead with enzyme protein leading to alterations in its biochemical functions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Bovine serum albumin, phosphate buffer salts (sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate and disodium hydrogen phosphate) were obtained from Fisher Scientific and Folin and Ciocalteu's Phenol reagent was from Spectrochem Pvt.

Preparation of Ghosts</title><p>Human blood sample was collected from a healthy 24-year-old male not exposed to radiation, drugs, or any other antioxidant supplementation, including vitamins, by venipuncture, into an EDTA coated vial and was centrifuged at 3000&#x02009;rpm for 5&#x02009;min at 4&#x000b0;C for the removal of plasma. The erythrocytes were washed thrice with cold 2x phosphate buffer saline (20&#x02009;mM phosphate buffer containing 274&#x02009;mM NaCl and 5.4&#x02009;mM KCl; pH 7.4) and centrifuged.

Then the erythrocytes were centrifuged for 7-8 times with the hypotonic phosphate buffer at 9000&#x02009;rpm for 10&#x02009;min at 4&#x000b0;C to get the ghost (erythrocyte membranes) at the bottom of the tube. This preparation (ghost cells after the loss of haemoglobin) was treated with Triton X-100 (0.2%, v/v; prepared in phosphate buffer 50&#x02009;mM, pH 7.4) to solubilize membrane bound enzyme, AChE.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3.

Human Ghost (as described above) was homogenized by applying 3 strokes, each of 30&#x02009;sec in the presence of precooled 50&#x02009;mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 to produce homogenate. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000&#x02009;g for 10&#x02009;min at 4&#x02013;6&#x000b0;C and the clear supernatant was used for the AChE assays.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4.

Discussion</title><p>AChE is responsible for transmission interruption of normal nerve transmission at the synapse by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Ach) to acetic acid and choline in order to avoid undesired stimulation of nervous system. The reports on the presence of lead and its adverse effects in the occupants exposed to this heavy metal while working in various lead infested environments make it imperative to study the assessment of the impact of lead on the activity of AChE responsible for regulating the cholinergic functions and physiological activities of humans [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Continuously for about two decades in past from now the studies on dose-response relationship concerning lead mediated neurotoxicity were carried out using only neurobehavioral tests [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or electrophysiological measurements [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] on the pretext of the unavailability of the cells or tissues of human's central nervous system, lack of sensitive neurochemical indicators, and also the ethical considerations. The peripheral tissues such as erythrocytes and other blood cells exhibiting some components of neurotransmission such as AChE and Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> ATPases from erythrocytes, adrenergic and muscarinic receptors from lymphocytes, and adrenergic receptors from platelets [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], however, were found to act as the most viable alternatives to study lead mediated neurotoxicity in humans using direct biochemical methods without facing a lot of hassles as mentioned above.</p><p>In this study, the activity of AChE was determined by extraction of the enzyme protein from human erythrocytes. This enzyme has been extracted by other workers using other detergents as well as low concentration of NaCl (0.14&#x02009;M) [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. They have shown that both hydrophobic and electrostatic forces are involved in binding of the AChE to human erythrocyte membrane. NaCl probably weakens the electrostatic bonding with membrane proteins that shields some of the enzyme from the action of the detergent, and in this way NaCl allows a more effective attack of the detergent on the membrane to solubilize more membrane bound acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, some AChE was not released from the membrane even by using the Triton X-100 as well as mixtures of Triton X-100 and NaCl, suggesting that either it is more tightly bound to the membrane or it is shielded with such layers of macromolecules which are ineffective towards the action of Triton X-100 and NaCl although its amount was much less. AChE from erythrocytes exhibited maximum activity at pH 7.4 and 37&#x000b0;C temperature. Similar observations have also been reported by other workers [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This enzyme exhibited Michaelis-Menten constant (<italic>K</italic>

The effect of many other heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium, copper, and lead on the activity of human erythrocytes AChE has been reported recently by Ademuyiwa et al. [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] in the people who were consistently exposed to lead during different occupations. The estimation of IC<sub>50</sub> value of lead for AChE of human erythrocytes, however, has not been conducted<italic> in vitro</italic> by any other worker elsewhere. The results from present study also demonstrated that lead at a concentration of 0.25&#x02009;mM caused sharp decrease in the enzyme activity in time dependent manner at room temperature (26 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C), the <italic>t</italic>

<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> value being 3.6&#x02009;mM, thereby reducing both the <italic>V</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and substrate binding affinity of the enzyme. As shown in the following reaction scheme, lead as an uncompetitive inhibitor [I] has opportunity only to reversibly combine with the enzyme [E]-substrate [S] complex [ES] and not to the free enzyme. Lead is negatively influencing both the <italic>V</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and the <italic>K</italic>
<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> values for the enzyme. The decrease in <italic>V</italic>
<sub>max</sub> values occurs because some of the substrate is always bound in ESI complexes where it cannot be converted into product, decreasing the effective dissociation constant for the substrate. It results in a concomitant decrease in the <italic>K</italic>
<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> value as well. Since the <italic>V</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and the <italic>K</italic>
<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> are decreased by the same factor, the ratio of <italic>K</italic>
<sub><italic>m</italic></sub>/<italic>V</italic>
<sub>max</sub> remains the same and gives rise to two parallel lines corresponding to the uninhibited and inhibited reactions in Lineweaver-Burk's double reciprocal plot. No such studies have been carried out by other workers elsewhere: <disp-formula id="eq1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mtable style="T1"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x027fa;</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mover><mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02191;</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x02193;</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:munder><mml:mo>&#x027f9;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math></disp-formula>The reaction scheme shows mechanism of uncompetitive inhibition of enzyme. The &#x02212;I and +I indicate the dissociation of inhibitor from ESI complex and association of inhibitor with ES complex, respectively.</p><p>Lead is known to exert its action in the biological systems through binding with the sulfhydryl groups of the proteins [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. AChE from human erythrocytes does not contain any free thiol group for this purpose. Thus, the strong inhibition of this enzyme by lead as observed in the present study is noteworthy. The uncompetitive mode of inhibition by lead indicates that it has some interaction sites either in the catalytic pocket or on the surface of the enzyme protein, which needs to be ascertained by further detailed investigation using suitable bioinformatics tools.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>The AChE present in membrane bound forms in the human erythrocyte could be solubilized employing a nonionic detergent, Triton X-100. The drastic inhibition of AChE activity in human erythrocyte by lead nitrate suggests that the compound even at low concentration (<italic>K</italic>
<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> 3.6&#x02009;mM) is extremely neurotoxic to the mammals. The striking feature of lead was its potential to decrease enzyme activity in time dependent manner as the presence of its 0.25&#x02009;mM concentration resulted in loss of 60% enzyme activity in just 10&#x02009;min. Though the exact mechanism of action of lead on erythrocytes AChE is not known by this study it is evident that this heavy metal inhibits the enzyme in an uncompetitive manner and hence adversely influences both the optimum velocity of reaction (<italic>V</italic>
<sub>max</sub>) and the extent of enzyme-substrate binding affinity (<italic>K</italic>
<sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) together. Thus, the results of this study as well as those available from other workers suggest that AChE from human erythrocytes might be exploited as a putative indicator to monitor lead induced perturbations in the cholinergic system of human population actively occupied in lead infested environment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Vivek Kumar Gupta is grateful to the University Grant Commission, New Delhi, for providing research scholarship for this work at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Allahabad, India.
