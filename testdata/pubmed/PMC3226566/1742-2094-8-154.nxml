PD was first described by James Parkinson in 1817, and the aetiology of PD still remains unknown. However, emerging investigations suggest that multiple factors, both genetic and acquired, contribute to the loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra (SN) of these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Among these culprits, accumulated evidence suggests that neuroinflammation, which is characterised by activation of microglia and subsequent production of proinflammatory cytokines, may play an important role in the neurodegenerative process in PD. Activated microglia are found in the SN of mesencephalon in the brain of PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and of parkinsonian animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Molecules related to neuroinflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2;, interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;), and superoxide, have been found co-localized with microglia in brain, and in cerebrospinal fluid and serum of PD patients as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Taken together, those previous studies suggest that persistent activation of microglia is dynamically involved in the disease's progression.</p><p>CD200R, an important inhibitory receptor present on microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], actively maintains microglia in a quiescent state through its interaction with CD200, a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Recent publications have demonstrated that disruption of CD200-CD200R engagement can cause abnormal activation of microglia and consequent pathological changes. Microglia in CD200-deficient (CD200<sup>-/-</sup>) mice exhibit more characteristics of activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. They are aggregated, less ramified and have shorter glial processes, as well as a disordered arrangement and increased expression of CD11b and CD45. Moreover, this increased microglial response is substantiated by enhanced expression of Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC II), TNF-&#x003b1; and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, CD200<sup>-/- </sup>mice display earlier onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, preventing CD200-CD200R interactions with CD200R-blocking antibodies also induces augmented microglial activation in EAE rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Conversely, CD200<sup>-/- </sup>mice receiving exogenous CD200R agonist, including CD200 antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or an agonist anti-CD200R antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], are resistant to the induction of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). All of these findings suggest that decreased interaction between CD200 and CD200R is related to increased activation of microglia. Interestingly, decreased expression of CD200 and CD200R have also been found in hippocampus and inferior temporal gyrus of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Down-regulation of CD200 has also been detected in brain of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. These results suggest that a deficient CD200-CD200R system may be involved in the progression of various neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our previous study revealed altered regulation of CD200R in monocyte-derived macrophages from PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. We also found that blocking CD200-CD200R engagement dramatically exacerbates dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a primary neuron/microglia co-culture system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus, further in vivo evidence is needed to thoroughly elucidate the role of malfunction of CD200-CD200R signalling in the pathogenesis of PD. In the present study, we used a CD200R blocking antibody to destroy CD200-CD200R engagement in hemiparkinsonian rats, induced by 6-OHDA injection. We found that the impairment of CD200-CD200R interaction resulted in increased microglial activation and corresponding neurodegeneration in this animal model of PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Specific monoclonal antibodies against CD200R (CD200R-blocking antibody, BAb), CD11b, MHC II and isotype control mouse IgG1 (Control antibody, CAb) were obtained from Serotec (Indianapolis, IN, USA).

When the animals were deeply anesthetized, they were placed in a stereotactic apparatus. Subsequently, the rats were injected with BAb (1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l, 5 ul for each site) or CAb (1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l, 5 ul for each site) into the right striatum (anterior lesion site: AP: 1.0 mm anterior to the bregma, L: 2.6 mm from the midline, D: 4.5 mm from the dura; posterior lesion site: AP: 0.3 mm posterior to the bregma, L: 3.5 mm from the midline, D: 4.5 mm from the dura). The sham groups were injected with vehicle (10 mM PBS, 5 &#x003bc;l for each site, Veh). The next day, each group was injected with 6-OHDA (4 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l in 0.9% saline with 0.02% ascorbic acid, 2 &#x003bc;l for each site) into the right ascending medial forebrain bundle (MFB) (one 4.2 mm posterior to bregma, 1.2 mm lateral to the midline, and 7.8 mm below the dura, and another 4.4 mm posterior to bregma, 1.7 mm lateral to the midline, and 7.8 mm below the dura). The microinjection coordinates used were obtained from a rat brain atlas by Paxinos and Watson. The injection was made at a rate of 1 &#x003bc;l/min using a 10 &#x003bc;l Hamilton syringe with a 26-gauge needle. At the end of each injection, the syringe needle was left in place for 5 min, and then was slowly withdrawn to prevent reflux of the solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>At 21 days post 6-OHDA-injection, animals were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused through the aorta with 150 ml of 0.9% saline, followed by 250 ml of a cold fixative consisting 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mM phosphate buffer (PB). Brains were then dissected out (3-4 mm in thickness) and postfixed for 24 hours with paraformaldehyde in 100 mM PB before placed into 30% sucrose solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 24-72 hours at 4&#x000b0;C. Brains were then cryosectioned coronally on a Leica1650 cryostat (cut thickness: 25 &#x003bc;m) with a random start, and including sections before and after both anatomical regions to confirm the entire structure was quantified. Sections were collected serially throughout the SN and placed into PBS for further experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Free-floating sections were pretreated with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.2-7.5) for 10 min at RT (60 rpm) to block endogenous peroxidase activity, then washed with 0.1 M PBS for 3 times. The tissue was then blocked with diluted blocking serum (Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with the primary antibody to TH (mouse anti-TH, 1:4000, Sigma), CD11b (mouse anti-CD11b, 1:1000, serotec) or MHC II (mouse anti-MHC II, 1:1000, serotec) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The following day the sections were washed and then incubated with diluted biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. The secondary antibody was amplified using avidin-biotin complex (Vector laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. Finally the sections were developed with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetra-hydrochloride (Vector Laboratories). Sections were then mounted onto glass slides and dried overnight. The next day the slides were passed through a gradient of ethyl alcohol and xylene to dehydrate the tissue. The slides were then coverslipped using permount mounting medium.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell quantification</title><p>Unbiased stereological estimates of DA (TH-positive cell) neuron numbers were performed using StereoInvestigator analysis software (MicroBrightField, Williston, VT), combined with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope, and the optical fractionator method according to previously published reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Boundaries in the SN were defined according to previously defined anatomical analysis in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and cells were counted from every sixth 25-&#x003bc;m section (~24 sections) along the entire SN (to ensure coefficient of errors &#x0003c;0.1, the rostral-caudal length of the SN was 4 mm), by investigators blinded to treatment history, with a 60 &#x000d7; objective. In brief, optical dissectors (area of counting frame, 64,000 mm<sup>3</sup>; guard height, 2 &#x003bc;m; spaced 300 &#x003bc;m apart in the x-direction, and 200 &#x003bc;m apart in the y-direction) were applied to each section in the series throughout the entire SN (including pars reticulata and compacta; estimates are reflective of two sides; n = 5 for each group). We show the percent of neurons remaining on the ipsilateral side compared to those on the intact contralateral side. Values are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; S.E.M. of all animals in each group.</p><p>Microglial quantification similarly used adjacent (8 sections) serial sections. An observer blind to sample identity counted numbers of CD11b-immunoreactive (CD11b-ir) positive cells in the SN on each side (Nikon microscope at a 40 &#x000d7; magnification). Here the X-Y step length used was between 300-400 mm in order to count 100-200 CD11b-ir cells in each side of the SN. A positive cell was defined as a nucleus covered and surrounded by CD11b immunostaining. The stage of cells was identified by their morphology. For quantitation of MHC II immunoreactive (MHC II-ir) cells, cells in stage 4 were identified by their morphology on MHC II staining under 40&#x000d7; magnification and counted in every sixth 25-&#x003bc;m-thick serial section of the SN of each rat using a two-blinded procedure.

To investigate the role of CD200-CD200R dysfunction in 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity, we employed a CD200R monoclonal antibody to block CD200-CD200R engagement, which was first used by Wright, G. J. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and later by many other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In the present study, BAb, CAb or Veh was injected into striatum one day before 6-OHDA injection. Then, apomorphine-induced rotational behaviour was analyzed to assess unilateral degeneration of presynaptic dopaminergic neuron terminals at 7 and 21 days after 6-OHDA injection. Although rats that had been microinjected with 6-OHDA/Veh could contralaterally rotate to the site of 6-OHDA lesion with apomorphine administration (1.5 &#x000b1; 0.6 at 7 days, 3.7 &#x000b1; 1.3 at 21 days), apomorphine-induced rotation was significantly increased in 6-OHDA/BAb rats at both time points (7.7 &#x000b1; 2.6 and 18.3 &#x000b1; 2.3 respectively, p &#x0003c; 0.0001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Pretreatment with BAb not only exacerbated but also accelerated (as early as 7 days) motor deficits in hemiparkinsonian rats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Animals that responded to apomorphine treatment with at least 7.0 turns/min could be regarded as successfully induced hemiparkinsonian rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].

So the dose of 6-OHDA (16 &#x003bc;g) used in this experiment could be considered as a sub-toxic dose. However, rats treated with 6-OHDA/CAb did not show a significant increase in contralateral rotational number, 2.7 &#x000b1; 1.1 turns/min at 7 days and 4.7 &#x000b1;1.7 turns/min at 21 days, compared to the rats treated with 6-OHDA/Veh (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>BAb exacerbates 6-OHDA-induced behavioural deficits</bold>.

We observed that a sub-toxic dose of 6-OHDA was able to induce moderate but not overt dopaminergic neurodegeneration in SN (55.0 &#x000b1; 6.0% of contralateral) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Intrastriatal injection of BAb resulted in a significant decrease in TH-ir neurons in whole SN in animals treated with 6-OHDA/BAb (5.2 &#x000b1;2.0%, P &#x0003c; 0.0001). However, no dramatic decrease in TH-ir cells was observed between groups treated with 6-OHDA/Veh and 6-OHDA/CAb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). These results indicate an exacerbating effect of BAb on the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. At higher magnifications, we observed that treatment of 6-OHDA/BAb not only decreased the number of TH-ir cells but also their arborisation or fibers. TH-ir fibers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> arrowheads) were less densely spread amongst TH-ir cell bodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> arrows) in the SN in 6-OHDA/BAb-treated rats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>), compared to either control group (6-OHDA/Veh, 6-OHDA/CAb) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E-F</xref>). There were no marked morphological differences in numbers of TH-ir cells in SN between rats pretreated with CAb (6-OHDA/CAb) and Veh (6-OHDA/Veh) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E-F</xref>). Furthermore, BAb administration had a significant effect on DA and its metabolites in ipsilateral striatum.

Injection of CAb prior to 6-OHDA-lesion did not cause significant changes in DA or its metabolites in the right striatum of rats in comparison to vehicle control animals (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), while the contents of DA and its metabolites in 6-OHDA/BAb group were significantly lower than that in the 6-OHDA/Veh group.

Thus, we studied microglial activation and possible neuroinflammation in SN at 21 days post-6-OHDA-injection by immunohistochemistry as described in Methods.</p><p>First, we studied morphological changes and quantification of microglia using the microglia-specific marker CD11b (a constitutive marker of microglia). CD11b recognizes complement receptor type 3 (CR3), the expression of which is greatly increased in hyperactive microglia compared with resting microglia. In our study, profound microglial responses were observed in ipsilateral SN in rats following treatment with 6-OHDA/BAb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F,I</xref>). Round and amoeboid cells (Stage 4) became predominant in the core of the SN and were mingled with rod-shaped (stage 3) or highly ramified (stage 2) microglia near the boundary (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref>). Twenty one days post-6-OHDA injection there was an increase in CD11b-ir cells in all groups. In addition, we found that the total number of CD11b-ir cells in SN was significantly increased in 6-OHDA/BAb-treated rats (716 &#x000b1; 23%, P = 0.0002) versus 6-OHDA/CAb-treated rats (318 &#x000b1; 20%) and 6-OHDA/Veh-treated rats (273 &#x000b1; 27%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). No significant difference was found between 6-OHDA/Veh and 6-OHDA/CAb groups (P = 0.2519) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Furthermore, we analysed the quantification of microglia in different stages. Four cellular patterns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) were defined according to Kreutzberg's classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We observed that stage 4 cells constituted over 85% of the microglia population in the 6-OHDA/BAb-treated group, while less than 10% of them were found in the other two groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The majority of cells presenting in the core lesion of the SN in the other two groups were stage 3 cells or stage 2 cells. In the 6-OHDA/Veh group, stage 3 cells constituted about 34% of the population, while 39% of population turned out to be stage 2 cells. In the 6-OHDA/CAb group, 33% of population were stage 3 cells, while 38% were stage 2 cells. Statistically significant differences were found between the 6-OHDA/BAb-treated group and the two control groups (P &#x0003c; 0.01), but no difference was found between the two control groups. We also investigated the expression of MHC II, a marker for activated microglia, which is practically undetectable in resting microglia. MHC II-ir cells showed similar morphology to that of stage 4 microglia. MHC II-ir microglia were found scattered throughout the SN in the 6-OHDA/Veh and 6-OHDA/CAb groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3M-N</xref>), while mainly stage 4 MHC II-ir microglia were visualized in the core lesion of SN from the 6-OHDA/BAb treated group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3L,O</xref>). The number of stage 4 MHC II-ir microglia was dramatically increased in 6-OHDA/BAb-treated rats compared with the two control groups (n = 5, P &#x0003c; 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

We detected the expression profile of two most-important cytokines, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6, in SN of rats from each group at 21 days post-6-OHDA-injection. This is the time point at which dopaminergic neurodegeneration, rotational behaviour and microglial activation were investigated. Interestingly, we found significant increases in the induction of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 expression in rats treated with 6-OHDA/BAb in comparison with the other treatments (6-OHDA/CAb, 6-OHDA/Veh) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, P &#x0003c; 0.001). No difference was noted between the two control groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

Microglia, which are not only the resident innate immune cells in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] but also the predominant cells that express CD200R in CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], play a critical role in maintaining a homeostatic milieu for most vulnerable dopaminergic neurons. CD200-CD200R signalling is considered to be a brake on innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Breaking the interaction between CD200 and CD200R will cause abnormal activation of microglia in brain.</p><p>Normal CD200-CD200R signalling maintains microglia in a quiescent state. Hoek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] first reported that disruption of CD200-CD200R interaction in the nervous system can cause EAE, which is related to abnormal activation of microglia. Recently, several studies have shown links between CD200/CD200R signalling and PD, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prion diseases. Protein and mRNA levels of CD200 and CD200R are decreased in hippocampus and inferior temporal gyrus of AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], suggesting that deficiency of the CD200-CD200R signalling may play an important role in the progress of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Costello et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] observed an exaggeration of proinflammatory cytokine production, including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;, produced by CD200<sup>-/- </sup>glia And these up-regulated cytokines correlated with significantly reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA1 synapses of hippocampal slices from CD200<sup>-/- </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. These findings indicated that loss of CD200-CD200R interaction might impair synaptic function in hippocampus and play an important role in dementia. A deficit of CD200-CD200R has also been found in PD patients. Luo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] examined CD200R expression and regulation in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), the peripheral counterpart of microglia, in PD patients and in old and young healthy controls. They found that basal CD200R expression is similar in MDMs from young control, old control and PD patients; however, expression of CD200R in MDMs induced by various stimuli is impaired in the older groups, especially in PD patients, implying an intrinsic abnormality of CD200-CD200R signalling in PD brain. Interestingly, CD200R expressed in human beings and rats functions only as an inhibitory signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. However there are two different CD200Rs in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]; an inhibitory receptor CD200R1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] and an activating receptor CD200R2-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. There is no report about the expression levels of CD200R or CD200 in patients with prion disease, but activated microglia are thought to be related to up-regulation of CD200R4 in a mouse model of prion disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. All of these findings suggest that CD200-CD200R signalling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, including PD.</p><p>Previously, we always used 32&#x003bc;g of 6-OHDA to yield an animal model of PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This amount would result in the demise of almost all dopaminergic neurons in the SN (&#x0003e;95%) and in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (&#x0003e;80%) at 3 weeks post-lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. To investigate whether abnormal CD200-CD200R signalling could exacerbate microglial activation and dopaminergic neurodegneration in the 6-OHDA-induced rat PD model, we needed to find a proper dose of 6-OHDA that would produce only a limited loss of TH-ir neurons on the ipsilateral side of the SN. Therefore, we injected different amounts (32&#x003bc;g, 24&#x003bc;g, 16&#x003bc;g, 8&#x003bc;g) of 6-OHDA into MFB and found that 16&#x003bc;g of 6-OHDA was able to induce moderate but not overt dopaminergic neurodegeneration in SN (data not shown). This is the sub-toxic dose of 6-OHDA that is similar to that used by Saucer H et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>], Depino AM et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and Roedter A et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. In these studies, 20&#x003bc;g 6-OHDA in the striatum provoked a moderate and progressive loss of dopaminergic cells in the ipsilateral SN at 3 weeks post -lesion. The typical phenotype and corresponding neurodegeneration, as well as augmented microglial activation, observed in 6-OHDA/BAb-treated rats suggests that abnormal CD200-CD200R signalling exacerbates microglial activation and plays an important role in progression of the disease. It is believed that multiple factors are involved in the development of PD. Our present study in a PD rat model and our previous study in PD patients indicate that both intrinsic abnormal CD200-CD200R signalling and environmental neurotoxins participate in the pathogenesis of PD.</p><p>According to previous studies, the bolus administration of any substance into cerebrum may cause mechanical damage to neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>] and subsequent adjacent activation of microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. This makes it difficult to distinguish activation of microglia caused by injection from that caused by changes in CD200-CD200R signalling. Beside this, the small volume of the SN makes it hard to inject any reagent precisely into the SN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Finding an ideal alternative antibody injection site would help to elucidate the role of CD200-CD200R signalling in the pathogenesis of PD. Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and biocytin, injected into striatum, can later be found in substantia nigra pars reticulate (SNpr) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in squirrel monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>]. In addition, Mufson et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>] have shown that intrastriatral infusion of the tracer fluorogold results in transport into the SNpc. The above evidence indicates that antibody injected into striatum may spread into the SN, causing abnormal activation of microglia and damage to dopaminergic neurons. Histological and immunological examinations in rats confirmed our speculation. Furthermore, the reduced levels of DA and its metabolites caused by injection of BAb in striatum demonstrates impairment of dopaminergic neurons in SN.</p><p>The results of this study provide in vivo evidence that impairment of CD200-CD200R signalling might play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. However, our study lacked a time course of microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Therefore, further study is required to fully elucidate the mechanism involved in microglial activation and subsequent neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taking all of these results together, this study shows that disruption of CD200-CD200R signalling might play a role in the pathogenesis of PD. The role of CD200-CD200R signalling in the pathogenesis of PD makes it a potential therapeutic target for PD therapy. Therapeutic agents that can efficiently inhibit microglial activation through regulation of CD200-CD200R signalling may become a novel approach to the clinical treatment of PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SZ, XJW, JQD, SDC designed research.
