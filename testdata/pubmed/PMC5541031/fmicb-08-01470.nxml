The goal of this study was to determine whether DBM could be inoculated with MOM from mothers of preterm infants to restore the live microbiota (RM). Culture dependent and culture independent methods were used to analyze the fluctuations in the overall population and microbiome, respectively, of DBM, MOM, and RM samples over time. Using MOM at time = 0 (T0) as the target for the restoration process, this level was reached in the 10% (RM-10) and 30% (RM-30) mixtures after 4 h of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, whereas, the larger dilutions of 1% (RM-1) and 5% (RM-5) after 8 h. The diversity indexes were similar between MOM and DBM samples, however, different genera were prevalent in each group. Interestingly, 40% of the bacterial families were able to expand in DBM after 4 h of incubation indicating that a large percentage of the bacterial load present in MOM can grow when transferred to DBM, however, no core microbiome was identified. In summary, the microbiome analyses indicated that each mother has a unique microbiota and that live microbial reestablishment of DBM may provide these microbes to individual mothers&#x02019; infants. The agreement between the results obtained from the viable bacterial counts and the microbiome analyses indicate that DBM incubated with 10&#x02013;30% v/v of the MOM for 4 h is a reasonable restoration strategy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mother&#x02019;s own milk</kwd><kwd>restoration</kwd><kwd>personalization</kwd><kwd>donor breast milk</kwd><kwd>bacterial load</kwd><kwd>human milk microbiome</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="61"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The benefits of human milk for preterm infants include immune and nutritional protection against infection, decreased necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and other morbidities (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wight, 2001</xref>). In the absence of mother&#x02019;s own milk (MOM), the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using DBM over formula in very preterm infants (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Moretti, 2012</xref>). Thus, the current practice at the University of Florida, UF Health Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), is to provide premature infants of gestational age less than 30 weeks with DBM if the MOM supply is low or not available.</p><p>Numerous components of human milk are thought to be beneficial for the infant (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Newburg et al., 2005</xref>). Accumulating data suggests that microbes that are indigenous to human milk may not be contaminants and play a beneficial role for the infant (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Jeurink et al., 2013</xref>). Up to 200 different bacterial species have been found in human milk. <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al. (2011)</xref> studied milk samples from 16 healthy women collected at three different time points. A common group of nine bacterial genera was present in all samples, but in different concentrations among the subjects. Each individual demonstrated a unique milk microbiome that was stable over time (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al., 2011</xref>). Collectively, these data highlight a personalized collection of milk microbes from each mother that is optimized for the health of her own infant.</p><p>Donor breast milk used in most NICUs is pasteurized due to safety concerns (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Landers and Updegrove, 2010</xref>). Pasteurization of DBM kills 99% of bacteria and may also inactivate a large proportion of the bioactive components. Since DBM is pooled and pasteurized, it lacks the unique live maternal milk microbiome, which may be of benefit to the infant (for a review see <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Jost et al., 2015</xref>). The majority of mothers of very preterm infants are able to express small amounts of their own milk and although it may be of insufficient volume to meet the daily nutritrional requirements of their infant, it can still provide lasting health benefits. Our objective was to encourage the NICU mothers to continue pumping and use a small amount of MOM to inoculate the pasteurized DBM to add back the potentially beneficial naturally occurring microbes. We hypothesized that fresh MOM can be mixed with DBM to improve the quality of DBM by cultivating the beneficial milk microbiome to reflect MOM. Studies were performed to determine optimal dilutions and incubation times to obtain a microbial content most similar to that of the MOM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study cohort consisted of twelve mothers who provided a breast milk sample between December 2014 and February 2016.

In contrast, the two highest milk dilution ratios (RM-1 and RM-5) were less than 0.5 at 4 h of incubation and then at 8 h of incubation reached a ratio &#x0003e; 1, exceeding the MOM bacterial load (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>).</p><p>Since microbial growth may result in changes in pH as well as physical changes to the milk, the overall appearance (i.e., phase separation and curdling) and pH was monitored throughout the incubation period. Visual inspection of the milk samples did not reveal changes during the incubation period. Analysis of pH indicated that MOM samples were more alkaline (pH 7.5 &#x000b1; 0.11) than pasteurized DBM (pH 6.5 &#x000b1; 0.15) at T0. The incubation of MOM milk for 8 h resulted in a significant decrease (<italic>p</italic> = 0.047) in pH to 7 &#x000b1; 0.5 while no significant changes were observed in DBM samples or RM samples over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Donor Milk versus Mother&#x02019;s Own Milk Have a Similar Diversity Index</title><p>Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA was performed on all milk samples. After quality control, a total of 15,575,142 sequences were obtained with a mean of 75,976 sequences per sample. The rationale of this microbiome analyses was to have an unbiased view of the changes in the microbial community during the restoration process.</p><p>First, we compared the community structure of DBM and MOM at T0. The alpha diversity expressed as Chao1 and Shannon index was similar between the two sets of samples (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref></bold>). It cannot be concluded, however, that due to the similarity in alpha diversity between DBM and MOM that the bacterial load is the same since DBM is pasteurized. The relative abundance of genera was compared between the two samples (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref></bold>). <italic>Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, Halomonas, Bacillus, Stenotrophomonas, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae genus, Streptococcus, Shewanella, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Enterococcus</italic>, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae genus, unclassified Methylobacteriaceae genus, unclassified Pseudomonadaceae genus, unclassified Xanthomonadaceae genus and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> constituted 85% of the sequences found in DBM.

The Shannon index was utilized to determine the species richness across time between DBM, MOM, and the RM samples (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>). It was found that after 4 h of incubation the MOM samples had a significant decrease (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) in alpha diversity only when compared to DBM and RM-1.

A multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot was generated to visualize the variability of the microbial community in each MOM and their derived RM samples (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). It was expected that the DBM samples of each individual set should remain clustered together since DBM is pasteurized and should have negative to little bacterial growth. In most cases, the DBM samples remained clustered together, such as MOM sample 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 (shown as circles in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>) whereas, in DBM used for MOM samples 2 and 9 has a small difference in bacterial richness over time. Overall, these MDS plots allowed the visualization of fluctuations of the microbial population in the different RM samples over time. In some mothers, it was observed that the different RM samples migrated toward MOM at T0, suggesting that the RM sample became more similar to MOM at T0 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). However, some exceptions were observed. For example, all samples derived from MOM 3 cluster together, indicative that the restoration process was not successful. Mothers 11 and 12 show migration of all the dilutions moving away from MOM at all time-points and toward DBM instead. Mothers 11 and 12 shared the same sample of DBM so it is possible that live bacteria still found within this DBM sample are hindering the expansion of MOM-derived microbiota.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p>Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots of RM samples.

Based on the culture dependent results where the target bacterial load (of the culturable population) was reached after 4 h and a decrease in diversity was observed in the microbiome after 8 h of incubation, the next series of analyses were performed on all the samples (DBM, RM, and MOM) only after 4 h of incubation.</p><p>For these analyses the relative abundance of each bacterial family was obtained. To identify families that increase in abundance after 4 h, the bacterial load from T0 was subtracted from the bacterial load from T4 across all samples. If a family increased in concentration within the negative control (DBM), it was excluded in the results. It was found that out of the 120 &#x000b1; 40 families identified within MOM samples, an average of 37 &#x000b1; 12 were able to increase concentration after 4 h of incubation.

Other genera that had <italic>p</italic>-values greater than 0.05 and less than 0.13 were also taken into consideration for further analyses.

MOM contains irreplaceable immune modulating factors including commensal bacteria (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Wold and Adlerberth, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Jost et al., 2013</xref>). Feeding preterm infants MOM has been shown to decrease NEC and sepsis with even small amounts of MOM providing some protection (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Furman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Schanler, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Meinzen-Derr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Corpeleijn et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abrams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chowning et al., 2016</xref>). The microbiome found in MOM may provide short term and long term benefits to infants including preventing colonization by pathogens, stimulating production of cross-reactive antibiodies, and possibly establishing a healthy intestinal microbiome which may prevent long term morbidities including obesity, type 2 diabetes, chronic intestinal inflammation, autoimmune disorders, allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, and allergic gastroenteritis (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Goulet, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lemas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wallace et al., 2016</xref>). Unfortunately, many mothers of preterm infants are unable to produce sufficient amounts of breast milk to sustain 100% of their infant&#x02019;s nutritional needs (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Gould, 2009</xref>). The RM may offer a personalized and beneficial alternative to DBM when MOM is limited. Since MOM contains a unique and unchanging microbiome (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cacho and Neu, 2014</xref>), providing infants their own mother&#x02019;s milk may be beneficial, especially for infants born preterm, at risk for infection and other premature specific morbidities.</p><p>Our culture dependent approach indicated that the main bacterial groups that were tested, namely <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, lactic acid bacteria (and other that can grow in MRS agar), along with other facultative aerobes (including <italic>Streptococcus</italic>), can be propagated into DBM, however, a large variability in bacterial load was observed between mothers. Previous studies examining bacteria present in breast milk have required aseptic sample collection of milk by mothers to limit skin flora and potential contaminants (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;n et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Collado et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Jost et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Khodayar-Pardo et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, we aimed to examine the typical microbes that the preterm babies consistently received from their mother&#x02019;s milk during routine NICU expression practices and therefore, mothers performed routine NICU protocols for hand hygiene techniques and equipment cleaning. Consistent with <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Heikkil&#x000e4; and Saris (2003)</xref> and <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;n et al. (2003)</xref>, our results reveal that <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, facultative aerobes, lactic acid bacteria, and few Gram negatives can be cultured from breast milk. We were not able to isolate <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> in culture which may be due to the sensitive anaerobic nature of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, having not provided the proper anaerobic environment or handling techniques to facilitate growth. In addition, it is possible that <italic>Bifidobaceterium</italic> is negligible in breast milk from mothers delivering preterm infants as indicated from the study by <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Khodayar-Pardo et al. (2014)</xref>, which showed less <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> compared to milk from mothers of term infants. Small numbers of Gram negative bacteria grew on MacConkey agar (results not shown), which is consistent with previous research indicating that approximately 30&#x02013;70% of breast milk samples contained Gram negative bacteria (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Botsford et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Landers and Updegrove, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Keim et al., 2013</xref>). Small amounts of Gram negative bacteria in breast milk may be important in preparing the immune system to utilize toll-like receptor mediated tolerizing mechanisms to prevent an exaggerated response to future Gram negative bacteria (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Madara, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, pasteurized DBM obtained from HMBANA showed that 10<sup>2</sup> CFU/mL of bacteria were still present in nutrient broth (facultative anaerobes including <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>) in 44% of the DBM samples. This is consistent with previous studies describing the presence of staphylococcal species in DBM as well as spore forming bacteria such as <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Crielly et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Landers and Updegrove, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Decousser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Akindolire et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dewitte et al., 2015</xref>). Although microbial diversity indexes were similar between DBM and MOM, the most abundant genera differed. The most prevalent genera in MOM were <italic>Halomonas, Shewanella, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, while the most common genera in DBM were <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, and <italic>Serratia</italic>. These differences may reflect variances in the mothers who provided breast milk samples and the sanitation or method used for collection. DBM is typically obtained from mothers who are breastfeeding term infants who are often more than 6 months old. In contrast, the MOM in this study was obtained from mothers of preterm, hospitalized infants who because of their infant&#x02019;s prematurity, were unable to breastfeed and were thus dependent on mechanical breast milk expression to obtain milk for their infants.</p><p>We found that <italic>Halomonas</italic> was present in greater abundance than <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> in comparison with other studies in MOM. Although <italic>Halomonas</italic> has not been previously described in breast milk from mothers delivering preterm, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> is a well-known predominant phyla in breast milk (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Urbaniak et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Jost et al., 2013</xref>). We also found <italic>Shewanellaceae</italic> was high in MOM (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared to DBM. The main genera found to be of great abundance in MOM across different studies are <italic>Staphylococcus, Streptococcus</italic>, Proteobacteria groups, and <italic>Propionibacteria</italic> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hunt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). However, <italic>Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides</italic> and Clostridia groups have also been identified to be a part of the breast milk microbiota (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Sinkiewicz and Ljunggren, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). Although <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> was identified from our sequencing results, it was not shown to be prevalent. These differences in the predominant genera being <italic>Halomonas</italic> and <italic>Shewanellaceae</italic> as opposed to <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> may be due to the fact that (except for rare occasions in three patients) mothers in our study did not breastfeed their infants. They were dependent on mechanical breast pumps for milk removal, thus the mother&#x02019;s breasts were not routinely exposed to oral microbes from the infant&#x02019;s mouth. Other reasons for these variations may be attributed to younger gestational age at delivery, stage of lactation, milk collection strategies and geographic variations in our study compared to others. In DBM, the most abundant genera were <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae genus, and <italic>Serratia.</italic></p><p>Results of this study suggest that the optimal restoration strategy to reach a microbial content most similar to MOM was a mixture of RM-10 incubated for 4 h. Using the bacterial load and microbial content of MOM at T0 as the target, we were able to successfully restore the microbiome in the RM-10 and RM-30 mixtures after 4 h of incubation, whereas larger dilutions of RM-1 and RM-5 reached the target level after 8 h. Although it did not reach the microbial content of MOM, RM-10 was able to reach 60% of the bacterial load of MOM. In contrast, RM-30 exceeded the target goal of MOM in the majority of incubated samples. This may be clinically undesireable since potentially pathogenic bacterial strains may grow to possibly harmful levels. Overall, our results demonstrate that inoculation with an amount of MOM as small as 1% can populate DBM with the mother&#x02019;s potentially beneficial bacteria.</p><p>The alpha diversity of MOM and the larger dilutions of RM (RM-10 and RM-30) decreased as incubation time increased. In contrast, the diversity of DBM and smaller dilutions of RM (RM-1 and RM-5) remained similar to their original levels as incubation time increased. This trend of MOM toward decreased diversity suggests replication of only a few microbial species. Breast milk studies show that microbial diversity is associated with a healthy lactating milk microbiome as opposed to the milk microbiome of a mother with mastitis where <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> or <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species predominate (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Delgado et al., 2008</xref>). This decreased diversity indicates that in order to preserve microbial diversity similar to that found in MOM, a 4 h incubation time compared to an 8 h incubation time may be optimal, which confirms the culture based results favoring a 4 h incubation time over 8 h for the RM.</p><p>Birth mode of delivery has been shown to affect the microbiota of breast milk in the majority of studies, suggesting a difference in the milk microbiome between infants born via c-section and those born vaginally (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Azad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gregory et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Brumbaugh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dominguez-Bello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Nagpal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Rutayisire et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, we observed a differential clustering of microbiomes from the breast milk of c-sections versus vaginally delivering mothers. Although it is clear each individual mother&#x02019;s milk microbiota has bacterial variability, c-section and vaginal deliveries cluster with one another. Further analysis illustrated that bacterial genera most prevalent in breast milk from vaginal deliveries were <italic>Halomonas, Lactobacillus, Prevotella</italic>, unclassified Clostridiaceae genus, <italic>Clostridium, Comamonas</italic>, and <italic>Dorea.</italic> Those genera most prevalent in breast milk from cesarean deliveries were <italic>Erwinia, Pseudomonas, Ruminococcus</italic>, unclassified Enterococcaceae genus, <italic>Agrobacterium, Citrobacter, Enterococcus, Klebsiella</italic>, unclassified Bacilli genus, unclassified Bradyrhizobiaceae genus, and unclassified Methylophilaceae genus. Further statistical analysis does not show a common microbiota across breast milk regardless of c-section or vaginal delivery, concluding that the microbiota of breast milk is variable between each mother.</p><p>Based on our results, restoration of the live microbiome of DBM with MOM appears to be a promising and innovative method to provide preterm infants with beneficial breast milk bacteria. It is well known that breast milk changes over time to meet specific needs of infants which are attributed to stages of lactation, gestational age, infant feeding, and the health status of the breastfeeding dyad (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Daly et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kent, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hassiotou et al., 2013</xref>). If mothers of preterm infants are able to express even minimal amounts of breast milk, restoration of the microbiome in DBM may allow their infants to receive milk more specific to their individual needs based on the stage of lactation and gestational age, thereby potentially improving their overall health. We used non-culture based techniques to take a snapshot of the full range of bacteria present in fresh preterm milk and pasteurized donor milk. The main limitation of our study is its small sample size and the use of antibiotics during the peripartum period. Nevertheless, it addresses the concept that the live microbiota donor human milk can be effectively restablished by MOM. In addition, mothers were not required to clean their breasts prior to breast milk sampling so their samples may have contained a higher level of skin colonizing microbes. Another limitation of the study is that safety parameters were not assessed. Future studies will need to include the analyses of potential pathogenic bacterial groups that may proliferate in the RM samples in the NICU environment.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that each mother has a unique milk microbiota and that the live microbiome in DBM can be restored with these unique bacteria using small amounts of MOM. This is a novel approach to possibly improving the bioactivity of DBM by adding specific MOM microbes in small quantities to personalize her own infant&#x02019;s milk. Personalizing DBM may benefit the mother&#x02013;infant dyad and contribute to a more robust infant intestinal microbiome. The agreement between the results obtained from the viable bacterial counts and the microbiome analyses indicate that DBM incubated with 10 percent of the MOM for 4 h is a reasonable restoration strategy.
