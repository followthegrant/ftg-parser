MCC typically presents as a painless, solitary lesion on sun-exposed regions of the body (e.g. head, neck, extremities) with initial indolent growth. However, the course of MCC is aggressive with nodal invasion, distant metastasis and high recurrence rates [<xref rid="rjy185C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This report describes an interesting case of MCC discovered on the left buttocks.</p></sec><sec id="rjy185s2"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 68-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department (ED) with a painless, draining left buttock lesion. He reported that the wound had originated as a pimple a few months earlier, but had been growing over the last three weeks with foul-smelling discharge. There was no history of trauma to the area. His past medical history included a deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism 20 years prior for which he was on warfarin, hyperlipidemia and tonsillectomy. On physical exam, the patient&#x02019;s vitals were significant for blood pressure elevated to 153/87. On the left gluteus, a 10 &#x000d7; 10 cm<sup>2</sup> non-tender lesion was noted with malodorous discharge. Labs were only significant for a therapeutic international normalized ratio of 3.07. A computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis was read as having a 9 &#x000d7; 10.8 &#x000d7; 4.2 cm<sup>3</sup> left gluteal abscess and bulky left inguinal lymphadenopathy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="rjy185F1">1</xref>). The patient was admitted, started on intravenous antibiotics and taken to the operating room (OR) for unroofing, debridement and incisional biopsy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="rjy185F2">2</xref>). Pathology revealed ulcerated, necrotic skin fragments with MCC and cultures grew <italic>Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus</italic>. Antibiotics were de-escalated and the patient was discharged with sodium hypochlorite wound dressing changes. A chest CT was performed and showed no evidence of distant metastasis. One month later, the patient then underwent complete operative excision of the lesion down to the gluteus fascia with 2 cm margins and left groin lymph node dissection with lymphadenectomy. The resulting 13 &#x000d7; 15 cm<sup>2</sup> defect was closed with a combination of fasciocutaneous advancement flaps and split-thickness skin grafting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="rjy185F3">3</xref>). Pathological analysis showed a completely excised 11.6 cm ulcerated MCC lesion with negative margins and positive lymphovascular invasion (2/2 positive lymph nodes)&#x02014;stage pT3 pN1b (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="rjy185F4">4</xref>).</p><fig id="rjy185F1" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1:</label><caption><p>Computed tomography of pelvis.

The buttock wound was noted to be healed at the 5-month postoperative follow up (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="rjy185F5">5</xref>). A follow-up CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis displayed increasing supraclavicular, mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

Merkel cells are dermal sensory neuroendocrine and mechanoreceptors that are located at the stratum basale epidermal layer [<xref rid="rjy185C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Numerous etiological factors contribute to MCC development such as exposure to UV radiation, infection with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) and chronic immunosuppression. MCPyV is a human polyomavirus that is linked with MCC in up to 80% of cases [<xref rid="rjy185C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More than 9 out of 10 people diagnosed with MCC are Caucasian and above the age of 50 [<xref rid="rjy185C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. MCC is most commonly found in sun-exposed regions of the body&#x02014;55% head/neck versus 5% buttock. The estimated 5-year survival rates for MCC are based on the stage of the disease and range from 18 to 80% [<xref rid="rjy185C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="rjy185C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>MCC can present clinically as a painless, firm, bluish-red, rapidly growing nodule. Overlying skin at the site of exposure may exhibit acneiform, telangiectasia or ulcerative characteristics [<xref rid="rjy185C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Histologically, MCC appears as small, round, blue cells with sparse cytoplasm, medium to large-sized hyperchromatic nuclei, multiple small nucleoli, delicately granular chromatin, abundant mitoses and numerous apoptotic figures [<xref rid="rjy185C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. MCC is occasionally mistaken for other histologically related cutaneous tumors such as small cell lung carcinoma or extra skeletal primitive neuroendocrine tumors [<xref rid="rjy185C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Diagnosis of MCC is confirmed by hybrid light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry [<xref rid="rjy185C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Locoregional treatments include wide excision, adjuvant radiation therapy, and if applicable, regional lymph node excision. The common sites of metastasis are the dermis, liver, lungs, bones, brain and lymph nodes [<xref rid="rjy185C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Metastasis detection with MCC can be done via CT, MRI, PET scan and octreotide scintigraphy [<xref rid="rjy185C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, radiotherapy to the primary site with or without inguinal nodes with palliative intent has been shown to significantly improve relapse-free survival rates. This patient&#x02019;s pathology results in a stage 3B MCC with a 25% 5-year survival rate. It is important for wound care physicians to be aware of this uncommon presentation of MCC, and there should be an index of suspicion for MCC in a rapidly growing painless lesion.</p><p>Currently, no curative treatments have been established for metastatic MCC. The role of chemotherapy is unclear and it is currently reserved for advanced-stage MCC and palliative therapy. Further studies are needed to assess the optimal combination of surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy to improve disease-free survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="rjy185s4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>MCC is a rare, aggressive carcinoma that usually arises in sun-exposed regions.
