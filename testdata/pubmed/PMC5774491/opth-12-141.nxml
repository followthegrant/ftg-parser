However, Zweng et al<xref rid="b2-opth-12-141" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> in 1971 first described the usage of argon laser for the management of PDR. It was not until the results of the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS)<xref rid="b3-opth-12-141" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and the Early treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)<xref rid="b4-opth-12-141" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> that the role of panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) was established as the gold standard treatment in preventing progression of complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). However, PRP has inherent adverse treatment effects. These include reduction in color and contrast sensitivity, loss of visual field and night vision, loss of visual acuity due to causation or exacerbation of macular edema, increased fibrovascular traction, and exudative choroidal detachment.<xref rid="b5-opth-12-141" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>With the description of PASCAL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or patterned scan laser by Blumenkranz et al<xref rid="b6-opth-12-141" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> in 2008, a semi-automated pattern allowing rapid application of multiple laser spots on the retina with a shorter pulse duration of 10&#x02013;30 ms was possible. This modality reduced treatment duration and pain for the patient. Moreover, it allowed precise placement of spots with reduction in the number and size of visual field defects. Further, PASCAL<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> delivered less severe threshold burns than conventional longer pulse laser photocoagulation, reducing the severity of adverse treatment effects.</p><p>Pulsed subthreshold micropulse laser or microsecond laser (microsecond for NAVILAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and micropulse for Iridex) is now commonly used in conditions such as diabetic macular edema and central serous chorioretinopathy, with good anatomical and visual outcomes, including improvement in functional vision.<xref rid="b7-opth-12-141" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Pulsed subthreshold microsecond laser low-intensity/high-density subthreshold microsecond (STM) laser for PRP for proliferative diabetic retinopathy was first described by Luttrull et al<xref rid="b8-opth-12-141" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> in 2007. They reported a reduced rate of vitreous hemorrhage and need for vitrectomy in their patients over a mean follow-up of 12 months, with reduced incidences of treatment-related complications. They noted that retinal destruction as a visible endpoint of photocoagulation is not actually necessary to achieve therapeutic benefit in the treatment of retinal vascular disease. In contrast, sub-threshold diode microsecond laser is believed to act solely at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by normalizing its function, rather than by destruction. This was an uncontrolled, retrospective, consecutive case series study, and did not include visual fields or electroretinography in analysis of outcomes of their microsecond PRP protocols.</p><p>In the present study, we undertook to compare the change in visual acuity, visual fields, low-contrast visual acuity (LCVA), and disease progression between continuous-wave laser (CWL; 532 nm) PRP and STM (577 nm) PRP in two eyes of the same subject with symmetrical low-risk PDR or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) stage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized, prospective, controlled trial was conducted on ten subjects with a diagnosis of na&#x000ef;ve, symmetric, bilateral, severe NPDR or low-risk PDR who presented to LV Prasad Eye Institute, Kallam Anji Reddy Campus, Hyderabad, India, between November 2014 and July 2015.

Patients were not evaluated or treated for obstructive sleep apnea. Data collected at the initial visit included demographics, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using ETDRS visual acuity, LCVA using COMPLOG, color fundus photographs (seven fields), infrared images (seven fields), autofluorescence images (seven fields), HVF 30-2, and Flash ERG.</p><p>A comprehensive ocular examination was carried out in all cases by the consultant in charge of the study (JC). Ocular investigations included optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FFA), wherever indicated. FFA as well as fundus photography was undertaken using FF450plus Fundus Camera with VISUPAC (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany).

At all follow-up visits on months 3, 6, and 9, color fundus photographs (seven fields), infrared images (seven fields), autofluorescence images (seven fields), and HVF 30-2 were done.

Moreover, it reported no significant difference between various parameters, such as visual acuity, LCVA, or visual field, between the CWL and STM groups. There was a slight advantage noted in the STM group in terms of LCVA as well as visual field. The CWL group showed a drop in the LCVA, visual field index, and scotopic b/a ratio in comparison to the STM group, although the change was statistically insignificant.</p><p>Our study raises an important concern about the conventional belief that retinal destruction is required to control the neovascularization process. We noticed clinical progression of neovascularization in one eye (10%) in the STM group. Although the eye with SNPDR developed a hemorrhage, no clinically detectable new lesions were seen, and even though we have treated this as a progression as per the definition in our study, we feel that, owing to lack of wide-field imaging, a neovascular complex in the far periphery could have been missed at diagnosis as well at further follow-ups or it could have been induced by posterior vitreous detachment. While resolution of neovascularization is the conventional treatment goal of panretinal laser for PDR, arrest and regression is the norm, and complete disappearance is rare with conventional photocoagulation and long-term anti-VEGF suppressive treatment. Echoing the findings of Luttrull et al,<xref rid="b8-opth-12-141" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> eliminating (STM) or reducing (PASCAL CWL) retinal damage &#x02013; and, thus, inflammation &#x02013; appeared to minimize preretinal fibrosis and contraction. This may generally lead to a more benign postoperative clinical course.</p><p>An advantage of microsecond laser over the conventional laser PRP includes no pain during treatment. Microsecond PRP can be repeated any number of times without adverse treatment effects. In this study, eyes were treated once at study entry. It is possible that periodic retreatment, permitted by treatment safety, may improve treatment results. Due to the lack of treatment-associated inflammation, microsecond PRP might be advantageous in eyes with extensive neovascularization and a thickened or partially detached hyaloid, which is at higher risk of tractional detachment following conventional laser PRP.</p><p>Due to ethical concerns, we treated eyes with significant, but not high-risk, DR, as there is no generally accepted need or mode of treatment at this stage of the disease that can be considered, while somewhat late in the course, as being &#x0201c;preventative.&#x0201d; The lack of generally accepted interventions for SNPDR and LRDR reflect adverse treatment effects associated with conventional PRP, which weigh against the benefits of early treatment and has been, thus far, the only available mode of treatment. While ranibizumab has been approved recently by the US FDA for treatment of diabetic retinopathy, long-term use of an expensive, short-acting, intravitreal medication for prevention of a chronic progressive disease is inherently problematic on many levels. While we report no significant improvements in secondary outcome measures, we also report no significant worsening. It must be remembered that the idea of preventive treatment changes nothing except the likelihood of disease progression. In this respect, both STM and CWL panretinal laser were found to stop progression of retinopathy without adverse treatment effects.<xref rid="b10-opth-12-141" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Thus, both may offer a more useful mode of preventive treatment in DR than conventional PRP or intravitreal drug injection. Further study is clearly necessary in this regard. However, we believe early treatment of SNPDR and LRPDR by STM or CWL panretinal laser may be useful in selected patients. While equally effective in this small study, because of that specific equality, we believe STM is to be preferred on the basis of its superior safety (no laser-induced retinal damage), comfort, and repeatability.</p><p>Limitations of our study include a small sample size and short follow-up. Due to the unavailability of wide-field imaging, we are unable to comment on the changes in peripheral neovascularization or ischemic areas during follow-up visits in both groups. We are unable to comment on subthreshold PRP in eyes with high-risk PDR, as we could not include this group due to ethical concerns. Strengths of our study include the evaluation of two laser modalities in the same subject, which excludes the bias caused by the systemic status of the subject. We included patients with symmetric disease to avoid any selection bias. In our study, patients as well as the evaluating optometrist were masked to the randomization.</p><p>In conclusion, our prospective pilot study proposes microsecond PRP is non-inferior to CWL PRP and could be an alternative to conventional CWL PRP in severe NPDR and early PDR to avoid complications associated with CW laser. A prospective study with a larger sample size with longer follow-up is warranted to establish the role of microsecond laser for PRP.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-opth-12-141"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Beetham</surname><given-names>WP</given-names></name><name><surname>Aiello</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Balodimos</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Koncz</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ruby-laser photocoagulation of early diabetic neovascular retinopathy: preliminary report of a long-term controlled study</article-title><source>Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc</source><year>1969</year><volume>67</volume><fpage>39</fpage><lpage>67</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5393426</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-opth-12-141"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zweng</surname><given-names>HC</given-names></name><name><surname>Little</surname><given-names>HL</given-names></name><name><surname>Peabody</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Argon laser photocoagulation of diabetic retinopathy</article-title><source>Arch Ophthalmol</source><year>1971</year><volume>86</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>395</fpage><lpage>400</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5110132</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-opth-12-141"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>The Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group</collab></person-group><article-title>Photocoagulation treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy: the second report of diabetic retinopathy study findings</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>1978</year><volume>85</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>82</fpage><lpage>106</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">345173</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-opth-12-141"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Early photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy</collab></person-group><article-title>ETDRS report number 9.
