Comparing the mechanisms of process formation between two cell types should provide useful guidance from the progress of neuron research. Studies have shown that some mature proteins of podocytes, such as podocin, nephrin, and synaptopodin, were also expressed in neurons. In this study, using cell biological experiments and immunohistochemical techniques, we showed that some neuronal iconic molecules, such as Neuron-specific enolase, nestin and Neuron-specific nuclear protein, were also expressed in podocytes. We further inhibited the expression of Neuron-specific enolase, nestin, synaptopodin and Ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolase-1 by Small interfering RNA in cultured mouse podocytes and observed the significant morphological changes in treated podocytes. When podocytes were treated with Adriamycin, the protein expression of Neuron-specific enolase, nestin, synaptopodin and Ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolase-1 decreased over time. Meanwhile, the morphological changes in the podocytes were consistent with results of the Small interfering RNA treatment of these proteins. The data demonstrated that neuronal iconic proteins play important roles in maintaining and regulating the formation and function of podocyte processes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by a grant from the National Nature Science Foundation of China (NFSC: 81070566).

The thin foot processes and GBM cooperatively construct the glomerular filtration barrier, which can effectively prevent proteins from passing through. The fine cellular architecture of podocytes is often altered; when podocytes are injured in certain pathophysiological conditions or in nephropathies, which are called podocytopathies, such as process effacement, false microvillus structures that formed from excessive cytoplasmic spines extending and the fracture or lose of the foot processes. These alterations may increase the permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier and cause massive proteinuria. Therefore, the maintenance of the special morphology construction of the podocyte is thought to be essential for its normal function. This morphology not only forms the unique shape and filtration function but also plays important roles in material metabolism, cell movement, energy and intracellular information transmission <xref rid="pone.0093999-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The elucidation of the mechanism of podocyte foot process formation is important for determining approaches to the prevention and control of nephropathy.</p><p>The mechanism of podocyte foot process formation remains unclear. However, several current studies have shown that there are many common cell biological features shared by neurons and podocytes. Naoto Kobayashi et al. revealed that podocytes had an extraordinary similarity with neurons <xref rid="pone.0093999-Kobayashi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Both cells are highly differentiated with similar long and short cell processes that are equipped with highly organized cytoskeletal systems. Additionally, the two types of cells share the expression of structural and regulatory proteins, such as synaptopodin, drebin and desin <xref rid="pone.0093999-Kobayashi2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Synaptopodin, which is the major component of the podocyte cytoskeleton, is primarily expressed in the site of the terminal processes of podocytes. Moreover, this protein can also be expressed in neuronal dendritic spines <xref rid="pone.0093999-Deller1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In addition, more recent data have shown that podocyte processes also share the expression of some special proteins, such as nephrin and podocin, with neuronal dendrites <xref rid="pone.0093999-Moeller1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093999-Deller2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Moreover, some molecules that are abnormally expressed may be involved in the pathological states of brain and kidney tissues. For example, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), which is a member of the deubiquitination enzyme family, is specifically expressed in the brain, testis and kidney tissue under normal circumstances <xref rid="pone.0093999-Wilkinson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093999-Shirato1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The abnormal expression of UCH-L1 in neurons is usually related to some degenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, in which dopamine and other proteins are deposited in Lewy bodies, which resulted from a ubiquitination disorder <xref rid="pone.0093999-Lowe1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093999-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In podocytes, our study and other laboratories have reported that UCH-L1 expression was elevated in diseased podocytes in several types of nephritis, which are related to the severity of nephropathy and proteinuria <xref rid="pone.0093999-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Enhancing UCH-L1 activity in membranous glomerulonephritis of rats could result in the inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, an increase in proteinuria and the progression of nephropathy <xref rid="pone.0093999-MeyerSchwesinger1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Thus, the data may suggest the similarity of the pathogenesis between podocyte injuries and neuron lesions <xref rid="pone.0093999-Sakurai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Among process-bearing cells, the neuron is the most intensely investigated so far. The careful comparison between neurons and podocytes may provide certain clues for understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of podocytopathy and nephropathy, as well as for providing novel therapeutic approaches.</p><p>The majority of the abovementioned studies were focused on podocyte differentiation proteins, such as nephrin, podocin and synaptopodin. To investigate process formation in greater detail, we hypothesized that some of the neuronal iconic molecules are also expressed in podocytes and that these molecules could play an important role in podocyte differentiation. In this study, we attempted to determine whether some neuronal iconic molecules, such as NSE (Neuron-specific enolase), nestin, NeuN (Neuron-specific nuclear protein) and S100, were expressed in podocytes through cell biology and immunohistochemistry techniques. The results confirmed that these neuronal iconic proteins were expressed in podocytes and played an important role in the formation of foot processes. These data indicated that these neuronal iconic proteins could be a critical regulator for podocyte function and a novel target in therapeutic approaches for podocytopathy and nephropathy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Permission to use the tissue sections for research purposes was obtained and approved by the Ethics Committee from Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China, and a written consent form was obtained from all patients.

The polygonal shape of cells became obtuse, the thin cytoplasmic processes clearly decreased and the intracellular actin fibers became misaligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093999-g004">Fig. 4A, B, C, D</xref>). The results indicated that nestin, NSE, synaptopodin and UCH-L1 played important roles in maintaining the formation of processes in podocytes. However, when NeuN and S100 mRNAs were inhibited, the polygonal morphology of podocytes was not changed, and the F-actin arrangement remained organized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093999-g004">Fig. 4E, F</xref>), which suggested that NeuN and S100 proteins might have other biological functions than process formation in podocytes.</p><fig id="pone-0093999-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0093999.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The effects of RNA interference of neuronal iconic proteins on podocyte morphology.</title><p>Following RNA interference of nestin (A), synaptopodin (B), UCH-L1(C) and NSE (D) separately for 72 hours, Western blotting showed a decrease in the protein level of these indicators in treated podocyte compared with the control cells.

Damage to any one of these three cell types will cause kidney diseases. When mesangial or endothelial cells are damaged, the surrounding normal cells will begin the compensatory repair response with proliferation and hyperplasia. However, because of the highly differentiated characteristics and limited proliferative capability of podocytes, which are similar to neurons, podocytes cannot effectively recover from damage. Therefore, podocyte injury becomes a pivotal factor during the progression of glomerular disease <xref rid="pone.0093999-MeyerSchwesinger2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Wiggins1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. A study demonstrated that when 20%&#x02013;40% podocytes were damaged, mild proteinuria would happen; when more than 60% of the podocytes were damaged, there was severe proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis <xref rid="pone.0093999-Kriz1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. All of the damaged podocytes have morphological changes as cell bodies swell, inclusive vacuoles increase and the foot processes fuse. Shirato once indicated that the molecular rearrangement of the cytoskeleton of podocyte foot processes was a key factor in the morphologic changes of the foot processes during podocyte injury <xref rid="pone.0093999-Shirato2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Therefore, determining the formation and regulation mechanism of the podocyte cytoskeleton is essential for podocyte injury research and for proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis treatments.</p><p>In podocyte injury research, certain specific proteins, such as nephrin, podocin, UCH-L1 and synaptopodin, have been found to be involved in the formation of foot processes. These proteins are often ectopic expressed in a variety of nephropathies. Nephrin is a podocyte biomarker <xref rid="pone.0093999-Ruotsalainen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Nephrin was significantly reduced in the early stage of rat diabetic nephropathy. Podocytes also exhibited mild swelling, foot process broadening and effacement, which were associated with significant proteinuria <xref rid="pone.0093999-Siu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093999-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Synaptopodin was originally found associated with actin filaments in podocyte foot processes <xref rid="pone.0093999-Mundel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Mundel2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and is thought to be vitally important for the morphology and function of podocyte processes. Therefore, synaptopodin is also considered a mature phenotype marker of podocytes <xref rid="pone.0093999-Mundel3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In glomerular lesions, synaptopodin expression decreased from normal, MCD, to IgAN, MsPGN and to FSGS in turn. This observation suggested that the change in synaptopodin influenced the structure and function of podocytes, which play an important role during the progressive course of glomerular diseases <xref rid="pone.0093999-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Podocin is localized in the slit diaphragm and is another molecular marker of mature podocytes. Podocin binds with nephrin and Neph1 to form a special signaling complex in foot processes, which is necessary for the structure and function of podocytes <xref rid="pone.0093999-George1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The reduction of podocin expression is also a symbol of podocyte injury <xref rid="pone.0093999-Wen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>These proteins also have been reported to be highly specifically expressed in neurons, particularly in the dendritic synapses and not in the axon <xref rid="pone.0093999-Kobayashi2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These proteins play an important role in neuronal differentiation and synapse function. These proteins are also involved in neural lesions <xref rid="pone.0093999-Saigoh1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Sakurai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Liu2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Lansbury1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Naoto Kobayashi et al. indicated that <xref rid="pone.0093999-Kobayashi2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, in addition to the co-expression of certain common proteins, these two cells shared other identical biological characteristics, such as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0093999.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula> Both cells develop microtubule-based thick processes with branching morphology and have thin actin-based projections. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0093999.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula> Both cells have the same mechanism of process formation, which is positively regulated by phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0093999.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula> Both cells share the machinery for intracellular trafficking of membranous vesicles and cytoskeletal elements <xref rid="pone.0093999-Kobayashi2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Shirato2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. There is currently growing evidence from our work and other laboratories that supports this concept that podocytes and neurons share the same regulatory mechanism for cell growth and development.</p><p>The proteins abovementioned, including nephrin, podocin and synaptopodin, are considered special podocyte proteins, which can also be expressed in neurons. Furthermore, as we speculated, there are many neuron-specific proteins, such as NSE, NeuN, nestin and UCH-L1, S100, that should also be expressed in podocytes. However, such reports are rarely seen. In the present study, we discovered that some neuronal iconic proteins, including NSE, nestin, NeuN, UCH-L1 and S100, could be found in human kidney tissue and in cultured podocytes, which indicated that neuronal specific proteins are expressed in podocytes.</p><p>Neuronal iconic proteins play an important role in neuron development, particularly in the formation of synaptic structures, as well as in the pathogenesis of neural diseases. NSE is a glycolytic enzyme that is primarily localized to the neuronal cytoplasm and synaptic plasma membrane <xref rid="pone.0093999-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Hardemark1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. NSE was reported to be associated with the cytoskeleton and to play important roles in cell growth, proliferation and survival in neurons <xref rid="pone.0093999-Brady1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that NSE was associated with microtubules in normal rat and mouse brains <xref rid="pone.0093999-Vinores1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and in some tumor cells <xref rid="pone.0093999-Vinores2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Nestin, which belongs to the class IV intermediate filament proteins, is distributed in the cytoplasm and is involved in the construction of the cytoskeletal structure. Nestin is primarily expressed in undifferentiated neuronal cells, which have the ability for cell division, such as nerve stem cells. Nestin is a marker for early primitive nerve cells <xref rid="pone.0093999-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Nestin re-expression in ischemic brain tissue may enhance anti-ischemic therapy and increase cell survival and cytoskeleton stabilization in neurons <xref rid="pone.0093999-Duggal1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093999-Parent1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. UCH-L1 is a deubiquitination enzyme. UCH-L1 is primarily expressed in brain nerve cells and is recognized as a neuronal iconic protein. Recently, studies found that UCH-L1 is an important regulator of synaptic structure <xref rid="pone.0093999-Cartier1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The inhibition of UCH-L1 could produce significant and dramatic alterations in synaptic protein distribution and spine morphology, which increased spine size and decreased spine density. UCH-L1 was found to be downregulated in early Alzheimer's brains. UCH-L1 overexpression in the mouse Alzheimer's model could help to recover synaptic function and improve cognitive function of mice <xref rid="pone.0093999-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Synaptopodin, as abovementioned, has also been confirmed to be necessary for synaptic structure in the brain <xref rid="pone.0093999-Deller1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Mundel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Using immunohistochemical methods, synaptopodin was found distributed in the postsynaptic densities and in the associated dendritic spines in exclusively telencephalic synapses; this distribution of synaptopodin is fully consistent with the distribution of actin <xref rid="pone.0093999-Mundel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The change in synaptopodin expression is also closely associated with neuropathy <xref rid="pone.0093999-Deller3" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p><p>As discussed above, from the viewpoint of both cells sharing same mechanism of process formation, we supposed that the expression of these proteins in podocytes should closely associate with the regulation of morphology and function of foot processes. Therefore, we knockdown the expression of NSE, nestin, UCH-L1 and synaptopodin. The results showed that there appeared significant changes in podocytes, with blunt cell edges, decreased dendritic processes and a disordered arrangement of intracellular actin fibers. This observation suggests that NSE, nestin, UCH-L1 and synaptopodin play an important role in maintaining the special shape of podocytes dendritic processes. In fact, all of these proteins are altered in kidney diseases <xref rid="pone.0093999-MeyerSchwesinger2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-Bertelli1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. For example, in our previous work and in other laboratories, UCH-L1 expression was upregulated in several types of nephritis in podocytes <xref rid="pone.0093999-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093999-MeyerSchwesinger2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In this study, we blocked UCH-L1 in cultured podocytes; the changes in these cells paralleled the observations in human nephritis. These data strongly support the hypothesis that these neuronal iconic proteins also play an important role in podocyte injury. These proteins are a potential novel target for studies of podocyte injury and podocytopathy.</p><p>In addition, the expression of NeuN and S100 were also downregulated in podocytes; however, there were no significant changes in the cell cytoskeleton. This observation prompted the thought that not all of the neuronal proteins participated in cytoskeleton construction. Some of these neuronal proteins might have other biological functions in podocytes.</p><p>After treatment with Adriamycin, severe damage of the podocyte cytoskeleton was observed, which notably resembled the morphological changes in cultured podocytes with the blocked expression of NSE, nestin, UCH-L1 and synaptopodin. Simultaneously, the Western blotting showed that the protein levels of NSE, nestin, UCH-L1 and synaptopodin decreased in a time-dependent manner. This decrease may be the responsive reaction of podocytes because of the destruction of the cytoskeleton and the reduction of some associated proteins. These studies further proved that NSE, nestin, UCH-L1 and synaptopodin are important regulators that are involved in the mechanism of process formation. However, the molecular mechanisms of the process still require further investigation.</p><p>In summary, in the present work, some neuronal iconic proteins, such as NSE, nestin, NeuN and UCH-L1, could be expressed in podocytes. The reduction of these proteins expression by mRNA block or by stimulation of Adriamycin could induce the impairment of podocytes cytoskeleton and its morphology. This data proves that neuronal iconic proteins are important for the morphology and function of podocytes. In recent years, there has been great progress in the mechanism of nerve injury. Therefore, we can learn from the research progress of the nervous system, which is instructive for us to understand and clarify the podocyte injury mechanism. This research will be a good foundation for the further study of the pathogenesis of podocyte injury and for the exploration of novel therapeutic targets for nephropathy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Prof. Muyi Guo, Dr. Xiurong Zhang, and Dr. Xiao Sun for their help with techniques and for their advice.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0093999-Kang1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
