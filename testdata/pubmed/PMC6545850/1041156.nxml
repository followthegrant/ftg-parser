The anti-tumor activity of GSK2879552 and GSK-LSD1, potent, selective irreversible inactivators of LSD1, has previously been described. Inhibition of LSD1 results in a cytostatic growth inhibitory effect in a range of acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. To enhance the therapeutic potential of LSD1 inhibition in this disease setting, a combination of LSD1 inhibition and all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid was explored. All-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid is currently approved for use in acute promyelocytic leukemia in which it promotes differentiation of abnormal blast cells into normal white blood cells. Combined treatment with all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid and GSK2879552 results in synergistic effects on cell proliferation, markers of differentiation, and, most importantly, cytotoxicity. Ultimately the combination potential for LSD1 inhibition and ATRA will require validation in acute myeloid leukemia patients, and clinical studies to assess this are currently underway.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) is characterized by excessive growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells that reach varying stages of differentiation depending on the subtype. With the exception of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) few patients with AML are cured, despite treatment that includes high-dose induction and consolidation therapy and even, for some, bone marrow transplant.<sup><xref rid="b1-1041156" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The disease is classified using the French-American-British (FAB) classification that divides AML into eight subtypes (M0 to M7) based on the differentiation status of the tumor cells as well as the cell type from which the cancer arises. The World Health Organization (WHO) further distinguishes AML types by also considering somatic genetic alterations.<sup><xref rid="b2-1041156" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> For most subtypes, first-line treatment consists of chemotherapy followed, in some instances, with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).<sup><xref rid="b3-1041156" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Due to the intensity of HSCT treatment, this approach is often only recommended for younger patients or those deemed fit enough to tolerate it. Even among the younger patient population, the 5-year overall survival is only approximately 40%.<sup><xref rid="b3-1041156" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> For patients over the age of 60, only approximately 20% survive;<sup><xref rid="b4-1041156" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> therefore, more effective second-line treatment options are needed.</p><p>Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a histone-modifying enzyme that is a member of the monoamine oxidase family.<sup><xref rid="b5-1041156" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> LSD1 has been shown to suppress gene expression through demethylation of mono and dimethyl groups present on lysine 4 of histone H3.<sup><xref rid="b6-1041156" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> LSD1 is a critical regulator of hematopoiesis, in part, through interaction with the transcription factors GFI-1 and GFI-1b. This LSD1-containing complex regulates expression of key myeloid differentiation genes and ultimately controls hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation.<sup><xref rid="b7-1041156" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> LSD1 is frequently over-expressed in human cancers, including AML, and knockdown of LSD1 has been shown to inhibit the growth of AML cells.<sup><xref rid="b1-1041156" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1041156" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-1041156" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> These data have spurred interest in LSD1 as a potential target for treatment of AML. As previously reported, potent, selective, irreversible inactivators of LSD1 have been developed, and among the cancer cell lines evaluated, these show selective anti-proliferative activity in SCLC and AML cell lines.<sup><xref rid="b9-1041156" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b11-1041156" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-1041156" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Preclinical data such as these have led to the clinical development of LSD1 inhibitors in relapsed, refractory AML patients.</p><p>To build upon the therapeutic potential of LSD1 inhibition in AML, rational combination hypotheses and combinations with standard of care agents were considered. All-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid (ATRA) is used clinically to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of AML, and has been shown to be hugely successful, achieving curative effects in this disease subtype.<sup><xref rid="b14-1041156" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> ATRA triggers the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR&#x003b1;) to bind to retinoic acid response elements found in the genome and initiate transcription of target genes, including those important for differentiation.<sup><xref rid="b15-1041156" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> APL is characterized by a PML-RAR&#x003b1; fusion that inactivates RAR&#x003b1; by preventing it from its normal binding and thus locking the tumor in an undifferentiated state. ATRA degrades this fusion, allowing RAR&#x003b1; to activate its target genes, leading to differentiation and apoptosis of the cancer cells.<sup><xref rid="b16-1041156" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-1041156" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Many clinical trials have attempted to extend the use of ATRA into non-APL AML, but unfortunately these have demonstrated very little success.<sup><xref rid="b18-1041156" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Since the discovery of LSD1 and the characterization of its role in hematopoiesis, there has been speculation as to the possibility of combining an inhibitor of LSD1 with ATRA. One report demonstrated that combination of ATRA with knockdown of LSD1 or tranylcypromine, a non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor with weak LSD1 inhibitory activity, leads to transcriptional activation of many RAR target genes that normally lack methylation of H3K4me2 at their promoters.<sup><xref rid="b19-1041156" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-1041156" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> This combination also had more robust anti-leukemic activity than either treatment alone in the model tested.<sup><xref rid="b19-1041156" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>The current report demonstrates the synergistic activity of a combination of a selective, potent inhibitor of LSD1, GSK2879552, with ATRA, and characterizes the mechanism associated with this combination. As a single agent, LSD1 inhibition promotes differentiation of AML cell lines and synergistic differentiation activity is observed when used in combination with ATRA across AML subtypes. This combination also enhances LSD1 inhibitor-mediated growth inhibition of AML cell lines and primary patient samples. Most importantly, treatment of AML cell lines with an LSD1 inhibitor and ATRA results in synergistic cytotoxicity and caspase-mediated cell death. Collectively, these data suggest that this combination may result in greater efficacy and may be more likely to translate to response in AML patients than LSD1 inhibitor monotherapy. Moreover, this combination may expand the therapeutic potential of ATRA, a proven therapy, to non-APL AML patients. Clinical studies are currently underway to test this hypothesis in relapsed, refractory AML patients (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifiers: 02273102, 02717884, 02842827</italic>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and human biological samples</title><p>Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) or the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellbulturen (DSMZ).

As shown previously, GSK2879552 and a structurally similar compound, GSK-LSD1, are both potent, selective inactivators of LSD1.<sup><xref rid="b11-1041156" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> GSK2879552 was analyzed for its ability to inhibit tumor cell growth in a 10-day proliferation assay using CellTiter-Glo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1041156">Figure 1A</xref>). The concentration required to achieve half of the maximal observed effect (EC<sub>50</sub>) as well as the maximum percent inhibition were determined for each cell line. GSK2879552 inhibited cell growth with a potent average EC<sub>50</sub> value of 137&#x000b1;30 nM across 20 cell lines. The average maximum inhibition was 62&#x000b1;5% suggesting complete cytostasis is not achieved by ten days with LSD1 inhibition alone. By comparing 6-day to 10-day proliferation assay results (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>), it is evident that an increase in maximum inhibition can be achieved with longer treatment, indicating that the biological consequences of LSD1 inhibition, including growth effects, may require time to be fully revealed. Several studies were conducted to determine if the lag in inhibition of cancer cell line growth is due to a delayed effect on all cells or involves some cell death. Cell cycle evaluation of MOLM-13 cells treated with a titration of GSK-LSD1 for six days revealed an increase in cells in G1 phase with a concomitant decrease in S phase (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S1C</italic>). No appreciable accumulation of cells in sub-G1 was observed. To confirm the cell cycle findings, a BrdU assay that measures actively dividing cells by incorporation of BrdU into DNA during S-phase was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1041156">Figure 1B</xref>). MOLM-13 cells treated for six days had a dose responsive decrease in BrdU signal (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.9&#x000b1;0.9 nM). Finally, induction of caspase 3/7 was assessed to determine if cells were activating the apoptosis pathway. Seven AML cell lines were treated for up to six days with GSK2879552. In six of seven AML cell lines there was no appreciable induction of caspase 3/7 at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1041156">Figure 1C</xref>). These data indicate that the growth inhibitory effects of LSD1 inhibitors are due to a slowing of cell division and not significant killing of tumor cells.</p><fig id="f1-1041156" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Inactivation of LSD1 inhibits the growth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells by releasing myeloid differentiation block.

The addition of ATRA synergistically enhanced the differentiation effect achieved with GSK2879552 through increased expression of myeloid cell surface marker CD11b. This is achieved at lower GSK2879552 concentrations than required when AML cells are treated without ATRA thus potentially widening the therapeutic index of LSD1 inhibition. Importantly this effect is observed across AML subtypes and is not exclusive to APL. Gene expression analysis revealed enrichment of the hematopoietic and CAM pathways further indicating that a primary mechanism in association with this combination involves differentiation. Pushing AML cells to differentiate with a combination of GSK2879552 and ATRA may offer profound implications for the success of AML treatment options for patients beyond APL or those with IDH2 mutations.</p><p>While enhancing differentiation provides an attractive rationale for pursuing the combination of LSD1 inhibitors with ATRA in the clinic, the observation that the combination promotes cytotoxic response provides an additional rationale to explore this combination in AML patients. Treatment of non-APL AML cell lines with GSK2879552 and ATRA results in synergistic cleavage of caspases 3 and 7, the executioner caspases.<sup><xref rid="b35-1041156" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The synergistic cell death occurs after the observed changes in cell surface marker expression and may suggest that as cells reach terminal differentiation, this process is a signal to the cells to undergo apoptosis in a manner similar to the life cycle of normal immune cells.<sup><xref rid="b36-1041156" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Given that the gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the lysosome and mTOR pathways are also affected with the combination, another possibility is that the differentiation triggers an autophagic response that leads to a switch to apoptosis.<sup><xref rid="b28-1041156" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Importantly, applying the combination to primary patient samples <italic>ex vivo</italic> successfully illustrates that a beneficial combination effect is not restricted to cultured cell lines. The broad response of cell lines and primary AML samples to the combination does preclude the ability to identify a biomarker preclinically. Pretreatment biopsy assessment will, therefore, be required to determine which patients will most likely respond to the combination. Taken together, these results highlight the possibility of achieving a cure in AML through treatment with LSD1 inhibitors and ATRA.</p></sec>
