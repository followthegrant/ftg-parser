Biallelic deleterious germline mutations in MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) lead to constitutional MMR deficiency syndrome (CMMR-D).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>We are reporting two cases of CMMR-D in siblings of a family, who developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with glioblastoma multiforme and ALL with alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) (first case in CMMR-D spectrum) respectively.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><sec disp-level="2" id="sec2-1"><title>Sibling 1</title><p>An 8-year-old girl presented in 2006 with fever, petechiae, and epistaxis for 2 weeks.

Then, for further confirmation, germline mutational analysis of the MMR genes should be considered after counseling their parents.</p><p>As very few hematologists/oncologists are aware of the CMMR-D, it should be kept in mind as a possibility while coming across relevant cases.</p><p>The diagnosis of CMMR-D should be confirmed by gene-specific mutation analysis. Mutation analysis will facilitate identification and surveillance of heterozygous and homozygous individuals in family and help in prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. R.
