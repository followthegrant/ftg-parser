These 2 properties offer the opportunity to make highly effective, easy to produce multi-valent vaccines. OMVs can be loaded with foreign antigens by targeting protein expression either to the outer membrane or to the periplasm of the OMV-producing strain. Periplasmic expression is simple and relatively efficient but leads to the accumulation of recombinant antigens in the lumen of OMVs and the ability of OMVs carrying internalized antigens to induce antigen-specific antibody responses has been only marginally investigated and is considered to be sub-optimal.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>We have systematically analyzed in qualitative and quantitative terms antibody responses induced by OMVs carrying different heterologous antigens in their lumen. <italic>Group A Streptococcus</italic> (GAS) Slo, SpyCEP, Spy0269 and <italic>Group B Streptococcus</italic> (GBS) SAM_1372 were fused to the OmpA leader sequence for secretion and expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.

Upon mice immunization, OMVs induced high functional antibody titers against the recombinant proteins. Furthermore, immunization with Slo-OMVs and SpyCEP-OMVs protected mice against GAS lethal challenge.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The efficiency of antigen delivery to the vesicular lumen via periplasmic expression, and the surprisingly high immunogenicity and protective activity of OMVs carrying internalized recombinant antigens further strengthens the potential of OMVs as vaccine platform.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>outer membrane vesicles</kwd><kwd>vaccines</kwd><kwd>heterologous antigens</kwd><kwd>periplasmic expression</kwd><kwd>Group A Streptococcus</kwd><kwd>Group B Streptococcus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are closed spheroid particles of heterogeneous size (10&#x02013;300 nm in diameter) released by all Gram-negative bacteria and generated through the &#x0201c;budding out&#x0201d; of the bacterial outer membrane. The production of OMVs was originally described as an essential step for rapid adaptation to environmental changes, but a multitude of other functions have now been attributed to OMVs, including delivery of toxins and virulence factors to host cells, inter-species and intra-species cell-to-cell cross-talk, biofilm formation, genetic transformation and defence against innate and adaptive host immune responses (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>OMVs purified from several pathogens, including <italic>Neisseria, Salmonella, Pseudomonas, Vibrio cholerae, Burkholderia</italic>, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, induce potent protective immune responses against the pathogens they derive from, and highly efficacious anti-<italic>Neisseria</italic> OMV-based vaccines are already available for human use (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Such remarkable protection is attributed to 3 key features of OMVs. First, they carry surface-associated antigens, usually including protective antigens. Second, they are readily phagocytosed by professional antigen-presenting cells, allowing efficient presentation of OMV-derived peptides. This results in efficient elicitation of antibodies and extracellular antigen mediated CD4+ T cell response against OMV proteins. For instance, mice immunized with <italic>Salmonella</italic> OMVs develop robust <italic>Salmonella</italic>-specific B- and T-cell responses, and OMVs also stimulate IFN-&#x003b3; production by a large proportion of CD4+ T cells in mice previously infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic>, indicating that OMVs are an abundant source of antigens recognized by <italic>Salmonella</italic>-specific CD4+ T cells (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Third, OMVs carry many pathogen-associated-molecular patterns (PAMPs) which, by binding to pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), play a key role in stimulating innate immunity and promoting adaptive immune responses (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). An additional key feature of OMVs is the possibility to manipulate their protein content by genetic engineering. Kesty and Kuehn (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) demonstrated that <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> outer membrane protein Ail assembled on OMVs&#x02019; surfaces when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and that the GFP fluorescence protein fused to the &#x0201c;twin-arginine transport&#x0201d; (Tat) signal sequence was incorporated in the OMV lumen. Furthermore, several heterologous antigens have been successfully exported to the surface of OMVs when fused to the &#x003b2;-barrel forming auto transporter AIDA and to the haemolysin ClyA, 2 proteins that naturally compartmentalize in <italic>E. coli</italic> OMVs (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>For a full blown development of OMVs as vaccine platform, a number of issues are yet to be addressed. Among them there are 2 relevant questions. First, although strategies to load OMVs with recombinant antigens have been described, their general applicability remains to be demonstrated. Second, recombinant antigens can theoretically be engineered (a) to reach the lumen of OMVs, either as soluble proteins or associated to the inner leaflet of the membrane and (b) to be associated to the membrane facing the external milieu. However, how protein compartmentalization in OMVs affects antibody responses deserves further investigation.</p><p>In this work, we addressed the question whether compartmentalization of recombinant antigens in the lumen of <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived OMVs represents a broadly applicable approach to induce protective antibody responses. To this aim, we selected a group of heterologous antigens and we show that all of them can be incorporated in the lumen of <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived OMVs in a functional conformation. Furthermore, we show that mouse immunization with engineered OMVs induces functional antibodies and protective immune responses. Altogether our data strengthen the potential of OMVs as vaccine platform in that they demonstrate that complex cloning strategies to deliver recombinant antigens to the OMV surface are not strictly necessary to promote effective immunological responses.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>HK-100 and BL21(DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37&#x000b0;C and used for cloning and expression experiments, respectively.

The obtained linear fragment, in which the antibiotic resistance gene was flanked by the upstream and downstream regions of <italic>ompA</italic> gene, was used to transform BL21(DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> (made electro-competent by 3 washing steps in cold water). <italic>&#x00394;ompA</italic> mutant colonies were selected by plating transformed bacteria on LB plates containing 30&#x000b5;g/ml Cm.

The first criterion addresses whether specific categories of proteins are more or less prone to reach the periplasm and be delivered to the OMVs. The second criterion was selected to exploit functional activity as a surrogate for antigen folding. Finally, the third criterion allows evaluating the quantity and quality of antibody responses elicited by the recombinant antigens once incorporated inside the OMVs.</p><p>All genes were cloned into the pETOmpA plasmid, a derivative of pET21b carrying the coding sequence of the <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpA signal peptide downstream from the T7 inducible promoter, thus allowing N-terminal fusion of the <italic>E. coli</italic> periplasmic secretion sequence to the protein of interest. Because of the presence of the OmpA leader sequence, all proteins (except TEM1 beta-lactamase) were cloned without their natural secretory signal. Furthermore, the C-terminal cell-wall anchoring domains of SpyCEP and SAM_1372 (amino acids 1,614&#x02013;1,647 and amino acids 620&#x02013;674, respectively) were also eliminated.

This is an important prerequisite to guarantee that, when OMVs are used in immunization, the antigens can elicit functional antibody responses. As surrogate of antigen folding, we measured the functional activity of Slo, SpyCEP and R-TEM &#x003b2;-lactamase. In particular, Slo haemolytic activity was tested by incubating increasing concentrations of Slo-OMVs with sheep blood erythrocytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Fig. 4</xref>a, 100% haemolysis was observed when 50 &#x000b5;g of OMVs (total protein content) were added to the reaction mixture. Considering that this amount of OMVs corresponds to approximately 2 &#x000b5;g of Slo, the kinetics of haemolysis was in line with that previously reported using purified recombinant Slo (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The enzymatic activity of OMVs-containing SpyCEP was measured by incubating human IL-8 (50 &#x000b5;g/ml) with Triton-permeabilized OMVs and following the hydrolysis of IL-8 by SDS-PAGE. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Fig. 4</xref>b (lane 3), IL-8 was completely cleaved after 30 minutes&#x02019; incubation with 4.5 &#x000b5;g of OMVs (corresponding to approximately 450 ng of SpyCEP). As in the case of Slo, the specific activity of OMV-internalized SpyCEP appeared to be similar to recombinant SpyCEP purified from the <italic>E. coli</italic> cytoplasm (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Finally, to determine the &#x003b2;-lactamase activity in OMVs, the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate nitrocefin was investigated after incubation with vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Fig. 4</xref>c). Again, estimating that &#x003b2;-lactamase corresponded to approximately 5% of total OMV proteins, the specific activity of the enzyme in OMVs was similar to the one of purified R-TEM &#x003b2;-lactamase. Interestingly, assuming that the specific activity of R-TEM in OMVs is comparable to the specific activity of the purified enzyme, we estimated that 23 ng of &#x003b2;-lactamase were present in 1 &#x000b5;g of OMV, corresponding to 2.5% of total proteins.

To this aim, mice were i.p. immunized 3 times at 2-week intervals with 25 &#x000b5;g of OMVs and antigen-specific antibody titers were measured collecting blood samples 2 weeks after the last dose. For these experiments, the immunogenicity of Slo<sub>dm</sub>-OMV, SpyCEP-OMV and SAM_1372-OMVs was investigated.

When the 20 &#x000b5;g doses of Slo<sub>dm</sub> and SpyCEP were mixed together with 25 &#x000b5;g of &#x0201c;empty OMVs,&#x0201d; an appreciable increase (approximately 5-fold) in antibody titers was observed highlighting the strong adjuvanticity of the vesicles. As far as SAM_1372-OMVs are concerned, they induced SAM_1372 antibody titers that were approximately 10-fold lower than those elicited by vaccination with Alum-formulated recombinant SAM_1372 (10 &#x000b5;g/dose). This might reflect the relatively poor expression of this antigen in OMVs, estimated to be in the range of 0.5% of total OMV proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Fig. 1</xref>d).

Discussion</title><p>Kesty and Kuehn (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) have been the first to demonstrate that the protein content of bacterial OMVs can be manipulated by targeting heterologous proteins to the outer membrane and/or to the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria. In light of the potent adjuvant property of OMVs, which stimulate cell-mediated and humoral immune responses when given both systemically and mucosally, the pivotal observation by Kesty and Kuehn pointed towards OMVs as a potentially ideal platform to develop highly effective, easy to produce multi-valent vaccines.</p><p>However, for OMVs to become broadly applicable, a number of questions remain to be addressed. Among them, it is important to demonstrate the robustness of the genetic engineering strategies for antigen delivery to the OMVs and to identify the most appropriate strategy for inducing the desired immune responses (cell-mediated immunity and/or antibody responses).</p><p>Theoretically, the best way to elicit antigen-specific antibody responses using engineered OMVs is to localize recombinant antigens on the vesicle surface, thus providing the best antigen accessibility for B cell receptor binding. However, targeting proteins to bacterial outer membrane can be challenging and usually requires the construction of chimera between antigen and endogenous outer membrane proteins (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The success of such fusion strategies usually inversely correlates with the size of the passenger protein. An easier approach to deliver recombinant antigens to OMVs would be to express them in the bacterial periplasm. Since periplasmic proteins get trapped in the OMV lumen during vesicle formation (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), the addition of a sec-dependent leader sequence to the N-termini of antigens should be sufficient to guarantee their incorporation into OMVs, provided that no selective periplasmic protein inclusion/exclusion occurs during vesiculation. However, luminal localization of antigens could be a sub-optimal way to induce an antigen-specific antibody response, unless membrane integrity is partially lost at the site of OMVs injection with concomitant exposure of their cargo to B cells.</p><p>In this work, we focused our attention on antigen delivery to the OMVs with the aim of establishing in a systematic manner (a) how efficiently heterologous protective antigens can be incorporated into the lumen of the vesicles and (b) to what extent antigens localized in the OMV lumen can elicit functional, antigen-specific antibody responses.</p><p>As far as the first question is concerned, our data demonstrate that all antigens selected in this study could be delivered to the <italic>E. coli</italic> vesicles by hooking them to the <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpA leader sequence for secretion. In addition, 3 heterologous antigens were previously reported to reach the OMVs via periplasmic expression (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and we have recently achieved OMV delivery of 5 additional protective antigens from gram-positive pathogens (unpublished). In light of the foregoing results, we conclude that most bacterial antigens eliciting antibody-mediated protection can be successfully incorporated into <italic>E. coli</italic> OMVs via the sec-dependent pathway of periplasmic expression. This conclusion also implies that, differently from that proposed for at least some outer membrane proteins (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), vesiculation does not use a selective process for periplasmic protein incorporation in OMVs.</p><p>The high rate of success in targeting recombinant antigens to the lumen of OMVs (in essence, all heterologous antigens we have tested so far were successfully incorporated into bacterial vesicles) could appear surprising. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that binding of the leader peptide to the ATP motor protein SecA is necessary but not sufficient for protein secretion through the sec-dependent pathway and that concomitant SecA binding by conserved motifs in mature proteins is also required (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). This is why many cytoplasmic proteins that do not carry SecA-binding motifs cannot reach the periplasm even when fused to leader peptides. To explain the efficiency of our OMV protein delivery, it has to be pointed out that we focused our attention on heterologous bacterial antigens inducing protective antibody responses. Many of these antigens, such as those selected for this study, belong to the category of proteins that are naturally secreted or surface-exposed by the sec-dependent pathway. Therefore, these proteins are the ideal candidates to be expressed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> periplasm as long as an <italic>E. coli</italic>-compatible leader sequence is fused to their N-termini. It is in fact known that leader sequences can be species-specific, and in particular leader sequences of Gram-negative bacteria differ from those of gram-positive species (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In this study, we have used the OmpA leader sequence for antigen secretion, but other leader sequences are expected to work as well and indeed to achieve optimal secretion levels we are currently testing each antigen with a battery of different <italic>E. coli</italic> leader sequences.</p><p>Antigens inducing antibody-mediated protective activity include members of the integral membrane family and proteins that are secreted via alternative secretion pathways. Although not tested in this work, such proteins are likely to be less prone to OMV delivery through fusion to leader sequences, and other strategies might be required to achieve their expression in OMVs.</p><p>The second question we addressed in this study is whether immunization with OMVs carrying antigens in their lumen can induce antigen-specific antibodies. Theoretically speaking, localizing antigens inside the vesicles should prevent antigen-specific B cell binding and the consequent proper stimulation of antibodies. To the best of our knowledge, only 2 groups have so far analyzed immune responses against luminal recombinant antigens (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Both groups have reported the elicitation of antigen-specific antibodies, but titers were relatively low and the authors reached the conclusion that, for practical vaccine application, antigens should be localized on the OMV surface. In the case of pneumococcal PspA expression in Salmonella OMVs, the authors presented evidence that the protein was released into the growth culture supernatants in addition to being localized in the periplasm/OMV lumen. Therefore, the observed PspA-specific antibodies could have been at least partially generated by the secreted protein &#x0201c;contaminating&#x0201d; the OMV preparation.</p><p>Our data unequivocally demonstrate that recombinant antigens delivered to the lumen of OMVs do induce effective antibody responses. Indeed, antibody titers were often close to those obtained with 20 &#x000b5;g of recombinant proteins, corresponding in some cases to 1 log higher antigen amounts than those carried in the 25 &#x000b5;g of OMVs doses used for mouse immunization. Most important, antibodies were characterized by a functional activity which could be greater than the one observed with sera from animals immunized with the corresponding recombinant proteins. This is particularly evident for SAM_1372-OMVs: despite the fact that the protein induced low ELISA titers (most likely because of its poor expression in OMVs) antibodies had an excellent functional activity in terms of bacterial opsonophagocytic killing.</p><p>Elicitation of high-quality antibodies translated into good protection <italic>in vivo</italic>, as judged by the ability of animals immunized with SpyCEP-OMVs and Slo-OMVs to survive GAS lethal challenges. At least 2 important factors contribute to such potent functional responses. First, all antigens used in this work preserved their native conformation when expressed in the lumen of OMVs, as deducible from the fact that the antigens had fully enzymatic/toxic activity. This guaranteed the elicitation of conformational antibodies capable of binding and neutralizing the antigen toxic activities. Second, and particularly important, recombinant OMVs have the intrinsic ability to co-deliver antigen and adjuvant to the same antigen-presenting cells, thus allowing the optimal activation of antigen-specific B- and T-cells (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The relevance of antigen/adjuvant co-delivery can be appreciated when the inhibition of SpyCEP proteolytic activity by antibodies induced by 2 injections of different SpyCEP-containing vaccine formulations was compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Fig. 7</xref>). Sera from SpyCEP-OMVs immunized animals showed a higher neutralization activity with respect to both Alum-formulated recombinant SpyCEP and SpyCEP mixed with &#x0201c;empty&#x0201d; OMVs. While the antigen-adjuvant co-delivery concept can explain how APCs taking up SpyCEP-OMVs optimally stimulate the generation of SpyCEP-specific plasma cells and memory B cells, the presentation of a luminal protein to na&#x000ef;ve B cells necessarily requires that the integrity of OMVs is partially compromised in order to expose the protein to B cell receptors. Based on the foregoing, we propose that OMVs are taken up at the site of injection by APCs, which present the antigen-specific peptides to T cells. At the same time, a fraction of OMVs are degraded before being phagocytosed by APCs and this allows antigen presentation to na&#x000ef;ve B cells. Antigen-specific B cells are finally stimulated to become effector and memory B cells by interaction with antigen-specific Helper T cells generated by those APCs that have taken up intact vesicles. According to this model, the ratio between intact and degraded OMVs at the site of injection is expected to be important for the generation of a sufficiently large population of antigen-specific T- and B-cells and, ultimately, a good antibody response. The extent of vesicle degradation should be determined by a number of factors, including site of immunization, formulation and nature of OMVs. In this respect, it has to be pointed out that the strains used for vesicle production and engineering usually carry specific mutations that confer an OMV-overproducing phenotype. Many of these mutations have a direct effect on the integrity of the outer membrane or on the interaction between outer and inner membranes (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In this study we used a BL21 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain carrying the <italic>ompA</italic> gene deletion, which results in the removal of one of the major membrane proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>. It is possible that the OMVs derived from this mutant are sufficiently robust/fragile to induce the good antigen-specific antibody responses we observed in our work. Other mutations could generate vesicles with different chemical&#x02013;physical properties and this could ultimately affect immune responses both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p><p>The reactogenicity of OMVs and the implication of such reactogenicity in OMV-based vaccine development deserve one last comment. It is well known that OMVs carry large amount of LPS. We measured the LPS content in our OMV preparations and determined an LPS:protein ratio of approximately 0.5 (50 ng of LPS/100 ng of OMV proteins). This number is consistent with that recently reported by Park and co-workers (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Such LPS concentrations are toxic in mice and 20 &#x000b5;g of <italic>E. coli</italic> OMVs injected intraperitoneally have been shown to be sufficient to rapidly kill animals (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This is the reason why, to decrease OMV reactogenicity, throughout this work OMV immunization was carried out in the presence of Alum, which absorbs LPS and prevents its systemic dissemination. However, for human use, OMVs must be detoxified. This can be achieved in at least 2 ways. One possibility is to remove LPS using detergent extraction. For instance, the meningococcal OMV-based vaccines available on the market are produced by deoxycholate treatment of whole bacteria. A second approach is to use OMVs deriving from mutant strains that carry detoxified variants of LPS. Mutations that produce detoxified OMVs have been described for <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Interestingly, a synthetic biology methodology has recently been reported that allows modulating the innate immune response of LPS by engineering the LPS biosynthetic pathway of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). We are pursuing similar approaches to design OMVs with TLR4 agonist activities tailored on the basis of specific vaccine needs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Giorgio Corsi for artwork and Elvira Ianni for the generation of <italic>&#x00394;omp</italic>A strain.</p></ack><sec id="S0005"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>The authors have not received any benefits from industry to conduct this study.
