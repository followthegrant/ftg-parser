Fibrocytes secrete profibrotic mediators including periostin; a matricellular protein that regulates cellular interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) components. In bleomycin-induced fibrosis, periostin deficiency in structural or hematopoietic cells limits development of pulmonary fibrosis. To determine if hematopoietic-derived fibrocytes might secrete soluble factors to activate structural myofibroblast differentiation, wild-type (WT) fibroblasts were treated with conditioned medium from fibrocytes isolated from bleomycin-treated WT or periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

IPF is a chronic progressive parenchymal lung disease of unknown origin, with mean survival rate of 3-5 years after diagnosis. Prevalence and mortality rates are increasing globally <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The cellular mechanisms leading to IPF remain unclear but a commonly held paradigm describes continuous cycles of injury to the alveolar epithelium leading to dysregulated repair. Prominent features of this dysregulated repair include fibroblast differentiation, myofibroblast accumulation and excessive collagen deposition in the alveolar space <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Mediators such as growth factors and cytokines from different cell types contribute to the persistence of activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Based on our current knowledge, bone marrow-derived collagen producing cells (e.g. fibrocytes and other collagen producing cells) play a significant role in the development of lung fibrosis <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Fibrocytes respond to a number of cytokines and chemokines that are typically associated with migration and activation of inflammatory cells<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Fibrocytes are hematopoietic bone marrow-derived cells that express both mesenchymal and leukocyte markers. They circulate in the peripheral blood and can be isolated from tissues. Cultured fibrocytes have been shown to express a number of ECM proteins including collagen 1, collagen 3 and fibronectin <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In addition, fibrocytes also express a number of chemokine receptors, including CXCR4, CCR7 and CCR2, which may contribute to the recruitment and activation of fibrocytes resulting in migration to damaged tissues <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Although several reports indicate that fibrocytes express type I collagen, others have suggested that uptake of secreted type I collagen by hematopoietic cells characterizes the fibrocyte population <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">A more recent study demonstrated that cells of hematopoietic origin produce type I collagen but are not a necessary source of type I collagen during experimental lung fibrosis <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Kleaveland et al. illustrated that fibrocytes can efficiently uptake type I collagen even though the underlying mechanism is not clearly understood <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Adoptive transfer of fibrocytes leads to augmented fibrosis in a FITC-induced mouse model and several studies have found a correlation between increased numbers of fibrocytes and worse disease progression<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>-<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Recently, fibrocytes were shown to contribute to the progression of pulmonary fibrosis without differentiating to myofibroblasts themselves using a transforming growth factor alpha model of fibrosis <sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Additionally, Garcia de alba <italic>et al</italic>. also showed that fibrocytes contributed to increased mRNA levels of ECM proteins in both fibrosis and chronic pneumonitis <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Work from our laboratory demonstrated that fibrocytes in circulation of IPF patients are major producers of the matricellular protein, periostin, and that periostin accumulates in the lung tissue of IPF patients <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Periostin, also known as osteoblast-specific factor 2, is a recently characterized matricellular protein that binds to components of the ECM including type I collagen and fibronectin and has been shown to be involved in collagen fibrillogenesis<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Periostin protein transmits signals from the ECM to the cell by binding to cellular receptors such as integrins that affect cell adhesion, proliferation, migration and tissue angiogenesis <sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. It has been reported that periostin promotes cancer cell invasion and metastasis through the integrin/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway, leading to the development of various tumors <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Work from our laboratory and others have shown that there are increased circulating periostin levels in IPF patients compared to controls <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Our work further showed that the increased periostin expression in IPF tissues was localized to active areas of fibrosis and that IPF patients also showed increased percentages of periostin-expressing fibrocytes and monocytes in the blood <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Chimeric mouse studies showed that both structural and hematopoietic sources of periostin were important in protecting periostin-deficient mice from bleomycin-induced fibrosis <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Although periostin has diverse functions, it is becoming increasingly clear that periostin is upregulated in lung tissue in the context of several respiratory diseases <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. At present, the precise function of periostin in the lung has not been fully elucidated. In this study we used bleomycin to establish fibrosis in mice, and then analyzed how hematopoietic-derived fibrocytes might signal structural myofibroblast differentiation through their ability to secrete periostin or other periostin-regulated soluble factors. We explored the use of periostin-deficient fibrocytes in adoptive transfer experiments as well as the use of integrin blocking antibodies to demonstrate that periostin interacts with different receptors on fibrocytes and fibroblasts and that periostin secretion by fibrocytes is important for the exacerbation of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P5">Wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) age and sex-matched mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).

To assess whether periostin also up-regulates TGF&#x003b2;1 production in purified fibroblasts and fibrocytes, we isolated these cell types from lung mince cultures from na&#x000ef;ve mouse lungs and treated with recombinant periostin (500 ng/mL) in SFM. Treatment of WT fibrocytes and fibroblasts with periostin lead to increased TGF&#x003b2;1 production as measured by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, treatment of fibroblasts and fibrocytes with recombinant TGF-&#x003b2; (2ng/mL) increased protein production of periostin as measured by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), as well as increased mRNA expression of periostin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Since, periostin and TGF&#x003b2;1 seem to be co-regulating each other, we wanted to assess whether the production of collagen I from fibroblasts and fibrocytes was different in the presence of periostin and if this effect was dependent on TGF-&#x003b2;1 signaling. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates that treatment of murine lung mesenchymal cells with periostin for 48hrs led to a significant increase in mRNA expression for collagen I. Because collagen I mRNA is extremely stable<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, small increases in transcription can lead to significant enhancement of translated protein. However, the increase in collagen I expression was independent of TGF&#x003b2;1 signaling in the fibrocytes compared to the fibroblasts as indicated by treatment with the A8301 TGF-&#x003b2;1 receptor. Additionally, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplemental Figure 1</xref> demonstrates that periostin can influence other extracellular matrix components as well including collagen 3 and fibronectin. Overall these data suggest that TGF&#x003b2;1 and periostin are co-regulating each other but periostin can signal to fibrocytes independently of TGF&#x003b2;1 and that the receptor needed for periostin signaling may be different on fibrocytes compared to fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Decreased integrin expression in fibrocytes from periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice post-bleomycin treatment</title><p id="P18">In many cancers, periostin binds to integrins activating the AKT/PKB and FAK-mediated signaling pathways.

Periostin also functions as a ligand for integrin alphaVbeta3 and alphaVbeta 5 to support adhesion and migration of epithelial cells <sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Because our data suggest that periostin might be signaling differently in fibrocytes vs fibroblasts, we wanted to examine the expression levels of integrins in WT and periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> na&#x000ef;ve lung mesenchymal cells. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A-D</xref>, there is no significant difference in the baseline mRNA expression levels of alpha 1, alpha V, beta 1 and beta 5 integrin levels on fibrocytes and fibroblasts from WT or periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, although in most cases, the expression levels of integrins were lower in fibrocytes than fibroblasts. We next treated WT and periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice intratracheally with saline or bleomycin for 14 days then cultured lung mesenchymal cells, sorted for fibrocytes and assessed mRNA expression for different integrins post-bleomycin treatment. Alpha 1, alpha V and beta 1 were found to be significantly upregulated in WT fibrocytes post bleomycin treatment but beta 5 expression was not altered. None of the integrins were upregulated post-bleomycin in the periostin&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E-H</xref>). To compare the differences in integrin expression on fibrocytes at the protein level, fibrocytes were isolated from bleomycin-treated WT or periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and integrin profiles were analyzed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 A-C</xref>).

We also confirmed lower levels of &#x003b2;1 integrin in periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> fibrocytes by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure. 5D</xref>). There were no statistically significant differences in integrin expression in fibroblasts from WT or periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at the mRNA or protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). To determine how integrin expression profiles correlated with TGF&#x003b2;1 production, we treated fibrocytes with exogenous TGF&#x003b2;1 and found increased mRNA expression for alpha V, alpha 1 and beta 5 in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Expression of these integrins was similarly increased in the periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells treated with TGF&#x003b2;1. In contrast, TGF&#x003b2;1 treatment caused a modest, but not significant increase in beta 1 expression in WT cells, but did not in periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells providing further support that beta 1 integrin expression may be necessary for periostin signaling to fibrocytes in murine lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Next, we treated WT fibrocytes and fibroblasts with periostin in the presence of a beta 1 integrin blocking antibody (102209-Biolegend) and after 48h assessed collagen1 mRNA expression as an indication of mesenchymal cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Fibrocytes treated with periostin in the presence of beta 1 blocking antibody had markedly less collagen I mRNA expression compared to samples treated with periostin and isotype control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, addition of beta 1 integrin blocking antibody to fibroblasts showed no change in collagen I expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Taken together our data suggest periostin signals collagen expression through beta 1 integrin to activate fibrocytes and this is independent of TGF&#x003b2; signaling.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Fibrocytes exacerbate bleomycin-induced fibrosis through paracrine effects and in a periostin-dependent manner</title><p id="P19">We previously showed that fibrocytes augment FITC-induced lung fibrosis <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.

After 24h we analyzed expression of &#x003b1;SMA by Western blot and saw less &#x003b1;SMA expression in WT fibroblasts that were incubated with bleomycin-treated supernatants from periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> fibrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>). To address whether this effect was solely due to periostin or possibly involved other downstream signaling proteins we performed a microarray using a targeted mouse fibrosis array with the goal of identifying differences between the WT and periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> fibrocytes. We saw significant decreases in connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and Lysyl oxidase (LOX) but not platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)&#x003b1; in periostin&#x02212;/&#x02212; fibrocytes. Findings were confirmed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>). In addition, there was a significant increase in CTGF mRNA expression in fibrocytes treated with exogenous periostin; however, in the presence of a beta 1 blocking antibody, periostin could no longer induce a significant increase in CTGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>). There was no change in CTGF mRNA expression in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9D</xref>). Given the importance of CTGF in fibrogenesis, we measured the amount of CTGF protein in the supernatants used in the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref> by ELISA and saw less CTGF in the periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> fibrocytes supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9E</xref>). Taken together these data suggest that fibrocytes in the presence of periostin secrete additional pro-fibrotic mediators such as CTGF that contribute to myofibroblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Periostin signaling is critical for fibrocyte amplification of a profibrotic response</title><p id="P21">We next wanted to determine the impact of periostin signaling to the fibrocytes to induce their profibrotic paracrine mediators. We isolated fibrocytes from bleomycin-treated wild-type mice and cultured them in SFM overnight in the presence or absence of an anti-periostin Ab to neutralize the periostin that is secreted into the supernatant by fibrocytes. When these supernatants were collected and incubated with fibroblasts, the supernatant collected from fibrocytes treated with anti-periostin antibodies could not induce expression of &#x003b1;-SMA to the same extent in the fibroblasts as supernatant from untreated fibrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). These results suggest that autocrine periostin signaling to the fibrocytes themselves is a critical upstream mediator of the release of fibrocyte pro-fibrotic paracrine mediators.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Previous studies have shown that periostin <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice treated with bleomycin intratracheally had decreased collagen content compared with WT littermates <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Both monocytes and fibrocytes likely contribute to the pool of circulating periostin in IPF patients and chimeric mouse studies demonstrated that both the hematopoietic-derived and structural sources of periostin contributed similarly to fibrogenesis <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. These studies suggested that a circulating source of periostin could be playing a significant role in the exacerbation of lung fibrosis, but it was unclear how the lower levels of periostin produced by circulating fibrocytes vs. structural cells (e.g. fibroblasts, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) were influencing disease. Our current findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, and <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggest that fibrocyte profibrotic function is likely via multiple paracrine mechanisms.</p><p id="P23">We examined the effects of fibrocytes in the exacerbation of bleomycin-induced fibrosis in WT and periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Adoptive transfer of WT fibrocytes during established lung fibrosis augmented bleomycin-induced fibrosis in recipient mice, corroborating the earlier studies in a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-induced model of pulmonary fibrosis <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice receiving WT fibrocytes there was a significant increase in lung hydroxyproline, which is evidence of enhanced lung fibrosis relative to the periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that did not receive additional fibrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). We first wondered whether there was a defect in migration of periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> fibrocytes to the injured lung. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref> shows that periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> fibrocytes could be identified in the lungs as easily as WT fibrocytes. Furthermore, we found no defect in the expression of chemokine receptors on the WT vs. the periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> fibrocytes (data not shown). Therefore, the decrease in fibrosis in mice treated with the periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> fibrocytes could not be attributed to a migration defect. Furthermore, we considered the possibility that WT fibrocytes might better be able to differentiate into fibroblasts or myofibroblasts once arriving in the injured lung. While in vitro work has clearly shown that fibrocytes can differentiate into myofibroblasts <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>, our <italic>in vivo</italic> work corroborates recent findings in another model system to suggest fibrocytes are not differentiating into myofibroblasts during fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. We also previously showed that fibrocytes migrate to areas in the lungs adjacent to fibroblasts <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Given that collagen production by circulating cells is also dispensable for development of lung fibrosis <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, these data, when taken together, suggest that fibrocytes work mostly by paracrine mechanisms to induce fibrogenesis. We believe that their ability to migrate to the site of injury by virtue of their chemokine receptors makes them uniquely poised to deliver their pro-fibrotic paracrine factors where they are most effective at stimulating wound repair; yet in the setting of chronic lung disease, these fibrocytes may promote exaggerated wound repair and fibrosis.</p><p id="P24">It is likely that some of the paracrine effects of periostin-producing fibrocytes are due to periostin itself. We have previously shown that periostin can directly influence ECM deposition and migration of lung fibroblasts <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> (and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Another feature of myofibroblasts is their ability to resist apoptosis, likely due to upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) expression <sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Periostin may directly contribute to myofibroblast resistance to apoptosis via stimulating XIAP protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). We recently demonstrated that blocking inhibitor of apoptosis family proteins using pharmacologic interventions attenuated bleomycin-induced fibrosis <sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Thus, periostin likely contributes to the exacerbation of bleomycin-induced fibrosis at least in part via direct effects on fibroblasts.</p><p id="P25">Another possibility is that periostin signals back to the fibrocytes themselves to influence production of other profibrotic mediators. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref> demonstrates that secretion of pro-fibrotic mediators by fibrocytes is blunted in the presence of a neutralizing antibody against periostin. This suggests that periostin plays an important autocrine signaling role to fibrocytes to promote pro-fibrotic mediator release. Additionally, we demonstrate that periostin production by fibrocytes promotes expression of CTGF and LOX post bleomycin-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>) and fibrocytes secrete less CTGF in the absence of periostin post-bleomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9E</xref>). CTGF has previously been described as an activator of mesenchymal cells <sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>-<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>, while LOX is known to promote collagen crosslinking, likely leading to stiffer ECM and more robust matrix-dependent fibroblast activation <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. CTGF can induce a variety of cytokines such as TGF&#x003b2; and vascular endothelial growth factor (reviewed in <sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>), which in turn induce more expression of CTGF, indicating a positive feedback loop involving CTGF expression that can contribute to the progression of fibrosis. It is also likely that a similar feedback loop is occurring with periostin. Inhibiting this positive feedback loop would be ideal for understanding the mechanism by which CTGF from fibrocytes enables persistent lung fibrosis and promotes myofibroblast differentiation in the presence of periostin. However, there is not a specific receptor antagonist for CTGF due to the complex mechanism of CTGF signaling. Treatment of duplicate cultures of WT untreated fibroblasts with 10&#x003bc;M of an MRTF inhibitor (CCG 203971, shown to inhibit CTGF expression), in the presence of WT bleomycin fibrocyte supernatant resulted in a decrease in &#x003b1;SMA protein expression similar to what was seen with the periostin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> supernatants demonstrating the importance of autocrine CTGF expression in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P26">To further examine the effects of periostin on fibrocytes we designed experiments using integrin blocking antibodies. Our results suggest that periostin signals uniquely to fibrocytes via beta 1 integrin. A recent study by Reed and colleagues <sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> suggested that inhibition of the alphaVbeta1 integrin using a small molecule inhibitor significantly attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In that study the authors only looked at lung mesenchymal cells, which are a combination of fibroblasts and fibrocytes. Given our findings that beta1 integrins are critical for periostin signaling to fibrocytes, it will be important to determine if the alphav-beta1 heterodimers are responsible for periostin signaling to fibrocytes.</p><p id="P27">One very interesting experiment would have been to deplete fibrocytes during fibrosis; however this strategy proved technically unsuccessful. We generated a collagenI&#x003b1;2-Cre-DTR transgenic mouse and used these animals to generate bone-marrow chimeras in a CD45.2 recipient mouse so that the bone-marrow derived cells (but not lung resident cells) would be expressing CD45.1 and the collagenI&#x003b1;2-Cre-DTR transgene. These mice were then given bleomycin and treated with diphtheria toxin on days 11 and 18 to deplete the recruited collagen I&#x003b1;2-Cre-DTR expressing cells. Despite excellent chimerism in the lung on day 21, surprisingly, there was a high percentage of recipient fibrocytes present post-bleomycin treatment that could not be eliminated by diphtheria toxin treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, the low level of DTR expression driven by the collagen promoter in fibrocytes likely impaired the ability to deplete these cells with diphtheria toxin. We feel it is important for the lung community to know that this strategy to create a fibrocyte-knock-out mouse was not effective. Definitive proof of the role of fibrocytes in lung fibrosis awaits the characterization of a fibrocyte-specific promoter that can be used in future cellular depletion studies.</p><p id="P28">In conclusion, the current study showed that once recruited to the lungs, fibrocytes did not differentiate into fibroblasts directly. Rather, fibrocyte-derived periostin signals via beta 1 integrin to cause release of profibrotic mediators such as CTGF from the fibrocytes themselves to promote myofibroblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS796512-supplement-1.docx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e781" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Amanda Huber for technical assistance and comments on the manuscript.</p><p>Funding sources;
