Surface observations and physical measurements at the molecular and atomic level can be made using analytical instruments, particularly scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Nonetheless, with some notable exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], there are very few methods for making direct physical measurements on individual cells. The physical property hardness is particularly informative of the characteristics of a cell, and much can be known about the cell from the determination of this parameter. Cell hardness is thought to be related to the resistance of bacterial spores to heat and UV. In the fields of food and pharmaceutical manufacturing, current methods for determining heat and UV resistance require viable cell counts involving cell culture and can take from a few days to 2&#x02009;weeks or more to complete.

The cantilever used in an SPM is a type of spring. We developed a method using the cantilever probe of a SPM to determine the hardness of a cell, an organelle, or other microscopic specimen. Physical stress induced by contact of the probe with the specimen is used to determine the Young&#x02019;s modulus as a hardness parameter. Here, we report the evaluation of cell hardness for log phase cells and spores of bacteria and compare it to the heat and UV resistance. The relationship between hardness, given by Young&#x02019;s modulus, and spore characteristics can be used to evaluate spore durability in sporogenic bacteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Definition of hardness and measurement positions</title><p>If hardness is expressed as the amount of work done for a given applied cantilever strain, that amount of work corresponds to a complex three-dimensional movement that would be difficult to measure accurately. However, the error factors are reduced if we limit this movement to the vertical direction along the z-axis, as shown in Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>(A) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>(B) and evaluate Young&#x02019;s modulus. In this way, the cell can be regarded as a linear-elastic body. The target sample is pressed by the cantilever with a fixed applied strain, <italic>&#x003f5;</italic>, and the repulsive force (stress), &#x003c3;, (N) is determined (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>(B)). Hooke&#x02019;s law can be expressed as &#x003c3;&#x02009;=&#x02009;E&#x003f5;, where E is Young&#x02019;s modulus (N/m) for log phase cells and spores, and is the physical stress arising in the cell due to the force exerted by the cantilever (depth of compression: m). Hooke&#x02019;s law holds if the starting point (point a in Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>(B)) of the approach curve overlaps with the endpoint of the release curve for the cantilever (point b in Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>(B)). Young&#x02019;s modulus, E, was thus confirmed to be a parameter of cell hardness for various cells and spores (&#x003c3;/<italic>&#x003f5;</italic>). Young&#x02019;s modulus of the sample can thus be estimated within the range of the nano-probe evaluation with an identical spring constant.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Principle for measuring cell and spore hardness using the cantilever of the SPM.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) Position of the cantilever and cell before measurement.

While there were no clear differences in hardness between the five gram-positive bacteria strains (<italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>Geobacillus</italic>, and <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp.) and the two gram-negative strains (<italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>), the gram-negative bacteria tended to have a lower Young&#x02019;s modulus. Further experiments using more strains of bacteria are needed to make more detailed examinations of differences between cells in log and stationary phases or for the use of different culture media. Further examination of additional bacteria species is needed to confirm this pattern. Generally, the greater hardness of spores than of vegetative cells for a bacterial strain can be thought of as the basis for the durability of spores. However, while the spores of four <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. other than <italic>B. megaterium</italic> were harder than the vegetative cells, there was no significant difference in hardness between the spores and vegetative cells for <italic>B. megaterium</italic>.

A number of different hypotheses for the formation of more durable spores have been proposed. Setlow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] attributed the high physical durability of spores primarily to the low water content in the core of the spore, which is due to compression and dehydration during spore cortex formation processes. Porham <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] proposed dehydration within the spore core as the major factor. Paredes-Sabja <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] hypothesized that minute structures composed of dipicolinic acid (DPA) with a dehydration function in the core of the spore were responsible for the increased durability. Grehardt <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] reported that for <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp., lower water content within the spore was correlated with higher durability and that positive correlations were seen between the water content and each thermal processing D value. Taken together, increased hardness resulting from reduced water content in the spore is related to durability.</p><p>In particular, hardness is thought to be acquired due to the dehydrating effect of the formation of bonds between dipicolinic acid, which is a unique component of spores, and calcium. The dehydrated spore has a strong and resilient structural hardness that confers strong physical durability. The difference in hardness between vegetative cells and spores of sporulating bacteria and the strong correlation between hardness and heat and UV resistance of the spores support this hypothesis.</p><p>Further work is required to expand this method to other applications. A first step to understanding the applicability of this method is to investigate additional spore specimens. While a correlation was found between hardness and durability in the present study, a spore with high cell hardness is not necessarily UV resistant. Nicholson <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] noted the relationship between heat resistance and divalent metal ions and the involvement of DNA repair enzymes in UV resistance. These enzymes have a direct relationship to the resistance mechanism, and it is likely that bacteria that form harder spores have higher divalent metal ion concentration and DNA repair enzyme production. The mechanism of spore durability is not yet fully clarified, but the present study offers some new and relevant findings. More heat- and UV-resistant mutants will need to be studied to clarify whether the correlations observed in the present study are direct correlations or whether they indicate indirect agreement. Also, in addition to dehydration of the spore, it is likely that differences in the spore coat contribute to differences in hardness; spore coat deletion variants will make it possible to investigate the correlation between hardness and durability in greater detail. The correlations between spore hardness and heat and UV resistance observed in the present study should be tested using alternative methods for measuring hardness. We expect that this new analytical method can be used to directly measure hardness on any type of cell and will have applications in a wide range of research, including pharmaceutical and food product testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We developed methods to directly measure the physical properties of a single cell using bacterial spores and a SPM. The hardness of a single cell is described in terms of its Young&#x02019;s modulus. Using this technique, the hardness of bacterial cells could be measured for the first time. We used this technique to measure the hardness of individual spores of spore-forming bacteria strains and observed a high correlation between spore hardness and resistance to heat and UV, which are conventional measures of physical durability. The present technique will permit the rapid measurement of spore durability and will be a powerful tool for clarifying its mechanisms.

The D<sub>121</sub> value for each <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. was used as the heat resistance parameter. For UV resistance, the UV exposure (mW&#x000b7;sec/cm<sup>2</sup>) required to kill 90% of the bacteria was determined. Spore suspensions at 10<sup>5</sup>&#x02009;CFU/ml in pure water were placed at a depth of 5&#x02009;mm in a 90&#x02009;mm Petri dish and irradiated at an intensity of 0.3&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> using a GLQ lamp (15&#x02009;W, UVC of mainly 185&#x02009;nm, Toshiba Lighting &#x00026; Technology Corporation) placed at a distance of 10&#x02009;cm. Viable bacteria counts were taken every 10&#x02009;min for 60&#x02009;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KN designed experiments, analyzed data, and prepared the manuscript.
