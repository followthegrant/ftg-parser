Nearly 50% of these tumors relapse following extensive treatment regimens. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a tumor suppressor, has been shown to be downregulated in many human cancers <italic>via</italic> multiple mechanisms including upregulation of its endogenous inhibitors, I2PP2A or CIP2A. We hypothesized that inhibition of the endogenous PP2A inhibitors or activation of PP2A would decrease tumorigenicity in human neuroblastoma cells. Four human neuroblastoma cell lines were utilized. Expression of PP2A and its endogenous inhibitors I2PP2A and CIP2A was confirmed by immunoblotting. PP2A activation was measured <italic>via</italic> phosphatase activation assay. Multiple parallel methods including siRNA inhibition of the endogenous PP2A inhibitors and pharmacologic activation of PP2A were utilized.

Inhibition of the endogenous inhibitors of PP2A or pharmacologic activation of PP2A with the PP2A activator FTY720 led to decreased neuroblastoma cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion. Treatment of mice bearing SK-N-AS or SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma tumors with FTY720 resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth compared to vehicle-treated animals. In conclusion, activation of PP2A may provide a novel therapeutic target for neuroblastoma.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">Neuroblastoma is the most common primary malignant extracranial nervous system tumor in children and is responsible for over 15% of all pediatric cancer deaths <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

Additionally, there was not an increase in PP2A expression with I2PP2A or CIP2A knockdown (Supplemental Figure 1, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>), but PP2A activation was increased, leading to the hypothesis that this activation is the mechanism leading to the observed alterations in tumor cell viability, proliferation, invasion, migration, and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth.</p><p id="p0155">Because of the inconsistencies seen with siRNA targeting of these endogenous PP2A inhibitors and lack of currently available clinical therapeutic formulations, studies were advanced to targeting PP2A itself. Forskolin is a known activator of PP2A <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Forskolin treatment resulted in slightly decreased proliferation but had a more pronounced effect on proliferation and motility in neuroblastoma cells than would have been expected with that seen in proliferation. Similar results were seen by other investigators in acute myeloid leukemia cells <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and prostate cancer cells <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p id="p0160">FTY720 (2-amino-2-[2-(4-octylphenyl)]-1,3-propanediol, fingolimod) is a synthetic sphingosine immunosuppressant that was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple sclerosis <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Over the past decade, FTY720 has also been shown to have antitumor properties in several human malignancies <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, including the pediatric tumor medulloblastoma <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, prompting its use in the current investigations. Many mechanisms have been proposed for the effects of FTY720, including activation of PP2A <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, generation of reactive oxygen species <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, and inhibition of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Li and others showed that FTY720 inhibited sphingosine kinase 2 in neuroblastoma <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, and Lange et al studied the effects on calcium channel signaling in neuroblastoma <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, but neither group explored whether PP2A activation was involved <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In the current study, we found that FTY720 treatment significantly increased PP2A activity in neuroblastoma cells.</p><p id="p0165">In addition to reducing cell viability, FTY720 has been shown to affect tumor cell motility. Zhou demonstrated decreased migration and invasion with FTY720 treatment in the human prostate cell lines DU145 and PC3 <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Zhang and others showed that human glioma cells had a marked reduction in migration and invasion following FTY720 treatment <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and Garner demonstrated similar effects in human medulloblastoma patient-derived xenograft cells <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Similarly, in this study, treatment of human neuroblastoma cells with FTY720 in doses well below the LD<sub>50</sub> resulted in significant reductions in both migration and invasion.</p><p id="p0170">Previous investigations have postulated that the effects of FTY720-induced PP2A activation may be dependent upon dephosphorylation of AKT. Loss of AKT phosphorylation has been noted in breast and prostate cancer cells and mesothelioma <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In this study, FTY720 treatment resulted in an increase in AKT phosphorylation in all four neuroblastoma cell lines tested. Studies conducted in neurologic noncancer models found that FTY720 led to activation of AKT kinase <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, indicating that our findings may have important clinical relevance. To that end, we demonstrated that FTY720 combined with AKT inhibition decreased neuroblastoma cell proliferation in a mostly synergistic, and at least additive, fashion, implying that it may sensitize neuroblastoma cells to conventional rapalogue chemotherapeutic agents. Alterations in ERK phosphorylation have also been proposed as a potential mechanistic target for FTY720. Rincon and colleagues showed decreased activation of ERK in BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells following treatment with FTY720 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, and others reported similar results with PC-3 prostate cancer cells <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In the current study, SH-EP and WAC2 cells showed increased ERK phosphorylation, but these changes followed changes noted in expression of total ERK (Supplemental Figure 2). These data indicated that the effects of FTY720 on kinases are likely cell line dependent and, along with the findings for AKT, will serve as a basis for further mechanistic studies of FTY720 in neuroblastoma.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0175">The data in the current study provide evidence that inhibition of I2PP2A or CIP2A, or activation of PP2A, decreased neuroblastoma cell proliferation, motility, and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor growth. These findings suggest that development of novel therapeutics that antagonize endogenous PP2A inhibitors and also enhance PP2A activity has potential for clinical applications in neuroblastoma. Further, these data suggest that potentially combining PP2A activation with kinase inhibition may be beneficial in neuroblastoma. These findings provide the impetus to further investigate these pathways for the treatment of neuroblastoma.</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><title>Additional Information</title><p id="p0180">None of the authors have any competing financial interests.</p></sec><sec id="s0125"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p id="p0185">No data sets were generated in the current studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maris</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The biologic basis for neuroblastoma heterogeneity and risk stratification</article-title><source>Curr Opin Pediatr</source><volume>17</volume><year>2005</year><fpage>7</fpage><lpage>13</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15659956</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moss&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>YP</given-names></name><name><surname>Deyell</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Berthold</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagakawara</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ambros</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name><name><surname>Monclair</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohn</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>London</surname><given-names>WB</given-names></name><name><surname>Matthay</surname><given-names>KK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neuroblastoma in older children, adolescents and young adults: a report from the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group project</article-title><source>Pediatr Blood Cancer</source><volume>61</volume><year>2014</year><fpage>627</fpage><lpage>635</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24038992</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0015"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cotterill</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>More</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Craft</surname><given-names>AW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neuroblastoma: changing incidence and survival in young people aged 0-24 years.
