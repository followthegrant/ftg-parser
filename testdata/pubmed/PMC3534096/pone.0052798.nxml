For modeling the complexity of the human disease, primary tumor cells are by far superior to established cell lines. As qualified exemplary model, patients&#x02019; acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells reliably engraft in mice inducing orthotopic disseminated leukemia closely resembling the disease in men. Unfortunately, disease monitoring of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in mice is hampered by lack of a suitable readout parameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and Methods</title><p>Patients&#x02019; acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were lentivirally transduced to express the membrane-bound form of Gaussia luciferase. In vivo imaging was established in individual patients&#x02019; leukemias and extensively validated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Bioluminescence in vivo imaging enabled reliable and continuous follow-up of individual mice. Light emission strictly correlated to post mortem quantification of leukemic burden and revealed a logarithmic, time and cell number dependent growth pattern. Imaging conveniently quantified frequencies of leukemia initiating cells in limiting dilution transplantation assays. Upon detecting a single leukemia cell within more than 10,000 bone marrow cells, imaging enabled monitoring minimal residual disease, time to tumor re-growth and relapse. Imaging quantified therapy effects precisely and with low variances, discriminating treatment failure from partial and complete responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>For the first time, we characterized in detail how in vivo imaging reforms preclinical studies on patient-derived tumors upon increasing monitoring resolution. In the future, in vivo imaging will enable performing precise preclinical studies on a broad range of highly demanding clinical challenges, such as treatment failure, resistance in leukemia initiating cells, minimal residual disease and relapse.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (SFB684, TP22; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp">http://www.dfg.de/en/index.jsp</ext-link>), Deutsche Jos&#x000e9; Carreras Leuk&#x000e4;mie Stiftung (R10/26; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.carreras-stiftung.de/">www.carreras-stiftung.de/</ext-link>), Bettina Br&#x000e4;u Stiftung (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bettina-braeu-stiftung.de/">http://www.bettina-braeu-stiftung.de/</ext-link>) and Dr. Helmut Legerlotz Stiftung (all to IJ) and DFG Cluster of Excellence NIM (to EW).

Novel therapeutic approaches undergo detailed preclinical evaluation before translation into clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0052798-Talmadge1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In the present work, a defined preclinical leukemia mouse model was technically improved to allow decisive studies on clinically demanding challenges.</p><p>In cancer research, a variety of different mouse models exist including xenotransplantation models and syngeneic models <xref rid="pone.0052798-McCormick1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Xenotransplantation models enable studying human tumor cells upon growth in severely immunocompromised mice <xref rid="pone.0052798-Shultz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Within the xenotransplantation models, the use of primary patients&#x02019; tumor cells is superior to the use of cell lines, as primary cells enable modeling of the complex heterogeneity of human tumors, while cell lines might have acquired non-physiologic mutations upon prolonged culture in vitro <xref rid="pone.0052798-Petitjean1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>At best, xenotransplanted tumor cells generate a disease in mice which highly resembles the disease in men <xref rid="pone.0052798-Francia1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Nevertheless, transplantation of solid tumors might suffer from heterotopic tumor localization and metastasis in mice <xref rid="pone.0052798-Francia1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In contrast, tumor cells obtained from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) engraft and develop the disease in mice with an organ distribution highly similar between mice and men <xref rid="pone.0052798-Liem1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In fact, since 2 decades the xenotransplantation model of patient ALL cells is well characterized <xref rid="pone.0052798-KamelReid1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and fulfills many criteria requested for preclinical treatment trials. Due to high engraftment rates, the heterogeneity of ALL can be modeled in mice and trials are performed in genetically defined subgroups of ALLs <xref rid="pone.0052798-Liem1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Nevertheless, first engraftment in mice might be non-representative for the heterogeneity of the human sample <xref rid="pone.0052798-Notta1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and clonal evolution might take place upon passaging cells through mice, although reportedly at a minor level <xref rid="pone.0052798-Schmitz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Taken together, xenotransplantation of primary human ALL into mice emerges as attractive model for preclinical anti-cancer trials in general.</p><p>Nevertheless, sensitive follow up of leukemia progression in mice remains a limitation of the model. Invasive bone marrow aspirations in mice require prolonged periods of recuperation; blood sampling is hampered by late and heterogeneous presence of tumor cells into the peripheral blood <xref rid="pone.0052798-Macor1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Lack of sensitive and convenient follow up of the leukemic disease so far disabled quantifying treatment responses and differentiating distinct clinical disease stages.</p><p>In vivo imaging based on molecular cell marking represents a sensitive readout parameter to monitor xenotransplanted tumors in mice, e.g., using bioluminescence <xref rid="pone.0052798-ONeill1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052798-Lyons1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. So far, in vivo imaging was mainly performed in preclinical models using tumor cell lines as patient-derived tumor cells are more difficult in handling, e.g., for molecular manipulation. Patient-derived tumor cells do not grow in vitro; instead, they survive only few hours in culture.</p><p>Here, we established the molecular labeling of patient-derived ALL cells and characterized in detail, how bioluminescence in vivo imaging enables a novel level of precision for future preclinical studies. In vivo imaging enabled quantification of treatment effects and monitoring of minimal residual disease in mice. The improved mouse model will allow performing decisive and complex preclinical studies on individual leukemias in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Design and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethical Statements</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and from parents/carers in the cases where patients were minors.

Single mice engrafted with sample ALL-50 were sacrificed weekly and bone marrow and spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry to quantify leukemic cells. Imaging was more sensitive in detecting leukemic infiltration in bone marrow than in spleen arguing towards the highest sensitivity of imaging in visualizing ALL in bone marrow located directly under the fur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052798-g002">Figure 2c</xref> and Supplemental Figure 6; similar data not shown for sample ALL-4S, ALL-177 and ALL-199).

At late stages of leukemia disease, imaging revealed a diffuse leukemic infiltration throughout the entire mouse body which was paralleled by GLuc-based light emission from isolated organs such as bones, spleen, liver, peripheral blood, lungs and brain (Supplemental Figure 7). Taken together, imaging precisely visualized the clinical course of leukemia in single mice over time with good correlation to conventional post mortem readout parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Quantification, Logarithmic Growth and Quality Parameters</title><p>To quantify light emission, regions of interest were defined and analyzed using the Living Image software 4.0 (Caliper Life Sciences). In close correlation to the visual impression, quantification revealed first engraftment in a region covering the lower extremities, while inner organs became visible at late time points followed by extremely rapid signal increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052798-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). For further studies, light emission of the entire animals was quantified as it represented the most reliable average value.</p><p>Quantification of light emission revealed a strictly logarithmic growth of patient-derived leukemia cells in mice covering up to 4 orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052798-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). Similarly, the relation between cell number injected and light emission was logarithmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052798-g003">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>Individual leukemias were obtained from patients with very different clinical parameters, including primary disease and relapse, and contained completely different cytogenetic and molecular alterations (Supplemental Table 1). Light emission quantification of ALL samples showed that all samples grew in a logarithmic pattern in mice (Supplemental Figure 8 and data not shown). Thus, logarithmic growth appears as general principle how human leukemia cells behave in mice. Nevertheless and according to published data <xref rid="pone.0052798-Meyer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, the growth rate in mice differed markedly between the samples with sample ALL-177 showing a slower growth rate compared to most other samples (Supplemental Figure 8). Thus, bioluminescence in vivo imaging represents a useful tool to study inter-sample heterogeneity in growth kinetics.</p><p>To control quality parameters of the model, assay variances were estimated. Imaging showed a highly reproducible growth of leukemia in mice with surprisingly low intra- and inter-assay variances considering that an in vivo model was studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052798-g003">Figure 3c</xref>, Supplemental Figure 9). Taken together, quantification of in vivo imaging revealed a strictly logarithmic growth of all individual leukemias in mice with high reliability and marginal standard errors.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Visualization of Minimal Disease</title><p>Upon anti-leukemia treatment, most patients suffering from ALL accomplish complete morphological response. Nevertheless, minimal residual disease (MRD) represents a major clinical threat as MRD is difficult to treat and often followed by relapse. Appropriate preclinical models to study MRD are required <xref rid="pone.0052798-Bottcher1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>To test, whether GLuc-based in vivo imaging could visualize MRD, its sensitivity was measured. Groups of mice were engrafted with equal cell numbers of the same sample and were imaged three times weekly. Upon crossing a clearly defined detection threshold (signal above 6&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> photons per second using defined criteria, see Methods for details), most mice were sacrificed and bone marrow and peripheral blood analyzed by flow cytometry, quantitative real time PCR and immunohistochemistry. All remaining mice showed constant light increase similar to the kinetic shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052798-g002">Figure 2a</xref> leading to overt leukemia (Supplemental Figure 10).</p><p>In all 3 samples tested, imaging was able to detect below 1 leukemia cell in 5,000 mouse bone marrow cells, while in one sample the detection threshold was even below 1 in 10,000 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052798-g003">Figure 3d</xref> and Supplemental Figure 10). Estimating the reported 10<sup>9</sup> normal bone marrow cells per mouse, imaging allowed the visualization of less than 100.000 absolute leukemia cells per mouse. Detection sensitivity directly correlated with the expression level of the transgenes. At this early stage of first light emission, no leukemia cells were detected in peripheral blood using either flow cytometry or quantitative real time PCR. Thus, conventional readouts in peripheral blood did not allow follow up of leukemia in living mice at this stage. Instead, GLuc-based bioluminescence imaging revealed very high sensitivity for detecting human leukemic cells in mice which now allows studies, e.g., on MRD.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Imaging-based Quantification of Leukemia Initiating Cell Frequencies</title><p>An important current concept in cancer research states that only cancer stem cells (CSC) are able to maintain tumor growth and therefore represent the most important targets for anti-cancer therapy <xref rid="pone.0052798-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The limiting dilution transplantation assay (LDTA) still represents the standard method for studying CSC <xref rid="pone.0052798-Misaghian1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

Sophisticated preclinical models are required for testing novel therapeutic approaches addressing these threats in order to prepare their translation into the clinics.</p><p>Individual leukemias were grown until advanced disease (10<sup>8</sup> photons per second per entire mouse). Imaging allowed starting treatment in mice with equal tumor burdens, although rarely mice had to be excluded, as leukemia grew highly homogenously in mice (compare Supplemental Figure 9). Mice were treated with conventional cytotoxic drugs by systemic bolus injections in concentrations modeling drug doses typically applied in patients <xref rid="pone.0052798-Ehrhardt3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Few days after treatment with an effective drug, light emission from mice was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052798-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). Thereby, low variances were found within a group of equally treated mice enabling highly reliable quantification of the therapeutic effects (Supplemental Figure 11a and 11c). As light emission persisted after therapy, the single drug application had reduced, but not eliminated leukemia. In our trials, a single bolus injection reduced light emission at maximum by 1 order of magnitude suggesting that at least 10% of tumor cell persist after a single treatment (data not shown) <xref rid="pone.0052798-Dy1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The effectiveness of drugs was independent from the leukemic burden of the mice within the log growth phase. Therapeutic reduction of leukemia was followed by tumor re-growth shortly afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052798-g005">Figure 5a</xref>).</p><p>Imaging results correlated well with data obtained by conventional post-mortem readout parameters in most organs (Supplemental Figure 11b and 11d). Treatment nearly eliminated tumor cells from peripheral blood, while imaging visualized the remaining tumor burden post treatment (Supplemental Figure 11e). Due to limited sensitivity, conventional measurement in peripheral blood appears overestimating therapeutic effects, although this readout was most frequently used for disease monitoring until today.</p><p>In our model, each mouse harbors the leukemia of an individual patient. Imaging-guided preclinical treatment trials in mice revealed that individual ALL samples retained individual sensitivities towards conventional cytotoxic drugs. While the T-ALL sample ALL-4S was sensitive towards treatment with Cyclophosphamide, it was resistant towards Etoposid; in contrast, the B-ALL sample ALL-199 was resistant towards Cyclophosphamide, but sensitive towards Etoposid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052798-g005">Figure 5b</xref>). Accordingly, treatment with Cyclophosphamide prolonged survival of ALL-4S, but not of ALL-199 bearing mice, while Etoposid prolonged survival of ALL-199, but not of ALL-4S bearing mice (data not shown). Thus, in vivo imaging was able to visualize specific drug sensitivities of each individual sample towards a given anti-cancer treatment shortly after treatment within the preclinical trial.</p><p>Most importantly, imaging was able to quantify therapeutic responses and to visualize tumor regrowth. Due to low assay variances, imaging allowed distinguishing treatment failure/drug resistance/progressive disease from partial or complete response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0052798-g005">Figure 5c</xref>). As additional advantage, imaging enabled quantifying the therapeutic effect already few days after treatment, while conventional readouts like survival require long incubation periods.</p><p>Taken together, in vivo imaging allowed the rapid, precise and individual quantification of treatment responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Monitoring of Distinct Clinical Stages Upon Treatment in Mice</title><p>The sensitivity of tumor cells towards treatment depends on the disease stage at which the drug is given <xref rid="pone.0052798-Francia2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

Furthermore, time to tumor re-growth/time to tumor progression/time of progression free survival represents a prognostic parameter for patients, especially in MRD.</p><p>After treatment, imaging reliably quantified residual disease.

In the future, improvement of the individualized ALL mouse model by in vivo imaging will allow performing preclinical trials more exactly and in more detail.</p><p>Imaging allowed modeling disease stages in mice which represent current challenges in the clinics such as minimal residual disease and tumor regrowth. Imaging was highly sensitive and continuous and correlated well with post mortem results regarding tumor distribution. Assay variances were minimal which will reduce the number of animals required per experiment. In addition, tumor growth was orthotopic and homogenous and tumor cells were derived from individual patients with genetically defined tumors; limiting dilution assays were easily visualized to study drug sensitivity of leukemia initiating cells. Taken together, GLuc-based imaging will allow performing high quality and convenient preclinical treatment trials in the individual mouse model of ALL in the future.</p><p>The most important challenges in cancer treatment represent treatment failure and relapse. Using in vivo imaging, treatment failure is easily detectable in the first days after treatment as light emission continues increasing despite of therapy; short-period treatment quantification will allow speeding up preclinical treatment trials. Tumor regrowth is visualized by quantification of post-therapeutic residual disease followed by monitoring increase in light emission. Thus, our model is able to exactly map both important clinical challenges for preclinical trials.</p><p>In addition to bioluminescence imaging, fluorescence imaging represents an interesting alternative with a better anatomical resolution, especially using near- infrared fluorochromes <xref rid="pone.0052798-Lyons1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052798-Ntziachristos1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Even though leukemic cells used in our studies also expressed GFP, GFP proved non-suitable for in vivo imaging due to the known high tissue autofluorescence signals emitted at the same wave length <xref rid="pone.0052798-Troy1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Fluorescent probes with near-infrared and far-red light emission have been recently developed which might be more suitable for small animal imaging <xref rid="pone.0052798-Shcherbo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In our hands, leukemia cells did not express sufficient levels of the mRaspberry protein (data not shown), which might have been due to reported cellular toxicity induced by the fluorochrome <xref rid="pone.0052798-Shaner1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Recently, two groups published the use of firefly luciferase for in vivo imaging of transplanted individual ALLs <xref rid="pone.0052798-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0052798-Duy1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

The novelty of the present study lies in (i) the use of GLuc as lighter luciferase; (ii) the detailed methodological validation of the technique including its sensitivity allowing in vivo studies on MRD in the future; (iii) the prove that treatment trials can now be performed at visible leukemic burden (iv) the ability of imaging to diagnose treatment resistance within days after treatment allowing secondary interventions; (iv) the prove that routine clinical outcome parameter can now be monitored in mice.</p><p>The major advantage of using GLuc instead of firefly luciferase for in vivo imaging is the markedly increased light emission from superficial organs such as bone marrow in the lower extremities of mice <xref rid="pone.0052798-Inoue1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Hence, GLuc-based imaging proved superior to firefly luciferase-based imaging in the context of T-cell imaging <xref rid="pone.0052798-Santos1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, we argued that GLuc might be more sensitive compared to firefly luciferase for imaging of patient-derived ALL and therefore used GLuc in our experiments.</p><p>Leukemic disease serves as a suitable model disease for cancer in general since leukemia cells are easier in handling compared to solid tumor cells. Many important research discoveries in cancer biology were first described in leukemia; for example, oncogenic mutations are best characterized in acute myeloid leukemia <xref rid="pone.0052798-Marcucci1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and; the cancer stem cell concept evolved upon research on leukemias <xref rid="pone.0052798-Dick1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Transferring its role from studying tumor biology to anti-tumor therapy, leukemia might now play a pivotal model disease for directing anti-cancer treatment towards individualized and disease stage-specific strategies.</p><p>Taken together, GLuc-based in vivo imaging in the individualized preclinical model of ALL enables performing treatment trials on a novel level of accuracy and precision. It enables quantifying therapy effects and remaining disease burdens as well as exact modeling of distinct disease stages.
