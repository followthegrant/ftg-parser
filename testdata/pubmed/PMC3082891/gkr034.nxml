The eukaryotic microRNA (miRNA) and short interfering RNA (siRNA) have been making a splash during the past few years. Recently, with the development of the experimental and computational approaches, hundreds of sRNAs have been identified in bacteria, especially in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [reviewed in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>)]. The bacterial sRNAs constitute a structurally diverse class of molecules that are typically of 50&#x02013;250&#x02009;nt in length and do not contain expressed open reading frames (ORFs). They have been shown to be involved in many cellular processes in prokaryotes, including translational quality control, protein inhibition, iron homeostasis, outer membrane protein biogenesis, sugar metabolism, quorum sensing, survival in stationary phase and virulence regulation of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">3&#x02013;8</xref>). According to the researches in Gram-negative bacteria, those sRNAs whose functions have been characterized can be sorted into three general categories: sRNAs that have intrinsic catalytic activity or are components of ribonucleoproteins, sRNAs that affect protein activity by structurally mimicking other nucleic acids and sRNAs that regulate gene expression by basepairing with target mRNAs, changing the translation and stability of the mRNA. sRNAs in the latter category appear to be the best-characterized and most abundant in Gram-negative bacteria. Most of these identified sRNAs are <italic>trans</italic>-encoded, located at chromosomal positions different from their targets. The majority of these <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs, such as DicF, MicF, OxyS, Spot42, RyhB and GcvB, repress the translation of target mRNAs. Compared to the Gram-negative bacterium, far fewer sRNAs were identified in Gram-positive pathogens, and there exist many differences in length, structure and function mode between the sRNAs from these two groups of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16">9&#x02013;16</xref>).</p><p>In Gram-negative bacteria, a large class of <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs silences their target mRNAs by binding tightly to Hfq, a highly abundant RNA chaperone protein that also binds the target mRNA in a number of cases studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). Base pairing between these sRNAs and their target mRNAs requires Hfq which is proposed to enhance the stability of sRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>, by protecting them from degradation. Hfq has also been shown to interact with proteins such as poly(A) polymerase I (PAP I), polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNP) and RNase E which are involved in mRNA decay and it is shown to form fibres <italic>in vitro</italic>, the physiological significance of which is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">20&#x02013;24</xref>). It is necessary to mention that Ribonuclease (RNase) E is the major endoribonuclease participating in RNA turnover in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which initiates the decay of RNAs by cutting them internally near their 5&#x02032;-end. Additionally, the binding of Hfq and <italic>E. coli</italic> sRNAs could protect sRNAs from endonucleolytic attack. More interestingly, some endogenous sRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic> have been shown to form a specific ribonucleoprotein complex with RNase E and Hfq, resulting in translation inhibition and RNase E dependent degradation of target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). In contrast to this, Hfq had been supposed to be dispensable for sRNA-mediated riboregulation in the Gram-positive species for a long time. But a recent study provided the first evidence for Hfq-dependent antisense regulation in Gram-positive bacteria <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>The small RNAs in eukaryotes, such as miRNA and siRNA, have become a powerful experimental technique for silencing gene expression both in cultured cells and living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). However, such an effective RNA silencing tool remains to be developed for prokaryotes in which the main methods of deciphering gene function are still homologous recombination and transposon mutagenesis. Additionally, the application of traditional antisense RNA (asRNA) is also limited due to its low efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Therefore, effective and convenient RNA silencing methods are urgently needed for prokaryotic organisms. Recently, the emergence of wide spread <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs that act as regulators of gene expression by basepairing with their targets in bacteria provide us a promising perspective for gene function investigation.</p><p>In the present study, we described first the use of artificial <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs (atsRNAs) for specific gene silencing in bacteria. A series of atsRNAs targeting specific genes were designed and synthesized, and some of them markedly suppressed the expression of target genes in an Hfq-dependent manner. Our results demonstrated that atsRNA was an efficient approach for specific gene silencing in <italic>E. coli</italic>, giving rise to a new research method for deciphering gene functions in bacteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MC4100 (F<sup>-</sup> <italic>ara</italic>D139 &#x00394;<italic>(argF-lac)</italic> U169 <italic>rpsL</italic>150 <italic>relA</italic>1 <italic>deoC</italic>1 <italic>rbsR fthD</italic>5301 <italic>fruA</italic>25 &#x003bb;<sup>-</sup>) (a gift from R.

The mRNA base pairing region of the sRNA was imperfectly complementary with the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) of the target mRNA, especially the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences. Although the Hfq binding sites of natural sRNAs shared no homology, the common characteristic of these sequences was a high A+U-content. The Rho-independent terminators typically shared common structural features which consisted of a GC rich inverted repeat followed by a run of U residues. Next, the secondary structures of these well-known natural sRNAs were predicted by MFOLD program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), and then their common characteristics were analyzed. These sRNAs were highly structured, forming at least two stem loops by mRNA base pairing region and Rho-independent terminator, respectively. In general, the Hfq binding site located at the AU rich area between these two stem loops in the predicted secondary structure.</p><p>Based on the common structural characteristics of natural bacterial <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we developed the principle and process for atsRNA design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). (i) atsRNA should be a modular structure consisting of three elements: mRNA base pairing region, Hfq binding site and Rho-independent terminator. (ii) The mRNA base pairing region (20 to 30&#x02009;nt in length) should be designed according to the 5&#x02032;-UTR (or part of the coding regions) of target mRNA, especially the SD sequence, and then the sequence composition should be adjusted appropriately to make it form a stem loop structure. (iii) The Hfq binding sites and Rho-independent terminators were extracted from the well-studied endogenous bacterial <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs, such as RyhB, Spot42, DsrA and OxyS. The Hfq binding sites generally corresponded to a 12&#x02013;19&#x02009;nt AU-rich region. (iv) The three component parts were selected randomly and then assembled into a series of atsRNA candidates according to the combination order listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Then their secondary structures were predicted by MFOLD program. (v) atsRNAs should be selected from atsRNA candidates whose predicted secondary structures meet the following criteria: atsRNAs should form two to four stem loops, including one formed by mRNA base pairing region and one formed by Rho-independent terminator. The Hfq binding site should locate between two stem loops. (vi) The start codon AUG should be avoided in atsRNA in order to prevent the translation. (vii) The selected atsRNAs were synthesized, cloned into the expression vector and transformed into host bacteria. Then the efficacies of these atsRNAs were determined.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, CY1, CY4, CY6 and CY9 suppressed the expression of <italic>uidA</italic> gene obviously; and CY3, CY5, CY7 and CY10 did so slightly; while CY2 and CY8 almost had no effect. The most effective atsRNA CY9 triggered a 71% reduction in expression of target genes. To determine whether the repression of target genes was indeed due to the expression of atsRNAs, we then analyzed the transcripts of atsRNAs by northern blot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C and D, atsRNAs were transcribed with the predicted length, indicating that the reduction on target gene was due to the expression of atsRNA. And the QPCR analysis indicated that atsRNAs generally expressed at 1&#x02013;2 orders of magnitude greater levels than that of some native sRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic> such as RyhB, DicF and DsrA (data not shown). Furthermore, to confirm whether the expression of atsRNAs interfere with the physiology of host bacteria, we first detected the growth curve of host bacteria after the induction of atsRNA. As shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>, the expression of atsRNAs had no effect on growth rate of host bacteria. Then we swapped atsRNA expression plasmids (CY series for GY series and vice versa) as a test of specificity. As shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>, the expression level of EGFP and uidA gene had no reduction after the induction of atsRNA. These results demonstrated that atsRNA was effective in suppressing the expression of specific bacterial genes.

From the primary sequences of atsRNAs, there were no obvious differences in full length of the effective and non-effective atsRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Tables S1 and S2</ext-link>). The mRNA base pairing regions of those atsRNAs imperfectly paired with the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the target mRNAs according to the predicted results by LALIGN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4, Tables S1 and S2</ext-link>). This result indicted that atsRNA acted by basepairing with target mRNA. The complementary sequences between atsRNAs and their targets ranged mainly from 19 to 23&#x02009;nt in length, and there were no obvious differences in sequence composition between them (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4, Tables S1 and S2</ext-link>). Since the putative interacting sequences were maintained in all atsRNAs (effective and non-effective), we presumed that the different effect of these atsRNAs was due to the secondary structure or stability or the other two component parts of atsRNA.</p><p>In the predicted secondary structure, all the effective atsRNAs showed two or three stem loop structures and putative AU rich Hfq binding sites locating between two stem loops (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>). Their mRNA base pairing regions formed a stem&#x02013;loop structure, while two atsRNA candidates without stem loop structure in mRNA base pairing region were non-effective. To confirm the role of stem loop structure, the mRNA base pairing regions of CY4 and CY6 were adjusted appropriately to make them lost the stem loop in predicted secondary structure, yielding atsRNA mutants L-CY4 and L-CY6, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The complementary sequences of L-CY4 and L-CY6 were similar with that of CY4 and CY6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6</ext-link>) and the Hfq binding site and Rho-independent terminators remained constant in the mutant construct, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>).

However, the reduced amounts of atsRNA mutants could not account for the loss of repressing effect on target gene. After normalization of the interference efficiency of each atsRNAs to relative RNA amounts, the relative interference efficiency of L-CY4 and L-CY6 decreased dramatically (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S7</ext-link>). This result suggested that the lost activity of mutants L-CY4 and L-CY6 was due to the loss of stem loop structure but not the reduced stability. These results demonstrated that the stem loop structure formed by mRNA base pairing region was necessary for the activity of atsRNA.

The length of the unpaired nucleotides in the loop formed by mRNA base pairing region of CY9 was 9&#x02009;nt. To determine the optimal length of unpaired nucleotides in the loop, the number of unpaired nucleotides of CY9 was changed appropriately, yielding atsRNA mutants CY9-L1 (3&#x02009;nt in the loop), CY9-L2 (5&#x02009;nt in the loop), CY9-L3 (7&#x02009;nt in the loop) and CY9-L4 (13&#x02009;nt in the loop). All of the mutants were maintained similar secondary structure with CY9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In addition, the complementary sequences of these mutants were similar to that of CY9 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S8</ext-link>) and the Hfq binding site and Rho-independent terminators remained constant in these mutant constructs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>).

The minimum free energy of CY1 (&#x02212;16.9&#x02009;kcal/mol) was higher than that of CY9 (&#x02212;21.8&#x02009;kcal/mol), suggesting that it was easier to be degraded. To verify the prediction, the stability of CY1 and CY9 was determined by northern blot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, the half-life of CY9 was much longer than that of CY1. Furthermore, to increase the stability of CY1, atsRNA mutant N-CY1 was constructed by adding a 5&#x02032;-stem&#x02013;loop structure without pairing sequence with target mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The mutant N-CY1 had the same mRNA base pairing region, Hfq binding site and Rho-independent terminator with that of CY1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>). As expected, the predicted minimum free energy of N-CY1 was reduced to &#x02212;20.7&#x02009;kcal/mol and the stability of N-CY1 was improved according to the northern blot results (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S10</ext-link>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B, the two mutants lost the repressing effect on target genes, demonstrating that mRNA base pairing region was necessary for the functioning of atsRNA.

It was found that the interference efficiency of Hfq-null-GY2 and Hfq-null-CY9 was attenuated dramatically in comparison with that of GY2 and CY9.

Interestingly, the half-lives of the two mutants were obviously shorter than that of the corresponding atsRNAs. The reduced stability of mutants was presumed to be due to the reduced ability to bind Hfq. To confirm whether the decreased repressing effect was due to the reduced RNA amounts or not, we normalized the interference efficiency of each atsRNAs to relative RNA amounts.

Furthermore, the interference efficiencies of these atsRNAs were recovered after a multicopy plasmid containing <italic>hfq</italic> gene was transformed into the mutant strain GSO81 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S13</ext-link>). It is worthwhile noting that the expression of target gene <italic>uidA</italic> decreased dramatically in GSO81 compared to the wild-type strain MC4100 in the absence of atsRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). The importance of Hfq in cellular physiology has been acknowledged when the broadly pleiotropic phenotypes of an <italic>E. coli hfq</italic> mutant were characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Deletion of <italic>hfq</italic> could lead to the increase on oxidation of carbon sources. In this study, the target gene <italic>uidA</italic> encodes &#x003b2;-glucuronidase which is involved in the degradation of carbon compounds. Hfq was hypothesized to have effect on utilization of carbon sources and therefore affect the expression of <italic>uidA</italic> gene. Nonetheless, these findings demonstrated that the atsRNA-mediated gene silencing was Hfq dependent.

H1, H2, H3 and H4 shared the same Hfq binding site and Rho-independent terminator with CY9, and had 22, 16, 11 and 6 base pairings with mRNA, respectively. The results indicated that all the four atsRNAs only slightly suppressed the expression of &#x003b1;-hemolysin, and the silencing abilities were positively related with mRNA base pairing numbers. Although H5 had no Hfq binding site compared with H1, it also triggered the same interference efficiency with H1. H6 also had no Hfq binding site, and contained fewer mRNA base pairings compaired with H5. The suppression to gene expression was weaker than that of H5.

Using this method, we successfully repressed the expression of exogenous EGFP gene and endogenous <italic>uidA</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic>. atsRNA acted by base pairing with the 5&#x02032;-UTR of target mRNA and the atsRNA-mediated gene silencing was Hfq dependent. atsRNA led to translation inhibition and RNase E dependent degradation of target mRNA and the translation inhibition was the primary event for gene silencing.</p><p>The atsRNA-mediated gene silencing holds many advantages over conventional methods. It is an easy and fast way of down regulating the expression of specific genes, and more importantly, it is an inducible system. The existing methods for functional decipherment of genes in prokaryotes, such as homologous recombination and transposon mutagenesis, significantly limit the study of bacterial essential genes. The atsRNA-mediated silencing is promised to be an alternative RNA tool of deciphering gene function in bacteria whereas gene knockout was time consuming. In addition, atsRNA acting at post-transcriptional level provides a simple way to impose an over-arching level of regulation on a group of genes or operons that may be regulated in many different ways at the level of transcription. Due to its low cost and easy designing, atsRNA makes the automatic and high-throughput functional decipherment of prokaryotic genes possible.</p><p>Bacterial sRNAs that act by base pairing can be divided into two classes: <italic>cis</italic>-encoded and <italic>trans</italic>-encoded antisense sRNAs. The former are located in the same DNA region and are, therefore, fully complementary to their targets over a long sequence stretch, whereas the latter are located in another chromosomal location, and are only partially complementary to their target mRNAs. The traditional antisense RNA (asRNA) strategy has been developed based on the <italic>cis</italic>-encoded antisense RNAs. Thus, asRNAs were fully complementary to the target genes over a long region (usually &#x0003e;300&#x02009;nt). Although the asRNA technology worked well in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), it usually led to a 40&#x02013;60% reduction in the expression of target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). In this study, the atsRNA strategy was developed based on the <italic>trans</italic>-encoded antisense RNAs. They were complementary to the target mRNAs over a stretch of &#x0223c;20&#x02009;nt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4, Tables S1 and S2</ext-link>), and even within this stretch, the complementarity is not complete. The full length of atsRNAs was generally &#x0003c;100&#x02009;nt. In this study, the interference efficiency of most effective atsRNA could reach &#x0223c;80%, which is higher than that of asRNAs. Stability was important for the efficacy of both asRNA and atsRNA. The half-life of atsRNA as well as the natural <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs was usually &#x0003e;10&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>), while the half-life of asRNA was usually &#x0003e;5&#x02009;min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). This may partially explain the improved efficacy of atsRNA.</p><p>The RNA chaperone protein Hfq is important for the functioning of sRNA; it facilitates the interaction between some of well-characterized sRNA and their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Hfq has been shown to exert a stabilizing effect on endogenous sRNAs by protecting them from endonucleolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). Our results also demonstrated that Hfq was required for the stability of atsRNAs. The interaction between Hfq and atsRNA was presumed to increase the stability and then enhance the efficacy of atsRNA. Hfq appears to bind preferentially to unstructured AU-rich regions, which were frequently located between structured loop regions of sRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). And the AU rich Hfq binding site of atsRNA has been demonstrated to be crucial for the binding affinity to Hfq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S14</ext-link>). In this study, atsRNAs with long putative Hfq binding site in secondary structure, such as GY2, GY6, CY4 and CY9, had higher interference efficiency than those with short putative Hfq binding site (e.g. GY3, GY5 and CY6). Therefore, the length of putative Hfq binding site was proposed to be crucial for the interaction between atsRNA and Hfq. In order to enhance the efficacy of atsRNA, the putative Hfq binding site could be appropriately elongated during the designing process. However, longer putative Hfq binding site is not always better. For instance, increase of the length of putative Hfq binding site of CY9 did not result in an increase of interference efficiency. According to our results, a length of 10&#x02009;nt of putative Hfq binding site was believed to be enough for the functioning of atsRNA.</p><p>The efficacy of atsRNA depends on several factors, including the structure and stability itself, the binding kinetics (e.g. binding rate and binding strength) between atsRNA and target mRNA and the Hfq binding affinity. The lower inhibitory efficiency of CY1 and CY10 was presumed to be due to the unstable structure according to the predicted minimum free energy. Since the short putative Hfq binding sites, the less effective efficiency of GY3, GY5, CY3 and CY6 was hypothesized to be due to the low binding affinity with Hfq. The secondary structure of atsRNA is an important factor for inhibitory efficiency of atsRNA. Our results indicated the stem&#x02013;loop structure within the mRNA base pairing region is necessary for atsRNA regulation. Especially, the size of the loop structure is crucial for the activity of atsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the optimal number of unpaired nucleotides in the loop is not always the same for all atsRNAs. For instance, the optimal number of loop nucleotides for atsRNA GY2, GY6 and CY4 was 9, 11 and 8&#x02009;nt, respectively (data not shown). We presume that the optimal size of the loop depends on the secondary structure of both atsRNA and target mRNA, as well as the nucleotide composition in the loop. In addition, according to the calculated thermodynamic pairing energy value of atsRNA-target duplex formation, there is no direct correlation between the inhibitory efficiency and the stability of the hybrids (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). It is worth noting that the inhibitory efficiency of classical <italic>cis</italic>-acting antisense RNAs has proven to be primarily controlled by the binding rate constant rather than the binding affinity between the sense&#x02013;antisense complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). However, the relationship between inhibitory efficiency and binding kinetics of atsRNA requires further studies. Since the participation of Hfq in atsRNA regulation, the binding kinetic features of atsRNA would be more complex than that of <italic>cis</italic>-acted antisense RNA. In this study, the number of hybrid base pairings of atsRNA ranged mainly from 19 to 23&#x02009;nt in length. Some effective asRNA cassettes with a small number of base pairings (12&#x02009;nt) have been reported, indicating that relatively short antisense sequences can also suffice for efficient binding and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). However, in the absence of knowledge about target accessibility, we still favor large number of base pairing sequences during atsRNA design process, which are more likely to contain structures that efficiently seed hybridization. Furthermore, a large number of antisense nucleotides would be helpful for the inhibitory specificity of atsRNA.</p><p>In this study, the effective atsRNA could result in a 4- to 7-fold repression of target genes, and this is enough for functional investigation of bacterial genes. However, over-expression of natural <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs could generally repress the target genes from 7- to hundreds-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60 B61 B62 B63">60&#x02013;63</xref>). Therefore, we will further optimize the above-discussed design parameters to increase the efficacy of atsRNA. More importantly, research progress on natural <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNA will be contributive to the improvement of atsRNA technology. Additionally, taking into account of the structural accessibility of target mRNA during the design process would be helpful for the efficacy of atsRNA. Since the binding between many natural sRNAs and their corresponding targets initiates through a loop&#x02013;loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64 B65 B66">64&#x02013;66</xref>), the target site for loop nucleotides of atsRNA should also be located in an accessible loop structure.</p><p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the endogenous sRNAs, SgrS and RyhB have been shown clearly to form a specific ribonucleoprotein complex with RNase E and Hfq, resulting in translation inhibition and RNase E dependent degradation of target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Translation inhibition is the primary event for gene silencing rather than the target mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). In this study, atsRNA also led to gene silencing and RNase E dependent degradation of target mRNA and gene silencing occurred in the absence of target mRNA degradation. This is quite similar with the endogenous sRNAs RyhB and SgrS. According to the mechanism similarity between endogenous <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNA and atsRNA, we conclude that atsRNA functions also by associating with the RNase E/Hfq complex. The atsRNA-Hfq-RNase E complex acts on the SD sequences of target mRNA through base pairing sequences, resulting in translation inhibition and RNase E dependent degradation of target mRNA. For both the two endogenous sRNA and atsRNA, the decay of target mRNAs is just a consequence of translational inhibition. However, the physiological relevance of the RNase E-dependent degradation of target mRNAs would be necessary to make gene silencing irreversible.</p><p>Compared to Gram-negative bacteria, much fewer sRNAs have been identified in Gram-positive species, and there exists many differences in length, structure and function mode between the sRNAs from the two bacterial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In our study, atsRNAs targeting <italic>hla</italic> and SEA genes designed by the above principle were transformed into <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain RN4220 in which Hfq is produced. Unfortunately, the results indicated that both H and S series of atsRNAs failed to achieve significant repression effect on the respective target mRNA. It is necessary to mention that the synthesis of virulence factors in <italic>S. aureus</italic> is controlled by a regulatory RNA molecule, RNAIII, encoded by the <italic>agr</italic> locus. Transcription of genes coding for secreted toxins and enzymes is stimulated by RNAIII. More importantly, the ribosome binding site of the <italic>hla</italic> transcript is blocked by intramolecular base pairing. Hybridization with RNAIII prevents this intramolecular base pairing and makes the <italic>hla</italic> mRNA accessible for translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). So initially we doubted that the inhibition effect of H series atsRNAs might be counteracted by the competitive binding of RNAIII and <italic>hla</italic> transcript. But later sequence alignments showed that H series atsRNAs were mainly complementary to nucleotides 305&#x02013;345 of the <italic>hla</italic> transcript including the start codon and SD region, whereas RNAIII forms base pairing with the anti-SD region (nucleotides 179&#x02013;186) of the <italic>hla</italic> mRNA. So it seemed unlikely that <italic>S. aureus</italic> RNAIII, which is heavily expressed at the stationary phase of growth, would compete with the atsRNAs involved in this study. Moreover, the S series atsRNAs also triggered weak downregulation of SEA gene. Taken together, these results indicated that the designing principle was not applicable for gene silencing in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Therefore we speculated that these atsRNAs probably affected gene expression only by a slight antisense mechanism.</p><p>In low GC Gram-positive bacteria, the function of Hfq is unclear. Although Hfq has been shown to interact with <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> SR1 and SR2 as well as <italic>S. aureus</italic> RNAIII, it neither affects their stability nor facilitates the interactions between the antisense RNAs and their target mRNAs. A study from <italic>S. aureus</italic> failed to identify significant phenotype changes for an Hfq mutant strain. So it has been supposed that Hfq is dispensable for riboregulation by sRNAs in Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69 B70 B71 B72 B73">69&#x02013;73</xref>). But some notions may question this view. First, Hfq homologs are present in one or more copies in several Gram-positive species, and many of the key amino acids involved in RNA binding are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>). Second, Hfq in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> contributes to stress tolerance and pathogenesis in mice and interacts with the sRNAs, indicating a role for Hfq in sRNA-mediated riboregulation in this Gram-positive pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). Third, although Hfq protein of <italic>E. coli</italic> has a longer C terminal-tail than that of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the tail appears to be dispensable in the RNA binding function of Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>). So the possibility of <italic>S. aureus</italic> Hfq functioning as a RNA chaperon should not be excluded. Just as expected, a recent work suggested that the Hfq protein in <italic>S. aureus</italic> could also act as an RNA binding protein such as in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>). However, the mechanism how the relevant genes can be regulated by Hfq remains to be uncovered. Last but not least, some studies indicated that <italic>hfq</italic> gene was differently expressed in several <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains. Even in strains such as RN6390, Hfq can not be detected at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>). So it is supposed that while the protein-mediated riboregulation is likely to exist in Gram-positive bacterium, Hfq should not be regarded as the unique RNA chaperone, in other word, there may be other protein molecules functioning by facilitating the mRNA&#x02013;sRNA interaction. In view of this point, one important direction for future studies is to clarify whether Hfq-independent trans-acting antisense RNAs act on their own or depend on other factors that substitute for the Hfq protein. It is remarkable that a recent study provided evidence for Hfq-dependent translational repression in the Gram-positive human pathogen <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, indicating that modulation of translation by trans-encoded sRNAs may occur by both Hfq-dependent and independent mechanisms, thus adding another layer of complexity to sRNA-mediated riboregulation in Gram-positive species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). It is certainly conceivable that this mode of regulation is more widespread in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and other Gram-positive bacteria.</p><p>It is widely acknowledged that although RNA interference (RNAi) has become a powerful gene silencing tool in eukaryotes, the frequency of so-called &#x0201c;off-target effect&#x0201d; is still high to some extent. In our study, the atsRNAs designed following our principle achieved a notable inhibition effect against the targets; however, a similar issue should not be neglected. Because the atsRNA only have a considerably short and incomplete complementary base pairing with the predicted target mRNA, the cross-talk to mRNAs other than the targets seems not to be avoided easily; in other word, just like the siRNA in RNAi, the specificity of atsRNA is hard to be guaranteed. But hitherto there has not been a convincing method to settle this significant problem, so developing new specially analysis software is a promising approach, which would improve the current principle remarkably.</p><p>The small RNA has become a standard experimental tool and its therapeutic potential is being aggressively harnessed in eukaryotes. Similarly, the atsRNA-mediated gene silencing will become a popular method for studying gene function and elucidating networks of gene expression in bacteria. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that numerous endogenous <italic>trans</italic>-encoded sRNAs have crucial roles in bacterial stress responses and virulence regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>). Therefore, atsRNAs targeting against virulence genes would function effectively in bacterial pathogens and it could potentially serve as antibiotics. Given the emergence and increasing prevalence of bacterial strains that are resistant to available antibiotics, atsRNAs will provide an alternative approach to antimicrobial therapy that offers promising opportunities to inhibit pathogenesis and its consequences without placing immediate life-or-death pressure on the target bacterium.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr034/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>National Basic Research Program of China</funding-source> (973 Program) [<award-id>2003CB716402</award-id>]; <funding-source>National High Technology Research and Development Program of China</funding-source> (863 Program) [<award-id>2007AA09Z418</award-id> and <award-id>2007AA091506</award-id>].
