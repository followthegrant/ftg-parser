Recently, a novel family of endogenous lipids, palmitic acid hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs), was discovered. These have anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects in mice and are reduced in serum and adipose tissue of insulin resistant humans. In the present study, we investigate if adipose tissue dysfunction is associated with reduced PAHSA levels in human subjects and if PAHSAs influence adipocyte differentiation. Our results show that low expression of adipocyte GLUT4 and adipocyte hypertrophy, markers of adipose tissue dysfunction, are associated with reduced expression of key enzymes for de novo lipogenesis and adipose tissue levels of PAHSAs in human subjects. We also show that GLUT4 is not only a marker of adipose tissue dysfunction, but may be causally related to the observed impairments. PAHSAs may also act locally in the adipose tissue to improve adipogenesis through a mechanism bypassing direct activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR&#x003b3;). The discovery of PAHSAs and our current results provide novel insights into positive effects of lipid species in adipose tissue and mechanisms by which dysfunctional adipose tissue is associated with insulin resistance and risk of developing T2D.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">It is well documented that adipose tissue dysfunction, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and impaired adipogenesis, is an important contributor to systemic insulin resistance. Hypertrophic obesity has a central role in driving insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and has also been shown to be an independent predictor of future T2D development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

Mimicking this by deleting GLUT4 in mouse adipocytes results in whole body insulin resistance and increased diabetes risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, whereas adipose tissue-selective overexpression of GLUT4 results in hyperplastic expansion of the adipose tissue and improved glucose metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. GLUT4 is also reduced in the adipose tissue in human insulin-resistance and the degree of reduction correlates with whole-body insulin sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These findings demonstrate that reduced GLUT4 levels are an important contributor to, and a marker of, adipose tissue dysfunction and its metabolic complications.</p><p id="Par4">The beneficial metabolic effects seen in mice with adipose tissue-specific overexpression of GLUT4 (AG4OX) are related to increased glucose-dependent de novo lipogenesis in the adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and production of a novel class of lipids characterized by a branched ester linkage between a fatty acid and a hydroxy-fatty acid, FAHFAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In recent publications, we showed that the palmitic acid-hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs) have anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects in mouse models of obesity and insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We also showed that PAHSA levels are reduced in the subcutaneous adipose tissue and in serum of insulin-resistant individuals suggesting that restoring PAHSA levels could have beneficial metabolic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In agreement with this, insulin-resistant mice on a high fat diet were treated with PAHSAs and showed improvement in both insulin resistance and glucose tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, we showed that PAHSAs exert their effects, at least in part, through activation of the G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120). This receptor has also previously been described to enhance adipocyte differentiation and improve metabolic health (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>). Interestingly, recent work has shown that the positive PAHSA effects on insulin secretion are mediated by GPR40<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and this receptor also appears to play a role in PAHSA effects on insulin sensitivity. Taken together, these and previous findings suggest a link between adipose tissue dysfunction and the low levels of PAHSAs observed in insulin-resistance. However, so far, very little is known about potential direct effects of PAHSAs in adipose tissue biology and human physiology.</p><p id="Par5">The purpose of the present study is to investigate if adipose tissue dysfunction, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy and markers of impaired differentiation, is associated with low level of PAHSAs in human subjects.

However, it has not been investigated which of these two factors is the strongest predictor of whole-body insulin sensitivity. To answer this question, we performed a multiple regression analysis including adipocyte cell size and GLUT4 protein expression as predictors of insulin sensitivity measured by the hyperinsulinemic, euglucemic clamp technique in a cohort of non-diabetic subjects. As expected, GLUT4 protein was positively correlated with insulin sensitivity in two independent cohorts with similar range of insulin sensitivity (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.56, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>), while adipocyte cell size was negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.38, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.017) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>).

This needs to be directly studied.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par30">We hypothesized in the present study that markers of human subcutaneous adipose tissue dysfunction, including reduced GLUT4, adiponectin and lipogenic enzymes, were associated with low tissue levels of PAHSAs and our current results document this. We found strong correlations between these markers of adipose tissue dysfunction and low levels of all adipose tissue PAHSA isomers measured. Adipose tissue expression of key de novo lipogenic enzymes was highly correlated with circulating levels of 9- and total-PAHSA. This suggests an important role of adipose tissue lipogenesis in regulating circulating PAHSA levels which is consistent with our previous report of reduced PAHSA levels in adipose tissue and serum of adipose-ChREBP knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The adipose tissue PAHSA concentrations are expressed per mg tissue. It is possible that the results would be different if the concentrations were expressed per mg of protein. However, previous publications show that protein content is either unchanged or positively correlated with adipocyte size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which would strengthen the correlations we observe. In addition, since PAHSAs are products of an enzymatic pathway, and is likely that their abundance correlates with the activity of the specific pathway rather than with total protein content. Thus, most likely adjusting for total protein content would not change the overall results. However, this question can be addressed in future studies.</p><p id="Par31">The lack of significant correlations between GLUT4 and adipocyte size with circulating PAHSA levels may be explained by the small study cohort since trends could be seen for some serum PAHSAs. Most importantly, however, adipose tissue is not the only tissue producing PAHSAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and the serum contribution of adipose-derived PAHSAs may be diluted by other secreting tissues.</p><p id="Par32">In our current study, we also show that experimentally reducing the cellular level of GLUT4, similar to that seen in insulin-resistance in both man and murine models, results in pronounced impairment of adipocyte differentiation that did not result from nutrient deprivation. These findings suggest that low adipose tissue GLUT4 is not merely a marker of a dysfunctional adipose tissue, but may in fact be a central contributor to the impaired adipogenesis and low adipose tissue PAHSA concentrations seen in hypertrophic adipose tissue. In fact, in the current cohort the expression of GLUT4 was a stronger predictor of insulin sensitivity than adipocyte size. This finding is in line with the observations that adipose tissue specific overexpression of GLUT4 in mice leads to improved glucose homeostasis in spite of increased fat mass. It also confers protection against high fat diet-induced impaired glucose tolerance which may result from increased PAHSAs with improved pre-adipocyte differentiation and hyperplastic adipose tissue expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">The mechanisms for the reduced adipose tissue GLUT4 in insulin resistance can only be speculated upon. There may be contributing genetic factors since GLUT4 is reduced in adipose tissue in first-degree relatives to patients with T2D (FDRs) long before diabetes develops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, GLUT4 itself is not one of the identified diabetes risk genes. Furthermore, the fact that FDRs have a greater risk of developing diabetes than the pooled risk of all these genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, suggests that the reduction can be due to the presence of increased inflammation and/or epigenetic regulation. Indeed, epigenetic regulation of GLUT4 by miRNA93 has been demonstrated in adipocytes in other conditions of insulin resistance and adipocyte hypertrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par34">Large efforts have been made to understand the mechanisms favoring hyperplastic or hypertrophic adipose tissue expansion. We have shown that, for a given BMI, there are large inter-individual differences in subcutaneous adipocyte cells size and that this is related to the ability of the pre-adipocytes to undergo adipocyte differentiation, i.e., an individual whose pre-adipocytes differentiate poorly primarily expands his/her adipose tissue by cell hypertrophy, while individuals whose pre-adipocytes differentiate well may expand his/her adipose tissue by hyperplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. These findings are in line with observations by Arner <italic>et al</italic>. showing reduced turnover of adipose cells in hypertrophic adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par35">The results of our present study show that the novel PAHSA lipids, which are produced by the adipose tissue, can regulate the ability of pre-adipocytes to differentiate into mature adipocytes at least partly by activation of the C/EBP pathway. These results suggest that individuals with low adipose cell GLUT4 and endogenous PAHSA levels in the adipose tissue, also have reduced ability to differentiate new adipocytes, thus contributing to adipose tissue dysfunction as part of a negative circuit.</p><p id="Par36">Although PAHSAs were shown to promote adipogenesis, the addition of the tested lipids could not rescue the impaired adipocyte differentiation induced by GLUT4 silencing. Modulating the level of adipose tissue GLUT4 profoundly affects fatty acid synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, it is possible that silencing GLUT4 during adipocyte differentiation impairs the production of several PAHSAs or FAHFAs other than those tested that promote adipocyte differentiation through activation of PPAR&#x003b3;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The beneficial effect of the PAHSAs tested on adipocyte differentiation is clearly not a direct effect on the transcriptional activity of PPAR&#x003b3;.</p><p id="Par37">In conclusion, adipose tissue dysfunction, defined by adipocyte hypertrophy, low expression of cellular GLUT4, adiponectin and lipogenic enzymes, also is associated with low levels of adipose tissue PAHSA. Reduced GLUT4 may indeed be an important primary regulator of these downstream effects also involving currently unknown specific lipogenic enzymes for the formation of PAHSAs. Although further investigations are necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms, the discovery of PAHSAs and our current results provide novel insights into the beneficial effects of these lipids and why dysfunctional adipose tissue is associated with insulin resistance and risk of developing T2D.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par38">87 subjects with varying degrees of insulin sensitivity and BMI were recruited through advertisement in local media.
