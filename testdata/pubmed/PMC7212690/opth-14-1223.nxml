Also, Yamane<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> reported a novel method that used two 30-gauge thin-wall needles, which were inserted into the sclera to withdraw 2 IOL haptics, after which the tips of the haptics were cauterized using an ophthalmic cautery device to make a flange shape so as to not naturally drop into the vitreous. Totan<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and Hu<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> used modified methods with vitrectomy trocars to guide the IOL haptic thorough the scleral tunnels, while Walsh<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> reported guidance with 27-gauge trocars and cauterization with an ophthalmic cautery device.</p><p>Intrascleral IOL fixation is a relatively new procedure, some complications such as postoperative exposure of an IOL haptic<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> might be encountered in the future. By reviewing various methods of sutureless scleral fixation, Karadag<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> mentioned that the short-term results of these new methods were acceptable and studies including more cases with longer follow-up were needed to determine their long-term success. Furthermore, some improvements and modifications are likely necessary so as to decrease postoperative complications and make the intrascleral IOL fixation easy for surgeons.</p><p>In 2019, Thanos presented a report of a 3-port sutureless posterior chamber intraocular lens intrascleral fixation technique,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> which has similarities with our technique. For the present study, we attempted a mixed procedure with a small gauge vitrectomy using a 25-gauge trocar and simultaneous intrascleral IOL fixation through the same trocar within the lamellar scleral incision. There were some minor postoperative complications noted, such as transient postoperative ocular hypotension, ocular hypertension, mild vitreous hemorrhage and exposure of an IOL haptic, but none were severe. Concerning operation time and postoperative astigmatism, this new method is not inferior compared to the conventional procedure. We consider that the method is more convenient than a conventional because of the lower number of wound, thus recommend it as a procedure.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the patients who participated in this study and thereby made this work possible.
