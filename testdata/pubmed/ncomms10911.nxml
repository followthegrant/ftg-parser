However, biocatalytic methodologies for this type of reaction are scarce, which is related to the fact that enzymes naturally catalysing carbon&#x02013;carbon bond-forming Michael-type additions are rare. A promising template to develop new biocatalysts for carbon&#x02013;carbon bond formation is the enzyme 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, which exhibits promiscuous Michael-type addition activity. Here we present mutability landscapes for the expression, tautomerase and Michael-type addition activities, and enantioselectivity of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase. These maps of neutral, beneficial and detrimental amino acids for each residue position and enzyme property provide detailed insight into sequence&#x02013;function relationships. This offers exciting opportunities for enzyme engineering, which is illustrated by the redesign of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase into two enantiocomplementary &#x02018;Michaelases'. These &#x02018;Michaelases' catalyse the asymmetric addition of acetaldehyde to various nitroolefins, providing access to both enantiomers of &#x003b3;-nitroaldehydes, which are important precursors for pharmaceutically active &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid derivatives.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="web-summary"><p>

For example, marketed pharmaceuticals Phenibut (anxiolytic), Pregabalin (anticonvulsant), Baclofen (muscle relaxant) and Rolipram (antidepressant) can be readily obtained from distinct chiral &#x003b3;-nitroaldehydes by two simple chemical steps<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Preparation of the appropriate &#x003b3;-nitroaldehyde precursors for these GABA derivatives would require the Michael-type addition of acetaldehyde to diverse nitroalkene acceptors. The Michael-type addition of unmodified aldehydes to nitroalkenes has recently become viable by the development of proline- and peptide-based organocatalysts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, examples including acetaldehyde as donor substrate are scarce and 10&#x02013;20&#x02009;mol&#x00025; of organocatalyst in organic solvent is typically applied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Therefore, there is great interest in the development of alternative biocatalytic procedures for the enantioselective synthesis of &#x003b3;-nitroaldehydes. Unfortunately, enzymes that naturally catalyse carbon&#x02013;carbon bond-forming Michael-type additions are extremely rare<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. A few elegant studies on promiscuous enzyme-catalysed carbon&#x02013;carbon bond-forming Michael-type additions have been reported; however, most of these reactions proceed in organic solvent with low or moderate stereocontrol and do not involve acetaldehyde as donor substrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>The enzyme 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) is composed of six identical subunits of only 62 amino acid residues each<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. It belongs to the tautomerase superfamily, a group of homologous proteins that share a unique catalytic amino-terminal proline (Pro-1) and a characteristic &#x003b2;-&#x003b1;-&#x003b2; structural fold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. 4-OT takes part in a catabolic pathway for aromatic hydrocarbons in <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> mt-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), where it catalyses the tautomerization of 2-hydroxymuconate (<bold>1</bold>) to yield 2-oxohex-3-enedioate (<bold>2</bold>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Residue Pro-1 functions as a general base (p<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>&#x02248;6.4) that transfers the 2-hydroxyl proton of <bold>1</bold> to the C5-position to give <bold>2</bold> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Two other key catalytic residues are Arg-11 and Arg-39. Arg-39 is proposed to interact with the 2-hydroxyl group of <bold>1</bold> and a C-1 carboxylate oxygen, whereas Arg-11 is proposed to interact with the C-6 carboxylate group in a bidentate manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The latter interaction may draw electron density towards C-5 to facilitate protonation by Pro-1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p><p>Inspired by the versatile success of proline and its derivatives as organocatalysts, we anticipated and found the proline-based enzyme 4-OT to promiscuously catalyse carbon&#x02013;carbon bond-forming reactions such as aldolizations and Michael-type additions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. These include Michael-type additions of linear aldehydes, such as acetaldehyde (<bold>3</bold>) or butanal (<bold>4</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), to a variety of nitroalkenes (<bold>5a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>5g</bold>) to yield enantioenriched &#x003b3;-nitroaldehydes (<bold>6a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>6g</bold> and <bold>7</bold>), which are important precursors for GABA analogues such as the above-mentioned pharmaceuticals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The proposed catalytic mechanism involves formation of an enamine intermediate of the aldehyde donor with the active site Pro-1 residue of 4-OT, reminiscent of the mechanism of proline-based organocatalysts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p><p>The discovery of the promiscuous Michael-type addition activity of 4-OT is an important step on the way to develop new biocatalysts for synthetically useful Michael-type reactions. Accordingly, it would be very attractive to enhance the Michael-type addition activity of 4-OT and improve its enantioselectivity. Because of the strong advantage of working with a protein with a small monomer size, we describe herein the construction of entire mutability landscapes for the expression, tautomerase and Michael-type addition activities, and enantioselectivity of 4-OT. These landscapes may be assessed and reasoned about as a whole, providing detailed insight into sequence&#x02013;function relationships. Simultaneously, intelligent mutability-landscape navigation, coupled to combinatorial mutagenesis, offers exciting opportunities for rapid enzyme engineering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. This is illustrated here by the generation of 4-OT variants with improved activity and enantioselectivity, as well as inverted enantioselectivity, in Michael-type additions. The usefulness of these designer &#x02018;Michaelases' is demonstrated by their application in the asymmetric addition of acetaldehyde to various nitroalkenes, providing convenient access to both enantiomers of chiral &#x003b3;-nitroaldehydes, which are valuable precursors for GABA derivatives, several of which represent marketed pharmaceuticals.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Collection of single 4-OT mutants</title><p>To chart the mutability landscapes of 4-OT, a collection of 4-OT genes encoding nearly all possible single variants of 4-OT was constructed. This unique collection covered at least 15 of the 19 possible variants at each residue position, from Ile-2 to the carboxy-terminal Arg-62. Single mutants of the N-terminal proline residue (Pro-1) were not included in the collection, because Pro-1 is a key catalytic residue and mutations at this position lead to incorrect demethionylation of the protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The 4-OT genes did not contain any affinity tag and were individually cloned, stored and expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21(DE3). Importantly, as all 4-OT variants are stored and analysed separately, no oversampling is required.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mutability landscape of 4-OT for protein expression</title><p>A mutability landscape for protein expression was generated by determining the effect of each mutation on the production of soluble 4-OT protein. From the alignment of this landscape with the secondary structure elements of 4-OT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), it becomes apparent that many mutations in the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-helix result in decreased production of soluble protein. Most notably, the introduction of a proline residue at any given position in the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-helix has a pronounced effect on soluble 4-OT production. It seems likely to be that the introduction of a proline disrupts this &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-helix, resulting in an insoluble 4-OT mutant. The &#x003b2;-hairpin element (Gly-51 to Leu-56) is thought to play a crucial role in the stabilization of the hexameric structure of 4-OT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Although most mutations in this region do not seem to affect the amount of soluble protein produced, replacing the negatively charged Glu-55 with a positively charged residue (Lys or Arg) decreases the amount of soluble 4-OT protein produced to a level that is below the detection limit. The average effect of each amino acid substitution on the amount of soluble protein produced reveals that substitutions to Trp, Arg and Pro are the most unfavourable ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). A probable explanation for this is that these residues have the biggest impact on the protein structure because of their volumetrically large side chain, charge or conformational rigidity, respectively. The finding that these amino acid substitutions are highly unfavourable for soluble protein production is consistent with the results of a recently published systematic mutagenesis study on a protein-binding domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. On the other hand, some mutations seem to increase the amount of soluble protein produced. These mutations can be found mainly at positions His-6, Ile-7 and Lys-47. Gratifyingly, the majority of the mutants was produced in sufficient amounts to enable activity assays.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mutability landscape of 4-OT for tautomerase activity</title><p>A mutability landscape for the tautomerase activity of 4-OT was generated by determining the effect of each mutation on the ability of the enzyme to ketonize phenylenolpyruvate (<bold>8</bold>) to phenylpyruvate (<bold>9</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Screening assays with the native substrate of 4-OT, 2-hydroxymuconate (<bold>1</bold>), were not possible due to the high activity (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>&#x0223c;3500, s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) of the enzyme with this substrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Hence, activity profiling required very low enzyme concentrations, probably leading to hexamer dissociation, yielding unreproducible results. Therefore, the alternative substrate <bold>8</bold> (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>=73&#x02009;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was used to monitor the tautomerase activity of 4-OT, which enabled a practical screening assay with reproducible results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p><p>The mutability landscape for 4-OT's tautomerase activity demonstrates the mutational robustness of the enzyme for this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). This is apparent from mutations in various regions of the enzyme that show no or little effect on activity, including the regions Ser-12 to Arg-29 and Gly-54 to Arg-62. It has been hypothesized that such neutral mutations can have an important role in natural enzyme evolution, because they may result in &#x02018;neutral drift'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Whitman and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> demonstrated that the two active-site arginines (Arg-11 and Arg-39) of 4-OT are required for the tautomerization of dicarboxylate substrates, because they interact with the carboxylate moieties of the substrate. Fully consistent with this finding, we observed that only one active-site arginine (Arg-11) is essential for the tautomerization of the monocarboxylate substrate <bold>8</bold>. In addition to Arg-11, also Gly-10 appears to be important for the tautomerase activity. As mutations at Gly-10 have no significant effect on enzyme expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), it is unlikely to be that this residue is required for correct overall folding of the enzyme. It is therefore tempting to speculate that this residue is required for securing the correct architecture of the active site.</p><p>Interestingly, five positions at which single mutations result in significantly improved tautomerase activity (&#x0003e;5-fold) were identified. These include mutations at positions Ile-2, Gln-4, Leu-8, Ser-37 and Phe-50. Whereas Ile-2, Leu-8, Ser-37 and Phe-50 are lining the Pro-1 pocket, the distance between Gln-4 and Pro-1 is &#x0223c;11&#x02009;&#x000c5;, illustrating that both close and distant mutations can improve activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. These findings suggest that 4-OT could be readily engineered to become a more efficient catalyst for the tautomerization of <bold>8</bold>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mutability landscape of 4-OT for the addition of <bold>3</bold> to <bold>5a</bold></title><p>To generate a mutability landscape for the promiscuous &#x02018;Michaelase' activity of 4-OT, the effect of each mutation on the ability of the enzyme to catalyse the addition of acetaldehyde (<bold>3</bold>) to <italic>trans</italic>-&#x003b2;-nitrostyrene (<bold>5a</bold>) was determined. This activity was monitored (using ultraviolet spectroscopy) by following the depletion of substrate <bold>5a</bold> in the presence of <bold>3</bold> and enzyme. For each mutant, control experiments confirmed that the depletion of <bold>5a</bold> was dependent on the presence of both <bold>3</bold> and enzyme. This indicates that the conversion of <bold>5a</bold> was indeed the result of an enzyme-catalysed Michael-type addition of <bold>3</bold> to <bold>5a</bold> (rather than the enzyme-catalysed addition of water to <bold>5a</bold>).</p><p>The mutability landscape shows that the majority of mutations does not have a significant effect on this &#x02018;Michaelase' activity of 4-OT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). This demonstrates the mutational robustness of the enzyme for this promiscuous activity. The key functionally important residue that can be identified from the mutability landscape is Arg-39, which is in accordance with the proposed mechanism of this Michael-type addition reaction, in which Arg-39 serves as a catalytic acid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The observation that the activity is partially restored when Arg-39 is replaced by a positively charged residue that could function also as an acid (Lys or His) further strengthens this proposed mechanistic role of Arg-39. Interestingly, the other active-site arginine (Arg-11) appears to be less important for this promiscuous &#x02018;Michaelase' activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>), whereas it was shown to be essential for the phenylenolpyruvate tautomerase activity of 4-OT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Residues around and in the &#x003b2;-hairpin element (Gly-51 to Leu-56) also appear to be important for this Michael-type addition activity of 4-OT. Especially mutations at the positions of Phe-50 and the two glycine residues in the middle of the &#x003b2;-hairpin seem to have a large functional effect.</p><p>Most notably, four mutations at position Ala-33 result in an improved &#x02018;Michaelase' activity of 4-OT. When this residue was replaced by negatively charged residues (Asp or Glu), or the corresponding polar residues (Asn or Gln), the activity was significantly enhanced. Of these mutants, variant A33D had a 3.5-fold increase in specific activity, making it the most active single 4-OT mutant for this Michael-type addition reaction. In contrast, the phenylenolpyruvate tautomerase activity of variant A33D was reduced &#x0223c;8-fold when compared with that of wild-type 4-OT.</p><p>The preparative usefulness of the A33D mutant was compared with that of wild-type 4-OT by transformations using 0.7&#x02009;mol&#x00025; biocatalyst and a 25-fold excess of <bold>3</bold> (50&#x02009;mM) over <bold>5a</bold> (2&#x02009;mM). Analysis of the progress curves of these reactions confirmed that mutant A33D is more efficient in the addition of <bold>3</bold> to <bold>5a</bold> than wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), with the A33D-catalysed reaction being completed within just 90&#x02009;min at room temperature. The products were purified and characterized using <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy, chiral phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and optical rotation measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 2 and 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). This analysis revealed that in addition to enhanced activity, mutant A33D also has improved enantioselectivity compared with wild-type 4-OT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, compare entries 1 and 2), producing the <italic>3S</italic> enantiomer of 4-nitro-3-phenylbutanal (<bold>6a</bold>) with an enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) of 99:1. The isolated product yield could be improved by conducting the enzymatic reaction at pH 6.5 instead of pH 7.3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, entries 4 and 5, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 4&#x02013;6</xref>), lowering the amount of byproducts formed, which result from the inherent tendency of acetaldehyde to rapidly react with itself, forming oligomers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.

These results clearly demonstrate the potential of the A33D mutant enzyme for application in enantioselective synthesis of various &#x003b3;-nitroaldehydes. The discovery of the A33D mutant illustrates the opportunities for protein improvement afforded by experimental protein mutability landscapes; this single mutant would probably not have been generated by using an error-prone PCR approach, because the codon for Ala-33 in 4-OT (GCG) requires two point mutations to produce an aspartate (GAT or GAC).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mutability landscapes of 4-OT for the addition of <bold>4</bold> to <bold>5a</bold></title><p>To gain further insight into which residues govern the activity and enantioselectivity of 4-OT in Michael-type addition reactions, we determined the effect of each mutation on the ability of 4-OT to catalyse the addition of butanal (<bold>4</bold>) to <italic>trans</italic>-&#x003b2;-nitrostyrene (<bold>5a</bold>), and to yield enantioenriched product <bold>7</bold>.

To prevent epimerization of product <bold>7</bold> and minimize the formation of side products, reactions were performed at pH 5.5 instead of pH 7.3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Under these conditions, however, slight protein precipitation was observed with some mutants, precluding accurate activity measurements.</p><p>Nevertheless, the mutability landscape clearly demonstrates the mutational robustness of the C-terminal domain (Ala-57 to Arg-62) of 4-OT for the Michael-type addition of <bold>4</bold> to <bold>5a</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). This robustness of the C-terminal domain has also been observed for the other two activities analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>), which may suggest a minor contribution of this domain to catalysis. The overall mutational robustness of 4-OT for the Michael-type addition of <bold>4</bold> to <bold>5a</bold>, however, seems less when compared with the Michael-type addition activity of <bold>3</bold> to <bold>5a</bold>. This may be related to the difference in the pH of the assay buffer (pH 5.5 versus pH 7.3).</p><p>Importantly, the mutability landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) revealed four residue positions at which mutations significantly improved the specific activity of 4-OT for the Michael-type addition of <bold>4</bold> to <bold>5a</bold>. The higher number of favourable mutations found for this reaction, when compared with the Michael-type addition of <bold>3</bold> to <bold>5a</bold>, could be the result of the additional ethyl group on the aldehyde substrate, which could serve as an extra handle for the enzyme to coordinate substrate binding. The first position where beneficial single mutations (Val, Ile, Leu or Met) were found is His-6. For this position, the best mutant enzyme was H6M, which has an &#x0223c;3-fold increased specific activity compared with that of wild-type 4-OT. The second position is Ala-33, which on mutation to a Glu improved the specific activity &#x0223c;4-fold compared with that of wild-type 4-OT (a Gln at this position improved the activity slightly). Notably, the A33E mutation also significantly improved the activity of 4-OT for the Michael-type addition of <bold>3</bold> to <bold>5a</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The third position is Met-45; at this position, four single mutations improved the activity, including mutations to Ile (2.1-fold), Tyr (2.3-fold), His (3.6-fold) and Thr (2-fold). Finally, at position Phe-50, mutations to Leu and Val improved the specific activity 2.5- and &#x0223c;5-fold, respectively, compared with that of wild-type 4-OT. This makes the F50V enzyme the most active single 4-OT mutant for the Michael-type addition of <bold>4</bold> to <bold>5a</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 28</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). These identified hotspots are good targets to further enhance 4-OT's promiscuous &#x02018;Michaelase' activity, as shown by combinatorial mutagenesis, which yielded a triple mutant, H6M/A33E/F50V, with strongly enhanced activity for the Michael-type addition of <bold>4</bold> to <bold>5a</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Discussion</xref> for full details).</p><p>No significant changes in the diastereoselectivity were observed, as all active mutant enzymes such as wild-type 4-OT produced the <italic>syn</italic> diastereomer of <bold>7</bold> in large excess (diastereomeric ratio (d.r.) &#x02265;72:28).

The residue positions where single mutations led to the most pronounced improvement in enantioselectivity are Ala-33, Arg-39, Ala-57 and Arg-61. A comparison of the mutability landscapes suggests that in contrast to the mutational robustness of the C-terminal domain for the natural and promiscuous activities of 4-OT, this domain appears to contribute largely to the enantioselectivity of 4-OT in the Michael-type addition of <bold>4</bold> to <bold>5a</bold>.</p><p>The single mutants with the best enantioselectivity at each of these residue positions (A33D, R39E, A57Y and R61M) were purified and characterized for their ability to produce enantioenriched products in the Michael-type addition of <bold>4</bold> to <bold>5a</bold>, as well as <bold>3</bold> to <bold>5a</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).

This makes the R39E mutant a promising biocatalyst for application in the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched <italic>2R3S</italic>-<bold>7</bold>.</p><p>Interestingly, the mutability landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>) further shows that several single variants of 4-OT have inverted enantioselectivity, producing the <italic>2S3R</italic> enantiomer of <bold>7</bold> in excess over the <italic>2R3S</italic> enantiomer. Mutations at positions His-6, Arg-11, Met-45, Phe-50 and Gly-54 had the most pronounced effect on inversion of enantioselectivity. Three of these positions (His-6, Met-45 and Phe-50) overlap with the positions at which single mutations were identified, which improve 4-OT's &#x02018;Michaelase' activity for addition of <bold>4</bold> to <bold>5a</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The best mutant at each of these positions (H6I, R11I, M45H, F50A and G54E) was purified and characterized for its ability to produce enantioenriched products in the Michael-type addition of both <bold>3</bold> to <bold>5a</bold> and <bold>4</bold> to <bold>5a</bold>. At position Met-45, the second-best mutant was chosen for analysis, because the best mutant at this position (M45Y) could not be purified to homogeneity due to insufficient expression (consistent with the mutability landscape shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Strikingly, all five mutants did not only have inverted enantioselectivity for the Michael-type addition of <bold>4</bold> to <bold>5a</bold> but also for the Michael-type addition of <bold>3</bold> to <bold>5a</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).

However, the M45Y and F50A mutations did have a pronounced effect on the active-site geometry near Pro-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 31a,b</xref>). In the wild-type 4-OT structure, the side chains of Met-45 and Phe-50 point towards Pro-1, restricting access to a small hydrophobic pocket at the back of the active site. In the structure of mutant M45Y/F50A, the side chain of Tyr-45 is rotated away from Pro-1 towards the back of the active site, where it forms a hydrogen bond with His-6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 31c</xref>). Combined with the replacement of the bulky Phe-50 with an alanine, the M45Y mutation results in a significant opening and enlargement of the hydrophobic pocket near Pro-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 31a,b</xref>). This enlarged pocket in the M45Y/F50A mutant is able to accommodate the phenyl group of <bold>5a</bold>, as revealed in the crystal structure of mutant M45Y/F50A complexed with this substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The phenyl group of <bold>5a</bold> makes van der Waals contacts with residues Pro-1, His-6, Ile-7, Leu-8 and Ile-41 in the hydrophobic pocket, whereas the nitro group is in van der Waals contact with Ser-37 and forms a salt bridge with the guanidinium group of Arg-39. The central ethylene group of <bold>5a</bold> is only &#x0223c;3&#x02009;&#x000c5; away from the amino group of Pro-1. The observed binding mode of <bold>5a</bold> in the structure of mutant M45Y/F50A is not possible in the wild-type 4-OT structure, due to steric hindrance by the Phe-50 and Met-45 residues.</p><p>In conclusion, our results reveal that the two mutations (M45Y and F50A) unexpectedly created a new substrate-binding pocket. This active-site remodelling is most probably responsible for the observed differences in activity and enantioselectivity between mutant and wild-type 4-OT. However, these findings <italic>per se</italic> do not explain the enantiopreference of mutant M45Y/F50A. The electron density for bound <bold>5a</bold> does not indicate a preference of this substrate to bind with an orientation relative to Pro-1 that is consistent with the formation of the (<italic>R</italic>)-product; the other orientation differing by a rotation of &#x0223c;180&#x000b0; around the longitudinal axis of the substrate molecule, and consistent with formation of the (<italic>S</italic>)-product, fits equally well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 31d</xref>).

To further improve this activity, a 4-OT mutant library was constructed in which the most favourable mutations at these four positions were combined.
