Recent data suggest that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) deficiency causes delay in the repair and regeneration of many tissues such as bones, muscles, lung, hematopoietic cells, intestines, and liver (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>). Although COX-2 may affect multiple mechanisms of tissue repair and regeneration, we reason that COX-2&#x02013;mediated regenerative functions ultimately work directly or indirectly through stem cells that are responsible for tissue repair and regeneration. To support this reasoning, previous studies have well documented the importance of COX-2 for stem cell functions. To provide some examples, early studies have shown that COX-2 is critical for the survival of embryonic stem cells (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Recent data further demonstrate that COX-2 plays an essential role in the survival of cancer stem cells and hence in the repopulation of cancer cells during chemotherapy and radiotherapy (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). In addition, the role of COX-2 in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been intensively investigated. It has been reported that COX-2 promotes the differentiation of MSCs into cardiocytes (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>) and that COX-2 deficiency impairs bone regeneration mediated by muscle-derived stem cells (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>).</p><p>With respect to the role of COX-2 in MSC-mediated tissue repair and regeneration, recent data have further demonstrated that MSCs are heterogeneous and contain multiple subsets. However, the mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates the differentiation of MSC subsets to promote the repair and regeneration of different tissues remain unknown. In this regard, one of the tissues that has been intensively studied for the role of COX-2 in the MSC-mediated tissue repair and regeneration is the bone. It has been convincingly demonstrated that COX-2 deficiency causes delay of bone repair (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>). In addition, data from our laboratory have shown that local COX-2 overexpression in fracture sites accelerates fracture repair (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). On the basis of these previous findings, we reason that a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which local COX-2 overexpression accelerates fracture repair can help the development of novel strategies for the acceleration of bone repair. Moreover, because the bone is one of the few tissues that can repair to their original structures, mechanistic insights on the COX-2 overexpression&#x02013;mediated acceleration of bone repair can also shed lights on the cause for a lack of complete tissue repair and hence can potentially facilitate the development of novel strategies for improving the repair and regeneration of those tissues that cannot repair to their original architectures.</p><p>Accordingly, this study aimed to understand the mechanisms by which local COX-2 overexpression regulates the differentiation of MSC subsets in fracture sites to promote fracture repair. In this regard, our previous findings have demonstrated that local COX-2 overexpression increases the number of osteocalcin (OCN)&#x02013;expressing osteoblasts, as well as the mRNA expressions of <italic>alkaline phosphatase</italic> (<italic>ALP</italic>) and <italic>osteopontin</italic> in fracture sites (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). In contrast, local COX-2 overexpression reduces callus size, cartilage area, the expression of <italic>Sox9</italic> mRNA, and the expression of <italic>Col10</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> mRNA in fracture sites (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). These previous findings indicate that local COX-2 overexpression promotes osteoblast differentiation but suppresses chondrocyte differentiation. Accordingly, we hypothesize that local COX-2 overexpression augments the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblast progenitors but suppresses the differentiation of MSCs into chondrocyte progenitors in fracture sites. This study tested this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of the specific mSSC subset that was quantitatively increased in fracture sites following local COX-2 overexpression</title><p>Because recent data have demonstrated that skeletal MSC subsets can be distinguished by surface markers in both mice and humans (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>), as the first step to evaluate our hypothesis, we used the previously reported skeletal MSC surface markers to investigate MSCs in fracture sites. In this regard, recent data suggest that mouse skeletal stem cells (mSSCs; i.e., CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Tie2<sup>&#x02212;</sup>AlphaV<sup>+</sup> MSCs) can be further divided into two broad categories, i.e., CD90<sup>+</sup> and 6C3<sup>+</sup> mSSCs (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>). Therefore, we proceeded to examine the CD90<sup>+</sup> and 6C3<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in fracture sites. Accordingly, C57BL/6 (B6) mice were subjected to femur fracture surgery and, on the following day, received in the fracture sites no treatment, a control adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, or the AAV.COX-2 vector. On days 3, 4, 7, and 10 following the vector treatments, contralateral bones and the bones spanning the fracture sites were harvested and bone marrows were flushed. These bones in which bone marrows have been removed are specifically designated as &#x0201c;intact bones&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;fractured bones,&#x0201d; respectively. Subsequently, we isolated mononuclear cells (MNCs). Hence, these isolated MNCs were not contaminated with bone marrow cells and represented the cells that actively participated in the formation of fracture calluses and in the repair of fractures. We then analyzed the isolated MNCs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Our data showed that, on day 3, the local COX-2 overexpression increased the abundance of mSSCs in the fractured bones (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, top). In addition, the local COX-2 overexpression selectively and significantly increased the abundance of CD90<sup>+</sup> but not of 6C3<sup>+</sup> mSSCs [<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C</xref> (middle and bottom) and D]. We also confirmed a previous finding that the expressions of CD90 and 6C3 among mSSCs were mutually exclusive (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>). Moreover, our data showed that COX-2 overexpression prolonged the presence of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in the fractured bones (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Local COX-2 overexpression selectively increased the abundance and prolonged the presence of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in the fractured bones.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) B6 mice were subjected to femur fracture surgery (Fx).

These findings prompted us to determine the mechanisms by which CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs were positioned in fracture sites following local COX-2 overexpression. In this regard, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) has been previously shown to play a role in the recruitment of MSCs into fracture sites (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Hence, we first asked whether local COX-2 overexpression increased the expression of MCP-1 in fracture sites. To answer this question, we subjected B6 mice to femur fracture surgery and treated the fractures as described in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Four days after the vector treatments, the fractured bones and contralateral intact bones were harvested and analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Our data showed that <italic>MCP-1</italic> mRNA expression in the fractured bones, when compared to that in the intact bones, was significantly increased by twofold (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), a finding that is consistent with a previous report (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>).

In addition, on the day following the fracture surgery, half of the animals from each group received a treatment of a control AAV vector and the other half the AAV.COX-2 vector in fracture sites. On day 4 following the treatments, the fractured bones and contralateral intact bones were harvested and the MNCs were isolated for analyses by FACS. Data are shown in (D) and (E).

Accordingly, B6 mice were subjected to fracture surgery and, beginning on the same day, subcutaneously received a daily dose of either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or the clone 2H5 for three consecutive days. In addition, on the second day after the fracture surgery, half of the animals in each group received in the fracture sites a dose of a control AAV vector and the other half received the AAV.COX-2 vector. Four days after the vector treatments, we harvested fractured bones and contralateral intact bones and isolated MNCs for analysis by FACS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Our data showed that the clone 2H5 completely blocked the increase in CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSC abundance in the fractured bones following the local COX-2 overexpression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the increased abundance of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in fractured bones following local COX-2 overexpression is a consequence of MCP-1&#x02013;mediated cellular recruitment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study of the MSCs that were targeted by MCP-1</title><p>Our observation of the MCP-1&#x02013;mediated increase in CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSC abundance in fractured bones following local COX-2 overexpression can be due to an increased recruitment of CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs, followed by a conversion of the CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs into CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs or a direct recruitment of CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs from progenitor niches near fractured bones. To address these two possibilities, in an in vitro migration assay, we determined the ability of CD90<sup>+</sup> and CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs to migrate toward bone chips that were derived from fractured bones. In this in vitro migration assay system, the bone chips mimicked the in vivo microenvironment of fractured bones. Specifically, we subjected B6 mice to femur fracture surgery and treated the fractures with vectors as described in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Four days after the vector treatments, approximately equal lengths of fractured bones and contralateral intact bones were harvested and cut into small pieces to prepare bone chips. The bone chips were then placed in the lower chambers of a 24-well Transwell culture plate. In addition, an equal number (2.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) of CD90<sup>+</sup> or CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow&#x02013;derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) was seeded in the upper chambers. We cocultured the MSCs and bone chips for 48 hours, fixed the membranes, and counted the MSCs migrating into the membranes (fig. S1A). Our data showed that, when compared to the membranes from the CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSC cultures, those from the CD90<sup>+</sup> MSC cultures showed significantly more migrated MSCs under all conditions (fig. S1, B to D). The data suggest that MCP-1 mainly recruits CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs from progenitor niches near fractured bones.</p><p>Because the receptor for MCP-1 is C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2), the foregoing in vitro migration data suggest that CD90<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> MSCs are present in the progenitor niches near fractured bones. To support this notion, previous data have already shown that tissues near the fractured bones, e.g., periostea, endostea, muscles, and bone marrow, all contain CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>). To determine whether CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs in these potential progenitor niches indeed express CCR2 and whether local COX-2 overexpression further increases the abundance of CD90<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> MSCs, we subjected B6 mice to tibia fracture surgery and treated the fractures with vectors as described in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Four days after the vector treatments, the following tissues were collected from the fracture and contralateral sites: bones (fractured bones and intact bones), bone marrows, and muscles. Subsequently, we isolated the MNCs for analysis by FACS (fig. S1E). Our data showed that the MCP-1&#x02013;responsive CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells were present in bones, bone marrows, and muscles. In addition, the frequencies of CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly increased in the bones and muscles but not in the bone marrows following the local COX-2 overexpression (fig. S1, F and G). Hence, the above data support that MCP-1 targets CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs from progenitor niches near fractured bones. In addition, our data suggest that local COX-2 overexpression enhances the recruitment of CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs not only by augmenting the expressions of MCP-1 in the fractured bones (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) but also by increasing the abundance of MCP-1&#x02013;responsive CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells mainly in periostea, endostea, and muscles but not in the bone marrow.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mechanisms by which local COX-2 overexpression increased the abundance of CD90<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> MSCs in the progenitor niches near fractured bones</title><p>The increasing abundance of CD90<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> MSCs in some progenitor niches such as muscles near the fractured bones following local COX-2 overexpression could be due to an increased proliferation of preexisting CD90<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> MSCs. The other possibility could be an increased proliferation of CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs following the conversion of the CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs into CD90<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> MSCs. To evaluate these possibilities, we labeled CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD90<sup>+</sup> BM-MSCs with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). Subsequently, 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFSE-labeled CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs were seeded into the lower chambers of a 24-well Transwell culture plate. In addition, the upper chambers were added with no cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells that were transduced with a control AAV vector, or HEK293T cells that were transduced with the AAV.COX-2 vector. The cells were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Four days later, we collected and analyzed the CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs for CFSE dilution by FACS. Our data showed that molecules secreted by COX-2&#x02013;overexpressed cells promoted the proliferation of CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> but not of CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs (fig. S2A). To support this finding, our data further showed that, at 1, 10, and 100 nM, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is one of the molecules produced by COX-2, significantly increased the proliferation of purified CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> but not of CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs in an in vitro [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) proliferation assay (fig. S2B).</p><p>The COX-2&#x02013;mediated increase in the proliferation of CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> but not of CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs suggests that COX-2 may also promote the conversion of CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs into CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs. To address this potential, we seeded purified CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> BM-MSCs in the lower chambers of a 24-well Transwell culture plate.

Hence, we proceeded to determine the effects of local COX-2 overexpression on the osteoblast differentiation of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in fractured bones. Because CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs purified from fractured bones were quantitatively low, in most experiments, purified CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs were first expanded in cultures for up to 3 weeks. Hence, we first determined the purity and phenotypic stability of purified CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs (fig. S3A). Our data showed that purified CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs were approximately 96% pure and expressed MSC markers (i.e., CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD34<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>CD73<sup>+</sup>CD29<sup>+</sup>). In addition, the purity and MSC marker expressions were stable for at least 3 weeks (fig. S3, B and C). Using these CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs purified from fractured bones, we then asked whether the purified CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs could indeed differentiate into osteoblasts in fracture sites. To address this question, we subjected B6.GFP mice to femur fracture surgery. Four days later, fractured bones were harvested for the purification of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs and CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mesenchymal cells. Subsequently, the purified CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs and CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mesenchymal cells were subcutaneously administered into recipient B6 mice near the fracture sites on the second day following the femur fracture surgery. Twenty-one days later, we harvested and analyzed the bones spanning the fracture sites for the expressions of GFP (green fluorescent protein) and OCN (i.e., the marker for osteoblasts) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (fig. S3D). Our data showed that only the bones administered with the GFP-expressing CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs, but not those administered with the GFP-expressing CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mesenchymal cells, displayed a clear presence of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (fig. S3E). In addition, an appreciable number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were costained with OCN, indicating differentiation of the CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs into osteoblasts.</p><p>Having demonstrated that CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs can differentiate into osteoblasts in fracture sites, we used an in vitro nodule assay to determine whether local COX-2 overexpression augmented the osteoblast differentiation of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in fractured bones. Accordingly, CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs purified from fractured bones were cultured in an osteoblast differentiation medium for 21 days. Our data showed that CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs purified from COX-2&#x02013;overexpressed fractured bones, when compared to those from the control-treated fractured bones, displayed enhanced mineralization as determined by Alizarin Red staining (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In addition, we also cultured the purified CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs for 1 week before performing the nodule assay. Our data showed similar results (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). A nodule assay time study showed a significant effect of local COX-2 overexpression at 1 week with continued effect for 3 weeks (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, F and G</xref>). Because CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs purified from fractured bones did not spontaneously differentiate into osteoblasts in the absence of the osteoblast differentiation medium in the nodule assay, we conclude that local COX-2 overexpression significantly augments the osteoblast differentiation potential of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in fractured bones and that additional signals are required for the ultimate differentiation of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs into osteoblasts.</p><p>To further support the role of COX-2 in augmenting the osteoblast differentiation potential of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs, our data showed that soluble factors secreted by COX-2&#x02013;overexpressed cells augmented the expressions of OCN and OSX in BM-MSCs, which were abolished by the COX-2&#x02013;specific inhibitor Celecoxib (fig. S4, A and B). Because PGE2 is a major COX-2 enzymatic product, we determined the relative contribution of the four PGE2 receptors (i.e., EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) to the COX-2 overexpression&#x02013;mediated augmentation of osteoblast differentiation in CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in fracture sites. Accordingly, B6 mice were subjected to femur fracture surgery and, beginning on the same day, received a daily subcutaneous dose of an inhibitor for EP1, EP2, EP3, or EP4 near the fracture sites. In addition, on the second day following the fracture surgery, the animals received in the fracture sites a dose of a control AAV vector or the AAV.COX-2 vector. On day 4 following the fracture surgery, we harvested the fractured bones and contralateral intact bones and purified the CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs for analysis by RT-qPCR and an in vitro nodule assay for osteoblast differentiation (fig. S4C). The RT-qPCR analysis showed that the expressions of <italic>EP1</italic>, <italic>EP2</italic>, <italic>EP3</italic>, and <italic>EP4</italic> in the fractured bones were effectively inhibited by the corresponding inhibitors (fig. S4D). The in vitro nodule assay demonstrated that, although EP2, EP3, and EP4 inhibitors significantly suppressed the mineralization in the CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs purified from the control-treated fractured bones, the EP1 inhibitor significantly enhanced the mineralization (fig. S4, E and F). These data are consistent with the previously reported positive roles of EP2, EP3, and EP4 and a negative role of EP1 in wound healing (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>). Similar to the findings in the control-treated fractured bones, in the COX-2&#x02013;treated fractured bones, the mineralization of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs was significantly blocked by EP2, EP3, and EP4 inhibitors but not by the EP1 inhibitor (fig. S4, G and H). The foregoing data suggest that the PGE2 receptors are tightly regulated in CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs during fracture repair.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The effects of local COX-2 overexpression on the chondrocyte differentiation of CD90<sup>+</sup> SCs in fractured bones</title><p>In addition to being able to differentiate into osteoblast, CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs from the bone marrow have been shown to differentiate into chondrocytes as well (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>). Hence, we sought to determine whether CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in fractured bones could also differentiate into chondrocytes and, if yes, how local COX-2 overexpression affected their chondrocyte differentiation. To address these questions, we subjected B6 mice to femur fracture surgery and treated the fractures with vectors as described in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Four days after the vector treatments, the fractured bones were harvested and CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs and CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mesenchymal cells were purified for analyses by RT-qPCR and an in vitro chondrogenesis assay (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

Because the above three genes are necessary for chondrocyte differentiation, our data suggest that CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in fractured bones also mediate chondrocyte differentiation during normal fracture repair. In addition, our data showed that the local COX-2 overexpression significantly reduced the mRNA expressions of the above three genes in the CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), which suggests that local COX-2 overexpression suppresses the chondrocyte differentiation of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in fractured bones. Further analyses using the in vitro chondrogenesis assay showed that, in the control-treated fractured bones, CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs differentiated into chondrocytes. Consistent with the gene expression data, the chondrocyte differentiation of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs was suppressed by local COX-2 overexpression (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).

In addition, on the second day following the fracture surgery, half of the animals that were administered with PBS or the clone 30H12 received no treatment and the other half received the AAV.COX-2 vector in the fracture sites. Furthermore, a group of animals that received only a control AAV vector in the fracture sites was also included as a control. On days 4, 10, and 21 following the vector treatments, the bones spanning the fracture sites were then examined by x-ray. At the end of the experiment (day 21), the bones spanning the fracture sites were harvested for analyses by micro-computed tomography (&#x003bc;CT) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Data from the x-ray analysis on day 21 were consistent with our previous report (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>) that local COX-2 overexpression in fracture sites, when compared to the controls, significantly decreased callus sizes (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, D and E</xref>, and fig. S6). In addition, our data in the current study further showed that the COX-2 overexpression&#x02013;mediated reduction of callus size was abolished by the clone 30H12 administration. Moreover, &#x003bc;CT analysis demonstrated that, in the fracture sites, the local COX-2 overexpression significantly increased connectivity density, bone volume, bone mineral density, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness but decreased trabecular space, all of which indicated enhanced new bone formation (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, F and G</xref>). This enhanced new bone formation was completely abolished by the clone 30H12 administration. Hence, we conclude that local COX-2 overexpression targets CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs to accelerate fracture repair.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" disp-level="1"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Bone fractures are the most common injuries sustained by humans. In the United States alone, there are approximately 6.3 million fractures annually (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>), emphasizing the existence of a large population of patients requiring medical intervention. In contrast to this high demand for medical intervention, there is only one U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#x02013;approved therapy for delayed healing, i.e., electrical field stimulation (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). Under current therapeutic regimens, approximately 10% of fractures still proceed as delayed healing or nonunion (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>), which significantly lowers the quality of life and causes inability for patients to return to their job duties (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>). Because delayed fracture repair puts patients under the risk of nonunion, acceleration of normal fracture repair is necessary and is an unmet medical need. In this regard, we have demonstrated that COX-2 gene therapy is one of the most effective treatments for normal rodent bone fractures (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). For this reason, the goal of the present study was to determine the MSCs that COX-2 gene therapy acts to accelerate normal fracture repair. This information can be valuable to eventually avoid gene therapy and identify small molecules that can precisely target MSCs for the acceleration of normal fracture repair.</p><p>Using tibia and femur fractures, we have now shown that COX-2 gene therapy increases the abundance of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in fractured bones via MCP-1&#x02013;mediated recruitment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 and 2</xref>). In addition, our data have demonstrated that COX-2 gene therapy augments the osteoblast differentiation potential but suppresses the chondrocyte differentiation potential of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs in fractured bones (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3 and 4</xref>). Consistent with the above findings, our data have determined that COX-2 gene therapy promotes the differentiation of osteoblast progenitors (i.e., CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mSSCs) but suppresses the differentiation of chondrocyte progenitors (i.e., CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> mSSCs) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Our data from both tibia and femur fractures were consistent. Moreover, these current findings are in line with our previous observations that COX-2 gene therapy increases the number of OCN-expressing osteoblasts, as well as the mRNA expressions of <italic>ALP</italic> and <italic>osteopontin</italic> in fracture sites (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>), but reduces the callus size, the cartilage area, the expression of <italic>Sox9</italic> mRNA, and the expression of <italic>Col10</italic>&#x003b1;<italic>1</italic> mRNA in fracture sites (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). Collectively, findings from our studies so far support that COX-2 gene therapy augments intramembranous bone formation but suppresses endochondral bone formation in fracture sites.</p><p>Although our data have suggested that CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs are recruited from progenitor niches near fractured bones to selectively augment intramembranous bone formation, we noticed that most CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs in muscles and bone marrows did not express AlphaV that is a marker for mSSCs (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>). These data indicate that, during the migration from muscles and bone marrows into fractured bones, CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs undergo skeletal lineage commitment into mSSCs. Because most CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs isolated from intact bones also express AlphaV (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), our data suggest that signals in bones are sufficient to confer this skeletal lineage commitment of CD90<sup>+</sup> MSCs and that this skeletal lineage commitment is independent of local COX-2 overexpression. The signals that confer this skeletal lineage commitment are currently unclear.</p><p>On the basis of our findings, we have proposed a model for the COX-2 overexpression&#x02013;mediated acceleration of fracture repair in long bones (fig. S7). In this model, we propose that, under normal conditions, CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD200<sup>&#x02212;</sup>AlphaV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs undergo proliferation and CD90<sup>+</sup> conversion in progenitor niches near fractured bones. Subsequently, the CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>&#x02212;</sup>AlphaV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs are recruited into fractured bones by MCP-1. Inside the fractured bones, the CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>&#x02212;</sup>AlphaV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs undergo skeletal lineage commitment and become CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs. Subsequently, the CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs preferentially differentiate into CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup>AlphaV<sup>+</sup> chondrocyte progenitors with a small fraction of CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>&#x02212;</sup>AlphaV<sup>+</sup> osteoblast progenitors. Consequently, the fractured bones are healed predominantly via endochondral bone formation. Under the condition of COX-2 overexpression, local COX-2 overexpression significantly increases the concentrations of COX-2&#x02013;enzymatic products (i.e., prostanoids) such as PGE2. Consequently, the elevated levels of prostanoids in the progenitor niches near fractured bones significantly increase the proliferation of the CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD200<sup>&#x02212;</sup>AlphaV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs and promote the conversion of the CD90<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD200<sup>&#x02212;</sup>AlphaV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs into CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>&#x02212;</sup>AlphaV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs. In addition, the elevated levels of prostanoids also significantly increase in the fractured bones the expression of MCP-1, which enhances the migration of CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>&#x02212;</sup>AlphaV<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MSCs into the fractured bones. Inside the fractured bones, the elevated levels of prostanoids enhance the differentiation of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs into CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>&#x02212;</sup>AlphaV<sup>+</sup> osteoblast progenitors but suppress the differentiation of CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs into CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup>AlphaV<sup>+</sup> chondrocyte progenitors by augmenting WNT/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling. As a result, the bone healing is accelerated through enhanced intramembranous bone formation.</p><p>Although the current study only focused on the effects of COX-2 gene therapy on mSSCs in fractured bones, COX-2 actions are more pleotropic than those detailed in this study. A previous work (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>) indicates that COX-2 also increases bone resorption, which could accelerate fracture healing by increasing the final remodeling of newly deposited bones. In addition, COX-2 also increases angiogenesis, which is critical for the entire repertoire of COX-2&#x02013;stimulated events on bone formation and resorption (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>).</p><p>A limitation of this study is that we did not specifically determine whether the COX-2&#x02013;mediated switch from CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> mSSCs to CD90<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mSSCs is necessary for the COX-2 overexpression&#x02013;mediated acceleration of fracture repair. In future studies, transgenic mice in which CD200 expression is overexpressed in CD90<sup>+</sup> mSSCs and/or specifically tagged with fluorescence will be used to address this question.</p><p>The importance of the current study is underscored by recent findings that COX-2 is critical for the repair and regeneration of multiple tissues such as the muscles, lung, hematopoietic cells, intestines, and liver (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>).
