The intrinsic features of tumor microenvironment, such as pH, glutathione (GSH), growth factors, oxygen levels and presence of immune cells, have been increasingly considered as specific targets for drug delivery, cancer diagnosis therapeutics and prognosis <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>Tissue oxygenation is an important component of microenvironment and can acutely alter the behaviors of cells, such as cell survival, apoptosis, glucose metabolism, and angiogenesis <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In normal tissues, O<sub>2</sub> levels span from 150 mm Hg to 20-70 mm Hg, whereas markedly lower levels (&#x02264; 2.5 mm Hg) have been described in most types of locally advanced tumors <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. This is because the abnormal vessels within tumor tissues and rapid proliferation of tumor cells can cause an imbalance between O<sub>2</sub> supply and consumption. Various investigations have clearly demonstrated that hypoxia causes a challenge for cancer therapy <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. It not only contributes to tumor proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis, but also induces resistance to many types of tumor therapeutics <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, particularly for O<sub>2</sub> based photodynamic therapy (PDT) or SDT <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Up to now, several strategies have been proposed to overcome tumor hypoxia and then enhance tumor treatment efficiency, such as increasing O<sub>2</sub> supply using perfluorocarbon-loaded nanoparticles <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, promoting tumor oxygenation through chemical or biochemical reactions locally <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, enlarging intratumor blood flow <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, or hypoxia-medicated prodrugs activation <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. However, these methods cannot be applied to clinic because of their potential safety concerns, limited O<sub>2</sub>-carrying capacities and poorly O<sub>2</sub>-delivering efficiency in hypoxic tumor region. How to take advantage of the tumor's own characteristics to generate O<sub>2</sub> continuously in situ, maybe a new and effective strategy to solve hypoxia fundamentally.</p><p>High accumulation of macrophage (tumor associated macrophages, TAMs) in hypoxic regions of solid tumor is another important component of microenvironment <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Normally, macrophages present two subtypes, classically activated pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2). The polarization of these two macrophages is a highly dynamic process <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. They can be reversed with stimulation of different environmental or biological factors. Initially, TAMs present a M1-like phenotype in tumor inflammation areas, which exhibit anti-tumor activity by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-12, IL-23), reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, NO, superoxide) <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Thereafter, M1 macrophages are transformed into M2-like phenotype responding to secreted cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and stress signals in the tumor microenvironment. M2 macrophages secrete pro-tumor cytokines (such as IL-4, IL-10, IL-13) and alter gene expression (such as up-regulation hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7)), to promote tumor progression <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Studies demonstrate that there is a high density of M2 macrophages in tumor hypoxia region <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Therefore, synchronous remodeling macrophage phenotype (M2 to M1) and alleviating tumor hypoxic microenvironment may be a new and efficient strategy for tumor treatment <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>Cancer cells have been found to generate oxidative stress by inducing an elevated level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The utilization of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-catalysts to decompose endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>2</sub> has been recognized to be an attractive strategy to relieve tumor hypoxia and improve cancer therapeutic efficacy <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Prussian blue (PB) has been approved by USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a safe and clinical medicine for the treatment of radioactive exposure. Previous studies have proved that PB NPs also have excellent catalase activity <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Therefore, ensuring adequate supplement of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> substrate is the key to lessen tumor hypoxia. Hyaluronic acid (HA) polysaccharose with different molecular weights can promote differential inflammatory mediators and signals <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Rayahin et al. proved that HA has molecular weight-dependent effects on modulating macrophage phenotype. Macrophages exposed to LMWHA are encouraged to produce pro-inflammatory mediators associated with the classically activated state <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. In this study, we modified MPB NPs with LMWHA to remodel TAMs phenotype (pro-tumor M2&#x02192;anti-tumor M1), guaranteeing continuous supplement of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> substrate in the tumor hypoxic area. Combing with the specific catalysis of MPB NPs, there is steady O<sub>2</sub> generation within tumor to alleviate hypoxia. After loading sonosensitizer HMME, LMWHA-MPB/HMME can effectively inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of 4T1 tumor (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)</bold>.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment Section</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Low molecular weight sodium hyaluronate (LMWHA, purity &#x0003e; 98%, MW = 6276) was obtained from Bloomage Freda Biopharm Co.

Furthermore, the lung tissues in N.S, LMWHA-MPB and LMWHA-MPB/HMME+US groups were isolated and soaked in Bouin's solution for 24 h and dehydrated in absolute ethyl alcohol for the quantification of visible metastatic pulmonary nodules, to evaluate the pulmonary metastasis of 4T1 tumor.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>At the end of pharmacodynamic experiment, tumor tissues of each group were subjected and soaked in 10% formalin solution, embedded with paraffin for immunofluorescence staining. To evaluate tumor hypoxia, Hypoxyprobe&#x02122;-1 Plus Kits (FITC-Mab) hypoxia probe was used to detect the hypoxia area of the tumor tissues in each group. To determine the effect of LMWHA-MPB nanoparticles on the polarization of TAMs, rabbit polyclonal FITC-CD206 antibody (dilution 1:50) and rabbit polyclonal PE-CD86 antibody (dilution 1:50) were used to determine the distribution of M2 and M1 macrophages in tumor tissues, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> toxicity evaluation</title><p>The toxicity of the formulations is evaluated on health mice. Briefly, the health mice were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 3): (1) N.S., (2) MPB, (3) LMWHA-MPB, (4) HMME, (5) MPB/HMME, (6) LMWHA-MPB/HMME. All formulations were intravenously administrated every 2 days for 6 times with the same HMME dose (10 mg/kg) and nanocarriers (MPB or LMWHA-MPB) dose (10 mg/kg). At the 12th day, the toxicity of the formulations was evaluated by the serum biochemistry assay and histological examination.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All experimental data were shown as mean &#x000b1; SD, and differences between two groups were analyzed by SPSS software via one-way ANOVA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Synthesis and characterization of LMWHA-MPB</title><p>Firstly, PVP K30 was used as template to synthesize PB NPs. TEM image clearly exhibited the cubic structure and smooth surface of PB NPs (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A</bold>). The typical -C&#x02261;N stretching vibration peak at 2087.15 cm<sup>-1</sup> and -Fe-C&#x02261;N-Fe bending vibration peak at 500.93 cm<sup>-1</sup> in FTIR spectrum (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S1</xref></bold>), belonging to the structural composition of PB <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, were further confirmed the successful preparation of PB NPs. Then MPB NPs were prepared via a controlled acid self-etching reaction. TEM image demonstrated that MPB showed excellently internal porous structure (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B</bold>), allowing small drug molecules (such as HMME) to freely diffuse into the porous interior of MPB. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed the average diameter of MPB NPs was ~91 nm with uniform particle size distribution (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C and Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S2</xref></bold>). The zeta potential of MPB NPs was -10.1 mV (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S3</xref></bold>).<bold> Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S4</xref></bold> showed the size and PDI changes of MPB NPs in PBS and cell medium, suggesting that MPB NPs could be stable for one week in physiological solutions.</p><p>It's reported that HA is an immuno stimulant and has immunotoxicological effect on macrophages. Particularly, LMWHA can activate the polarization of M2-type macrophages to M1-type macrophages. Herein, LMWHA was utilized to modify the surface of MPB NPs, which can also improve the biocompatibility and stability of MPB. The synthesis procedure of LMWHA-MPB was illustrated in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>,</bold> and <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D</bold> showed the FTIR spectrum of LMWHA-MPB. The typical C=O stretching vibration band at 1728.97 cm<sup>-1</sup>, N-H bending modes at 1645.77 cm<sup>-1</sup> and C-N stretching vibration band at 1384.03 cm<sup>-1</sup>, all suggested that the amide bond between LMWHA and MPB (with PEI-amino groups) was synthesized successfully. After LMWHA grafting, the particle size and zeta potential of LMWHA-MPB NPs were changed to ~127 nm (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F</bold>) and -19.2 mV (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>G</bold>). Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S5</xref> demonstrated the monodispersity of LMWHA-MPB NPs in aqueous phase. The size stability of LMWHA-MPB NPs in PBS and cell medium had been tested. The size and PDI changes shown in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S6</xref> suggested that LMWHA-MPB NPs could be stable for one week in physiological solutions. The mesoporous structure made MPB an ideal carrier to encapsulate anticancer drugs, such as HMME. <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S7</xref></bold> showed the characteristics of HMME-loaded LMWHA-MPB. The drug loading efficiency improved from 22.9% to 63.4% along with increased HMME feeding amount, while entrapment efficiency exhibited firstly increased and then decreased trend. Finally, a feed ratio of 1:2 (LMWHA-MPB:HMME) was chosen for further studies with excellent drug loading efficiency (57.6%) and high entrapment efficiency (67.9%). The final zeta potential of LMWHA-MPB/HMME was -35.2 mV.</p></sec><sec><title>The remodeling regulation effect of LMWHA-MPB on macrophage phenotype</title><p>In order to explore the macrophages remodeling effect of LMWHA-MPB <italic>in vitro</italic>, firstly we induced RAW264.7 cells into M2 phenotype using IL-4. After incubation with IL-4 for 24 h at 40 ng/mL, FITC labeled CD206, a typical marker for M2 phenotype, was used to identify M2 macrophages (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A</bold>). Flow cytometry quantitative analysis showed ~83.1% macrophages were successfully induced to M2 phenotype. Subsequently, we found LMWHA modified MPB NPs were more easily internalized by M2 macrophages (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B</bold>). After incubation M2 macrophages with FITC-labeled MPB and LMWHA-MPB for 2 h, the fluorescent intensities within cells were 64.8% and 100.0%, respectively (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S8</xref></bold>). This significant difference suggested a specific and rapid internalization of LMWHA-MPB by M2 macrophages. This may be due to the highly expressed HA receptors on the membrane of M2 macrophages <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. It is known that HA has immunotoxicological effect, which can activate macrophages. Richard et al. have proved that LMWHA can induce a classically activated-like state (M1) or remodel TAMs phenotype from M2 to M1 by up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes, including NOS 2, TNF, IL12b, and CD80, and enhancing secretion of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-&#x003b1; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. So, would LMWHA-MPB NPs have immunological effect on macrophage polarization after entering M2 macrophages? Next, we made further exploration. After treating M2 phenotype with LMWHA-MPB NPs for different hours, PE labeled CD86 was used to identify M1 macrophages. As <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C</bold> shown, CD86 expression was significantly increased after incubation with LMWHA-MPB for 3 h, indicating that LMWHA-MPB could change the polarization from M2 to M1 phenotype. Moreover, the remodeling regulation effect of LMWHA-MPB on macrophage phenotype was further confirmed according to determining those correlated cytokines. As seen in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D</bold> and<bold> 3E</bold>, after incubation with LMWHA-MPB for 3 h, the concentration of IL-10, a typical cytokine secreted by M2 macrophages, decreased obviously. While the secretion level of IL-12, the typical cytokine of M1 macrophages, increased significantly. All above results suggested the successful polarization of M2 to M1 phenotype by LMWHA-MPB NPs.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> cell migration and invasion assay</title><p>As we known, M1 and M2 polarized macrophages differ in many aspects of tumor progression. M2 macrophages are tumor-promoting phenotype which account for tumor proliferation and metastasis, while M1 macrophages are tumor-killing phenotype that inhibit tumor proliferation by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23), reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, superoxide) <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Therefore, we further studied the inhibitory effect of LMWHA-MPB NPs on proliferation and migration of 4T1 cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>First of all, the wound healing assay was constructed to study the inhibitory effect on cell motility. As illustrated in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>, after incubation for 18 h, the migration rates of 4T1 cells in normal serum-free medium, M2 conditioned medium, MPB pre-treated M2 conditioned medium and LMWHA-MPB pre-treated M2 conditioned medium were 32.3 &#x000b1; 3.54%, 53.9 &#x000b1; 6.99%, 50.6 &#x000b1; 4.71% and 13.1 &#x000b1; 1.72%, respectively. This result indicated after reversing TAMs phenotype by LMWHA-MPB NPs, the migration behavior of highly metastatic 4T1 tumor cells can be effectively inhibited. Then, transwell assay was conducted to further study the effect of LMWHA-MPB on invasion and metastasis ability of 4T1 cells. The results were presented in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>. Cells incubating with normal medium, M2 conditioned medium and MPB pre-treated M2 conditioned medium passed through the upper compartment transwell and covered almost the entire lower surface of the membrane. The invasion rates in M2 conditioned medium and MPB pre-treated M2 conditioned medium groups were 1.81 &#x000b1; 0.14 and 1.66 &#x000b1; 0.16, indicating M2 macrophages could obviously promote the migratory and invasive ability of 4T1 cells. On the contrary, after co-culture with LMWHA-MPB pre-treated M2 conditioned medium, the invasion and metastasis ability of 4T1 cells sharply decreased from 1.81 &#x000b1; 0.14 to 0.25 &#x000b1; 0.03. Moreover, the main correlated cytokines had also been determined. As <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S9</xref></bold> shown, after incubation with LMWHA-MPB pre-treated M2 conditioned medium for 24 h, the expression of tumor metastasis-associated markers in 4T1 cells, such as MMP-9 and VEGF, were significantly reduced in comparison with the control and M2 groups. All above data suggested that LMWHA-MPB NPs treated M2 macrophages exhibited great potential in anti-metastatic effects on 4T1 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytotoxicity study with LMWHA-MPB/HMME <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p><italic>In vitro</italic> cytotoxicity of LMWHA-MPB/HMME was determined using SRB method. <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E</bold> demonstrated MPB NPs (50 &#x003bc;g/mL) had a little toxicity (~83% survival rate) on 4T1 cells, and ultrasound irradiation alone showed no obvious cytotoxicity (~94% survival rate). However, LMWHA-MPB pre-treated conditioned medium displayed obvious tumor killing effect with cell viability of 65.8 &#x000b1; 2.1%. After HMME loading, the viability sharply reduced to 22.1 &#x000b1; 2.8%. Then calcein AM/PI staining was conducted to visualize the sonodynamic cytotoxicity. As <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>F</bold> shown, compared with MPB NPs, the number of dead cells (red) in LMWHA-MPB group increased significantly. While in LMWHA-MPB/HMME group, almost all tumor cells were killed combining with ultrasound irradiation. These results were in agreement with cell viability assay as mentioned above. This indicated LMWHA-MPB with the ability of macrophage phenotypic transformation could significantly enhance the SDT effect of HMME.</p></sec><sec><title>NIR imaging to explore the targeting ability of LMWHA-MPB NPs</title><p>A sufficient distribution amount in targeted tumor is a prerequisite for LMWHA-MPB NPs to achieve its biological effects. The noninvasive NIR optical imaging technique was applied to estimate the biodistribution of LMWHA-MPB. IR783, a NIR dye, was encapsulated into LMWHA-MPB (LMWHA-MPB/IR783) for NPs tracking <italic>in vivo</italic>. The real-time images were recorded in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A</bold>. Free IR783 was lack of tumor targeting ability and mainly accumulated in liver. Furthermore, its fluorescence weakened gradually with time, suggesting free IR783 could be cleared easily <italic>in vivo</italic>. On the contrary, LMWHA-MPB/IR783 NPs accumulated rapidly in tumor region at 2 h post injection, and the fluorescence signal was still strong up to 24 h, indicating the notable tumor targeting and accumulation abilities of LMWHA-MPB. At 24 h, mice were sacrificed. The major organs and tumor tissues were harvested for ex vivo imaging. As <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B</bold> and <bold>5C</bold> shown, LMWHA-MPB/IR783 demonstrated significantly enhanced fluorescence signals in tumor site and reticuloendothelial system (RES), such as liver, spleen and lung tissues. Moreover, there was also obvious fluorescence of IR783 in kidneys. This is because a part of IR783 that loaded into LMWHA-MPB will leak out as free dye molecules during <italic>in vivo</italic> circulation, and then they are cleared through kidneys. The notable tumor targeting ability could be elucidated by MPB-mediated EPR effect based on its nanoscale size as well as CD44 receptor-mediated active targeting endocytosis.</p></sec><sec><title>US imaging based on O<sub>2</sub> production</title><p>This study intended to explore the SDT enhancement effect of LMWHA-MPB through increasing tumor local O<sub>2</sub> level. As we known, solid tumor has a hypoxic microenvironment, which seriously affects SDT efficacy. Enhancing tumor oxygen partial pressure is a key method to improve SDT efficiency. As reported by many studies, cancer cells have been found to generate oxidative stress by producing an elevated level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Moreover, as presented in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S10</xref></bold>, MPB NPs owned good catalase activity. LMWHA modification did not affect this characteristic. In order to visually monitor O<sub>2</sub> generation in tumor sites, the Vevo2100 small animal US imaging system was used to obtain US signal images <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D</bold> proved O<sub>2</sub> production in the catalytic reaction of MPB NPs and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could be clearly recorded using US images. <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E</bold> showed at 2 h post injection, notable US signals appeared in MPB and LMWHA-MPB groups, suggesting there was plenty of O<sub>2</sub> in tumor tissues. Furthermore, it was noteworthy that the signal intensity in LMWHA-MPB treated tumor was much stronger than that of MPB treated tumor. This may be due to the macrophage phenotypic remodeling characteristics of LMWHA-MPB NPs. We had proved that LMWHA-MPB could remodel M2 to M1 phenotype. M1-like phenotype can secrete pro-inflammatory oxygen species, such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, to ensure sufficient endogenous substrate (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) supplement. To confirm this hypothesis, we further tested the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in three different macrophages. Results in<bold> Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S11</xref></bold> proved that after being induced by LMWHA-MPB NPs, the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in M1-like phenotypes increased significantly. All these data suggested LMWHA-MPB NPs not only had excellent tumor targeting capability to deliver drug, but also owned O<sub>2</sub> self-provided characteristic at tumor sites.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> antitumor studies</title><p>The promising properties of tumor targeting and O<sub>2</sub> self-producing displayed by LMWHA-MPB NPs <italic>in vivo</italic> led us to explore the enhanced tumor SDT effect. HMME was chose as the model drug. During 10 days of treatment, changes of relative tumor volume (V/V<sub>0</sub>) for each group were summarized in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A</bold>. The visual image of tumor tissues after the mice were sacrificed can be seen in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S12</xref></bold>. LMWHA-MPB demonstrated a modesty tumor inhibition. This was mainly because LMWHA-MPB could remodel TAMs phenotypes (pro-tumor M2&#x02192;anti-tumor M1). M1 macrophages are conducive to inhibit tumor proliferation by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23), reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, superoxide) <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Free HMME and LMWHA-MPB groups showed similar tumor growth trends. Nevertheless, LMWHA-MPB/HMME displayed the best therapeutic efficacy with a reduced relative tumor volume of 0.31 &#x000b1; 0.19 at day 11, which was much lower than free HMME or LMWHA-MPB group alone. ROS is the main active substance that achieves tumor SDT. Therefore, we measured in site ROS amount after administration. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S13</xref></bold>, comparing with the extremely low ROS level in HMME group, LMWHA-MPB/HMME could significantly increase therapeutically active ROS amount in tumor site. This result suggested that LMWHA-MPB/HMME could achieve O<sub>2</sub> self-supplied SDT and enhanced anti-tumor effect of HMME significantly <italic>in vivo</italic>. What's more, mice treated with LMWHA-MPB/HMME exhibited no weight loss (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B</bold>). The histological changes of tumor tissues were tested by H&#x00026;E staining<bold> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C</bold>). It could be observed a compact cell arrangement in N.S. group, whereas cell shrinkage and expanding intercellular space emerged in HMME, LMWHA-MPB and MPB/HMME groups. Furthermore, LMWHA-MPB/HMME group displayed apparent cell lysis and necrosis as well as wide tumor cell disappearance areas, implying a remarkable antitumor activity.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> results demonstrated the remarkable anti-tumor migration and metastatic abilities of LMWHA-MPB NPs on 4T1 cells. So at the endpoint of pharmacodynamic experiment, the lung tissues in N.S, LMWHA-MPB and LMWHA-MPB/HMME+US groups were isolated to evaluate the pulmonary metastasis of 4T1 tumor. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>D</bold> and <bold>E</bold>, the pulmonary nodules in LMWHA-MPB group (58.4 &#x000b1; 3.6) were significantly less than those of N.S. group (135.8 &#x000b1; 4.8). There were only 12.2 &#x000b1; 2.4 pulmonary nodules in LMWHA-MPB/HMME group. Furthermore, H&#x00026;E staining results of lung tissues were showed in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>F</bold>. The metastasis of 4T1 tumors in lung were indicated by red box. In N.S. group, many tumor metastases were visible. Compared with normal lung tissue, metastatic tumor cells were closely arranged, with large and deep nuclear staining, as well as alveolar reduction. In LMWHA-MPB group, tumor metastases on the slice decreased significantly. In LMWHA-MPB/HMME group, there were almost no obvious metastases. All above results indicated that LMWHA-MPB/HMME could effectively inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of 4T1 tumor <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Furthermore, the polarization of TAMs, MMP-9, Ki67 and local hypoxia that associated with tumor proliferation and metastasis were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. As shown in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>, in comparison with N.S. and N.S.+US groups, the percentages of M2 macrophages in LMWHA-MPB and LMWHA-MPB/HMME groups significantly decreased, while that of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages increased. This trend was similar with <italic>in vitro</italic> results, implying that LMWHA-MPB NPs could successfully skew TAMs away from the M2 phenotype to the tumoricidal M1 phenotype. MMP-9 is a matrix metalloproteinase produced by macrophages, in response to stimulation by tumor derived factors. Studies have shown that tumor cells at primary sites induce the expression of MMP-9 and Ki67 in macrophages, which promote tumor cell establishment and proliferation in the metastatic cascade <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. As <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A</bold> and <bold>C</bold> shown, comparing with N.S. group, the expression of MMP-9 and Ki67 in LMWHA-MPB and LMWHA-MPB/HMME groups decreased, indicating the reduced metastasis ability of tumor. Moreover, angiogenesis is also closely related to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. Shima et al. have proved that matrix metalloproteinase, such as MMP-9, is directly related to angiogenesis and metastasis <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. So next, we studied the expression of CD31 (vascular endothelial cell marker) in tumor tissues. As <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S14</xref></bold> shown, the expression of CD31 in LMWHA-MPB group was down-regulated significantly, and among all groups, LMWHA-MPB/HMME+US group exhibited the lowest CD31 expression.</p><p>As we all know, hypoxia is a major feature of tumor microenvironment that limits SDT efficacy severely. In this study, we designed an O<sub>2</sub> self-supplied SDT system to alleviate tumor hypoxia and inhibit tumor progression. As shown in<bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A</bold> and <bold>D</bold>, after treated with LMWHA-MPB and LMWHA-MPB/HMME for 10 days, local tumor hypoxia situation had improved. This was because the remodeling effect of LMWHA-MPB on TAMs phenotypes (pro-tumor M2&#x02192;anti-tumor M1) could produce high level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which react with LMWHA-MPB to produce large amount of O<sub>2</sub>, to efficiently manipulate the tumor microenvironment. After SDT, the degree of hypoxia in the tumor site was slightly elevated in LMWHA-MPB/HMME+US group. This is because consumption of O<sub>2</sub> during SDT can reduce the local O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>.</p><p>Finally, the potential toxicity of LMWHA-MPB <italic>in vivo</italic> was evaluated by the serum biochemistry assay and histological examination on health mice. As shown in<bold> Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S15</xref></bold> and <bold>S16</bold>, after administration at the therapy dose, all the parameters were normal, and no notable lesion or inflammation appeared in the major organs. Hence, LMWHA-MPB could be a kind of safe nanocarriers for cancer therapy or drug delivery.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, LMWHA-MPB NPs were successfully synthesized as an in site macrophages converter and O<sub>2</sub> generator, to achieve the transformation of tumor microenvironment. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results demonstrated LMWHA-MPB NPs could remodel the polarization of M2 phenotype toward to M1 phenotype and improve O<sub>2</sub> level in tumor via catalytic decomposition of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
