Earlier studies and our external microarray data analysis indicated that mammary matrix from involuting tissue showed upregulation of genes involved in ECM remodeling. The present study examines the fate of mammary and oral cancer cells grown in the ECM from lactating mammary gland. Our findings show that non-tumorigenic cells, MCF10A and DOK cells did not proliferate but the tumorigenic and metastatic cells, SCC25 and MDA-MB-231, underwent apoptosis when grown on mammary ECM isolated from lactating mice. In addition, the cytokinesis marker, CEP55, was repressed in the oral and breast cancer cells. In contrast, these cells proliferated normally on mammary ECM isolated from mice undergoing involution. External microarray data analysis of mammary tissue further revealed over expression (~16 fold) of QSOX1 gene, which promotes cellular quiescence, in lactating mammary gland. A recent study has indicated that QSOX1 overexpression in breast cancer cells led to reduced proliferation and tumorigenic properties. This extracellular protein in mammary ECM may be responsible for reduced cellular proliferation. The present study has shown that ECM from lactating mammary gland can regulate signals to oral and breast cancer cells to halt cell division. This preliminary observation provided insights into the potential role of ECM factors present in lactating mammary gland as therapeutic targets to control cancer cell division. This preliminary study is an attempt to understand not only the requirement of ECM remodeling factors essential for the growth and survival of cancer cells but also the factors present in the lactation matrix that simultaneously halts cell division and selectively inhibits the growth of cancer cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>lactation</kwd><kwd>involution</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tumour microenvironment plays an important role in the regulation of cancer cell behavior (Bhowmick et al., 2004; Bissell and Labarge, 2005). Recent research has also revealed that non-cellular components of the microenvironment, the extracellular matrix (ECM), also play an important role in tumour progression (Erler et al., 2009; Levental et al., 2009). ECM promotes integrity, proliferation and maintenance of tissue morphology and also influences the fundamental characteristics of the cell (Hynes, 2009; Lu et al., 2011). Several mechanisms regulate the dynamics of ECM including synthesis, degradation and remodelling required during developmental processes (Page-McCaw et al., 2007) and deregulation of these mechanisms can lead to disorganized ECM with cellular abnormalities resulting in fibrotic and cancer conditions (Cox and Erler, 2011). ECM is also responsible for maintaining the polarity and architecture of epithelial tissues including mammary gland and the loss of polarity due to aberrant ECM dynamics is often associated with the cancer progression (Ghajar and Bissell, 2008; Akhtar et al., 2009).</p><p>ECM not only provides strong support to the mammary gland architecture but also acts as a communicating link between the extracellular environment and the epithelial cells (Akhtar et al., 2009). The ECM protein profile is different in various stages of mammary gland development including pregnancy, lactation and involution (Warburton et al., 1982; Schedin et al., 2004). During involution, the majority of the epithelial cells undergo apoptosis followed by ECM remodelling and an irreversible change in the mammary gland to a pre-pregnant stage (Watson, 2006). This ECM remodelling process is due to significant expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (Green and Lund, 2005) and the expression profile of MMPs during involution was found to be similar to that of developing mammary gland tumours (Almholt et al., 2007). The activation of inflammatory responsive elements during involution is highly similar to that of the tumour microenvironment and in the wound healing process (van Kempen et al., 2003; Schedin et al., 2007).</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that mammary gland proliferation is low during lactation and mammary epithelial cells undergo a quiescence stage (Knight and Peaker, 1982; Capuco et al., 2003). A recent study from our lab has indicated that ECM isolated from different phases of lactation provides regulatory signals in-vitro to mammary epithelial cells (MECs) so they behave in a similar way to that observed at the phase of lactation from which the ECM was isolated (Wanyonyi et al., 2013). From the studies stated above, there is clear evidence that lactating glands show less proliferation and as the ECM can govern tumour progression, it would be interesting to observe if factors in lactating ECM inhibits metastatic and tumourigenic potential on breast and oral cancer cells, irrespective of their tumourigenic potential. Hence, the present preliminary study addressed whether extracellular matrix isolated from mammary gland during lactation included factors for inhibiting cell division of breast and oral cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>BALB/c mice were used and were obtained from Monash Animal Services, Melbourne, Australia.

Principal component analysis through Gene spring analysis showed a clear distinction between the two sample types (lactation and involution) considered for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Further analysis using Gene Spring software revealed significant differentially regulated genes (1,000) with significant P-Value less than 0.01 and fold change greater than 2 (Supplementary file 2 (SSD 2)). In addition, the gene profile was analysed for the expression of genes involved in ECM remodelling and genes promoting cellular quiescence using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID 6.7) program (Dennis et al., 2003), details of which are incorporated in the supplementary file 3 (SSD 3). The data analysis that was performed includes whole tissue of late lactating and late involuting mammary gland and hence the present study focuses on the secretory proteins that might have been secreted in the ECM. Most of the genes related to ECM remodelling were up regulated in involuting mammary gland (Table 2 in SSD 1). Further analysis of the genes indicated important inflammatory response-promoting genes that were up regulated in involuting mammary gland compared to the lactating mammary gland (Table 3 in SSD 1). Analysis of the genes among the significant differentially regulated genes promoting cellular quiescence revealed over expression of the QSOX1 gene. This gene is related to cells undergoing cellular quiescence (Coppock et al., 2000) and was up regulated in lactating mammary gland (Table 4 in SSD 1). The gene for beta actin (ACTB) expression was found to be down regulated and epidermal growth factor (EGF) was up regulated in lactating mammary gland in comparison to the involuting mammary gland (Table 4 in SSD 1).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Principal Component Analysis of Involution and Lactation Microarray Datasets.

Changes in ECM composition lead to modification of ECM dynamics thereby resulting in the altered tissue architecture (Lopez et al., 2008; Engler et al., 2009). Mammary gland is emerging as a powerful model to investigate the mechanoinduction of the signals induced by ECM that can lead to the changes in cellular behavior further affecting the tissue. Previous studies indicated that cell proliferation in the mammary gland is low during lactation and most of the mammary epithelial cells are quiescent (Knight and Peaker, 1982; Capuco et al., 2003). An earlier study indicated that mammary epithelial cells (MECs) grown on the mammary ECM of a specific phase of lactation behave and respond like cells belonging to the phase of ECM irrespective of the phase of lactation from which the MECs were isolated (Wanyonyi et al., 2013). This is consistent with the conclusion that ECM plays a major role in promoting cellular quiescence during lactation. This preliminary study has explored the effects of lactation matrix on the growth of non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic oral and breast cancer cells.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Lactation matrix promotes cellular quiescence in all cell types and induces apoptosis in tumour cells</title><p>In the current study, tumorigenic cells (SCC25 and MDA-MB-231) and non-tumorigenic cells (MCF10A and DOK) demonstrated considerable proliferation when cultured on involution matrix, most likely due to the cells being able to penetrate the matrix and reach the plastic underneath. In contrast, there was no growth observed when the cells were cultured on lactation matrix which did not allow the cells to penetrate, consistent with previous findings that lactation matrix promotes cellular quiescence (Capuco et al., 2003). It was observed that some of the tumorigenic cells showed cell death when cultured on lactation matrix. The presence of factors in the mammary ECM during lactation may promote cell death only in tumorigenic cells and/or lack of the factors essential for the tumorigenic cell survival may induce apoptosis in these cells (Elmore, 2007). Actin staining revealed cells cultured on lactation matrix showed a rounded shape and were unable to penetrate the matrix and attach to the plastic surface whereas the cells cultured on the involution matrix were able to penetrate and attach to the plastic. In addition, enriched SCC25 tumour spheres did not attach to the plastic when cultured on lactation matrix but did attach to plastic following culture on involution matrix. Analysis of microarray data revealed over expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) gene in lactating mammary gland compared to involuting mammary gland. An earlier study revealed EGF induced detachment of cells from the extracellular matrix (ECM) and induced dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) reducing the cell attachment and motility (Lu et al., 2001). The mammary matrix from lactating gland has retained EGF that has been sequestered to ECM to reduce the cell attachment. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) inhibit the activity of MMPs (Bourboulia and Stetler-Stevenson, 2010) and the current microarray analysis did not show any significant over expression of TIMPs in lactating mammary gland suggesting that there might be other factors in the mammary ECM that block the cells to penetrate and attach to the plastic surface.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Reduction of cytokinesis marker expression, CEP55, in tumour cells grown on lactation matrix</title><p>Centrosomal protein 55kDa, CEP55, is a cell division marker (van der Horst et al., 2009) and is often overexpressed in several types of cancers including oral and breast cancers (Inoda et al., 2009; Waseem et al., 2010). When grown on involution matrix, SCC25 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressed CEP55 protein but on lactation matrix only few cells expressed CEP55 which is consistent with the fact that cancer cells require survival signals for their proliferation (Elmore, 2007). Earlier study showed that breast cancer cells mixed with mammary involuting ECM further increases tumorigenicity (McDaniel et al., 2006) and it would also be interesting to perform these tumorigenic experiments by mixing the tumour cells with mammary ECM from lactating tissue. This will clearly suggest whether the mammary ECM during lactation has any capacity to inhibit the growth of the cancer cells in- vivo.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Genes promoting ECM remodeling and inflammatory genes in involution</title><p>In the current microarray data analysis, over expression of genes related to chemokines and several inflammatory response mediators and over expression of genes related to ECM remodeling (matrix metalloproteinases), cysteine proteinases, ECM components, cell surface receptors were observed in involuting mammary gland. The present analysis correlates with previous studies indicating involution matrix undergoes ECM remodeling and induces an inflammatory response which is similar to the cancer microenvironment (van Kempen et al., 2003; Green and Lund, 2005; Almholt et al., 2007; Schedin et al., 2007). Lactation matrix did not allow the cells to penetrate and it has further promoted cell death in the tumorigenic cells. However, an important question remaining to be addressed is what limits the cells from penetrating the matrix. In contrast, involution matrix might lack these factors and hence the cells can penetrate and attach to the plastic surface. A comparison of these 2 matrices will potentially provide this information.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Cell quiescence promoting gene, QSOX1, may play a prominent role in controlling the cell proliferation</title><p>Cellular quiescence is one of the prominent features of the mammary epithelial cells during lactation (Capuco et al., 2003). Earlier studies indicated that laminin-1 promoted cellular quiescence (Spencer et al., 2011) but it was also observed in other studies that there was no change in the expression of the laminin during several stages of mammary gland development (Woodward et al., 2001; Schedin et al., 2004). Differential expression of the laminin-1 gene was not observed in lactating mammary gland in comparison to the involuting mammary gland which is consistent with the earlier studies (Woodward et al., 2001; Schedin et al., 2004). Further the current microarray analysis showed beta actin (ACTB) levels in lactation mammary gland were reduced in comparison with the involution mammary gland. An earlier study indicated that during cellular quiescence, promoted by laminin 1 molecule, depletion of nuclear beta actin levels were also observed (Spencer et al., 2011). Studies have shown nuclear actin is essential for transcriptional activity and chromatin arrangement during cell division (Lenart et al., 2005). Microarray data analysis also revealed significant up regulation of QSOX1 gene in lactation mammary gland (in comparison to involution mammary gland). QSOX1, an extracellular protein, plays an important role in the promotion of cellular quiescence and was inversely correlated with the aggressiveness of the breast tumours (Pernodet et al., 2012). Recent studies suggested that QSOX1 is essential for the incorporation of laminin into the extracellular matrix and blocking QSOX1 leads to reduced cellular adhesion and migration (Ilani et al., 2013). From these observations it is clear that over expression of QSOX1 might play a role in recruiting laminin into the ECM of lactating mammary gland for promoting cellular quiescence. To our knowledge, the complete profile of ECM composition at different stages of mammary gland development (pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, lactation and involution) has not been determined. However, in the current study the question remains as to why the cells were unable to divide on matrix from lactating mammary gland. The plausible explanation might be attributed to the local factors in the mammary gland (Sinowatz et al., 2000). Further studies to identify the ECM proteins might be beneficial to better understand role of these proteins and their function.</p><p>Collectively, the current study has provided basic insights into the importance of lactation matrix to reduce proliferation of oral and breast cancer cells. However, a comprehensive identification of the ECM components and their potential signaling mechanisms may provide strategies for developing novel therapeutic interventions for cancer treatment. Unravelling the factors in the lactating mammary matrix that induces cell death only in the tumorigenic cells might provide new strategies in tissue engineering for cancer patients that have undergone surgical tissue excision.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>No conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
