Testosterone has a major function in the process of spermatogenesis and the formation of male secondary sexual characteristics, but many other functions are equally important, such as helping increase bone and muscle mass, inhibiting ageing, preventing cardiac arrhythmias, increasing fat metabolism, and preventing atherosclerosis. Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells, which are cells located in the interstitial testes, between seminiferous tubules. However, recently there has been an increase in the prevalence of hypogonadism in the elderly population, which occurs in as much as 20% in men aged 60&#x02013;70&#x02009;years and 50% at the age of more than 80&#x02009;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that one in four couples in developing countries experience infertility and sexual dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Several studies show that male reproductive health problems are the most common cause of couples with infertility cases. In Indonesia, there are 12% or about 3 million infertile couples. It is known that 30% of all cases of infertile couples are caused by men and tend to increase with older couples to 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Infertility in men can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, tumors, hormonal imbalances, smoking and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The most common cause is oxidative stress caused by an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the testes and a decrease in antioxidant agents that disrupt the process of spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Oxidative stress can significantly interfere with sperm function, which is an early sign of infertility in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">One of the compounds that can cause the formation of ROS is Advanced Glycation End products (AGE). AGE is a toxic compound derived from proteins or lipids that undergo the process of glycation after binding to sugars. AGE can trigger damage to blood vessel walls, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis through inflammatory mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Mangosteen, which has the Latin name <italic>Garcinia mangostana</italic>, has long been used as a medicine to treat skin infections, wounds and diarrhea in Southeast Asia because it contains anti-inflammatory compounds. In one study, it was found that the mangosteen pericarp contained gamma-mangostin, a derivative of xanthones which can reduce the inflammatory reaction by reducing the expenditure of prostaglandin E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The use of mangosteen pericarp extract containing gamma-mangostin is already familiar in Indonesia because it is known to have many health benefits. Beginning with increasing cases of infertility caused by a decrease in testosterone hormone, the authors are interested in examining testosterone levels in Leydig cell cultures of Sprague-Dawley rats induced by AGE 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL and given gamma-mangostin 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Samples</title><p id="Par21">This study was conducted from April 2014&#x02013;May 2015 at Cell culture laboratory, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

The rats were fasted for about 10&#x02009;h before removing the testicles. Then, the rats were anaesthetized using ketamine HCl 0.3&#x02009;mL/100grBW intramuscularly. After being unconscious, the four limbs of the rat were fixed using a rope on the operating table. Hairs in the abdomen and testicles were moistened using wet cotton and then shaved until the skin appears as limited as the area to be opened. The area to be opened was sterilized with an alcohol swab and then incised about 2&#x02009;cm along the midline of the abdomen with a scalpel. A peritoneal incision of 1.5&#x02013;2&#x02009;cm long was made. Using a pair of curved tweezers and small scissors, a skin incision was made midline along the lower abdomen about 0.5&#x02009;in. anterior to the genitals, and about 1.0&#x02009;cm long. The skin was opened towards the right and left to remove each of the testicles from just one incision. Two vas deferens were then identified on the side of the testis. The left vas deferens was gently grasped with the forceps and then partially lifted so that the incision was clearly visible (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Wang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] mentioned in his study that gamma-mangostin with a level of 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL could induce apoptosis and inhibit the G1 phase cell cycle in melanoma cells that were given behavior for 48&#x02009;h. In another study, it was found that gamma-mangostin had an antiproliferative effect on human colon cancer cells DLD-1 at a level of 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M and incubated for 72&#x02009;h through the S phase inhibition mechanism in the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">In normal metabolism, Leydig cells produce ROS through an electron transport chain mechanism, and when steroid hydroxylation occurs by the cytochrome P450scc enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Jen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] stated that ROS and activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway could induce apoptotic initiator caspase-9, then caspase-9 would activate its effector, caspase-3. Kim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] mentioned in his study that caspase-3 activation in Leydig cells led to Leydig cell apoptosis. Caspase-3 may play a role in the activation of core proteins that accelerate the final process of apoptosis, namely DNA fragmentation, which causes a gradual decrease in steroidogenesis activity by Leydig cells, as evidenced by the coloring of 3&#x003b2;-HSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">The experiments conducted by Shakui et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], in prostate cancer cells given hydroxanthone compounds extracted from the roots of the <italic>Garcinia subelliptica</italic> plant found an antiandrogenic effect on these cells. The chemical structure of the benzopyrene ring found in most xanthone compounds is capable of mediating the inhibitory process of the Sp-1 transcription factor found in the androgen receptor promoter (AR) and modifying posttranscriptional AR protein&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Another possibility that can cause no increase in testosterone levels in Leydig cell cultures is the low or lack of gamma-mangostin levels given. Nakatani [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] stated in his study that gamma-mangostin effectively inhibited the inflammatory process of C6 mouse glioma cells at a level of 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. In this study, the gamma-mangostin levels used were 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M.</p><p id="Par46">However, the small sample size in this study and only a single concentration of gamma-mangostin was given to the cell cultures are our main study limitations. Further study is necessary to investigate whether different concentrations of gamma-mangostin would decrease the toxic effect of AGE and increase testosterone levels. Finally, none of our findings showed that administration of gamma-mangostin could increase testosterone levels in Leydig cells culture of Sprague-Dawley rat induced by AGE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">In conclusion, testosterone levels in Leydig cell cultures induced by AGE were lower than the control group. Giving gamma-mangostin 5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M does not increase testosterone levels in Leydig cell cultures induced by AGE 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL. Furthermore, this is the first study to examine the effect of gamma-mangostin administration on testosterone level of AGE-induced Leydig cell cultures. Further study with larger samples and different gamma-mangostin concentrations is important to confirm and clarify our findings.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AGE</term><def><p id="Par5">Advanced glycation end products</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AR</term><def><p id="Par6">Androgen receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSA</term><def><p id="Par7">Bovine serum albumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMSO</term><def><p id="Par8">Dimethyl-sulfoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELISA</term><def><p id="Par9">Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LH</term><def><p id="Par10">Luteinizing hormone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBS</term><def><p id="Par11">Phosphate buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCB</term><def><p id="Par12">Polychlorinated biphenyl</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROS</term><def><p id="Par13">Reactive oxygen species</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par14">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par15">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are thankful to all those who offered excellent technical help during the study.
