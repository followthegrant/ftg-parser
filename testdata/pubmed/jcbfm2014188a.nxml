Here we investigated whether pretreatment with low doses of memantine, within the range currently used and well tolerated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, produce a protective effect in stroke. A coculture preparation exposed to modeled ischemia showed cell death associated with rapid glutamate rises and cytotoxic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx. Cell death was significantly enhanced in the presence of high memantine concentrations. However, low memantine concentrations significantly protected neurons and glia via excitotoxic cascade interruption. Mice were systemically administered a range of memantine doses (0.02, 0.2, 2, 10, and 20&#x02009;mg/kg/day) starting 24&#x02009;hours before 60&#x02009;minutes reversible focal cerebral ischemia and continuing for a 48-hour recovery period. Low dose (0.2&#x02009;mg/kg/day) memantine treatment significantly reduced lesion volume (by 30&#x00025; to 50&#x00025;) and improved behavioral outcomes in stroke lesions that had been separated into either small/striatal or large/striatocortical infarcts. However, higher doses of memantine (20&#x02009;mg/kg/day) significantly increased injury. These results show that clinically established low doses of memantine should be considered for patients &#x02018;at risk' of stroke, while higher doses are contraindicated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>glutamate</kwd><kwd>ischemia</kwd><kwd>memantine</kwd><kwd>NMDA receptor</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cerebral stroke is the third leading cause of death in developed countries and the leading cause of adult disability. The only licensed pharmacological treatment available for acute cerebral stroke is thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator but because of its narrow therapeutic window (&#x0003c;4.5&#x02009;h) and safety concerns, approximately only 15&#x00025; of stroke patients receive recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Focal cerebral ischemia initiates a cascade of complex pathophysiologic events including excitotoxicity, acidotoxicity, ionic imbalance, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> In an attempt to limit the acute cell death after the onset of ischemia a variety of neuroprotective strategies have been developed, which aim to antagonize injurious biochemical and molecular events that culminate in neuronal death. However, such strategies have failed to translate effectively into clinically available treatments for stroke patients (see Davis <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup>) and the development of safe and effective treatments remains a major challenge to stroke research.</p><p>The most rapid, and possibly the most severe, pathophysiologic mechanism initiated after ischemic stroke is that of excitotoxicity, which triggers widespread necrosis and subsequent functional impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Historically, the focus of neuroprotection research has been to use strategies that supress the excitotoxic response after induction of ischemia and primarily target the glutamate system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Various NMDA (<italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate) receptor antagonists have been investigated for their therapeutic potential and been shown to reduce the deleterious effects of excitotoxicity within both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models of ischemic stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> However, clinical trials targeting acute ischemic stroke using NMDA receptor antagonists have repeatedly failed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> probably for a number of reasons including an inability to reach effective concentrations because of severe toxicity shown in humans, too short a neuroprotective time window, and poor clinical trial design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup></p><p>To exert a beneficial effect after ischemic stroke the majority of NMDA receptor antagonists have to be administered at high doses, which increases the possibility of producing unwanted psychotomimetic and cardiovascular effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> However, not all NMDA receptor antagonists produce unwanted side effects at clinically effective doses and some are in current clinical use. One such NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane), has been approved since 2002 in Europe (and since 2003 in the USA) for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> and has been shown in clinical trials to be a safe and effective treatment for vascular dementia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Memantine is distinct from other NMDA receptor antagonists as it possesses fast on/off kinetics, low-moderate receptor affinity and is able to block the effects of excessive glutamate without interfering with the physiologic activation of NMDA receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Although acute postischemic administration of other NMDA receptor antagonists has been shown to be protective in experimental models (for review see Lipton, 2004) there is a wealth of evidence showing that this therapeutic approach of trying to limit cell death during the acute phase of ischemia is difficult to achieve. Thus, a more realistic approach may be prophylactic administration of memantine to those patients identified at being at risk of ischemic stroke, at a dose already tolerated in clinical practice, e.g., for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to determine if systemic administration of the antiexcitotoxic drug, memantine hydrochloride, at doses currently administered for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, could produce protection from ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>High-density cultures (HDCs): Cortices were obtained from E16 balb-c mice after humane cervical dislocation under UK Home Office regulations.

Dye-loaded cultures were mounted into a perfusion chamber (atmosphere chamber, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA), perfused at 2&#x02009;ml/min (artificial cerebrospinal fluid in mmol/l: NaCl, 126; KCl, 3; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2; MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 26; and glucose, 10; pH, 7.45, bubbled with 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>/95&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub>) and maintained at 37&#x000b0;C on the stage of an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Kingston Upon Thames, UK). Oxygen&#x02013;glucose deprivation involved switching to artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing no glucose prebubbled with 95&#x00025; N<sub>2</sub>/5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>, while chamber atmosphere was switched from 95&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub>/5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> to 95&#x00025; N<sub>2</sub>/5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>. Cell temperature was monitored and maintained via flow-through, objective, and room heaters. A rapid exchange perfusion system was used for short application agonist experiments (ValveBank8.2, AutoMate Scientific, Berkeley, CA, USA). Oil immersion x20 images were collected at 520&#x02009;nm or 508&#x02009;nm using appropriate filter sets (Chroma Technology Corporation, Bellows Falls, VT, USA). For FURA-loaded cultures, cells were illuminated at 340, 360, and 380&#x02009;nm; 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate cells were illuminated at 489&#x02009;nm (Optoscan, Cairn Research). Images were captured by a coolSNAP HQ camera (Roper Scientific, Sarasota, FL, USA) controlled via MetaFluor (Molecular Devices) with background signal subtracted. For FURA-2 imaging, 340:380 was converted to [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> using a calcium calibration kit (Invitrogen). Cell death was characterized by sudden collapse of the fluorescent signal to the background level and this phenomenon was used to calculate cell death rates and precise time points of cell death for all cells within the field of view. Cells were also imaged before and after the experiment in quadrants surrounding the field of view, where initial cell counts and surviving cell counts were measured. Cell death data plotted as a time series represents the real-time recordings from the field of view, while total cell death data includes the cells from the surrounding quadrants.</p><p>Cultured astrocytes and neurons are morphologically distinct under phase contrast.

This layer is in communication with the bath solution and is likely to vary between recordings depending on the placement of the electrodes. These factors may contribute to the degree of variance observed between data sets, but reliable mean recordings were achieved. Signals were differential to a null electrode and both active and null electrodes were carefully inserted into a modified atmosphere chamber until the sensor tips rested directly on the cell layer. An Ag/AgCl reference electrode was introduced at a distal site. Oxygen&#x02013;glucose deprivation and control experiments were performed as described above for cell imaging. Sensors were recalibrated in the chamber at the end of the OGD period after retraction from the cell layer. Values from the null, sensor, and sensor-minus-null outputs were recorded at 0.5&#x02009;Hz and subsequently converted into &#x00394; adenosine triphosphate or &#x00394; glutamate, rather than absolute concentrations. Experiments were repeated a minimum of three times, all values collected for a time point during a specific condition/experiment were averaged using Prism (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Focal Cerebral Ischemia</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (Project License 60/4315).

Memantine toxicity in neural cell cultures was not potentiated by high extracellular [K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>] and was not mimicked by exposure to high MK-801 concentrations (100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/l; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) and the underlying mechanisms are not known.

Although findings based on reduced preparations are highly dependent on technical factors, these results show that while low doses of memantine resulted in protection, as a consequence of successfully blocking the excitotoxic injury cascade, higher doses have a neurotoxic effect and significantly increased the amount of cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>Establishing the Dose-Dependent Effects of Memantine after <italic>In Vivo</italic> Cerebral Ischemia</title><p>Preinfusion for 24&#x02009;hours with low-dose memantine reduced whole lesion volumes but significance levels were not achieved using the appropriate nonparametric comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Significant reduction in both striatal and striatocortical lesions (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B and 5C</xref>) were found in the 0.2-mg/kg memantine infusion group when the two lesion types were separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Reduced lesion volume was associated with improved behavioral scores at 24&#x02009;hours after MCAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D&#x02013;5F</xref>) and significantly reduced body weight loss in the striatal lesion group at 24 and 48&#x02009;hours after MCAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Higher memantine concentrations (2 to 10&#x02009;mg/kg) failed to provide any protection while 20&#x02009;mg/kg potentiated injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), correlating with the inverse concentration dependence of the protective effect of memantine over the 0.2 to 10&#x02009;mg/kg range.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current study, memantine exerted a dose-dependent effect in both the degree of protection provided against ischemic injury and the degree of toxicity directed against neural cells. A broad range of concentrations/doses were tested, revealing significant protection at levels several orders of magnitude lower than previously tested in <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of stroke, bringing prophylactic pretreatment for patients at risk of stroke within the therapeutic window. Importantly, this study replicated these dose-dependent effects both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We observed that mice exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion displayed two distinct patterns of injury, small striatal or large corticostriatal lesions and when lesions were divided into the two subtypes, low doses of memantine reduced the amount of lesion volume present whereas high doses increased it. These results suggest that memantine is an effective neuroprotectant at clinically useful doses while the toxicity found at high concentrations may explain previous variability in the degree of protection reported.</p><p>To investigate the effect of memantine <italic>in vitro</italic>, we developed a HDCs model which allowed acute cell death, [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and extracellular glutamate release to be monitored in real time simultaneously in astrocytes, neurons, and mixed cultures. Memantine applied to normal-density culturs at high concentrations (100 to 300&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) produced a toxic effect under control artificial cerebrospinal fluid conditions and potentiated the injury produced by OGD. An absence of protection against ischemic conditions at this concentration is found in experiments using isolated rat optic nerve,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> an effect that is counteracted by coperfusion with a non-NMDA glutamate receptor blocker; while negative effects of higher memantine doses have been noted previously <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> The toxic effect of memantine may be because of the interaction of the antagonist with the NMDA receptor or at a site distinct from the receptor. To test this, memantine was applied under depolarizing conditions, which did not potentiate toxicity, indicating the toxic effect is not because of the interaction of memantine at the NMDA receptor since actions at this site are highly voltage-dependent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> High concentrations of MK-801 (100&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/l) were not toxic, confirming that there is no specific toxicity after NMDA receptor blockade in this preparation. Memantine has been shown to interact with various other receptors including the 5-HT and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-nicotinic receptors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> and toxicity may arise from nonselective effects of this type.</p><p>Although higher concentrations of memantine potentiated cell death during 90&#x02009;minutes of OGD in coculture, significant protection was seen in the presence of lower concentrations (0.5 to 2&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/l). The current well-tolerated therapeutic dose for Alzheimer's treatment is 5 to 10&#x02009;mg/day, with 5&#x02009;mg/day producing a CSF concentration in patients of ~0.05&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/l,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> although the effective concentration at the receptor mouth <italic>in vivo</italic> is estimated to be an order of magnitude higher (Xia <italic>et al</italic> 2010). Results here show that NMDA receptor inhibition at these memantine concentrations attenuates both astrocyte and neuronal cell death in coculture, while ischemic conditions evoked glutamate release from astrocyte but not neuronal monocultures. Caution must be used when interpreting a negative result of this type, however, it is possible that the lower density of neuronal monocultures resulted in lower levels of glutamate release compared with the denser glial monoculture. Neuronal cell death was potentiated by coculture with astrocytes and was preceded by biphasic cytotoxic [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rises, while exogenous application of glutamate agonists evoked [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rises in neurons with little effect in astrocytes. The findings are consistent with ischemic glutamate release from astrocytes evoking neuronal [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rises and cell death via a glutamate receptor dependent form of excitotoxicity, a cascade interrupted by memantine leading to cell protection. Despite the low incidence and amplitude of NMDA receptor responses in astrocytes, low memantine concentrations protected both cell types; an effect indicative of bidirectional glial-neuronal feedback during ischemic conditions, where neuronal injury may potentiate astrocyte injury, while astrocyte glutamate release triggers neuron cell death.</p><p>Antiexcitotoxic drugs were first identified as potential stroke therapies over 30 years ago, but have failed to translate into clinical practice because of dose-dependent complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> Memantine is a moderate affinity noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, binding directly within the pore of the channel in its open configuration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> Although it displays fast on/off kinetics, it also shows partial trapping on agonist removal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> These properties make memantine effective in models of stroke at high (20&#x02009;mg/kg) concentrations when administered in the acute treatment window;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> 20&#x02009;mg/kg/day infusion produces a CSF concentration in rodents of 0.5 to 1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/l,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> an order of magnitude higher than that reported in patients receiving a standard 5&#x02009;mg/day regime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> Although there are no data indicating rodent-CSF levels at lower infusion doses, the 0.2&#x02009;mg/kg/day dose found to be protective in the current experiments is two orders of magnitude lower than the standard 20&#x02009;mg/kg/day protocol use elsewhere and is likely to correlate to the 0.05&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/l levels reported in patients taking 5 to 10&#x02009;mg/day.

Why a standard protocol of focal ischemia should produce one of two distinct injury patterns may relate to variability in vascular anatomy or genetic makeup, or may arise from a normal distribution in the vascular field size producing lesions that encroach from the striatum into the cortex in a proportion of cases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> where a separate injury cascade may spread the lesion in an all or none manner throughout a large cortical area.
