The battery of standardized cognitive assessments that is used for diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to AD in the TOMMORROW study have only been fully validated in English-speaking countries. We conducted a validation and normative study of the German language version of the TOMMORROW neuropsychological test battery, which tests episodic memory, language, visuospatial ability, executive function, and attention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>German-speaking cognitively healthy controls (NCs) and subjects with AD were recruited from a memory clinic at a Swiss medical center. Construct validity, test&#x02013;retest, and alternate form reliability were assessed in NCs. Criterion and discriminant validities of the cognitive measures were tested using logistic regression and discriminant analysis. Cross-cultural equivalency of performance of the German language tests was compared with English language tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 198&#x000a0;NCs and 25 subjects with AD (aged 65&#x02013;88&#x000a0;years) were analyzed. All German language tests discriminated NCs from persons with AD. Episodic memory tests had the highest potential to discriminate with almost twice the predictive power of any other domain. Test-retest reliability of the test battery was adequate, and alternate form reliability for episodic memory tests was supported. For most tests, age was a significant predictor of group effect sizes; therefore, normative data were stratified by age. Validity and reliability results were similar to those in the published US cognitive testing literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study establishes the reliability and validity of the German language TOMMORROW test battery, which performed similarly to the English language tests. Some variations in test performance underscore the importance of regional normative values. The German language battery and normative data will improve the precision of measuring cognition and diagnosing incident mild cognitive impairment due to AD in clinical settings in German-speaking countries.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>Randomized clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Neuropsychology</kwd><kwd>Cross-cultural</kwd><kwd>Validation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Background</title><p id="p0010">Measurement of cognitive change in Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials has typically relied on well-validated metrics, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale test, a composite measure that detects treatment response across different trial settings and cultures <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, as more research started focusing on the preclinical stages of AD, more sensitive metrics are required for the detection of very subtle cognitive changes that occur in the very early stages of incident mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD). An increasing number of secondary prevention studies are now underway that are designed to test therapeutic agents that may either delay or prevent the onset of early clinical symptoms of AD <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These studies have selected composite end points capable of detecting cognitive decline in older adults at risk of developing AD, based on neuropsychological data from longitudinal studies of clinically healthy populations <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">The TOMMORROW study is among these secondary prevention studies and examines the efficacy of medicines to delay the onset of diagnosable MCI-AD <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Unlike the other secondary prevention trials, the primary outcome is a clinically definable event, MCI, rather than a cognitive composite. The trial uses a time-to-event design, with the primary end point event defined as an adjudicated clinical diagnosis of MCI-AD based on the National Institute on Aging&#x02013;Alzheimer's Association criteria <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This end point choice has advantages in being a clinically meaningful outcome but also presents some complexities when applied across different languages and cultures. First, the MCI-AD criteria had not yet been used as an end point in clinical trials, and the criteria needed to be operationalized to allow&#x000a0;diagnostic standardization across multiple sites and clinicians. Second, because the diagnostic criteria are to be used in a global context, cross-cultural validation and standardization of the metrics are essential to ensure that they capture the cognitive and functional features of early-stage AD across all the cultural settings.</p><p id="p0020">In the TOMMORROW study, the core clinical criteria for MCI-AD were operationalized. These criteria were made available for public review before study launch <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and are defined as a sustained decline in both function and neuropsychological performances. Functional decline is operationalized as a change in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) score from 0 to 0.5, and neuropsychological performance is measured by two domains of cognition (one of which must have been episodic memory) falling below baseline performance (to at least 1.3 standard deviation [SD] below the age-adjusted normative mean) or an isolated decline from baseline in episodic memory (i.e., to at least 1.5 SD below the age-adjusted normative mean). To meet the operationalized definition of MCI-AD, these criteria are expected to be met at two consecutive study visits, approximately 6&#x000a0;months apart.</p><p id="p0025">Criteria for MCI-AD can be applied readily in English-speaking countries using standardized cognitive assessments that are normed for the population and well validated for clinical use in cognitively healthy older adults. However, the use of these tools for diagnostic purposes in other cultures requires establishing their test reliability, validity, and normative ranges appropriate to the applicable culture. The purpose of the present study was to psychometrically validate the German language adaptation of the cognitive tests for the TOMMORROW study for application among German-speaking adult populations aged 65&#x02013;88&#x000a0;years (the&#x000a0;target age range for the TOMMORROW study) and to develop normative data for the battery of tests.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p id="p0030">We conducted a validation and normative study of the German language version of the TOMMORROW study's neuropsychological test battery.

This research site&#x000a0;was selected because it would become a site for the TOMMORROW study, and the predominant language spoken (high German) is linguistically equivalent to German-speaking populations in Germany, thereby assuring generalizability of the normative data to a broad range of German-speaking older adults.</p><p id="p0055">Participants were included in the NC group if they had a CDR global rating of 0, a Mini&#x02013;Mental State Examination <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> age- and education-adjusted score &#x02265;25 and were deemed cognitively healthy on neurological evaluation. Mini&#x02013;Mental State Examination scores for NC participants were adjusted for low education (+1 point for those with 0&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years of education) and older age (+1 point for &#x0003e;75&#x000a0;years). Participants with AD were required to have a global CDR rating between 0.5 and 2.0, and have a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD based on well-established diagnostic criteria and supported with clinical documentation from medical records. All participants were required to have a knowledgeable project partner to complete the CDR and other informant-based questionnaires. To ensure consistency in diagnostic assignment, an expert&#x000a0;clinical review of cases was conducted by a clinical consensus committee who had designed the assessment battery and validation study (i.e., the Neuropsychology Lead Office for the TOMMORROW program at Duke University: K.M.H., B.L.P., H.R.R., and K.A.W.-B., in addition to A.S.A. from NeuroCog Trials) and were involved in the cultural validation (A.S.A.).</p><p id="p0060">There were 50 NC participants enrolled in the following four age strata (65&#x02013;69, 70&#x02013;74, 75&#x02013;79, and 80&#x02013;88&#x000a0;years). To ensure a balanced representation of gender and education in each age group, enrollment per stratum was capped to include the following: (1) a minimum of 15 and at most 35&#x000a0;male or female participants per age stratum; (2) a minimum of five and at most 10 individuals with a lower educational level; and (3) a minimum of 40 and at most 45 individuals with a higher educational level. Definitions for high versus low education level were based on population statistics for older adults in Switzerland, in consultation with local experts. Educational levels for Switzerland were designated as lower level (0&#x02013;9&#x000a0;years) and higher level (grade 10 or greater). Finally, to obtain an adequate distribution of AD participants across the overall age range (65&#x02013;88&#x000a0;years), 17&#x000a0;patients with AD aged 65&#x000a0;years to &#x0003c;78&#x000a0;years and eight&#x000a0;patients with AD aged &#x02265;78&#x000a0;years were recruited.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.1.4"><label>2.1.4</label><title>Schedule of assessments</title><p id="p0065">All participants (NC and AD) and their project partners attended visit 1 (baseline).

Medical history was reviewed along with a full clinical interview for dementia with the participant and the project partner using the CDR scale. Clinical diagnoses were assigned by the site clinician based on all data collected at visit 1, with the exception that the clinician remained blinded to the TOMMORROW battery scores to avoid contamination of the validation process. The AD participants were administered standard forms of the CVLT-II and BVMT-R tests.

Cross-cultural equivalence was evaluated by comparing the SDs and the 7th and 10th percentile levels of standardized scores of NC German language participants with published information in commercial manuals for the English versions of the tests (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). The second set of analyses involved the generation of age-standardized German language norms.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2.2"><label>2.2.2</label><title>Validation analysis</title><p id="p0080">For discriminant validity analyses, composite scores were calculated for four cognitive domains, including episodic memory (BVMT-R delayed, CVLT-II long delay, and CVLT-II short delay), executive function (Trails B and digit span backward), language (semantic and lexical fluency), and attention (Trails A and digit span forward). Z-scores for tests within each domain were calculated and then averaged to produce the domain composite scores. The four domain scores were then averaged to produce the total neuropsychological composite score. A forced entry logistic regression was used to evaluate the performance of the composite score for discriminating between NC and AD groups.</p><p id="p0085">A forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to identify the subset of cognitive tests that best described differences between NC and AD cases. Classification statistics (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and correct classification) were generated for each set of the models at a prespecified cut point typically applied to define dementia (&#x02212;2 SD). Cognitive tests were compared by domain-specific and composite models (with and without covariate adjustment) to determine the extent to which performance accurately classified diagnostic groups.</p><p id="p0090">Test-retest reliability was assessed by examining the correlations between paired responses to standard forms of the cognitive tests at visit 1 and visit 2 data from NC participants. Alternate forms reliability was conducted on the raw scores from standard and alternate forms of memory tests that were administered to the same individuals (in schedule 2) at visit 1 and visit 2, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2.3"><label>2.2.3</label><title>Sample size justification</title><p id="p0095">The sample size of 50 NC participants per age strata was based on published guidelines for stable estimates in normative samples <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. For validity analysis, an effect size was estimated based on previously reported mean baseline differences between NC and premorbid AD &#x0201c;converters&#x0201d; (within 3&#x000a0;years), equivalent to an effect size of d&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;1 on both the Trails B and the CVLT-II tests <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Although conservative for this study in which we examine separation of AD dementia from NC, we expected that some tests in the battery would be less sensitive than others. Power analysis indicated that 21 patients with AD were required to detect a group difference equivalent to an effect size of d&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.9 between AD and NC individuals, assuming use of a two-tailed test with <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.05 and powered at &#x003b2;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.8.

Age-standardized normative data tables were generated using the NC data set at visit 1, for each of the four age strata. Norming tables for each cognitive test were based on one of the following norming methods: (1) Z-scores; (2) percentiles; and (3) cutoff points. Test scores for each of the cognitive tests were normed on a linear Z-score metric with a mean of 0 and SD of 1. For tests with skewed distributions, either percentile associated with each raw score for each age strata were generated, or cutoff values were determined to represent the seventh percentile for each age strata.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Sample</title><p id="p0105">There were 228 participants screened; five did not meet the eligibility criteria.

Several factors were taken into consideration, including the intended use of the tests in preclinical AD trials (e.g., is the test part of trigger criteria for diagnosis of MCI-AD?) and the ease of interpreting demographically corrected tests by site clinicians in a clinical trial (e.g., can the clinician interpret performance if points are added/subtracted for a specific gender?). The magnitude of differences by gender was examined across age groups in order to determine which tests should receive a gender correction. The decision was made not to apply a gender correction to MiNT and CVLT-II total learning.</p><p id="p0145">Further modeling was done to examine the impact of a gender correction for CVLT-II short-delay free recall and long-delay free recall. The frequency of normal participants who scored &#x02212;1.3 and &#x02212;1.5 SD below the mean was examined, as well as the raw score differences between men and women at each of these cut points (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table&#x000a0;5</xref>).

An effort was made to choose an adjustment that would correct for the distinct effects of gender on CVLT-II long-delay and short-delay recall tests, without over-correcting the scores of individuals in the oldest age group, resulting in an adjustment of +1.0 for men, to level the differences between males and females.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7.2"><label>3.7.2</label><title>Age-standardized norming tables</title><p id="p0150">Age-standardized normative data tables were generated using the NC data set at visit 1 for each of the four age strata.

Overall, the battery performed as expected in German speakers in Switzerland and similar to the tests in English in the US. However, there were some differences observed across the language versions, which underscore the importance of having regionally based, language-appropriate normative values. To this end, we provide normative data to facilitate the application of the battery in German speakers enrolled in TOMMORROW and other clinical trials in the future. Because all of the cognitive measures in the TOMMORROW neuropsychological battery are scaled for use in the clinical assessment of NC adults, they are well targeted for use in trials designed to prevent or delay early symptomatic AD, and possibly other mild cognitive disorders. The co-norming of the measures that was done in this study provides some unique advantages when drawing clinical inferences. Standardized scores (such as Z-scores, t-scores, or percentiles) for all measures are based on the same normative sample, a situation which allows for a ready assessment of relative strengths and weaknesses in cognitive performance. This information can bolster diagnostic confidence of suspected focal presentations (e.g., stroke), clarify profiles of generalized cognitive disorders due to various dementias (such as AD), and reinforce inferences of possible improvement or decline over time.</p><p id="p0160">The TOMMORROW battery was designed to reliably capture incident cases of MCI-AD. The predetermined cut points on the composite score (&#x02212;2 SD below the norm) yielded variability in sensitivity across the four domain scores; however, specificity was high for all domains. The strong discriminant performance of the CVLT-II delay tests and weaker contribution of tests of attention (e.g., digit span forward and Trails A) is consistent with findings in the cognitive testing literature that focuses on detection of mild cases of AD <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This variability across domains is expected in AD, in which memory impairment is a distinguishing feature throughout the disease, whereas the other domains change over the course of disease expression. We have constructed the composite taking into account the variability in disease expression, aiming to make the composite maximally useful in detecting longitudinal change and potential treatment effects in the very early stages of MCI-AD, rather than cross-sectional change. These expectations are supported by modeling work with the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Additional work should be completed to further improve the composite weighting to allow optimal detection of treatment change over short- and long-time intervals anticipated in clinical prevention trials.</p><p id="p0165">Tests translated and culturally adapted for the German language in Switzerland were compared with the US-developed versions. The validity, test-retest reliability, and alternate form reliability results all showed that the psychometric properties of the translated and culturally adapted tests in German were in the same direction and of similar magnitude as the results from English-speaking countries <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. An example of the benefits of cultural adaptation is evident from the lexical fluency test: it was well matched to US standards, indicating that the letters selected for the German language (letters D, S, and F) are an appropriate adaptation for word frequency, compared with the English language version (letters F, A, and S). Similar to US studies, the test-retest reliability was strong for most tests, and lower for other tests (e.g., CDT and BVMT-R copy) <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>: this is likely due to these tests being skewed toward maximum correct value. Strong alternate form reliability supports the use of a single set of norming tables to derive standardized scores. There was also indication of slight deviations in German language norms compared with English language norms, underscoring the importance of specific German language norms appropriate to the trial population. The use of these regional norms is crucial for reducing false-positive errors and costs of inaccurate case assignment that could occur if English norms were used. Taken together, current results suggest that the battery is fit for use in the German language, functioning in a similar manner to the English version.</p><p id="p0170">Given the number of significant associations observed for age, age stratification is justified for generation of norming tables. Regarding gender effect for CVLT-II short-delay and long-delay, men consistently performed worse than women on these tests, a finding that has been reported in other studies using similar verbal memory measures <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The gender correction of +1 point for male participants could avoid the erroneous exclusion of cognitively healthy men from the study based on low, albeit normal, performance on the CVLT-II short-delay and long-delay subtests. We suggest that the future use of the TOMMORROW battery in clinical practice may also benefit from gender corrections on these specific measures to facilitate accurate diagnostic inferences.</p><p id="p0175">This study has several strengths. First, group classification of either NC or AD was based on an evaluation by a behavioral neurologist or a neuropsychologist, which was conducted independent of knowledge of the participant's performance on the TOMMORROW battery. Second, the sampling schema for the NC participants was uniquely designed to capture the population characteristics of individuals likely to participate in a preclinical AD trial, such as the TOMMORROW study. Sampling criteria that included gender and educational attainment for those aged 65&#x02013;88&#x000a0;years provide a good representation of the range of normal performance in the local population. Third, this study had a robust basis for the normative values, which were based on several rigorous and unique study design elements. Translation of all measures was done in accordance with linguistic and cultural adaptation guidelines provided by International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Moreover, the same normative sample was co-normed providing uniformity in measurement and ready comparisons across tests and cognitive domains within participants, a capability that is unparalleled in current clinical practice given that these eight tests (CVLT-II, BVMT-R, Trails A and B, digit span, lexical fluency, semantic fluency, CDT, and MiNT) have never been co-normed together.</p><p id="p0180">In conclusion, the German language TOMMORROW neuropsychological test battery is both linguistically and culturally valid and measures cognitive performance reliably across time. All tests were performed in a manner that closely parallels the English language standards. The few tests that differed slightly, compared with US normative data, nevertheless represent normal cognitive performance for this local population. The use of the neurocognitive battery and normative data derived from this study will improve precision for both measuring cognition in Switzerland and Germany and diagnosing incident MCI in clinical trials and clinical settings.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in Context</title></caption><p id="p0200"><list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p id="p0205">Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature using traditional sources and congress abstracts and presentations.
