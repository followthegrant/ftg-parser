Intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI; also known in the scientific literature as VEGF Trap Eye or IVT-AFL) has been approved for the treatment of visual impairment because of DME in the United States, Europe, and, most recently, Japan. This approval was based on 2 Phase 3 studies (VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME) that demonstrated significant superiority of IAI 2 mg (plus sham laser) every 4 weeks (2q4) and 2 mg every 8 weeks after 5 initial monthly doses (2q8) over laser in both functional and anatomical outcomes. In addition to VISTA-DME and VIVID-DME, a clinical trial further examining IAI in Japanese patients for at least 1 year (VIVID-Japan) was also conducted.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In Europe, the recommended treatment is 1 IAI per month for 5 consecutive doses, followed by 1 injection every 2 months (8 weeks).<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> There is no requirement for monitoring between injections and, after the first 12 months of treatment with IAI, the treatment interval may be increased gradually (&#x0201c;treat-and-extend&#x0201d; regimen) to maintain stable visual and/or anatomical outcomes. The schedule for monitoring should be determined by the treating physician. In the United States, the recommended dose is 2-mg IAI every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 5 injections followed by 2-mg IAI once every 2 months (8 weeks).<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Similar to the United States, in Japan,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> treatment is initiated with 1 IAI per month for 5 consecutive doses; thereafter, the recommended treatment is usually 1 IAI every 2 months. The dosing interval may be adjusted according to the patient's symptoms and conditions; however, the interval should be at least 1 month or longer. In addition to supplementing the efficacy and safety information observed in the VIVID trial, the aim of the current study is to investigate whether regional and ethnic differences had an effect on the efficacy and safety of IAI by examining Japanese patients who were treated with IAI in VIVID-DME and VIVID-Japan.</p><sec sec-type="patients|methods" id="s1"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Design</title><p>This was an analysis of 2 key IAI studies: VIVID-DME (NCT01331681) and VIVID-Japan (NCT01512966). It should be noted that VISTA-DME was not included in the current analysis because it did not enroll Japanese patients. VIVID-DME was a Phase 3, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled study in patients with clinically significant DME with central involvement and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS]) ranging from 20/40 to 20/320. VIVID-DME enrolled patients from 73 sites across Europe, Japan, and Australia. The design of this study is described in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> VIVID-Japan was conducted specifically in a Japanese population with DME (in response to a request from the regulatory authority) and was a nonrandomized, multicenter, open-label safety study in patients with clinically significantly DME with central involvement and BCVA (ETDRS) 20/40 to 20/320. Patients from 17 sites across Japan were enrolled. Studies were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and were approved by the relevant independent ethics committees and institutional review boards in participating countries.

Furthermore, the observed efficacy and safety outcomes were similar to those observed in a non-Japanese patient population (VIVID-DME).</p><p>With an aging population, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and its associated vision-related complications (including DME) has increased substantially worldwide, and particularly within Asia. As the overall prevalence of DME in Asian patients with diabetes mellitus is now comparable with that in patients in the United States and Europe (0.85&#x02013;12.3%),<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> there is an increasing need for new treatment options in this region as well. Anti-VEGF agents, which have recently been approved in Japan for the treatment of visual impairment because of DME, are one such option.</p><p>Although a number of efficacy and safety studies with anti-VEGF agents have been undertaken in patients with DME, including the RESOLVE, RESTORE, DRCR.net, READ-2, RISE, RIDE, Protocol T, and VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME studies,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> there are currently few published data on the use of anti-VEGF agents specifically in an Asian patient population, in particular, Japanese patients.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>The aim of the current study was therefore to further investigate whether regional and ethnic differences had an effect on the efficacy and safety of IAI in Japanese and non-Japanese patients included in the VIVID-DME study. As only 18.9% (n = 76/403) of patients enrolled in VIVID-DME were Japanese, it was important to compare the findings of VIVID-DME with those of a Japanese population with DME (VIVID-JAPAN) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IAI in Japanese patients with DME; the findings were consistent. In the original VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME studies, Korobelnik et al<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> demonstrated the superiority of IAI 2q4 and 2q8 over laser for both functional and anatomical outcomes. The findings from the subgroup analysis reported here seem to mirror the findings reported for the overall patient population studied in VIVID-DME. At Week 52, Japanese patients with DME who were randomized to the IAI 2q4 (9.8 ETDRS letters) or IAI 2q8 (9.5 ETDRS letters) regimens experienced improvements in BCVA compared with laser (1.1 ETDRS letters).</p><p>REVEAL, a 12-month, multicenter, Phase 3 study, is one of the few other trials to investigate anti-VEGF use in Asian patient populations.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In total, 396 Asian patients with DME were randomized to receive 0.5-mg ranibizumab (plus sham laser) pro re nata, 0.5-mg ranibizumab (plus active laser) pro re nata, or active laser (plus sham injections). REVEAL demonstrated that ranibizumab, when used alone (5.9 ETDRS letters) or in combination with laser (5.7 ETDRS letters), was associated with a numerically and statistically greater change in BCVA from baseline than laser treatment alone (1.4 ETDRS letters; both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001); however, the study did not meet its primary objective for superiority of at least a 5-letter difference.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In addition to the visual results, no new ocular or nonocular safety findings were observed and treatment was well tolerated over 12 months.</p><p>In the current subgroup analysis, the greatest gains in BCVA letters were observed during the initial injection periods (both IAI 2q4 and 2q8 groups); thereafter, these gains were maintained or increased until Week 52. Overall, the time courses for mean variation in BCVA in the non-Japanese and Japanese populations were comparable.</p><p>In the non-Japanese and Japanese populations of the current study, the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was similar across all treatment groups through 52 weeks of treatment.
