In vertebrates, thirst drives water intake, but the neuronal circuits that connect the physiology of water regulation with emotional context are poorly understood. Vasopressin (VP) is a prominent messenger in this circuit, as well as L-glutamate. We have investigated the role of a VP circuit and interaction between thirst and motivational behaviors evoked by life-threatening stimuli in rats. We demonstrate a direct pathway from hypothalamic paraventricular VP-expressing, glutamatergic magnocellular neurons to the medial division of lateral habenula (LHbM), a region containing GABAergic neurons. <italic>In vivo</italic> recording and juxtacellular labeling revealed that GABAergic neurons in the LHbM had locally branching axons, and received VP-positive axon terminal contacts on their dendrites. Water deprivation significantly reduced freezing and immobility behaviors evoked by innate fear and behavioral despair, respectively, accompanied by decreased Fos expression in the lateral habenula. Our results reveal a novel VP-expressing hypothalamus to the LHbM circuit that is likely to evoke GABA-mediated inhibition in the LHbM, which promotes escape behavior during stress coping.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>fluorogold</kwd><kwd>juxtacellular labeling</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>dense core vesicle</kwd><kwd>synapsis</kwd><kwd>metastress coping</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="63"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="11816"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is commonly observed that animals experiencing severe physiological stress, such as prolonged food and water deprivation, are prepared to take greater risks to fight or take flight for survival, whereas in a satiated state, passive stress coping strategies generally predominate. This phenomenon suggests that internal homeostatic demands may exert powerful modulation on emotion, motivation, and motor circuits.</p><p>Thirst is a fundamental function of the nervous system aiming to maintain the internal water, salt and blood pressure homeostasis. Thirst is regulated by many factors that convey to the metabolic activation of the hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory neurons (MNNs) in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei (McKinley and Johnson, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; McKinley et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The activated MNNs release the nonapeptide arginine vasopressin (VP) to the vascular plexus of the neurohypophysis exerting peripheral endocrine functions such as the increase of water re-absorption in the kidney and contraction of smooth muscles of blood vessels to enhance the blood pressure (Armstrong, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Aside the neuroendocrine functions, VP-MNNs' intracerebral micro-circuitry is not fully understood.</p><p>It is widely accepted that the lateral habenula (LHb) codifies negative motivational value and its over-activation fosters depression-related behavior (Matsumoto and Hikosaka, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Hikosaka, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Li et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lecca et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The main afferent and efferent connections of the mammalian LHb comprise the so called &#x0201c;dorsal diencephalic conduction system&#x0201d; (Sutherland, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>), via which the forebrain structures, most importantly the forebrain and midbrain limbic regions influence the neuronal activities in the midbrain aminergic regions (Hikosaka et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Most LHb afferents arrive via the <italic>stria medullaris</italic> (sm) from basal ganglia, entopeduncular nucleus, nucleus accumbens, preoptic regions of the hypothalamus, and septum (Herkenham and Nauta, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). Virtually all efferents project via the <italic>fasciculus retroflexus</italic> (fr) to various midbrain structures including the dorsal raphe, the <italic>substantia nigra pars compacta</italic>, and the ventral tegmental area (Herkenham and Nauta, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). Electrical stimulation of the LHb has a marked suppressant effect on the spontaneous activity of most serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain (Wang and Aghajanian, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>), suggesting that an important function of the LHb is the modulation of the monoaminergic neuronal activity.</p><p>The presence of VP containing axons and terminals in the LHb has long been observed (Buijs, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>). However, the origin of these projections, which neurons they act on, and the functional implications of these connections are still unclear. Here, by using anatomical and immunohistochemical methods, we found that the medial subdivision of lateral habenula (LHbM) was a main VP fiber-targeting region, which concurred with a unique population of GABAergic interneurons in the habenular complex. At the electron microscopy level, VP+ terminals were found establishing Gray type I synapses with VP containing vesicles docked on the presynaptic membrane suggesting a role for synaptic transmission. With <italic>in vivo</italic> juxtacellular labeling and reconstruction methods, we observed that GABA containing neurons located in the LHbM possessed axons that branched extensively in the LHbM parvocellular subnucleus (LHbMPc), and that their dendrites received VP+ fiber contacts. Fluorogold retrograde tracing from LHbM showed that the VP-MNNs of PVN served as one of the sources for VP habenular innervation. This notion is further confirmed by <italic>in vivo</italic> juxtacellularily labeled and reconstructed VP-MNNs. We therefore, hypothesized that modulation of thirst would significantly influence the information processing concerning innate fear and behavioral despair through activation of a habenular microcircuit,. Indeed, recent studies have reported that hunger promotes fear extinction through activation of an amygdala microcircuit (Verma et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and that hypernatremia attenuates the cardiovascular response to restraint and promotes the recovery to pre-stress levels (Krause et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Our results shows that up-regulation of the metabolic activity of the VP-MNNs by 24 h water-deprivation (WD24) reduced freezing/immobility behaviors during live predator (cat) exposure and forced swimming test (FST), which correlated with reduced Fos expression in the whole lateral habenular complex, suggesting a down-regulation of LHb's functional output in response to WD24.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male Wistar rats of 280 g &#x000b1; 20 g (except for the <italic>in vitro</italic> patch clamp experiments, in which 3 weeks old rats were used), were obtained from the local animal facility.

Sections were flat embedded on glass microscope slides, and the resin was polymerized at 60&#x000b0;C for 2 days. Areas containing AVP immunolabeled axons in the medial part of the lateral habenula were re-embedded in capsules with Durcupan resin. Ultrathin sections (~70 nm) were cut with an ultramicrotome using a diamond knife.

The fibers were grouped mainly in three subnuclei: the superior subnucleus (LHbMS), the central subnucleus (LHbMC), and the marginal subnucleus (LHbMMg) (see inset of panel G). Notice that the highest density of VP+ fibers was observed inside the LHbMC (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F&#x02013;I</xref>, arrows). For the sake of completeness, we also examined the expression of other relevant neurochemical markers: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH), serotonin transporter (SerT), somatostatin (SOM), enkephalin (ENK), substance P (SP), calretinin (CR), calbindin (CB), G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel 1 and 2 (GIRK1 and GIRK2) (see supplementary information Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>).

This phenomenon may indicate that: (1) the LHbMC is a key region modulated by subcortical aminergic pathway; (2) the VP innervation may contribute to the robustness of the modulatory mechanism for LHb function, which is also regulated by midbrain aminergic pathways. The region of strong immunostaining for SOM, CR, and CB was also similar to VP. The expressions of ENK, SP, and GIRK1 and GIRK2 were not similar to that of VP, particularly low in LHbMC.

Several reports have argued for the absence of GABAergic neurons inside LHb, although transcripts of gad2 (Wagner et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and gad1 (supplementary information, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref>) were found in the LHbMC by using conventional <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and RNAscope, respectively. GABA or GAD65 or GAD67 somatic labeling by conventional IHC has been a troublesome issue for a long time. We took the challenge with a wide range of antibodies, and a modified IHC protocol. By using two highly purified antisera against GABA-glutaraldehyde-BSA (Millipore MAB319, anti-GABA, clone 5A9, and Sigma A0310, clone GB-69) and GAD65/67 and intra-habenular injection of colchicine, we observed that there is a unique population of GABA/GAD containing neurons inside the rat LHbMC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Using high glutaraldehyde fixation, some GABA containing neuron's somata and proximal dendrites could be clearly labeled (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A<sub>a</sub>, A<sub>b</sub></xref>). Some labeled dendrites making close contacts with VP+ fibers contained postsynaptic glutamate receptor type 1 (GluR1) in juxtaposition to the VP axon terminals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A<sub>c</sub></xref>, arrows) suggesting the existence of glutamatergic synapses. To test whether there are GABAergic neurons in the LHbMC we modified the conventional immunohistochemistry procedures: (1) by microinjection of colchicine into LHbMC 6 h previous to the perfusion/fixation which has proved to increase the GABA/GAD somatic labeling (Ribak et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>); (2) by using high glutaraldehyde (0.1%) fixative; (3) by reducing the triton-100x usage (0.03%) for GABA and GAD IHC.

When looking for identities of GABAergic neurons, we assessed the GABA expressing neurons immunoreactive for metabotropic glutamate receptor 1&#x003b1; (mGluR1 &#x003b1;). We found that most of the somatic membranes labeled by mGluR1&#x003b1; co-expressed GABA, in the medial division of the LHb (supplementary information Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2A</xref>).

Another 30% of recorded cells decreased their firing rate upon VP application (named type II) (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3B</xref>). The type II somata were all bipolar shaped with a long single axon projecting to fasciculus retroflexus (fr). The soma and dendrites of these neurons were positive to GIRK1, a G protein coupled inward rectified potassium channel and their axons expressed vGluT2. VP bath application reduced significantly the input resistance of this group of neurons.

Physiological up-regulation of the VP-MNNs system by WD24 was associated with suppression of LHb functional output, which correlated with active stress coping showed as decreased freezing and immobility during innate fear and behavioral despair assessments. These experiments suggest that this VP-glutamate pathway from the hypothalamic thirst-hydro-electrolytic homeostatic circuit participates in the motivation encoding under multifaceted stressful situations, probably through the activation of a GABAergic microcircuit within the habenular complex.</p><p>Stress coping is essential for survival. Strategies to manage stress range from active to passive&#x02014;the former prepares the animals for a successful control of threats by performing goal-directed movements (e.g., <italic>fight</italic> or <italic>flight</italic>), while the latter, expressed as psychomotor deficit (e.g., <italic>freezing or immobility</italic>), is used when aversively perceived encounters are judged not to be controlled by fight or flight (Engelmann et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). It seems straightforward that the decision-making is intimately linked to the neuroendocrine states. However, beyond the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, little is known about involvement of other functional circuits. Recent advances in this topic include the effect of hunger on fear extinction (Verma et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), hypernatremia on HPA inhibition and post-stress recovery (Krause et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and the discovery of VP containing MNNs that project to the hippocampus (Cui et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zhang and Hern&#x000e1;ndez, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which are likely to influence spatial learning (Hern&#x000e1;ndez et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), anxiety (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and aggressive behavior (Pagani et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Our first novel finding is the discovery of the origin of VP innervations in the lateral habenula by both Fluoro-Gold retrograde labeling and <italic>in vivo</italic> juxtacellular anterograde labeling. In a recently published paper (Hern&#x000e1;ndez et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), we characterized extra-neurohypophyseal axonal projections from individual vasopressin-containing magnocellular neurons in the rat hypothalamus. We showed that the VP-MNNs possessed multiple axon-processes (Hern&#x000e1;ndez et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and the long-range non-neurohypophysial projections is a more common feature of this type of neuron, than an &#x0201c;occasional&#x0201d; phenomenon as previously thought to be, suggesting that the magnocellular VP-glutamatergic non-canonical pathways found here may constitute the central motivational circuits activated under multifaceted stress coping.</p><p>Our second key finding is that at the electron microscopy level, VP+ dense-core vesicles (dcv) co-localized with small-clear vesicles at the active synaptic zone, with some of them docked at the presynaptic membrane, suggesting that VP could act as a direct synaptic transmission modulator via a yet-unknown mechanism. It has been identified so far that VP binds mainly to three distinct G-protein coupled receptors: (i) vasopressin V1A receptors, that trigger phospholipase-C C (PLC) activation and calcium mobilization; (ii) vasopressin V1B receptors, that are also coupled to PLC and are found mainly in the anterior pituitary and hippocampus CA2 region; (iii) vasopressin V2 receptors, that are coupled to adenylyl cyclase, and are present in the kidney (Barberis et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Schoneberg et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Thibonnier et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Birnbaumer, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Although low expression of both V1a and V1b receptor transcripts have been observed in the lateral habenular region by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3D</xref> and Allen Brain Atlas, Allen Institute, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show?id=78153154">http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show?id=78153154</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show?id=79488955">http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show?id=79488955</ext-link>), the presence of receptors and their subregional and synaptic/extrasynaptic distribution in lateral habenular complex have remain unclear. One of the reasons for which this information is still obscure is due to lack of trustworthy antibodies and suitable techniques to identify the presence of VP receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. Nonetheless, the synergistic effects of vasopressin on fast and long-lasting glutamate-mediated excitatory synaptic events have been extensively reported (Muhlethaler et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Kombian et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Chepkova et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Dubrovsky et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). In particular, several VP metabolites have been identified to greatly contribute to the observed VP effects in the central nervous system. In contrast to VP, very low doses of those VP metabolites (e.g., 1/1000 of pharmacological dose of VP), which have no peripheral effects, have been found to induce changes in the CNS (Burbach et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Dietrich and Allen, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Fujiwara et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Reijmers et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). These data favor the hypothetical existence of a separate &#x0201c;receptor&#x0201d; for the VP metabolites distinct of the classical G-protein coupled VP and oxytocin receptors, although its identity has remained obscure. Another hypothetical mechanism to explain the experimental evidence mentioned above, including the presence of VP+ dcvs in the presynaptic membrane observed under electron microscopy we are reporting with this work, is that the vasopressin metabolites interact directly with postsynaptic proteins facilitating the glutamatergic transmission. Peptide-protein interactions are prevalent in the living cell and form a key component of the overall protein-protein interaction network (London et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Hence we would speculate that the interaction between VP-metabolites and the postsynaptic glutamate receptors underlies this glutamate transmission-synergic effect of brain VP. The study of these possible mechanisms is a major challenge to understand how brain VP system generates and regulates diverse central functions.</p><p>The presence of intrinsic GABAergic neurons in the rat LHb had been suggested more than 30 years ago (Gottesfeld et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Belin et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). However, it has been generally accepted that the LHb lacks inhibitory interneurons and that the strong GABAergic innervation observed under IHC is presumably coming from long-range projections (Meye et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). As a consequence, less attention has been paid to the contribution of intrinsic inhibitory interneurons on habenular physiology. However, this provisional conclusion could be due to the technical difficulties to label the soma and dendrites of GABA neurons by conventional IHC methods, although both GAD65 and GAD67 mRNA have been seen using either conventional <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization methods (Brinschwitz et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wagner et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) or the newly available RNAscope method (Advanced Cell Diagnostic, CA; Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref>). By modification of the fixation and IHC procedures, and by intrahabenular injection of colchicine, which enhanced the GABA somatic labeling (Ribak et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>), we have seen clearly the cytoplasmatic presence of either GABA or GAD65/67 in the LHbMC. This observation is further unequivocally corroborated by <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> labeled GABAergic neurons whose axonal branches were largely seen inside the LHbMC, particularly in the parvocellular subnucleus of the central part of the LHb (LHbMPc). Long term metabolic activation of hypothalamic VP-glutamate pathway due to WD24 24 h (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B<sub>c</sub></xref>, striking Fos expression in almost all VP+ neurons inside the PVN<sub>lmd</sub> and Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>, that most Fos+ nuclei co-express GABA in the LHbMC) reduced significantly the Fos expression in whole habenular complex when rats were subjected to life-threatening situations and correlated with the reduced freezing and immobility behaviors. These results suggest that the pathway involving VP-MNNs projections to the LHb could be a feed-forward inhibition arrangement, i.e., numerically not-so-abundant VP containing excitatory inputs selectively activate local inhibitory interneurons, which, in turn, suppress the functional output of the LHb.</p><p>We aimed to investigate the influences of an internal stressful condition (i.e., thirst caused by 24 h water deprivation, in which the hypothalamic VP magnocellular system is greatly up-regulated) on the life-threatening stress response (live-predator exposure and drowning). We would like to call this as a &#x0201c;meta-stress&#x0201d; coping. Our results suggest that WD24 enhance the motivational behavior (escape) and down-regulate the passive stress coping (freezing). This observation was correlated with differential Fos activation patterns in the LHb. Concerning the forced swim test (FST), we modified the classical setting to a simple one-time exposure, aiming to answer our research question&#x02014;can thirst (an internal stressful condition) increase the motivational behavior toward survival when the animal is facing a life-threatening condition (a multifaceted adversity). An acute episode, when the animal faces the threat of drowning for the first time in this setting (no adaptation of the inescapability chance has been given), the emotional component of the classical setting is minimized. Hence, we consider that this modified FST infers the animal internal motivational state&#x02014;&#x0201c;escape or wait to die&#x0201d; and it is valuable to assess an acute active vs. passive stress response. LHb activation has been shown to induce aversive learning and promote passive stress copping strategies, seen experimentally as an increased freezing behavior during innate fear processing and immobility accounts/time during behavioral despair (Pobbe and Zangrossi, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Bowen et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Gill et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The results suggest that AVP-MNNs to LHb pathway could contribute in promoting motivational behavior during a multifaceted stress coping.</p><p>We want to emphasize that an important strength of this study is that the behavioral tests were performed under physiological conditions. The hypothalamic magnocellular VP system possesses some unique advantages to study the behavioral consequences of the activation of a given neuronal set. This system can be potently up-regulated under thirst, in a relatively selective way (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B<sub>c</sub></xref>), even before a significant disruption of the body's water homeostasis occurs [for instance, WD24, in which the plasma osmolarity increases around 3% while the plasma VP concentration increases 7 fold (Dunn et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1973</xref>)]. This feature offers a valuable opportunity to study the behavioral consequence of the activation of a selective neuronal population strictly within the physiological circuitry controls&#x02014;no genetic modification, viral infection, artificial over-stimulation or pain caused by invasive procedures are involved.</p><p>From these data it could be further hypothesized that an intrinsic GABAergic microcircuit exists for the fine control of habenular functional output, a region considered to be part of the limbic system. During the preparation and reviewing of this manuscript a publication appeared (Myers et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) reporting evidence of limbic regions controlling posterior hypothalamic GABAergic microcircuits, which in turn suppress the excitatory output to the HPA axis, reducing anxious behavior and social withdrawal. The data from our study suggest that hypothalamic homeostatic circuits could modulate the GABAergic microcircuit within the LHb, a limbic region, to promote motivational behaviors, echoing with the previous work. Together, these novel results provide a beautiful example of how distinct brain regions work in concert to produce mental and behavioral actions to promote survival.</p><p>Further studies on the synaptic organization and the interactions with other transmitter systems, in particular, the TH+ and SerT+ fiber systems in the habenula, will provide a more complete view of brain's physiological circuits for motivational behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: LZ, VSH.
