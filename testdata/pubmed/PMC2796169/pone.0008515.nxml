To try to reconcile these into an easily visualized 3D model of wound healing amenable for experimentation by cell biologists, a multiscale model of the formation of a 3D skin epithelium was established with TGF-&#x003b2;1 literature&#x02013;derived rule sets and equations embedded within it. At the cellular level, an agent-based bottom-up model that focuses on individual interacting units (keratinocytes) was used. This was based on literature-derived rules governing keratinocyte behavior and keratinocyte/ECM interactions. The selection of these rule sets is described in detail in this paper. The agent-based model was then linked with a subcellular model of TGF-&#x003b2;1 production and its action on keratinocytes simulated with a complex pathway simulator. This multiscale model can be run at a cellular level only or at a combined cellular/subcellular level. It was then initially challenged (by wounding) to investigate the behavior of keratinocytes in wound healing at the cellular level. To investigate the possible actions of TGF-&#x003b2;1, several hypotheses were then explored by deliberately manipulating some of these rule sets at subcellular levels. This exercise readily eliminated some hypotheses and identified a sequence of spatial-temporal actions of TGF-&#x003b2;1 for normal successful wound healing in an easy-to-follow 3D model. We suggest this multiscale model offers a valuable, easy-to-visualize aid to our understanding of the actions of this key regulator in wound healing, and provides a model that can now be used to explore pathologies of wound healing.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is a wealth of intracellular detail available on the genome, proteome and metabolome of individual cells.

Their major contribution to cell and tissue biologists however is that they aid and challenge our thinking about how parameters relate to each other, providing a relatively simple platform in which to test hypotheses and ultimately improve our understanding of complex biological systems such as tissue morphogenesis and pathogenesis <xref rid="pone.0008515-Rashbass1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>1</bold>]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008515-Drasdo1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>4</bold>]</xref>.</p><p>Agent-based modeling in particular is popular with biologists as it can be used to simulate the interactions of autonomous entities (agents or cells) with each other and their local environment to predict higher level emergent behaviours. The outputs of these models can be visual and easily accessible to biologists to assist in developing the much needed interaction between cell and tissue biologists and computational modelers <xref rid="pone.0008515-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>5</bold>]</xref>.</p><p>The underpinning hypothesis behind agent based modeling for cells is that the development of a complex tissue is crucially dependent on the coordination of relatively few cellular mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0008515-Rashbass1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>1</bold>]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Vespa1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>6</bold>]</xref>. Thus in our previous work in this area we used a rule set which describes several basic cellular behaviors of keratinocytes (proliferation, migration and differentiation etc.) derived from the keratinocyte literature by abstracting the details of complex sub-cellular mechanisms to develop an agent-based colony formation model. This model was then used to generate some predictions which were tested in parallel <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments which allowed us to explore hypotheses about how normal human keratinocyte (NHK) form colonies <xref rid="pone.0008515-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>5</bold>]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we have progressed this work in two directions. We now model keratinocyte organization in three dimensions (3D) which allows us to simulate the formation of the epidermis (and then the response of the epidermis to wounding) and we have taken on a multi-scale modeling approach which allows us to link intracellular signaling rules (concerning one key growth factor, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1)) and the emergent behaviours of NHK at the cellular level.</p><p>Since the majority of the biological data of TGF-&#x003b2;1 are either qualitative or semi-quantitative, our general approach, as before, was to derive rule sets and/or relatively simple equations for TGF-&#x003b2;1 regulation of keratinocyte behaviour from the extensive literature on TGF-&#x003b2;1, which was then simulated with COmplex PAthway Simulator (COPASI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.COPASI.org">http://www.COPASI.org</ext-link>) <xref rid="pone.0008515-Hoops1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>7</bold>]</xref> and linked to the agent based model. There are a growing number of models of intracellular regulation of the cell cycle or of the activity of particular key intracellular signaling molecules. We selected TGF-&#x003b2;1 to develop a multi-scale model because it is a potent tissue regulator with profound but apparently paradoxical influences on epithelial cell behaviour in wound healing. Clearly TGF-&#x003b2;1 is not the only regulator of epithelial cell behaviour but to the best of our knowledge this is one of only a few such multi-scale models which seek to link intracellular signaling to an agent based model of cell behaviour (as referenced in the accompanying paper).</p><p>The rule sets for the COPASI model were based on detailed analysis of the biological data describing TGF-&#x003b2;1 synthesis, expression, secretion, activation, signaling and biological functions during re-epithelialisation. Rule sets were deliberately designed so they could be readily modified to incorporate more quantitative biological data as this emerges in the future. The COPASI model was then integrated into the agent based re-epithelialisation model. Thus the behaviour of each cell agent was governed not only by rule sets at the cellular level, but also by TGF-&#x003b2;1 sub-cellular mechanisms that were simulated with COPASI. The assumptions used in the TGF-&#x003b2;1 simulations and in the cell level simulations and the relationships between the two are described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref> section.</p><p>The model was initially developed to describe the behaviour of keratinocytes and the expression and regulation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 following the wounding and healing of an epithelium. Then the model was used in exploratory <italic>in virtuo</italic> experiments to investigate the extent of the influence of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on epidermal wound healing. This <italic>in virtuo</italic> research demonstrated that the proliferative and migratory NHKs were located at different areas of the wound bed and both are necessary for normal epidermal wound healing. The model suggests that TGF-&#x003b2;1 plays a crucial role in normal re-epithelialisation by dictating the balance between cell proliferation and migration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The description of the model and how it was developed are described in the accompanying paper. This section however describes how the extensive literature on re-epithelialisation and TGF- &#x003b2;1 was selected and used to derive the rule sets in the model. The general approach was to conduct an extensive and systematic literature review for TGF- &#x003b2;1 and skin which encompassed normal adult skin, and its role in foetal development and adult wound healing using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), &#x0201c;TGF-beta1&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;re-epithelialisation&#x0201d; and similar terms. Reports were further divided into the reported actions of TGF- &#x003b2;1 in cell division, migration and differentiation. Only those which were substantially confirmed in several laboratories were used in formulating the rule sets. Studies which differed from each other quantitatively but not qualitatively were viewed as essentially similar for the purposes of this initial rule set formulation. A representative selection of this literature is referred to beneath and was used for the <italic>in silico</italic> model.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Review of Epidermal Wound Healing and the Broad Role of Cytokines Including TGF-&#x003b2;1</title><p>The normal human epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium composed predominantly of keratinocytes at different stages of proliferation/differentiation <xref rid="pone.0008515-Zambruno1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>8</bold>]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008515-Aukhil1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>10</bold>]</xref>.

The reasons for selecting TGF-&#x003b2;1 to model in this study are twofold -it is acknowledged as a key influence in normal (and abnormal) wound healing and there is a wealth of experimental data on its expression and activities to draw on. In the re-epithelialisation model, the sub-cellular mechanisms of all growth factors were abstracted away (not modeled) when deriving the minimum rule set, but the details of TGF-&#x003b2;1's actions were simulated explicitly using COPASI.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Modelling the Extracellular Matrix</title><p>The next aspect of wound healing to explain is the role and reconstitution of the basement membrane (BM)&#x02013;a key structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM).

At different stages of re-epithelialisation, keratinocytes and other cells express different ECM components to restore the BM.

As re-epithelialisation ensues, they then express other proteins such as laminin to produce the basal lamina, and essentially remodel the secondary matrix into a BM in a sequential manner starting from the margins of the wound and moving inwards, in a zipper like fashion <xref rid="pone.0008515-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>9</bold>]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008515-Aukhil1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>32</bold>]</xref>.

The rules we used were that the provisional matrix indirectly promotes migration and inhibits proliferation of NHK by inducing the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 (simulated using COPASI at the sub-cellular level), the secondary matrix enhances NHK proliferation and migration and the mature BM inhibits NHK proliferation and migration (simulated using rules at the cellular level). Further the rules dictate that the interaction of NHK with the provisional matrix induces the remodeling of provisional matrix into secondary matrix, while the interaction of NHK with secondary matrix induces the remodeling of this matrix into BM (simulated using rules at the cellular level). In the integrated model, the dynamic interactions between NHK and the various ECM components were simulated using both biological rules at the cellular level and the COPASI model at the sub-cellular level, however the COPASI model was given a higher priority than the cellular rules.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Review of Keratinocyte Migration</title><p>Keratinocytes migrate by a combination of keratinocyte integrin expression and remodelling of the underlying ECM by keratinocyte protease expression.

Biological rules of the emergent behavior of NHKs induced by injury were derived and incorporated into the previously developed keratinocyte colony formation model to establish an agent based re-epithelialisation model. TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression, signaling and function were then simulated using COPASI and integrated within the re-epithelialisation model. Most of the biological rules used in the previous keratinocyte colony formation model <xref rid="pone.0008515-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>5</bold>]</xref> were kept un-changed except for slight alterations to simulate cell behavior in the human epidermis in 3D as opposed to in 2D culture. Briefly, NHK stem cells can attach to the surface of ECM, proliferate, form tight colonies, and control the size of the stem cell colony automatically. When the stem cell colony reaches a certain size, the stem cells on the colony edge will differentiate to TA cells. TA cells can migrate, divide, stratify and control the size of TA cell colony due to the auto-regulation mechanisms. When TA cells are a certain distance away from stem cells, they will differentiate to committed cells.

In the re-epithelialisation model, there are attractive and repelling forces between different agents as in the previous model. The attractive forces simulate cell-cell and cell-substrate bonds, and are applied when the respective bodies (cell-cell or cell-substrate) are within 5 &#x000b5;m of one another, which keeps keratinocytes in the coherent cell sheet and the epidermis to the surface of ECM. In the integrated model, however, the cell-cell and cell-substrate bonds were simulated using variables instead of constants, which can be regulated by the function pathway of the TGF-&#x003b2;1 COPASI model. The ligand-receptor level in the endosome (LRE) simulated by the TGF-&#x003b2;1 signaling pathway in COPASI was used by the TGF-&#x003b2;1 function pathway to further simulate the expression of integrins and proteases (IN_PR) according to the equations described in the accompanying paper.

Thus two alterations were made to the active migration of TA cells as used in our previous model. Firstly, TA cells can migrate actively at the same rate (1 &#x000b5;m/minute) as in the previous model provided they keep contact with other cell agents. Secondly, a high tendency for the TA cells to migrate toward or on the provisional matrix is defined for active migration of TA cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>2.

In addition to the auto-regulation mechanism, the influences of the ECM matrix and TGF-&#x003b2;1 on cell proliferation were simulated explicitly, while the influences of other factors (such as cytokines) on cell proliferation were modeled implicitly in the re-epithelialisation model. For example it is well accepted that cells in a wound bed will become more proliferative and also migrate further away from the centre of their original colonies because of a high local concentration of cytokines. In order to simulate this hyperproliferation of the cells in the wound bed, a slight modification was made to the biological rule set so that both stem and TA cell agents could migrate further away from the centre of stem or TA cell colonies before they start to differentiate, thus the sizes of these auto-regulated stem and TA colonies were deliberately made bigger than in the previous model.</p><p>The cell proliferation rates of both stem and TA cells were also simulated using variables instead of constants, thus the cell proliferation rate can be regulated by the TGF-&#x003b2;1 function pathway of the COPASI model.

In virtuo investigation of epidermal wound healing. To create a virtual epidermal wound, the <italic>in virtuo</italic> intact epidermal model was deliberately &#x02018;injured&#x02019; by removing all of the cells in the epidermis down to the BM. The underlying damaged dermis surface was then covered with provisional matrix &#x02018;tiles&#x02019; to simulate the provisional matrix in the wound bed as one of the emergent events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). To simulate the active TGF-&#x003b2;1 released by platelets and macrophages in the early stage of the wounding the TGF-&#x003b2;1 level at the wound surface was set to a high level. Running the model using the &#x02018;virtually injured&#x02019; epidermis demonstrated that some basal and suprabasal cells (shown in red) initially migrated from the wound margins onto the provisional matrix while proliferation of these cells was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Model analysis clearly indicated that active TGF-&#x003b2;1 (released by platelets and macrophages) <xref rid="pone.0008515-Zambruno1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>8</bold>]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Blobe1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>44</bold>]</xref> played an important role at the early stage of epidermal wound healing. In the presence of this active TGF-&#x003b2;1, the cells on the dermal wound bed surface were more motile and less proliferative. Thus the earliest stage of cell migration in this model was not driven by the relatively slow up-regulation of cell proliferation as reported <xref rid="pone.0008515-Zambruno1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>8</bold>]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008515-Aukhil1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Breitkreutz1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Hakkinen1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Nodder1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>57</bold>]</xref>. Then as the epidermal cells on the wound surface migrated into the wound bed, there was a burst of keratinocyte proliferation at the wound margins, which provided the extra source of NHK for the continuous epidermal migration. As wound healing progressed, two distinguishable NHK populations appeared, proliferating keratinocytes mainly confined to the wound margins and migrating keratinocytes mostly distributed on the epithelial migration tongue moving toward the provisional matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). This emergent behaviour of the model simulates results from several studies of TGF-&#x003b2;1 <xref rid="pone.0008515-Zambruno1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>8</bold>]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0008515-Aukhil1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Garlick1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>58</bold>]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0008515-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008515.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Simulation of the normal epidermal wound healing process using the &#x02018;virtually injured&#x02019; epidermis.</title><p>During the healing process, (A) some basal and superbasal cells (labeled with red colour) initially migrated from the wound margins onto the provisional matrix while proliferation/division of these cells was not observed.

Cell proliferation vs migration during epidermal wound healing. The comparative requirements for cell proliferation and migration in epidermal wound healing are not easy to determine. It has been suggested that re-epithelialisation does not appear to depend on cell proliferation since molecules such as TGF-&#x003b2;1 promote the migration of epithelial cells in organ cultures while acting as a potent inhibitor of keratinocyte proliferation, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>9</bold>]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Clark2" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>59</bold>]</xref>. Model analysis at the cellular level indicated that when the migration rule was completely blocked, wound healing failed as all the epithelial cells simply started to overlap on top of each other at the wound margin instead of migrating forward to cover the denuded area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g005">Fig. 5A&#x02013;C</xref>). When only the hyperproliferation rule was blocked, part of the wound healed at a relatively slow rate due to the low proliferation rate on the wound edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g005">Fig. 5D&#x02013;F</xref>). However, when all the cell proliferation was inhibited, the wound healing process was completely deterred except for the small area near the wound edge which was covered by the initial cell migration of superbasal cells (data not shown). The influence of the block on migration rule or hyperproliferation rule on epidermal wound healing was also evaluated by measuring the migration distance of epidermal cells and the percentage of the wound area that was covered by cells as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g006">Fig. 6A&#x02013;B</xref>. Model analysis demonstrated that, at the earliest stage of re-epithelialisation, cell migration was not driven by cell proliferation as this was inhibited by factors such as TGF-&#x003b2;1 <xref rid="pone.0008515-Aukhil1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>10</bold>]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Nodder1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>57</bold>]</xref>. After all the dedifferentiated basal and superbasal cells migrated onto the denuded area, cell proliferation then became crucial for further progress of re-epithelialisation. The model showed that for a large wound re-epithelialisation is almost impossible without the presence of an extra source of new keratinocytes. Therefore, our <italic>in virtuo</italic> experimentation clearly demonstrated that both cell proliferation and migration are crucially important for re-epithelialisation&#x02013;particularly for extensive wounds. One implication is that the failure to heal of chronic wounds may be caused by abnormal (or blocked) cell migration or a failure in cell proliferation or both.</p><fig id="pone-0008515-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008515.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>In virtuo investigation of the influence of cell proliferation and migration on epidermal wound healing.</title><p>The migration rule at cellular level was completely blocked and the virtual epidermal wound was simulated for (A) 0, (B) 200, (C) 400 interactions.

The model predicted that even when cells have normal proliferation and migration rates, large wounds still cannot be healed no matter how long the model simulation is executed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g007">Fig. 7E&#x02013;H</xref>) compared with smaller wound beds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g007">Fig. 7A&#x02013;D</xref>). The healing process of a large wound using the integrated model is also illustrated in the attached <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008515.s001">Movie S1</xref>. Model analysis showed that this is because keratinocytes in this model are still regulated by the auto-regulation colony forming mechanism. Thus before the cells can migrate sufficiently to cover the large denuded area, they differentiate into committed cells and or corneocytes. Therefore, in such large wounds it will be necessary either to introduce a new source of keratinocytes not yet terminally differentiated (in clinical practice this would be achieved using skin grafts or tissue engineered skin) or to override the differentiation rules of these cells. The model as configured would achieve reepithelialisation of wounds of up a certain size (i.e. the size of stem and TA cell colony)&#x02013;wounds greater than this would be predicted not to heal spontaneously.</p><fig id="pone-0008515-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008515.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>In virtuo investigation of the influence of the auto-regulation mechanism and time period on the healing processes of small and large wound beds.</title><p>The small virtual wound with normal proliferation and migration rates were simulated for (A) 0, (B) 50, (C) 120, (D) 500 iterations and the epidermal cells migrated to cover the denuded area.

TGF-&#x003b2;1 released by platelets and macrophages at the site of injury initiated the outgrowth of epidermal cells by facilitating keratinocyte migration <xref rid="pone.0008515-Hebda1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>60</bold>]</xref>. The cells regulated by TGF-&#x003b2;1 became less proliferative and were induced to express TGF-&#x003b2;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>).

After the epidermal cells migrated away and the initially deposited active TGF-&#x003b2;1 was gradually lost from the wound surface, the inhibitory effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on cell proliferation was also diminished and there was a subsequent burst of keratinocyte proliferation at the wound margins, which provided the extra source of NHK to maintain the progress of re-epithelialization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g008">Fig. 8B&#x02013;C</xref>).</p><p>As the epidermal cells migrated onto the provisional matrix, the synthesis, secretion, deposition and activation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 were gradually up-regulated due to these cell-matrix interactions. Interestingly, all of these events were confined to a certain proportion of cells located at the migrating epithelial tongue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). Thus the cells in this area were promoted to be even more motile, but their proliferation was inhibited, while the proliferation of the keratinocytes beyond this area was not negatively influenced <xref rid="pone.0008515-Zambruno1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>8</bold>]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Streuli1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>38</bold>]</xref> (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g008">Fig. 8B&#x02013;C</xref>). In addition to the influence of TGF-&#x003b2;1 synthesis, secretion, deposition and activation, there are other mechanisms to down-regulate the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the keratinocytes behind the migration tongue. Model analysis demonstrated that both the gradual restoration of BM and degradation of latent TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the matrix were the main mechanisms. As the influence of TGF-&#x003b2;1 diminished gradually, the cells behind the migration tongue started to resume proliferation, thus new cells were produced to maintain the continuous migration of the cells at the migration tip.</p><p>The model analysis clearly suggests that TGF-&#x003b2;1 provides a mechanism to coordinate the behaviour of proliferative and migratory keratinocyte populations, consequently the wound can be repaired in a coordinated and organised manner. The model also helps illustrate how the functions of TGF-&#x003b2;1 can be explained by its temporal-spatial distribution in normal wound healing process as described by several researchers <xref rid="pone.0008515-Zambruno1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>8</bold>]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Garlick2" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>61</bold>]</xref>.

In these <italic>in virtuo</italic> experiments the assumption that was made was that TGF-&#x003b2;1 was only responsible for 60&#x00025; of stimulated cell migration and 60&#x00025; of reduced cell proliferation, since it is only one of several growth factors that can regulate cell behaviour and there is no quantitative biological data suggesting to what extent this growth factor is responsible for cell migration and proliferation. (This figure of 60&#x00025; is purely arbitrary and could easily be changed based on more accurate biological data).</p><p>Based on this assumption, it was found that if its function on cell migration was blocked then wound healing was partially slowed down (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g009">Fig. 9A&#x02013;C</xref>). If its inhibitory function on cell proliferation was blocked, then the wound healed in a relatively disorganised manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g009">Fig. 9D&#x02013;F</xref>). Model analysis demonstrated that this was because the cells on the migration tongue also proliferated and there was only one single NHK population, which was both proliferative and motile. The influence of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on epidermal wound healing was also evaluated by measuring the percentage of the wound area that was covered by epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>) and epidermal cell migration distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008515-g010">Fig. 10B</xref>).

However in this model it was not possible to investigate the influence of any specific sub-cellular pathways on multi-cellular behaviors or tissue morphogenesis. Agent-based modeling approaches are ideal for reducing the complexity of biological systems by abstracting away the micro-level or sub-cellular details to produce a global view of the biological system. These allow the testing of hypotheses and the designing of new informative experiments. The regulation of epidermal homeostasis involves a complex interplay between different generic and genetic mechanisms; cells actively change their behaviors and properties as a consequence of internal decisions or &#x02018;sub-cellular rules&#x02019; that are encoded in the genetic information. It would be very useful to investigate specific sub-cellular mechanisms in a model that can combine the description of a cell with a description of the &#x0201c;sub-cellular rules&#x0201d; that dictate the change of its behaviors or parameters <xref rid="pone.0008515-Galle1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>2</bold>]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Drasdo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0008515-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>63</bold>]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of this research was to develop an agent and COPASI based multi-scale model and go to the next level of complexity by combining the description of cell behaviors at the cellular level during epidermal wound healing with the description of TGF-&#x003b2;1 mechanisms (e.g expression, function etc) at the sub-cellular level.</p><p>To do this the previously developed agent based keratinocyte colony formation model <xref rid="pone.0008515-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>5</bold>]</xref> was first extended to an epidermal wound healing (re-epithelialisation) model by including new biological rules about the emergent responses of keratinocytes to various wound injury signals abstracted from an extensive published literature. At this stage the rules were still at the cellular level and only governed basic cellular behaviors such as cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. The sub-cellular details of TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression, signaling and regulation were then simulated using COPASI and integrated with the re-epithelialisation model. The model could now be used to simulate various cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions at the cellular level, but also to explicitly investigate the regulation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on keratinocyte behaviours at the sub-cellular level.</p><p>The validity of the basic biological rules at the cellular level and the sub-cellular mechanisms used in the COPASI were tested by comparing the simulation results of both intact epidermis and the epidermal wound healing process with corresponding research reports. The results demonstrated that the model successfully simulated the reported behavior of keratinocytes and of TGF-&#x003b2;1 sub-cellular mechanisms during epidermal wound healing. Overall the initial validity testing of the model seemed promising and quickly led to the generation of hypotheses for exploration.</p><p>The model was first used to create a virtual epidermis from scratch, which was then virtually injured and used to analyse the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes during re-epithelisation.

It was this migratory keratinocyte population that was regulated by TGF-&#x003b2;1, while the proliferative keratinocyte population was not influenced by TGF-&#x003b2;1. Therefore, the biological roles of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on wound healing were not conflicting in the context of healing a wound in a 3D epithelial tissue.</p><p>Our model supports TGF-&#x003b2;1 playing an important role in keeping the balance between migration and proliferation for normal wound healing. Model analysis further indicated that any disruption of TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression or signalling could influence the healing process leading to chronic wounds or hypertrophic wounds as indicated by biological research <xref rid="pone.0008515-Fitsialos1" ref-type="bibr">[<bold>66</bold>]</xref>.</p><p>Simulation of the sub-cellular mechanisms in the epidermal wound healing suggested that such biological information, such as to what extent TGF-&#x003b2;1 can influence cell migration and proliferation, is crucially important for us to calibrate the model before it can be used by biologists to explain or investigate more complex biological questions in the laboratory. The experience of developing this integrated model also clearly demonstrated the advantages and disadvantages of the simple biological rules in the agent based model and the mechanisms in the COPASI model. A balance between simple biological rules and complex sub-cellular mechanisms is crucially important to develop a multi-scale model based on current biological knowledge.</p><p>It is obvious that there are still many limitations in this multi-scale model. It does not go into details on which attachment factors or mitogens are produced during the wound healing process, or how cells respond to factors other than TGF-&#x003b2;1. However despite these limitations the current study demonstrates the potential of such models to become a powerful tool for understanding complex biological systems at a system level and guiding our research.</p><p>In summary, in this study we describe a novel computational model of epidermal wound healing, based on previously published experimental work both at the cellular and sub-cellular levels, enabling hypotheses to be readily generated and tested. This synergy between different modeling approaches has the potential to become a powerful tool for understanding how cells organize into tissues. An immediate &#x0201c;deliverable&#x0201d; to biologists is an easy to follow 3D <italic>in virtuo</italic> model which explains how TGF-&#x003b2;1 acts in wound healing in a highly coordinated manner to inhibit cell proliferation and stimulate cell migration. Further the model can now be used to investigate hypotheses behind chronic wound healing and scarring or to predict the number of keratinocytes with colony forming ability required to heal extensive skin wounds. At the sub-cellular level, the model can be employed for example to improve our understanding of how to deliver TGF-&#x003b2;1 to achieve better wound healing. The model can also be modified to explore questions about the application of other growth factors which biologists currently try to answer at an empirical level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008515.s001"><label>Movie S1</label><caption><p>The integrated model is used to illustrate the healing process of a large wound.</p><p>(7.38 MB WMV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0008515.s001.wmv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This work is part of the Epitheliome Project, which is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through two grants: one to the University of Sheffield (GR/S62321/01), and the other to the University of York (GR/S62338/01).
