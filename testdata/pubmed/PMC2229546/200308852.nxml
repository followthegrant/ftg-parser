The toxin consists of three domains, with the carboxy-terminal domain (C-domain) responsible for channel formation. The C-domain contributes four membrane-spanning segments and a 68-residue translocated segment to the open channel, whereas the upstream domains and the amino-terminal end of the C-domain stay on the cis side of the membrane. The isolated C-domain, lacking the two upstream domains, also forms channels; however, the amino terminus and one of the normally membrane-spanning segments can move across the membrane. (This can be observed as a drop in single-channel conductance.) In longer carboxy-terminal fragments of colicin Ia that include &#x02264;169 residues upstream from the C-domain, the entire upstream region is translocated. Presumably, a portion of the C-domain creates a pathway for the polar upstream region to move through the membrane. To determine the size of this translocation pathway, we have attached &#x0201c;molecular stoppers,&#x0201d; small disulfide-bonded polypeptides, to the amino terminus of the C-domain, and determined whether they could be translocated. We have found that the translocation rate is strongly voltage dependent, and that at voltages &#x02265;90 mV, even a 26-&#x000c5; stopper is translocated. Upon reduction of their disulfide bonds, all of the stoppers are easily translocated, indicating that it is the folded structure, rather than some aspect of the primary sequence, that slows translocation of the stoppers. Thus, the pathway for translocation is &#x02265;26 &#x000c5; in diameter, or can stretch to this value. This is large enough for an &#x003b1;-helical hairpin to fit through.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>&#x003b1;-conotoxin</kwd><kwd>apamin</kwd><kwd>charybdotoxin</kwd><kwd>disulfides</kwd><kwd>molecular stoppers</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>R.O.

The protein consists of three domains (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Wiener et al., 1997</xref>), with the 10&#x02013;&#x003b1;-helix colicin Ia carboxy-terminal domain (C-domain)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> (residues 451&#x02013;626) forming the lethal channel. (For a general review of channel-forming colicins and colicin Ia in particular, see <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Jakes et al., 1999</xref>). Channel formation by whole colicin Ia can be conceptually divided into two steps: (1) voltage-independent insertion of the hydrophobic hairpin formed by helices 8 and 9 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 1997</xref>) and (2) voltage-dependent insertion of portions of helix 1 and helices 6&#x02013;7 (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 1996</xref>). Associated with the voltage-dependent step is the translocation across the membrane of &#x0223c;68 residues corresponding to helices 2&#x02013;5 (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 1996</xref>). The open channel formed by whole colicin Ia thus consists of four membrane-spanning segments,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">1</xref> with the upstream T and R domains remaining on the cis side (the side to which the colicin was added) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>F<sc>igure</sc> 1. </label><caption><p>Comparison of single channels formed by whole colicin Ia and its carboxy-terminal domain (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>). (A) A whole colicin Ia channel opened at +50 mV with its characteristic, relatively high conductance (39 pS) and, as is typical at this voltage, stayed at this level. (B) A C-domain channel (residues 438&#x02013;626) opened at +50 mV with a comparable conductance (44 pS), but then dropped to a state of smaller conductance (7 pS). (C) Schematic model of the whole colicin Ia channel in its open state, with four membrane-spanning segments. The 10 &#x003b1;-helices of the C-domain are designated H1&#x02013;H10; T/R represents the upstream T and R domains. The part of H1 spanning the membrane is roughly from residues 451&#x02013;467. (D) Model of the C-domain channel in its transient, higher conductance state, also with four membrane-spanning segments. (E) Model of the C-domain channel in its small-conductance open state, with only three membrane-spanning segments, and helix H1 translocated across the membrane. The white bar in A indicates the open channel state that is diagrammed in C. In B, the black bar indicates when the channel is in the transient open state of D, and the gray bar indicates when it is in the small-conductance open state of E. The zero-current level in A and B is labeled 0 pA. There are two small-conductance channels already open at the beginning of the record in B. The solution on both sides of the membrane for A and B was 1 M KCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM MES, pH 6.2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="200308852f1"/></fig><p>Channel formation by the isolated C-domain, or by carboxy-terminal fragments containing as many as 345 residues (residues 282&#x02013;626), is similar to channel formation by whole colicin, except that the portion of helix 1 (H1) that was in the membrane, and everything upstream from it, is also translocated across the membrane, resulting in a small-conductance channel having only three transmembrane segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E) (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>). On the way to this small-conductance state, the channel initially opens to a state of relatively normal conductance (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). We have good reason to believe (see <sc>results</sc>) that the initial normal-conductance channel corresponds to the channel with four transmembrane segments, like that formed by the whole colicin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, compare C with D). The transition to the small-conductance channel marks the passage of the fourth segment (H1) (and everything upstream of it) across the membrane, and thus the conversion to a channel with only three transmembrane segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E).</p><p>What is the nature of the translocation passageway that the colicin creates for the fourth segment to cross the membrane? We know that this passageway allows the movement through it of the very polar and highly charged sequences that make up the upstream parts of colicin Ia carboxy-terminal fragments (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that it provides a high-dielectric&#x02013;constant milieu, but how wide is it? We previously showed that if the amino terminus of the C-domain is biotinylated and then preincubated with streptavidin, the resulting channels open to the normal-conductance state and remain there, failing to drop to the small-conductance state typical of C-domain channels (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>). Presumably, streptavidin holds the amino terminus on the cis side and prevents its translocation across the membrane. Thus, we know from these earlier experiments that the translocation pathway for the amino terminus is not wide enough to accommodate the 61-&#x000c5;-diameter streptavidin tetramer. Does the peptide chain have to unfold to fit through it, or can its secondary structure, and even its tertiary structure, be preserved during its passage? To address these questions, we attached a series of molecular &#x0201c;stoppers&#x0201d; to the amino terminus of the C-domain and determined how large a stopper could still cross the membrane. The stoppers consisted of peptides locked into a more or less fixed conformation by one or more disulfide bonds (see <sc>materials</sc>
<sc>and</sc>
<sc>methods</sc>). We reasoned that if the channel passed from the normal-conductance to the small-conductance state (as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), then the stopper had passed through, whereas if it remained in the normal-conductance state (as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A), the stopper was too large to pass through. Using this approach we determined that the passageway can be at least 26 &#x000c5; wide at its narrowest point.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of the Stoppers</title><p>Four separate molecular stopper constructs were prepared, all with the stopper attached near the amino-terminal end of the colicin Ia carboxy-terminal fragment 438&#x02013;626 (called CT-M in <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>). pKSJ155 has residues 438&#x02013;626 of colicin Ia inserted downstream of the 6 histidine tag (His<sub>6</sub>-tag) sequence in the Novagen vector pET-15b.

Cultures of 400&#x02013;500 ml were grown and the proteins were purified on His-Bind (Novagen) nickel affinity columns, as described previously (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>).

The thrombin/protein ratio was 1:1,000 by weight. The reaction was stopped with 1 mM PMSF. In one set of experiments with peptide U (see RESULTS), the His<sub>6</sub>-tag was not removed.</p><p>CTX, with 37 amino acids, has the sequence H-PyrPheThrAsnValSerCys7ThrThrSerLysGluCys13TrpSerValCys17GlnArgLeu-HisAsn-ThrSerArgGlyLysCys<sub>28</sub>MetAsnLysLysCys<sub>33</sub>ArgCys<sub>35</sub>Tyr-Ser, with three disulfide bonds, between cysteine residues 7&#x02013;28, 13&#x02013;33, and 17&#x02013;35 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bontems et al., 1992</xref>). CTX was genetically modified and chemically attached to colicin Ia residue 439, which had been mutated from glutamic acid to cysteine in pKSJ155, to yield pKSJ156 (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>), as follows. Three of the four lysines of CTX were mutated (K11Q/K31R/K32R) to generate a toxin bearing a single amino group (K27). Mutation, expression, amino-terminal pyroglutamate (Pyr) blocking, and purification of this toxin were as previously reported (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Stampe et al., 1994</xref>). N-succinimidyl 3-maleimidopropionate (SMP) was synthesized as described (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen and Buchardt, 1991</xref>) and was used to introduce maleimide functionality to the toxin via chemical modification of K27. Specifically, 2 ml of a solution containing 1.7 mM SMP in acetonitrile were added to a 10-ml solution containing 50 &#x003bc;M CTX and 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The resultant solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged under reduced pressure for &#x0223c;3 min to decrease the acetonitrile concentration to 5&#x02013;10%. The maleimido-CTX was purified using a C18 column (YMC, Inc.) with a linear, water&#x02013;acetonitrile gradient (Waters HPLC system, Waters Corp.), and assayed on a Mariner electrospray/TOF mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems/Perkin Elmer). Eluates from several preparative HPLC runs were pooled, evaporated under reduced pressure to a final volume of &#x0223c;5 ml, and adjusted to pH 7.2 via the addition of sodium phosphate to a concentration of 25 mM. The sample was frozen and lyophilized to a volume of &#x0223c;0.5 ml, and the volume was then increased to 1.8 ml by the addition of sodium phosphate buffer. The composition of this final solution was 150 &#x003bc;M maleimido-CTX in 150 mM sodium phosphate buffer. Purified material was &#x0003e;95% pure as judged by reinjection on an analytic C18 column while monitoring absorbance at 280 nm.</p><p>The His<sub>6</sub>-tag was removed from E439C colicin Ia C-domain protein by digestion with thrombin, using the same conditions as described above, except that the thrombin/protein ratio was 1:2,000 by weight. After the reaction was stopped with PMSF, the protein was reduced by adding 1 M DTT to a final concentration of 20 mM and incubating 1 h at room temperature. DTT was removed by dialysis, first against degassed 10 mM MES, pH 6.0, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) (Pierce Chemical Co.), and then against the same degassed buffer without EDTA. The reduced, dialyzed protein was transferred to argon-filled tubes and stored under argon at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. 7.5 &#x003bc;g of this protein in 3 &#x003bc;l (3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> moles) was added to 37 &#x003bc;l of maleimido-CTX (5.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> moles) in 150 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, an &#x0223c;18-fold excess of the CTX over colicin peptide. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 30&#x000b0;C and then stopped by addition of excess &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol. Approximately 80&#x02013;90% of the colicin peptide was judged to have reacted with the maleimido-CTX by analysis on a 15% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Wild-type colicin Ia C-domain was treated with thrombin, reduced, dialyzed, and reacted with maleimido-CTX in exactly the same way as the E439C mutant, as a control for nonspecific reaction of the maleimido-CTX with residues other than cysteine. There was no apparent reaction of the wild-type C-domain peptide with the reagent. The CTX moiety attached to colicin (CTX&#x02013;C-domain) was unfolded by adding 1/25 volume of 1.5 M Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, to raise the pH to &#x0223c;8.0, and making the protein solution 10 mM in DTT. The protein was then heated at 70&#x000b0;C for 10 min and quenched on ice (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Naini et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of Stopper Folding</title><p>The proteins containing the three smaller stoppers had a tendency to dimerize or multimerize via their multiple cysteine sulfhydryl groups. Keeping the proteins at concentrations below &#x0223c;1 mg/ml throughout the purification procedure reduced the ratio of multimers to monomers. We were also concerned that there might be improperly folded stoppers that had a free cysteine. To assay for free cysteines, the proteins were reacted with <italic>N-</italic>[6&#x02032;-(biotinamido) hexyl]-3&#x02032;-(2&#x02032;-pyridyldithio) propionamide (biotin-HPDP) (Pierce Chemical Co.) without prior reduction (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 1996</xref>). Any free cysteines were thus biotinylated, and could be detected by a gel-shift assay with streptavidin (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 1994</xref>). Both the peptide U and &#x003b1;-conotoxin stoppers were judged to have measurable free cysteine by this method, &#x0223c;10% of peptide U and nearly 50% of &#x003b1;-conotoxin (unpublished data). The biotinylated protein was then removed from the preparation by chromatography on monomeric avidin, as described previously (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 1996</xref>). This procedure appeared to remove any protein that had a free cysteine that had reacted with biotin-HPDP, as measured by gel-shift by streptavidin (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 1994</xref>). The preparations still contained a small amount of dimers and higher multimers, as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of Streptavidin- and Avidin-bound C-domain</title><p>We prepared and purified streptavidin-bound C-domain as follows. The mutant E439C of C-domain (residues 438&#x02013;626) was biotinylated and had its His<sub>6</sub>-tag removed as previously described (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>); 15 &#x003bc;g of this protein was incubated with 800 &#x003bc;g of streptavidin (an 18-fold molar excess of streptavidin tetramer) at room temperature for 15 min in a total volume of 120 &#x003bc;l. The mixture was centrifuged to remove any particulates, applied to a BioSil 250 sizing column (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and eluted in 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The absorbance at 280 nm was monitored. Three peaks were seen: first a small peak containing streptavidin-bound C-domain, then a large streptavidin peak, and finally a small peak containing unbound C-domain. The first two peaks were also observed with streptavidin alone; apparently the commercial streptavidin contains some high molecular weight material that happens to run together with the streptavidin-bound C-domain.</p><p>The purification of avidin-bound C-domain was similar, except that avidin was incubated with biotinylated C-domain for 60 min. Avidin alone had only one broad peak. No peak was visible for avidin-bound C-domain, so we used a fraction from the leading edge of the avidin peak.</p></sec><sec><title>Estimation of Stopper Diameters</title><p>Three-dimensional structures of peptide U (with its two cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond) were calculated by T.

The structures of the streptavidin tetramer bound to two or four biotin molecules were from files 1SWD and 1SWE, respectively (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Freitag et al., 1997</xref>).

For instance, allowing the projecting Arg and Lys side chains to bend out of the way might reduce the CTX diameter by a few angstroms. However, the reason we chose to use stoppers with a disulfide-bonded core was that we expected their dimensions would be reasonably well defined. This expectation was supported by inspection of the available structures. The standard deviation of the minimal diameter was less than or equal to 1.0 &#x000c5; for the calculated peptide U structures, the apamin and CTX NMR structures, and the two streptavidin crystal structures. This was also true for the structures in each of the &#x003b1;-conotoxin files; however, the mean diameter varied by up to 3.2 &#x000c5; among these files.

The membrane separated two 1-ml compartments, each containing a solution of 100 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM MES, pH 6.2. For single-channel experiments, 1 M KCl was used. The voltage-clamp recording setup was as described previously (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>). Voltages are given as the potential of the cis compartment, defined as the side to which colicin Ia C-domain was added, with respect to that of the opposite trans compartment. Streptavidin and avidin were obtained from Calbiochem. The antibody to the His<sub>6</sub>-tag was mouse Penta-His mAb (QIAGEN), mouse anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-galactosidase mAb was from Promega, rabbit anti-CTX polyclonal antibody was from Alomone Labs, and rabbit anti-HA.11 polyclonal antibody was from Covance.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Normal-State Dwell Times</title><p>C-domain channels initially open to a state of &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; conductance (like that of whole colicin Ia); they may subsequently make an abrupt transition to a small-conductance open state (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B). This transition is closely associated with the translocation of the amino terminus of the C-domain across the membrane to the trans side (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E). Thus, the dwell time in the normal state contains information about how readily the amino-terminal end is translocated. As we shall see, similar conductance transitions can be observed in channels formed by C-domain with an amino-terminal stopper peptide. In this case, the dwell time in the normal state reflects the rate of stopper translocation.</p><p>We show the distribution of normal-state dwell times in a survival plot, in which the ordinate is the percentage of events observed with a dwell time greater than the time <italic>t</italic> plotted on the abscissa. For example, if four channels made transitions in times <italic>t</italic>

The small-conductance channel can be returned to the original closed state by negative voltages (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>); thus, we could make several measurements of the normal-state dwell time from an individual channel. In general, however, each survival plot contains lifetimes of several different channels, each measured multiple times.</p><p>If all the channels are identical and the normal state is a single Markov state, then the normal-state lifetimes should be distributed as a single decaying exponential. In reality, a single exponential function is generally inadequate to fit the survival plots for C-domain with or without a stopper (see below). Thus, we usually fit the survival plots using a sum of two exponential components: <italic>A</italic> exp(&#x02212;<italic>t</italic>/&#x003c4;<sub>1</sub>) + (100% &#x02212; <italic>A</italic>) exp(&#x02212;<italic>t</italic>/&#x003c4;<sub>2</sub>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Validity of the Translocation Assay</title><p>The conclusions regarding the translocation pathway that are derived from the results to follow rest on the evidence that the transition of C-domain channels from a normal-conductance state (similar to that of channels formed by whole colicin Ia) to a small-conductance state (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B) represents the translocation of the amino terminus from the cis to the trans side of the membrane, and thus the conversion from a channel with four transmembrane segments to one with only three (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). It is therefore appropriate, before proceeding, to review this evidence. We have shown previously that in channels formed by whole colicin Ia, the amino-terminal region is on the cis side of the membrane, and that there are four membrane-spanning segments, with the most upstream segment formed by part of helix 1 (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 1996</xref>). In channels formed by the isolated C-domain, on the other hand, the amino terminus ends up on the trans side, leaving only three membrane-spanning segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E) (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>). Initially the C-domain channel opens to a conductance similar to that of the whole colicin Ia channel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B), consistent with its having four membrane-spanning segments. It drops to a conductance that is the same as that generated in whole colicin Ia channels when trypsin added on the trans side of the membrane cleaves the colicin in the loop between helices 2 and 3, thereby leaving only three membrane-spanning segments (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>All of this is consistent with the transition from the normal to the small conductance level being a consequence of the movement of the membrane-spanning portion of helix 1, along with its amino terminus, across the membrane to the trans side. Confirming this interpretation is the fact that when the amino terminus of the C-domain is held on the cis side of the membrane by streptavidin, the transition to the small conductance level does not occur; i.e., when the upstream membrane-spanning segment formed by part of helix 1 cannot move across the membrane, the conductance stays at the higher level (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>). These observations convinced us that, for a C-domain protein with a stopper appended to its amino terminus, the presence or absence of transitions from a normal to small channel conductance state would provide a way of knowing whether the stopper had traversed the membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Direct Demonstration of Stopper Translocation</title><p>With two of the stoppers, peptide U and CTX, we directly demonstrated, without having to rely on our interpretation of the conductance transitions, that they could be translocated across the membrane. In experiments with the peptide U stopper, we found that the amino terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag (which had not been removed for these experiments) was accessible to anti&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>-tag antibody in the trans compartment. Thus, although channels formed by this construct showed the normal gating pattern of turning on at positive voltages and off at negative voltages, a new conductance pattern developed when mouse anti&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>-tag mAb was added to the trans compartment, in which there was a rise in conductance at negative voltages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) . (This was observed in <italic>n</italic> = 3 separate experiments.) The reason why channels formed by the isolated C-domain appear to reverse orientation when bound by trans anti&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>-tag antibody or trans streptavidin (if they are biotinylated near the amino terminus) is not clear, but it is a phenomenon we have reported previously for several C-domain constructs (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>). Whatever the mechanism, the important point in this instance is that the amino terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag, along with the peptide U stopper, has been translocated across the membrane. In control experiments, mouse anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-galactosidase mAb added to the trans compartment did not affect channel gating.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>F<sc>igure</sc> 3. </label><caption><p>The effect of trans anti&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>-tag antibody on channels formed by C-domain with a peptide U stopper and an amino-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag.

It appears that large voltages are required for the translocation of the CTX stopper.

Seven channels were each held at +110 mV for over an hour without making any transitions to the small-conductance state (unpublished data) (<italic>n</italic> = 5). (At +120 mV, the channels began to slowly inactivate&#x02014;that is, to enter a completely closed state&#x02014;so we were unable to use larger voltages.) Results with avidin-bound C-domain were similar, but were more difficult to analyze due to a slow &#x0201c;blocking&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;unblocking&#x0201d; of the channels (<italic>n</italic> = 5). So, at least at voltages up to +110 mV, the 61-&#x000c5;-diameter streptavidin and avidin stoppers cannot be translocated.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Unfolding the Stoppers</title><p>The validity of the above results, and hence the conclusion about pathway width drawn from them, is predicated on two assumptions: (1) that these stoppers, which we claim traverse the membrane, are internally disulfide bonded and therefore have the conformations depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>; and (2) that the slower rates (at a given voltage) at which the large diameter stoppers (CTX and apamin) traverse the amino-terminal translocation pathway are a consequence of steric constraints, rather than being due to some property intrinsic to their sequences, such as their numerous positive charges. The following results address these issues.</p><p>We have removed any detectable C-domain molecules having free &#x02013;SH groups in their stoppers (<sc>materials</sc>

Presumably, therefore, the molecules that we tested on the bilayers all had the internal disulfide bonds formed in their stoppers, with the exception of minor contamination from dimers and higher multimers. As confirmation of both this and the validity of our entire approach, we found that when these disulfide bonds were reduced, thereby unfolding the stoppers, it became easier for them to traverse the pathway, as evidenced by the shortening of dwell times in the normal-conductance state. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> shows an example of this. Several minutes after the addition of the disulfide-reducing agent TCEP, the transition rate from the normal-conductance to the small-conductance state of C-domain channels with the amino-terminal peptide U stopper significantly increased (<italic>n</italic> = 4). The effect of reduction was particularly pronounced on C-domain channels having the amino-terminal apamin stopper (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) , which has two disulfide bonds (<italic>n</italic> = 6). Prior to TCEP addition, the dwell times in the open state at +70 mV were of the order of minutes, whereas following reduction they were merely several seconds or shorter.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>F<sc>igure</sc> 8. </label><caption><p>Comparison of translocation rates of peptide U stopper attached to C-domain before and after disulfide bond reduction. Each record shows many channels (&#x0223c;20), which opened at +70 mV with normal conductance and then dropped to the small-conductance state. Records with most of the channels opening at the beginning of the voltage pulse were selected, so that the rate of transition to the small-conductance state is reflected in the decay of the current. (A) Channels formed by unreduced peptide U&#x02013;C-domain dwelled in the normal-conductance state for a relatively long time (&#x003c4; &#x0223c;200 s) before making the transition to the small-conductance state. (B) Later in the same experiment, after TCEP was added to reduce the disulfide bond in peptide U, channels made their transitions much more quickly (&#x003c4; &#x0223c;30 s). This demonstrates that the cysteines in the stoppers of the channels making transitions in A were in fact disulfide bonded. The concentration of TCEP was 9 mM on the cis side and 5 mM on the trans side. The transition rate increased markedly within a few minutes of TCEP addition; trace B happens to begin 25 min after TCEP was added. Channels in the small-conductance state could be closed by a brief pulse to &#x02212;200 mV (not shown), after which they were ready to reopen through the normal-conductance state in response to a subsequent positive voltage pulse.

We attached a series of small peptides, held in a fixed conformation by one or more disulfide bonds, very near the amino-terminus of the colicin Ia channel-forming (C) domain, and found that all of these stoppers, whose minimal diameters ranged from 12 to 26 &#x000c5; (see <sc>materials</sc>
<sc>and</sc>
<sc>methods</sc>), crossed the membrane. There was a strong voltage dependence to their translocation, such that at +40 to +70 mV, the larger stoppers crossed slowly, if at all; at +90 to +110 mV they crossed readily (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). That the size of the stoppers was the relevant parameter governing their relative rates of translocation in our experiments (rather than some other factors, such as charge or specific amino acid composition) was illustrated by the much greater translocation rates after their unfolding by disulfide bond reduction (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). The translocation pathway is thus large enough to allow the passage of an &#x003b1;-helix, or even a pair of &#x003b1;-helices packed together side by side. In our earlier experiments with carboxy-terminal fragments of colicin Ia (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>), it is therefore likely that all of helix 1 (residues 359&#x02013;467) was translocated as an &#x003b1;-helix. The R domain (residues 282&#x02013;385) has a larger cross-section than CTX, however (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Wiener et al., 1997</xref>), so it must have been at least partially unfolded in those experiments in which it moved across the membrane at voltages up to +70 mV.</p><p>A possible concern about the sizes we have assigned to the stoppers is that they may not be folded in the configurations shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Although we are reasonably confident that we have removed stoppers with free sulfhydryls (see <sc>materials</sc>
<sc>and</sc>
<sc>methods</sc>), it is possible that the pairing of the cysteines is different from that in the native structures. The stoppers that were inserted genetically also have their ends constrained by the rest of the molecule into which they were inserted, and therefore may not fold as the free stopper peptides do. This is obviously not a concern for peptide U, which has only two cysteines. Nor is it a concern for the recombinant, bacterially expressed CTX. Although it has six cysteines, it has been shown to fold into its native conformation and block potassium channels in the same way as the native scorpion toxin (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 1991</xref>). It is conceivable that the &#x003b1;-conotoxin and apamin stoppers, each of which has four cysteines, could have formed nonnative disulfide bonds, in which case the stopper diameters would be somewhat different from those given. However, at least for apamin, it appears that rather drastic alterations in the peptide sequence are required to change the disulfide pairing (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Volkman and Wemmer, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In our description of the C-domain with its stoppers, we have implied that the stoppers are located exactly at the amino terminus. This is not precisely correct. After removal of the amino-terminal histidine tags from the expressed constructs, there remain five (in the case of peptide U) or six (in the case of &#x003b1;-conotoxin and apamin) residues amino-terminal to the stoppers. Depending on the details of the stopper structures (i.e., on the proximity of the amino and carboxy termini), this short extension may lie next to the stopper during translocation, in which case the effective diameter of the stopper would be somewhat larger. The situation is even more complicated with the CTX stopper, which was not inserted genetically into the C-domain construct, but rather was chemically linked to residue 439 of the colicin Ia C-domain (see <sc>materials</sc>
<sc>and</sc>
<sc>methods</sc>). Thus, CTX is attached via a linker near its own middle to a residue six positions from the amino terminus of the C-domain. Unfolding CTX by reducing its disulfide bonds therefore yields a structure with considerable branching near its amino terminus. Nevertheless, the translocation pathway is able to accommodate its passage.</p><p>The distribution of dwell times of the channel at the normal-conductance level (in the state with four membrane-spanning segments) before undergoing a transition to the small-conductance level (the state with three membrane-spanning segments) is fit by two (conceivably more) exponentials (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), implying that the channel has at least two normal-conductance open states. This is seen for each of the stoppers and also for the carboxy-terminal fragment 438&#x02013;626, which lacks a stopper (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). It is our impression that a given channel has only one normal-conductance open state&#x02014;it either always has a short dwell time distribution or always has a long dwell time distribution&#x02014;so that the two exponentials reflect two different channel populations. Since we are dealing with one particular protein (for a given stopper), this is somewhat surprising. One possibility is that a given molecule associated with the bilayer can be locked into two or more particular configurations that are not readily interconvertible. For instance, different colicin molecules might have the proline at residue 566 (the only proline residue in the C-domain) in either the cis or the trans isomer, with the resulting channels having different conformations. Further work is required to clarify this issue.</p><sec><title>Voltage Dependence of Translocation Rate</title><p>A striking characteristic of the stopper translocation kinetics we measured is their strong voltage dependence&#x02014;the larger the positive voltage, the more rapid the translocation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The mechanism of this voltage dependence is not clear. Given the positive charge of the conotoxin, apamin, and CTX stoppers, an obvious explanation is a simple electrophoretic effect. This cannot explain, however, the same sort of voltage dependence seen with the peptide U stopper, which carries a negative charge. A possible mechanism is that the applied electric field is acting directly on the translocation pathway and affecting its size. Thus, the diameter of this pathway may not be fixed, but rather may be a function of the applied transmembrane potential. Such an effect of potential is seen on the size of lipid pores (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abidor et al., 1979</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chernomordik et al., 1983</xref>). A feature of this type of mechanism is that large voltages of either sign should increase the pore diameter and, in our case, increase the translocation rate. (Because the normal-conductance channels rapidly turn off at negative voltages, this aspect of the mechanism is difficult to test. We are presently attempting to design experiments that get around this problem.) There is also evidence for protein translocation pores with a variable diameter in the endoplasmic reticulum translocon (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hamman et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>) and the mitochondrial inner membrane (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz and Matouschek, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with Other Protein Translocation Pathways</title><p>The sizes of various conducting channels have been estimated in countless studies, dating to antiquity (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hille, 1971</xref>); some of these channels are permeable to large molecules, such as polyethylene glycols and single-stranded nucleic acids (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bezrukov, 2000</xref>). In what follows, however, we shall restrict our discussion to pores or other pathways whose function is to allow proteins to cross a membrane.</p><sec><title>Self-inserting translocators</title><p>Several bacterial protein toxins consist of a toxic enzymatic domain that is attached (usually covalently) to a domain that is responsible for translocating the enzyme across a lipid membrane into the cytosol of the target cell, where it exerts its toxic effect. In many cases, the translocation domain has been shown to form a conducting channel, raising the possibility that the enzyme might be translocated through the channel.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">2</xref> For both diphtheria toxin (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al., 1999</xref>) and botulinum neurotoxin (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Koriazova and Montal, 2003</xref>), no additional proteins are required for translocation across planar lipid bilayers. Interestingly, the membrane topology of the diphtheria toxin channel is similar to that of the colicin Ia C-domain small channel (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kienker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Senzel et al., 2000</xref>). Anthrax toxin also makes a channel and translocates two separate enzymes; there is indirect evidence from planar bilayer experiments that they may be translocated through the conducting channel (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Finkelstein, 1994</xref>). Most likely, the enzymatic domains of these toxins are translocated in an unfolded conformation (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Wesche et al., 1998</xref>), so that the sizes of their translocation pathways are not clear.</p><p>Other translocation domains may transport their passenger domains in a folded conformation. The bacterial autotransporters constitute one class of such proteins, in which one domain is thought to export another domain across the bacterial outer membrane by forming a &#x003b2;-barrel pore through which the passenger domain passes (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Henderson et al., 1998</xref>). One example is the IgA protease of <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, whose pore domain is capable of exporting an attached passenger protein containing two disulfide bonds. As we have shown here for colicin Ia C-domain, the passenger protein was translocated more readily in its reduced state, but there was, nevertheless, significant transport of the unreduced, folded protein (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Veiga et al., 1999</xref>). Another autotransporter, Antigen 43 of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, can export a separate passenger protein containing a disulfide bond (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kj&#x000e6;rgaard et al., 2002</xref>). Streptolysin O belongs to another class of bacterial proteins that form conducting channels. It seems that its main function is to translocate the enzyme NAD-glycohydrolase across eukaryotic cell membranes (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Madden et al., 2001</xref>). If the large (300-&#x000c5;) pores visualized by electron microscopy (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Palmer et al., 1998</xref>) represent the functional channel, then the 52-kD enzyme could easily be translocated as a folded protein. Finally, the bacteriophage &#x003bb; holin protein forms a pore in the inner membrane of the target bacterium that allows the passage of an endolysin protein. The purified holin is sufficient to cause calcein release from liposomes (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1998</xref>). In vivo, endolysin fused to &#x003b2;-galactosidase can still pass through the holin pore; it was argued that the &#x003b2;-galactosidase portion was translocated as a folded tetramer of 480 kD (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>For most, if not all, of these proteins, the detailed mechanisms of protein translocation have not yet been elucidated; thus, it remains to be seen whether any of them (with the possible exception of diphtheria toxin) operates by a mechanism similar to that of colicin Ia.</p></sec><sec><title>Endogenous translocation pathways</title><p>There have been many studies of protein translocation across eukaryotic intracellular and bacterial membranes (for review see <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Schnell and Hebert, 2003</xref>). Probably the most extensive studies on the size of a translocation pore have been on the protein import channel of the mitochondrial outer membrane. It has been shown that branched polypeptides (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Vestweber and Schatz, 1988b</xref>) and a protein loop (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Wiedemann et al., 2001</xref>) can be imported into mitochondria. A gold cluster 20 &#x000c5; in diameter can also be imported, whereas a 26-&#x000c5; cluster cannot (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz and Matouschek, 1999</xref>). Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, which contains three disulfide bonds, is not imported (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Vestweber and Schatz, 1988a</xref>); its minimal diameter is &#x0223c;30 &#x000c5;. Furthermore, the import of dihydrofolate reductase (&#x0223c;40&#x02013;50 &#x000c5;) is blocked when its folded state is stabilized by the binding of methotrexate (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Eilers and Schatz, 1986</xref>). Thus, proteins can pass through the outer membrane as an extended strand or as a hairpin, but folded proteins are not normally imported (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Another well-characterized pore is the translocon of the endoplasmic reticulum. Its diameter has been estimated to be 40&#x02013;60 &#x000c5; when the ribosome is bound (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hamman et al., 1997</xref>) and 9&#x02013;15 &#x000c5; in the ribosome-free state (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hamman et al., 1998</xref>). Despite the large diameter of the ribosome-bound pore, it appears that nascent secretory proteins traverse the membrane in an extended, &#x003b1;-helical form (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Plath et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>There are also pores in cell membranes that translocate folded proteins such as those we have used in this study (and even larger proteins). Proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum can be transported back to the cytosol, a process termed dislocation. It has been shown that folded dihydrofolate reductase can be dislocated, indicating that the translocation pathway has a diameter of at least 40 &#x000c5; (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Tirosh et al., 2003</xref>). The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) system of bacteria apparently functions principally to move proteins that bind cofactors, and thus must fold in the cytoplasm, across the inner bacterial membrane. The Tat apparatus can translocate proteins as large as the formate dehydrogenase-N GH subcomplex, indicating a diameter of at least 60&#x02013;70 &#x000c5;. (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Berks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Palmer and Berks, 2003</xref>). However, unlike colicin Ia, diphtheria toxin, and botulinum neurotoxin, which are believed to be monomeric, these translocation pores are large, multimeric complexes. Thus, their structures are unlikely to explain how the colicin translocates protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>On the Structure of the Translocation Pathway</title><p>The translocation pathway followed by the amino-terminal stoppers is probably not identical to the ion-conducting channel. The diameter of the conducting channel has been estimated in two ways: by the size of ions that can pass through the narrowest part of the channel and by the size of nonelectrolytes that can fit into some part of the channel. No upper limit has been determined from the ion permeation experiments, but a lower limit of 8&#x02013;9 &#x000c5; has been established for colicins E1, A, and Ib (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Raymond et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bullock et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bullock and Kolen, 1995</xref>), and 7&#x02013;8 &#x000c5; for colicin Ia, based on its permeability to bis-tris propane and tetraethyl ammonium (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Jakes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Slatin and Kienker, 2003</xref>). From the experiments using nonelectrolytes, it was concluded that the cis and trans entrances of the colicin Ia channel are &#x0223c;18 and 10 &#x000c5; in diameter, respectively, with a 7-&#x000c5; constriction in between (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Krasilnikov et al., 1998</xref>). It is hard to see how any of our stopper peptides (12&#x02013;26 &#x000c5;) could fit through such a pore. Alternatively, one might expect that a stopper would follow C-domain helix 1, to which it is attached, through the membrane; that is, the space normally occupied by helix 1 would serve as the translocation pathway. Conceivably, the smaller stoppers (12&#x02013;15 &#x000c5;) could fit through such a pathway, although they would presumably be exposed to lipid. By combining the helix 1 space with the conducting channel, we might get a large enough pathway for apamin (19 &#x000c5;) to pass through the membrane. But even this combined pathway is apparently much too small to allow the CTX stopper (26 &#x000c5;) to be translocated, unless the diameter of the conducting channel has been substantially underestimated.</p><p>We have not addressed the question of what kind of structure of three transmembrane segments, formed from &#x0223c;85 amino acid residues, could mediate the translocation of a passenger as large as the 26-&#x000c5; CTX. This question is made more problematic by the fact that the colicin channel appears to be a monomer, based on the linear dependence of channel formation on colicin concentration, as well as on the colicin's monomeric state in aqueous solution above pH 4. (See <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cavard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Levinthal et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Mel and Stroud, 1993</xref>; and references therein.) A similar problem exists in the case of the diphtheria toxin T-domain, whose channels appear to be monomeric based on the number of site-specific chemical reactions (one) observed on single channels and on the absence of hybrid channels formed from mixtures of mutant T-domains with distinct gating properties, as discussed by <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gordon and Finkelstein (2001)</xref>. Thus, the only real evidence for a multimeric channel is common sense: how could such a small amount of protein possibly make such a large channel? Although we have no model for the channel structure, it is not unlikely that lipid is involved in the translocation pathway (and in the conducting channel, for that matter).</p><p>There is experimental evidence of interaction of both secretory proteins and integral membrane proteins with lipids adjacent to the proteinaceous translocon pore (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Martoglio et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Mothes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Plath et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Heinrich et al., 2000</xref>). Since these studies also found interaction of the signal sequences of these proteins with the Sec61 protein, the pathway for protein export in eukaryotes appears to involve both protein and lipid.</p><p>It has been reported that a number of &#x0201c;protein transduction domains&#x0201d; are internalized by cells, without the involvement of receptors, transporters, or endocytosis, and that attached proteins and other objects are also carried across the membrane. These domains include relatively short, very basic sequences from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Antennapedia transcription factor, the HIV-1 TAT protein (not to be confused with the bacterial Tat pathway discussed above) and herpes simplex virus-1 DNA-binding protein VP22 (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Schwarze et al., 2000</xref>). It was hypothesized that the Antennapedia domain may translocate itself and an attached passenger by inducing the formation of an inverted micelle in the membrane (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Derossi et al., 1996</xref>), and likewise for the HIV TAT domain (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Viv&#x000e8;s et al., 1997</xref>). It is tempting to consider this as a model for translocation of stoppers by the colicin C-domain. However, evidence in favor of the translocation of fluorescently-labeled Antennapedia domain in pure lipid bilayers (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Thor&#x000e9;n et al., 2000</xref>) has been balanced by contrary evidence (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Drin et al., 2001a</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). It has also been reported that labeled HIV TAT domain does not translocate into liposomes (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kr&#x000e4;mer and Wunderli-Allenspach, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, there has recently been some discussion as to whether the HIV TAT and VP22 domains are truly able to efficiently carry cargo across cell membranes (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Falnes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lundberg and Johansson, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Leifert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Richard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kr&#x000e4;mer and Wunderli-Allenspach, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Other models for a transmembrane pore lined by protein and lipid have been proposed (for review see <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert, 2002</xref>). Streptolysin O, whose role as a translocation pore was discussed above, has been reported to form large circular pores lined by oligomerized protein in erythrocyte membranes, as visualized by electron microscopy. Mixing of native streptolysin O with a modified, oligomerization-deficient mutant resulted in hybrid oligomers that formed pore structures partially lined by an arc of protein, with the remainder apparently lined by a straight boundary of lipid (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Palmer et al., 1998</xref>). Presumably, the lipid head groups face into the pore. As evidence for the functional relevance of these structures, the hybrid pores appeared to have a smaller size cutoff for permeant solutes than the native pores. A somewhat different model comes from experimental and theoretical studies of antimicrobial peptides such as magainin, tachyplesin, and melittin (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Matsuzaki, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Baumgaertner, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Huang, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Zemel et al., 2003</xref>). In this picture, the insertion of the peptides into the membrane destabilizes the packing of the bilayer lipids, inducing them to form a toroidal structure, with the peptide monomers separated from one another by lipid. Similar principles may be at work in the induction by polypeptides of lipidic fusion pores (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Basa&#x000f1;ez, 2002</xref>). Perhaps the passageway that colicin Ia C-domain creates for its first transmembrane segment (helix 1) and the amino-terminal stoppers we have attached will turn out to have a similar architecture, with the difference that the membrane-spanning segments of the colicin are tethered together by the extramembrane segments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Tom Newman for modeling the peptide U structure, David Wemmer for providing the apamin coordinates, and Jessica Muoio for the BioSil chromatography.</p><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants GM29210 (A.
