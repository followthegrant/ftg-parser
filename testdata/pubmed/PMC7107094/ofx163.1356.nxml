However, specific treatment for HPeV3 infection is currently unavailable. The application of antisense technology, such as peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), to viral infection has opened a new era of therapeutics. The aim of this study is to develop PNAs inhibiting HPeV3 gene expression in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We designed four PNAs that target domains I, J (base and head of domain J structure), and K of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) region within the 5&#x02019; untranslated region of HPeV3. The IRES region is needed for the cap-independent translation. The PNAs were conjugated to cell-penetrating peptide (RXR)<sub>4</sub>XB (R = L-arginine, X = 6-aminohexanoic acid, B = &#x003b2;-alanine). LLC-MK2 cells were treated with 0.1&#x02013;10&#x000b5;M of each PNA or water-containing growth medium for 4h. The cells were then infected with HPeV3 at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for 1h. The infected cells were incubated for 7 days at 37&#x000ba;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA were measured by real-time PCR on days 0 and 7.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Without any treatment, an extracellular level of HPeV3 RNA increased to 8.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> copies/&#x000b5;L on day 7. When the cells were treated with 10&#x000b5;M of PNA targeting the domain I of IRES, an extracellular level of HPeV3 RNA was suppressed to 4.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> copies/&#x000b5;L (&#x02212;99%) on day 7. Using the same PNA with lower concentrations, 1 &#x000b5;M and 0.1 &#x000b5;M of the PNA suppressed 24% and 0% of extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA, respectively, which demonstrated the effect is dose-dependent. In contrast, 10&#x000b5;M of PNAs targeting domain J (base), J (head), and K suppressed 94%, 92%, and 20% of extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA, respectively, compared with control.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The PNA-(RXR)<sub>4</sub>XB targeting the domain I of IRES suppressed extracellular levels of HPeV3 RNA in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, PNA treatment may be a therapeutic candidate for HPeV3-infected patients. This novel therapy could target other HPeV genotypes given that the target sequence used in this study is identical to those of other clinically significant HPeVs.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Disclosures</title><p>
