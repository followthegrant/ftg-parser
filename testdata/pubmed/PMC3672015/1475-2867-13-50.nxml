Despite the advances in current therapeutic approaches such as surgery, hormone, radio- and chemotherapy, gastric cancer is still the second most common cause of death from cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, it is urgent to make clear the key mechanism of the apoptosis in gastric cancer as well as establishment of the appropriate blocking channels is important for the development of more effective therapies of gastric cancer.</p><p>Celastrol is a plant triterpene derived from the root of Thunder of God Vine and can resist various inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has been reported that celastrol plays important role in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of wide variety of human tumor cell types including multiple myeloma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, its mechanism is not well understood.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a small, non-coding RNA involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation by binding to a target site in the 3&#x02032;-UTR of target mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recent evidence has revealed that the change of miRNAs expression was associated with tumorigenesis, which indicated that miRNAs could act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. One of these microRNAs, miR-146a is down-regulated in gastric cancer, and induces apoptotic effects by inhibiting G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. When the expression of miR-146a was up-regulated in human gastric cancer, it was showed to induce cell apoptosis.</p><p>The transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B is activated in tumorgenic processes including gastric cancer and may be an important pharmacological target for this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B predominantly occurs via the release of the p50/p65 heterodimer from the inhibitor of &#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B) complex in the cytosol of the cells. When released from I&#x003ba;B, the p50/p65 heterodimer translocates to the cell nucleus and regulates downstream gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In recent years, more and more evidence indicates that celastrol can induce apoptosis of various tumors by inhibiting of NF-&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As a result, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether miR-146a regulating NF-&#x003ba;B activity is involved in apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells induced by celastrol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Celastrol repressed cell viability of gastric cancer cells and NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway</title><p>The inhibitory effects of celastrol on the growth of gastric cancer cells and normal gastric epithelial cells were evaluated using MTT assays.

Celastrol inhibited proliferation of BGC-823, SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells, but had little effect on GES-1 cells, indicating celastrol induces selective cytotoxicity in cells. This triterpene caused the down-regulation of phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B and nuclear P65 protein levels, and it inhibited transcriptional activity of NF-&#x003ba;B. Celastrol increased miR-146a expression in gastric cancer cells and overexpression of miR-146a can significantly decrease NF-&#x003ba;B activity. Further, it induced apoptosis of BGC-823, SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells, which can be reversed by down-regulation of miR-146a expression. We also found that celastrol inhibited NF-&#x003ba;B activity could also be restored by down-regulation of miR-146a expression.</p><p>Increasing evidence showed that celastrol can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through inhibition of NF-kB activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Activation of the classical pathway of NF-&#x003ba;B involves the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, leading to the release and translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our studies showed that in gastric cancer cells, celastrol was observed to decrease phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B and subsequent inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, exhibiting an anti-tumor potential. More important, the IC 50 value at 72 h after treatment was 0.989 &#x003bc;M for BGC-823 cells 0.798 &#x003bc;M for SGC-7901 cells and 1.98 &#x003bc;M for MGC-803 cells, but 8.16 &#x003bc;M for GES-1 cells. These results indicated that celastrol could play the role in killing gastric cancer cells without destruction to the normal cells, which is in agreement with the previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>To further clarify the mechanism involved in the inhibition of viability of gastric cancer cells, we investigated the effect of celastrol on the expression of miR-146a. Prior study indicated that miR-146a is down-regulated in gastric cancer tissue samples and cell lines and overexpression of miR-146a could induce apoptosis of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. As a result, miR-146a may be a promising target for treatment of gastric cancer. Interestingly, celastrol was observed to up regulate the expression of miR-146a in BGC-823, SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells but not in GES-1 cells, which indicated that miR-146a may be involved in growth inhibition induced by celastrol. This hypothesis was confirmed that inhibition of miR-146a expression can reverse the effect of celastrol on apoptosis and growth inhibition of cancer cells.</p><p>We also found that over-expression of miR-146a could reduce phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B and nuclear P65 protein levels, leading to inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity. Moreover, inhibition of miR-146a expression can reverse NF-&#x003ba;B activity repression by celastrol. According to these results, we draw a conclusion that celastrol suppresses NF-&#x003ba;B activity by enhancing miR-146a expression.</p><p>In summary, we established a primary relationship between celastrol and apoptosis in BGC-823, SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells here. Furthermore, we explored the molecular mechanisms of celastrol-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. These results suggest that celastrol might be an effective drug to treat human gastric cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM), sodium pyruvate were from Gibco-BRL (Rockville, MD, USA).

The miR-146a level was quantified by real-time PCR using TransStartTM SYBR Green qPCR Supermix (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China), and with U6 small nuclear RNA as an internal normalized reference. For miR-146a, the primers were as follows: forward, 5&#x02032;- <sc>GCCGATTGGAGTGGTAAAC</sc>-3&#x02032; and reverse, 5&#x02032;-AAGACCCCTCGTTGCAGT-3&#x02032;.

BGC-823, SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells were transiently transfected with two plasmids (pNF-&#x003ba;B-luc plasmid and &#x003b2;-galactosidase) using the LipofectAMINE Plus regent. Cells were passaged on 24-wells plate the day prior to transfection to achieve 80%-85% confluence on the following day. Twelve hours after transfection, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in medium containing different concentration of celastrol and harvested for luciferase reporter assays. Luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (TD-20/20; Turner Designs, CA, USA) using the Luciferase Assay System. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase activity was detected to normalise any variations in the transfection efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Total protein was extracted using a lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/l Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.4; 1% NP-40; 150 mmol/l NaCl; 1 mmol/l EDTA; 1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (one tablet per 10 ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The cytosol and nuclear extracts were prepared by NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Protein concentration in the cell lysate was quantified using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Then, Western blot analysis was performed. &#x003b2;-actin and Lamin B were used as internal controls for the total and nuclear extracts, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with statistical analysis software SPSS 13.0 software.
