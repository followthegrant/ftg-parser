In addition to energy deprivation, increased mitochondrial ROS damage proteins and lipids in aged skeletal muscle. Therefore, prevention of mitochondrial ROS is important for potential therapeutic strategies to delay sarcopenia. This study elucidates the pharmacological efficiency of the new developed mitochondria-targeted ROS and electron scavenger, XJB-5-131 (XJB) to restore muscle contractility and mitochondrial function in aged skeletal muscle. Male adult (5-month old) and aged (29-month old) Fischer Brown Norway (F344/BN) rats were treated with XJB for four weeks and contractile properties of single skeletal muscle fibres and activity of mitochondrial ETC complexes were determined at the end of the treatment period. XJB-treated old rats showed higher muscle contractility associated with prevention of protein oxidation in both muscle homogenate and mitochondria compared with untreated counterparts. XJB-treated animals demonstrated a high activity of the respiratory complexes I, III, and IV with no changes in citrate synthase activity. These data demonstrate that mitochondrial ROS play a causal role in muscle weakness, and that a ROS scavenger specifically targeted to mitochondria can reverse age-related alterations of mitochondrial function and improve contractile properties in skeletal muscle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>single fiber contractility</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial ROS</kwd><kwd>XJB-5-131</kwd><kwd>Gerotarget</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The progressive age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength, known as sarcopenia, involves changes in several metabolic pathways [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Alterations in energy metabolism associated with impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative capacity are central events in aging myocytes [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The main alterations observed in mitochondria with aging include: i) high mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) generation associated with increased damage to proteins, lipids, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), ii) activation of stress response pathways, and iii) decreased expression of mtDNA-encoded proteins associated with a progressive loss of mitochondrial respiratory function [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As a result, mitochondria of old muscles generate less ATP and cannot provide adequate energy for muscle actions contributing to sarcopenia. Human studies have correlated age-related declines in O<sub>2</sub> consumption [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and ATP synthesis [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] with reduced mitochondrial mass [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and oxidative phosphorylation activity [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Importantly, mitochondrial dynamics significantly change with age because sustained mitochondrial elongation induces senescence-associated phenotypic changes in the cell, resulting in low mitochondrial membrane potential, high mtROS production, and mtDNA damage [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Giant, dysfunctional mitochondria with highly interconnected networks and ultrastructural abnormalities produce more ROS and have a low autophagic activity that further ablates the mitochondrial quality control in aged cells [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>While accumulation of mtROS plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia, the contributions of changes in the electron transfer chain (ETC) activity and increases in mtROS to age-related muscle weakness continues to be intensely debated. Furthermore, there is no pharmacologic treatment to reverse mitochondrial deficits in the elderly. Targeted expression of mitochondrial catalase preserved structure and function of mitochondria and extended lifespan [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] that was associated with reduced insulin resistance and muscle dysfunction in mice [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Treatment with the mitochondria-targeted peptide antioxidant SS-31 attenuated mitochondrial degeneration, improved age-related skeletal muscle performance [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and protected the diaphragm against mechanical ventilation-induced myofiber atrophy and contractile dysfunction [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Likewise, a derivative of plastoquinone (SkQ) exerted multiple anti-aging effects, prevented ROS accumulation, and was especially effective during the early and middle stages of aging [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These studies provide a proof-of-principle for a causal role of mtROS in sarcopenia and suggest the use of targeted antioxidant interventions as a promising and highly effective therapeutic intervention.</p><p>A derivative of the antibiotic gramicidin S, XJB-5-131 (XJB), is a recently developed antioxidant that targets mitochondria and provides mtROS and electron scavenging capacity by virtue of its conjugation to a 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxy (4-Amino-TEMPO) moiety [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The structure and redox properties of XJB are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The major antioxidant capacity of XJB is likely to involve the scavenging of electrons leaking from the ETC, rather than being caused by an SOD-like mechanism [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. XJB significantly reduced the disease phenotype and improved mitochondrial function of striatal synaptosomes in a mouse model of Huntington's disease [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mouse embryonic cells pretreated with XJB demonstrated reduced apoptosis and enhanced cell survival [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Intravenous administration of XJB prevented ileal mucosal barrier dysfunction and tissue ischemia associated with significantly prolonged survival from hemorrhagic shock [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and protected against global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in rats. Our recent studies demonstrated that hearts of XJB-treated aged rats were resistant to ischemia-reperfusion injury, as evidenced by improved post-ischemic recovery of cardiac function and reduced cell death. Also, they exhibited higher mitochondrial respiration rates than untreated age-matched counterparts [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Structure (A), and redox properties of XJB (B)</title><p>XJB is effectively enriched in mitochondria, where the nitroxide moiety acts as an ROS and electron/radical scavenger. Conversion of the nitroxide function into other oxidation states is reversible and can contribute to catalytic ROS turnover through the following interactions (B). The one-electron reduction of the nitroxide (1) in the XJB molecule generates a hydroxylamine (2), which can undergo a two-electron oxidation to the oxoammonium cation (3). Single-electron reduction of the oxoammonium cation regenerates the nitroxide. Therefore, all of these N-O oxidation states can equilibrate as a function of the redox state of the environment and the presence of glutathione and NAD(P)H [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Superoxide radical anion, as well as reactive nitrogen species, react with all XJB N-O oxidation states and participate in the redox cycle (B) [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The nitroxide radical is also a superb single-electron and radical acceptor, and can quench species originating from hydrogen atom abstraction by ROS, among other pathways [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-06-39469-g001"/></fig><p>In this study, we determined the possible beneficial effects of XJB on contractile properties and mitochondrial ETC activity of skeletal muscle in aged rats.

We revealed no differences between XJB-treated and untreated adults rats on the activity of ETC complexes and citrate synthase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A-6D</xref>). In old rats, XJB exerted diverse effects on different muscles for ETC complexes I, III, and IV. Complex I activity in soleus and plantaris mitochondria of XJB-treated rats increased by 69% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and 60% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), respectively, compared to untreated counterparts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The ROS scavenger also increased complex I activity in the gastrocnemius (by 41%, <italic>P</italic> = N.S.); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Treatment with XJB induced a 39% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and 59% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) increase of the complex III activity in soleus and gastrocnemius, respectively, with no effect on plantaris mitochondria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

Notably, there were no differences in citrate synthase activity between treated and untreated groups for all three muscles, indicating that mitochondrial mass was not affected by the ROS scavenger (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Also, analysis of ETC supercomplexes in gastrocnemius mitochondria revealed a 25% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) decrease in aged rats compared with adult counterparts. However, there were no differences between XJB-treated and untreated aged rats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A, 7B</xref>). Likewise, XJB had no effect on protein levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD2), a mitochondrial isoform of SOD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). These data are consistent with our previuos findings (20) and demonstrate that the antioxidant effects of XJB occur through its capacity to scavenge electrons leaking from uncoordinated electron carriers rather than the SOD-like activity.

These data provide strong experimental evidence that mtROS play a causal role in aging-related muscle weakness, and that the treatment of aged animals with a ROS/electron scavenger specifically targeting mitochondria may delay sarcopenia and improve contractility in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Several lines of evidence in both experimental and clinical studies have supported a central role of mtROS in aging, and the mitochondrial free radical theory emphasises the importance of developing new pharmacological compounds that would specifically accumulate in mitochondria and target mtROS to attenuate aging (reviewed in [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Targeted overexpression of catalase in mitochondria resulted in a significant lifespan extension in mice that provided a direct evidence for the role of mtROS in longevity [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We found that XJB preserved mitochondrial function (ETC activity) that was associated with improved contractility in single muscle fibres of old rats. Our data are also consistent with previous studies showing that treatment of accelerated aging Ercc1(&#x02212;/&#x00394;) mice with XJB attenuated age-related intervertebral disc degeneration and improved intervertebral disc cell metabolism [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have revealed a causal link between enhanced mitochondrial function and improved muscle contractility. The flavanol (-)-epicatechin, a component of dark chocolate, increased expression of ETC complexes and mitochondrial biogenesis that was associated with significantly enhanced fatigue resistance in isolated skeletal muscles and improved treadmill performance in young mice [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Likewise, high mitochondrial biogenesis and cytochrome c expression induced by administration of quercetin was associated with significantly improved exercise capacity in young mice [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We have previously reported [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] a direct mtROS scavenging effect of XJB in cultured H9c2 cells that are used widely as an <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular model for both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Pre-treatment of these cells with XJB was associated with preserved mitochondrial membrane potential and increased cell survival and significantly reduced mtROS induced by hydrogen peroxide, DMNQ (ROS inducer) and antimycin A (complex III inhibitor). Interestingly, unchanged citrate synthase activities in treated and untreated animals suggested that the improvements in mitochondrial function with XJB were not simply due to increased mitochondrial mass (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). These observations are consistent with previous studies that investigated anti-aging effects of a mitochondria-targeted peptide with mtROS scavenging capacity, SS-31. Age-related declines in mitochondrial ATP production, coupling of oxidative phosphorylation (P/O), and cell energy state (PCr/ATP) were rapidly reversed after SS-31 treatment with no effect on mitochondrial content as evidenced by unchanged protein expression of ETC complexes in old mice [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Notably, like SS-31, uptake of XJB into mitochondria is very high (up to 600-fold versus the cytosolic fraction) and largely independent of the mitochondrial membrane potential [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, accumulation of the scavenger does not affect the mitochondrial membrane potential in cardiac myocytes [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The anti-aging effects of XJB and maintenance of skeletal muscle contractility presumably occur due to improved mitochondrial ATP synthesis and energy transfer in the ETC. This preserved ETC activity due to XJB-induced reduction of mtROS may abolish mtDNA damage. Mitochondrial biogenesis and function is regulated by the network of transcription factors that control nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding mitochondrial proteins [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. MtDNA encodes 13 of the approximately 80 proteins involved in ETC complexes and mtDNA damage induced by mtROS overproduction alters mitochondrial gene expression leading to defective protein synthesis. Therefore, scavenging of mtROS may improve the ETC activity presumably through prevention of mtDNA damage in aged hearts. In support of this mechanistic hypothesis, previous studies revealed the ability of XJB to attenuate oxidative DNA damage in a mouse model of Huntington's disease [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Notably, prevention of mtDNA may be one of the pathways that mediate beneficial effects of XJB. Along with the conservation of mtDNA, prevention of protein (i.e. myosin) oxidation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) may play a critical role in the anti-aging effects of XJB. This could contribute to the preservation of muscle fiber contractility. In addition, XJB interacts closely with cardiolipin, a unique mitochondria-specific phospholipid, and very efficiently prevents its oxidation [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Cardiolipin plays an essential role in the assembly and stabilization of ETC supercomplexes. Aging reduced the protein level of supercomplexes in skeletal muscle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), and these findings are consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, XJB treatment had no effect on the supercomplex levels in aged skeletal muscle. These data indicate that the beneficial effects of XJB on ETC complexes are not mediated through assembling supercomplexes, at least, in gastrocnemius. Further studies are required to clarify the effect of XJB on ETC supercomplexes in different skeletal muscles as well as mitochondrial subpopulations (subsarcolemmal and interfibrillar mitochondria).</p><p>In conclusion, our findings provide strong evidence that reductions in mtROS emission by XJB improve the mitochondrial ETC activity and contractility in aged skeletal muscles. These protective effects might be due to increased ATP production, and decreased oxidation of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Development of a new generation of ROS scavengers that primarily target mtROS has a clinical significance for the treatment of age-related diseases, and for delaying the degenerative processes closely associated with aging. The beneficial effects observed with XJB in attenuating the muscle weakness in aged rats indicate the potential importance of this ROS and electron scavenger as a new therapeutic agent.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY</title><p>One of the limitations is that the studies were conducted only in male rats.

In addition, our study involves the treatment of aged rats with XJB for one month, which might be insufficient to exert more remarkable effects on the mitochondrial function and skeletal muscle contractility. High sensitivity of muscle fibers to low-temperature freezing did not allow the analysis of the muscle contractility in all groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s5"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s5_1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male adult (5-month old, n = 17) and aged (29-month old, n = 19) Fischer Brown Norway (F344/BN) rats were purchased from Charles River (NIA NIH colony at Charles River, Kingston, NY). All experiments were performed according to the protocol approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee and conform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).</p></sec><sec id="s5_2"><title>Experimental protocols</title><p>Animals were randomly assigned to the following four groups: adult (A), adult+XJB (AX), aged (O), and aged+XJB (OX). XJB was dissolved in 0.5 mL of sunflower seed oil (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and administered intraperitoneally 3 times per week (3 mg/kg body weight) for four weeks. Rats in untreated groups (A and O) were injected an equal volume of sunflower oil (vehicle) without XJB. The body weights of the animals were measured weekly. After four weeks of treatment, animals were sacrificed, and skeletal muscles were isolated, weighed, and used for analysis of contractile properties and isolation of mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s5_3"><title>Single fibre extraction and permeabilization</title><p>The gastrocnemius muscle was dissected from rats and placed in iced relaxing solution (in mM; 4 Mg-ATP, 1 free Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 20 imidazole, 7 EGTA, 14.5 creatine phosphate, and sufficient KCl to adjust the ionic strength to 180). The pH was adjusted to 7.0. The muscles were separated into bundles of fibres and chemically skinned for 24 h in skinning solution (relaxing solution containing 50% (v/v) glycerol) at 4&#x000b0;C. The chemically skinned bundles were stored at &#x000ad;20&#x000b0;C up to 4 weeks until experimental analysis or treated for long-term storage at &#x000ad;80&#x000b0;C using sucrose, a cryoprotectant.</p></sec><sec id="s5_4"><title>Analysis of single fibre dimensions</title><p>Single fibre dimensions were determined as previously described [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, the skinned fibre bundles were placed in relaxing Brij solution containing 0.5% Brij-58 (polyoxyethylene 20 cetyl ether; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Then, the bundles were transferred to relaxing solution for the isolation of single fibres. Each fibre was transferred to an experimental apparatus (1400A Permeabilized Fiber Test System, Aurora Scientific Inc., Ontario, Canada) and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX71, Tokyo, Japan). The fibre was attached between connectors leading to a force transducer (Model 403A, Aurora Scientific Inc., ON, Canada) and a direct-current torque motor (Model 315C, Aurora Scientific, ON, Canada). Immediately, the fibre segment was submerged in relaxing solution at 15&#x000b0;C to proceed with morphological measurements. The sarcomere length (set to 2.75-2.85 &#x003bc;m) and the fibre's diameter, depth, and length were measured using the Video Sarcomere Length Image Analysis System (Aurora Scientific Inc., ON, Canada). Fibre cross-sectional area (CSA) was calculated using width and depth of the fibre, assuming an elliptical circumference and corrected for the 20% swelling that follows skinning [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s5_5"><title>Determination of contractile properties in single fibres</title><p>The contractile properties of single fibers were determined with the slack test procedure [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Maximal unloaded shortening velocity (V<sub>0</sub>) was measured as the change in length of the fibre <italic>vs</italic>. change in time. Briefly, after 15 sec in a relaxing solution, the fibre was transferred to a low Ca<sup>2+</sup>-EGTA solution for another 15 sec to reach steady tension and to preserve the regularity of cross-striations. Then, the fibre was submerged in an activating solution (relaxing solution with 10<sup>&#x02212;4.5</sup> M Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Once the maximum force (plateau) was reached, a slack (shortening step) was imposed to drop the force rapidly to zero. The time required for the fibre to develop tension again from the imposed slack was measured. The fibre was relaxed and slowly re-extended to its original length. This procedure was repeated with different amplitudes of slacks (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15% of the total fibre segment length). After the procedure was completed, each fibre was stored in a sample buffer containing 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 0.5% bromophenol blue, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 &#x003bc;M leupeptin at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until the electrophoretic analysis was performed.</p><p>For each fibre, the relationship between the time required for force re-development and the slack length was plotted using least-squares regression. The slope corresponds to the V<sub>0</sub> of the fibre. Maximum active force (P<sub>0</sub>) was calculated as the difference between the total tension in activating solution (pCa 4.5) and the resting tension measured in the same segment while in relaxing solution. The specific force was calculated as P<sub>0</sub> normalized to CSA. Absolute power was calculated as the product of velocity and force and normalized power as absolute power normalized to CSA.</p></sec><sec id="s5_6"><title>Isolation of mitochondria</title><p>Mitochondria were isolated from all 3 skeletal muscles using minor modifications of the method described previously [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
