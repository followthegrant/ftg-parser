Here, through analysis of genome-scale loss-of-function datasets, we identify adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (<italic>ADAR</italic> or ADAR1) as an essential gene for the survival of a subset of cancer cell lines. ADAR1-dependent cell lines display increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Activation of type I interferon signaling in the context of ADAR1 deficiency can induce cell lethality in non-ADAR1-dependent cell lines. <italic>ADAR</italic> deletion causes activation of the double-stranded RNA sensor, protein kinase R (PKR). Disruption of PKR signaling, through inactivation of PKR or overexpression of either a wildtype or catalytically inactive mutant version of the p150 isoform of ADAR1, partially rescues cell lethality after ADAR1 loss, suggesting that both catalytic and non-enzymatic functions of ADAR1 may contribute to preventing PKR-mediated cell lethality.

In this study, we utilize genome-scale loss-of-function datasets to uncover genetic dependencies in lung cancer cell lines. We find that lung cancer cell lines expressing high levels of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are vulnerable to deletion of the RNA adenosine deaminase, <italic>ADAR</italic> or ADAR1. <italic>ADAR</italic> deletion induces phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor PKR, leading to downstream signaling. Deletion of PKR can partially rescue cell lethality after ADAR1 loss, indicating that <italic>ADAR</italic> genetic dependency is at least partly mediated by PKR signaling. Overexpression studies demonstrate that both the catalytic and non-enzymatic functions of ADAR1 may restrain PKR-mediated cell lethality in ADAR1-dependent lung&#x000a0;cancer cell lines.

Consistent with the known role of ADAR1 in IFN-I signaling, we found higher expression of ISGs in ADAR1-dependent versus non-ADAR1-dependent lung cancer cell lines (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>), suggesting that an elevated interferon gene expression signature may serve as a biomarker for ADAR1 dependency.

Similar to the ADAR1-dependent cell lines identified in the genome-scale shRNA screening&#x000a0;datasets, these cell lines (NCI-H596, HCC1438, and SW900) also expressed high levels of interferon-inducible proteins, such as PKR and MDA5 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), secreted IFN-&#x003b2; spontaneously (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), and were sensitive to ADAR1 loss (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Of note, this pattern of ADAR1 dependency was not restricted to lung cancer cell lines. Analysis of a CRISPR-Cas9 screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> identified an ADAR1-dependent pancreatic cancer cell line, PATU-8902, which also expressed high levels of interferon-inducible proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1b</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Next, we sought to determine whether activation of IFN-I signaling in the context of ADAR1 deficiency could induce cell lethality in non-ADAR1-dependent cancer cell lines. We deleted <italic>ADAR</italic> in A549 and NCI-H1437 cells, which normally tolerate ADAR1 deficiency, and then treated these cell lines with IFN-I. Treatment with either interferon-&#x003b1; (IFN-&#x003b1;) or interferon-&#x003b2; (IFN-&#x003b2;) caused increased cell lethality in ADAR1-deficient A549 and NCI-H1437 cells as compared to vehicle-treated controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). We observed similar results in an extended panel of <italic>ADAR</italic> KO-insensitive cancer cell lines treated with IFN-&#x003b2;, although the magnitude of the cell lethality phenotype varied between cell lines (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). ADAR1-deficient A549 cells treated with IFN-&#x003b2; showed increased caspase 3/caspase 7 activity, indicative of increased apoptosis (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1e</xref>).

On day 2, the culture media was replaced with media supplemented with recombinant IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b2; (both at 10&#x02009;ng/ml). On day 3, the culture media was replaced with 1.5&#x02009;mL fresh media for each well.
