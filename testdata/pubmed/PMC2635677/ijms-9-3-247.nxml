AL-1 regulates in a temporal fashion the production of at least five extracellular cellulases with different molecular weights. A 29 kDa protein, part of this enzyme battery, was purified to homogeneity and showed to possess chitosanase-cellulase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-3-247">1</xref>]. Furthermore, a gene encoding a family 9 extracellular cellulase was cloned from the genome of <italic>Myxobacter</italic> Sp. AL-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-3-247">2</xref>]. Sequences located downstream of <italic>cel9</italic> showed the existence of a contiguous partial reading frame, which putatively coded for another cellulase, termed cel48 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-3-247">2</xref>]. The first gene of this cluster, <italic>cel9</italic>, was successfully expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and the biochemical properties of the pure protein were very similar as those exhibited by related cellulases produced by thermophilic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-3-247">2</xref>]. Moreover, results of a Gapped-blast alignment analysis revealed that Cel9 is a modular enzyme composed of N-terminal catalytic and C-terminal type IIIc cellulose binding domains, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-9-3-247">3</xref>].</p><p>The complete degradation of cellulose occurs with the action of endo-1,4-&#x003b2;-glucanases and exo-1,4-&#x003b2;-glucanases. The endo-acting enzymes attack the cellulose chain internally whereas the exo-1,4-&#x003b2;-glucanases attack the reducing or non-reducing end of the cellulose chain to generate cellobiose or glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-9-3-247">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-9-3-247">5</xref>]. The ability of <italic>Myxobacter</italic> Sp. AL-1 to grow in CMC as a sole carbon source (Our unpublished results) and the presence in this microorganism of a <italic>cel9-cel48</italic> cluster suggest that this soil microorganism possesses the enzymatic machinery to degrade cellulose. However, since the full nucleotide sequence of <italic>cel48</italic> was not available, the biochemical properties of its encoding product remained unknown. In this communication, we report the expression of <italic>cel48</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic> and the purification of its encoding product as a His<sub>6</sub>-Cel48 protein. His<sub>6</sub>-Cel48 showed to possess biochemical properties as those described for cellobiohydrolases from bacterial origin belonging to the family 48 of the glycosyl hydrolases. Moreover, the expression of <italic>cel9</italic> from an IPTG-inducible promoter was carried out in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. The recombinant Cel9 protein was secreted to the culture medium of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells and was purified to homogeneity by FPLC. Results from a Western-blot analysis revealed that Cel48 as well as Cel9 are produced and secreted by <italic>Myxobacter</italic> Sp. AL-1; moreover, both proteins acted together, in a synergistic manner, to process the degradation of acid-swollen avicel.</p></sec><sec><title>2.

When necessary antibiotics were added to media at the following final concentrations: ampicillin (Amp), 100 &#x003bc;g/mL; kanamycin (Kan), 10 &#x003bc;g/mL. Cells were grown in liquid media with vigorous aeration or on solid media at 37&#x000b0;C.

The cell homogenate was subjected to centrifugation (27,200 &#x000d7; g) to eliminate undisrupted cells and cell debris and the supernatant was applied to a 5 mL Ni-NTA-Agarose (QIAGEN Inc.) column, previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A (50 mL) and buffer A containing 10 mM imidazole (50 mL) and the protein bound to the resin was eluted with buffer A (6 mL) containing imidazole (200 mM); 4 mL fractions were collected during this last step.

Results and Discussion</title><p>Since regions lying downstream of <italic>cel9</italic> showed the presence of a second partial ORF, encoding a putative cellulase, it was of further interest to characterize this gene. Thus, the full DNA sequence of this second gene was obtained by PCR walking using homologous oligonucleotides and the results revealed an ORF of 2151 bp (GenBank accession number 778327) encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 81 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-3-247">Figure 1</xref>). A Gapped-blast analysis (results not shown) showed that this protein possessed identity with cellobiohydrolases of bacterial origin grouped in the family 48 of the glycosyl hydrolases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-3-247">12</xref>], therefore this gene was termed <italic>cel48</italic>. Interestingly, Cel48C a 118 kDa cellobiohydrolase from <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. BP-23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-3-247">13</xref>] contains a type 3a cellulose-binding module as well as a fibronectin-III domain on its C-terminal end which are absent in Cel48.</p><p>To determine the biochemical and biophysical properties of Cel48, this protein was produced and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> cells transformed with plasmid pPERM407. Cell-free extracts of the transformed cells showed the presence of a protein of around 81 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-247">Figure 2</xref>, Lane 2), which was subsequently purified on a Ni-NTA-agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-247">Figure 2</xref>, Lanes 5&#x02013;8) and was recognized by an anti-Cel48 antibody in the cell free extracts of this <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-247">Figure 2</xref>, Lane 9).</p><p>Although the recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-Cel48 protein catalyzed the hydrolysis of ASC and CMC, the enzyme was more active against the former substrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ijms-9-3-247">Table 2</xref>). It has been previously described that family 48 cellobiohydrolases catalyze the hydrolysis of cellulosic substrates such as ASC in a slow manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-9-3-247">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-3-247">13</xref>]. In agreement with this observation, maximum hydrolysis of ASC and CMC by His<sub>6</sub>-Cel48 occurred after 18&#x02013;24 h at pH 6 (Results not shown).</p><p>Moreover, the recombinant enzyme showed to be very stable at least for 2 h periods, at 23, 37 and 45&#x000b0;C; however, the enzyme was rapidly inactivated at 60&#x000b0;C or higher temperatures (Results not shown). On the other hand, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ijms-9-3-247">Table 2</xref>, no activity of His <sub>6</sub>-Cel48 was detected against avicel and the oligomeric substrates <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl &#x003b2;-D-cellobioside (<italic>p</italic>-NP-Glc<sub>2</sub>) and <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl &#x003b2;-D-cellotrioside (<italic>p</italic>-NP-Glc<sub>3</sub>). Thus, in terms of substrate specificity, His<sub>6</sub>-Cel48 resembled the catalytic domain of Cel48A from the thermophile bacterium <italic>Thermomonospura fusca</italic> (Cel48Acd), since the recombinant form of this enzyme showed activity against ASC and CMC but was inactive against cello-oligosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-9-3-247">9</xref>]. Other properties such as optimal pH and thermal stability were also shared by both enzymes.</p><p>The synergistic degradation of cellulose by endoglucanases and exoglucanases has been previously documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-3-247">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-3-247">17</xref>]. It has been proposed that the synergistic reaction between both classes of enzymes involves a mechanism in which the endoglucanases attack the amorphous portions of cellulose followed by the action of exoglucanases which release cellobiose from the internal nicks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-3-247">14</xref>].</p><p>The existence of contiguous <italic>cel9</italic> and <italic>cel48</italic> genes encoding endo- and exo-acting cellulases suggested that <italic>Myxobacter</italic> Sp. AL-1 possessed the enzymatic machinery to degrade cellulose. To investigate whether Cel48 together with Cel9 catalyzed the degradation of ASC in a synergistic manner it was necessary to purify Cel9. To this end, the protease and &#x003b2;-glucanase deficient strain <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 1A751 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-3-247">Table 1</xref>) was used as a host to express <italic>cel9</italic>. Thus, <italic>cel9</italic> was cloned in the plasmid pDG148 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-3-247">18</xref>] under the control of the IPTG-inducible P<italic>spac</italic> promoter and the resulting construction was introduced in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 1A751 generating the strain <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PERM272. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-3-247">Figure 3</xref>, addition of IPTG to a mid logarithmic phase culture of strain <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PERM272 induced around five times the levels of CM-cellulase expression. The maximum levels of CM-cellulase activity were reached 10 h after addition of the inducer and these values were maintained during the following 14 h. SDS-PAGE and zymogram analysis revealed the presence of a protein with the predicted molecular mass of Cel9 that also possessed CM-cellulase activity in the culture medium of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PERM272.</p><p>Since <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was able to synthesize and secrete Cel9 we used a culture of strain <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PERM272 induced with IPTG for 12 h as a source to purify this protein. To this end, after separating the cells, the secreted proteins were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and then subjected to purification on a Mono-Q HR 16/10 anion-exchange column. After applying a linear salt gradient, Cel9 was solved on this column as a single peak of CM-cellulase activity which was eluded with around 0.12 M NaCl (Results not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that Cel9 was purified to apparent homogeneity after this chromatographic step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-247">Fig. 4</xref>). Following this protocol, Cel9 was purified five times with a 60% recovery (Results not shown). Results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-247">Figure 4</xref> (Lane 6) revealed that the ~66 kDa purified protein was specifically recognized by an anti-Cel9 antibody in the supernatant of the IPTG-induced strain <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PERM272.</p><p>Having available purified samples of both Cel9 and Cel48 it was further investigated whether these proteins catalyzed the degradation of ASC in a synergistic manner. To this end, either individual samples or different ratio&#x02019;s mixtures of Cel9 and Cel48 were incubated with ASC at a final concentration of 0.5% during 18 h at 40&#x000b0;C. A synergistic interaction between Cel9 and Cel48 during ASC degradation was observed since the activity of all mixtures were significantly higher than that of either enzyme assayed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-3-247">Fig. 5</xref>). The enzyme Cel48 showed a synergism of 1.68 times with the endoglucanase Cel9 during ASC degradation using an 8.1-fold excess of Cel48 over Cel9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-3-247">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Taken these results together is reasonable to conclude that the genetic information present in the <italic>cel9-cel48</italic> cluster of <italic>Myxobacter</italic> Sp. AL-1 encodes functional enzymes which catalyze synergistically the degradation of cellulose. However, as noted above, both, Cel9 and Cel48 were synthesized in heterologous hosts and the existence of these enzymes in <italic>Myxobacter</italic> Sp. AL-1 remained to be demonstrated. Regarding this issue, previous results of a zymogram analysis suggested that a ~70 kDa protein secreted into the culture medium of <italic>Myxobacter</italic> Sp. AL-1 could correspond to Cel9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-3-247">2</xref>]. However, to date the production of Cel48 by <italic>Myxobacter</italic> Sp. AL-1 has not been proven. Thus, the polyclonal antibodies generated against Cel9 and Cel48 were used to localize both proteins in the cell culture of this microorganism. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-3-247">Figure 6</xref> reveled that the anti-Cel9 and anti-Cel48 antibodies were able to recognize proteins with molecular masses of around 67 and 82 kDa, respectively, in the supernatant of a 24 h culture of <italic>Myxobacter</italic> Sp. AL-1. These results strongly suggest that Cel9 and Cel48 are produced and secreted by <italic>Myxobacter</italic> Sp. AL-1 to process the hydrolysis of cellulose.</p><p>In conclusion, the results described in this work add new evidence on the existence of the enzymatic machinery to process the synergistic degradation of cellulose in the soil microorganism <italic>Myxobacter</italic> Sp. AL-1.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the University of Guanajuato and by grant 43644 from the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a (CONACYT) of M&#x000e9;xico to Mario Pedraza-Reyes.
