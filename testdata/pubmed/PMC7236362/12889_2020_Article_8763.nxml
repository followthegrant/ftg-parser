The Global epidemic of obesity is driven by shared societal determinants and appear to have the greatest effect on the poorest people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current economic systems are promoting excessive and unsustainable consumption patterns, which are reflected in the rising obesity levels worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgency to address the continuing challenge of obesity in terms of biological and social risks in early life. In simplest terms, it may seem as though the rising obesity prevalence is due to environmental exposures such as excessive energy intake, sedentary lifestyles, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and sleep debt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, it appears to manifest preferentially in genetically predisposed individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] suggesting a more complex interaction between hereditary/genetic and environmental risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Accumulating evidence supports an important role for social factors&#x000a0;in early life that may be equally, if not more important than adult social factors&#x000a0;in predisposing to adult obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A previous study of Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 showed that differences in BMI by social class were formed at least partly during early childhood and a high maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was predictive of obesity in adulthood among the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Since then, early&#x000a0;social disadvantage has been continually linked to later obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. One study also&#x000a0;reported that higher genetic risk and low socio-economic status were associated with higher BMI in pre-adolescent individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We hypothesised&#x000a0;that&#x000a0;a&#x000a0;higher genetic risk for obesity may already be present at birth in the most socially disadvantaged groups (Additional File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). However, it is still unclear whether the association between early social disadvantage and later life obesity is direct or due in part to the inheritance of genetic risk and/or other maternal risk factors. Further complicating this relationship is the concept of social mobility, in which people can move up or down the social hierarchy throughout the life-course. Previous research has shown the direction of mobility to be accompanied by improvement or worsening of health, and likewise changes in health can often be related to fluctuations in social circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, more information is&#x000a0;needed on whether the association between early social disadvantage and later obesity can be modified by the process of social mobility&#x000a0;during the life-course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">In this study, we aimed to test whether i) early exposure to social disadvantage is related to later life body mass index (BMI) and other measures of body composition, ii) the relationship between early exposure to social disadvantage and later life BMI and body composition can be explained by higher genetic predisposition or maternal BMI and iii) reduction in social disadvantage during the life-course is associated with a lower BMI&#x000a0;and other measures of adiposity&#x000a0;in adulthood. Finally, we used three generations of birth cohorts in Finland to replicate the study during different historical phases of the obesity epidemic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par19">The study population comprised participants from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study (HBCS1934&#x02013;1944) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and Northern Finland Birth Cohorts 1966 (NFBC1966) and 1986 (NFBC1986), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which are population-based birth cohorts.</p><p id="Par20">HBCS1934&#x02013;1944&#x000a0;comprised&#x000a0;a total of 13,345 live-born children between 1934 and 1944&#x000a0;at&#x000a0;Helsinki University Central Hospital or the Helsinki City Maternity Hospital&#x000a0;and they were identified and followed through to present day using register data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Children attended child welfare clinics voluntarily and those, who were alive and living in Finland in 1971, received a unique personal identity number (ID). Information on pregnancy and early life was gathered&#x000a0;from hospital records and child welfare clinics. ID numbers were used to link the data to national registers. Clinical examinations were&#x000a0;conducted on a random sample of 2003 individuals, at a mean age of 62&#x02009;years between 2001 and 2004, and for 2001 of those individuals, the primary outcome, i.e. measured BMI was available. The present study used the 1277 individuals with measured BMI and early life social disadvantage score in the analysis&#x000a0;examining early life exposure to social disadvantage with adulthood BMI. In the second analysis examining social mobility, a sample size of 722 participants had both adult register and clinical data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

In adulthood,variables were higher education, household income and occupation. In NFBC1966 early life social disadvantage meeting all criteria was represented by parental marital status, paternal occupation, maternal occupation, maternal education and material wealth. Material wealth was a constructed variable including apartment/house ownership, car ownership and whether the family&#x02019;s dwelling had electricity, telephone, running water and television.

In NFBC1966, this association persisted following adjustment for PRS BMI (as well as principal components, in order to control for population stratification), maternal BMI and sex. However, in NFBC1986 the association was attenuated by the adjustment for PRS BMI. We observed a similar trend in HBCS1934&#x02013;1944 for higher later life BMI in the group exposed to high early social disadvantage. Furthermore, individuals&#x000a0;showing upward social mobility during the lifecourse had lower later life BMI compared to individuals with downward social mobility based on findings in our two adult cohorts (HBCS1934&#x02013;1944 and NFBC1966).</p><p id="Par43">These three birth cohorts reflect changes in the socio-historical context which may explain the trends we are observing. When individuals in the oldest birth cohort were born (1934&#x02013;1944), Finland was an agricultural society. At this time, food was scarce as they moved from the Great Depression into a period of war when groceries were rationed. During the 1960&#x02019;s, Finland was transitioning into an industrial economy, characterised by urbanization and mass migration. When the youngest birth cohort was born in the 1980&#x02019;s, Finland was living in an economic boom and becoming a consumer nation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">A previous study on seven population-based surveys from six countries showed that in cohorts born between 1910 and 1961, women from manual childhood backgrounds had an elevated risk of obesity in adulthood, although it was attenuated in two studies after adjustment for adult socioeconomic position. Among men, the association with childhood position was mostly in the same direction, although effects were weaker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which is consistent with what we observed in HBCS1934&#x02013;1944.</p><p id="Par45">NFBC1966 showed the most robust association between early social disadvantage and later life BMI, which is also consistent with previous reports showing the importance of occupational social class of the head of household in early life and risk for adult obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] even after adjustment for parental BMI in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, our results on early social disadvantage and adult VFA (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>) and adult WC and BFP in women showed similar trends to that of BMI (Additional file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">In our youngest cohort&#x000a0;included in the study (NFBC1986) the association between early social disadvantage and later life BMI was attenuated after adjusting for genetic predisposition to higher BMI. Interestingly, we also found that in all cohorts the PRS BMI was not equally distributed at birth and was highest in individuals born into the group with highest early life social disadvantages. This may be partly explained by social selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], meaning that parents&#x02019; of the participants with higher genetic predisposition to higher BMI may have already drifted to lower social positions and have difficulties in rising to higher social positions. There is also evidence that individuals tend to seek the company of people, who have similar characteristics than their own e.g. for example marrying people of the same level of educational attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These two observed trends of unequal distribution of PRS BMI at birth and stronger effect of genetic risk through time strongly suggest that the current obesogenic environments may be promoting the vicious cycle between low social class and poor health outcomes. We found one other similar study which has demonstrated interaction between genetic influence and socio-economic status in change in BMI across adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Finally, it could be hypothesised that BMI may exert a causal influence on psychosocial factors which may in turn contributed to the observed association. This may be consistent with the finding that obesity may be causally associated to smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and future research based on multivariate mendelian randomisation with very large sample size, for example, may help elucidating the observed associations.</p><p id="Par47">Individuals born in the two oldest cohorts with reduced exposure to social disadvantage during their lifecourse, also had lower BMI compared to individuals with increased exposure to social disadvantage. This is in line with previous studies in women which have also shown that upward mobility from low social origins to higher position during the lifecourse have decreased the risk for obesity compared to those with a stable situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, a society&#x02019;s degree of social mobility is important, for example in immobile societies an individual&#x02019;s education is strongly related to their parent&#x02019;s education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">It has not been possible to test the pathways of effect between high early social disadvantage and later life BMI in the present study. However, we would speculate&#x000a0;that underlying factors such as stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], nutrition in infancy and childhood, psychological factors such as emotional deprivation and social norms regarding dietary factors and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] may be involved. Furthermore, it has been shown that childhood social disadvantage was related to smoking and excess alcohol intake in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and therefore could foster other unhealthy lifestyle behaviors leading to obesity.</p><p id="Par49">Strengths of&#x000a0;our study include the use of longitudinal or register-based measures of social disadvantage in early life and adulthood to avoid recall bias and construct comprehensive measures of social disadvantage reflecting different social variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Previously, early social disadvantage has been solely based on a single variable, generally father&#x02019;s occupation. We have already demonstrated with the initial step in our variable selection strategy that there are a number of variables associated with later life BMI and potentially acting via different pathways of effect. Therefore, we wanted to capture the complexities of social construct by composing a composite variable. Use of this tested systematic strategy allows comparison between different datasets and time points as the selection process is carried out for each composite measure and thus accounts for differences in variable importance over time and by region. This study also examines the relationship between early social disadvantage and later life obesity in three different birth cohorts, which is especially valuable given the trends of intergenerational transmission of obesity and impact of maternal obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Additionally, we were&#x000a0;able to use objective measures of body composition,&#x000a0;including VFA, WC and BFP in the NFBC1966 in addition to BMI, which has been criticized for not differentiating between body lean mass and body fat mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">We do acknowledge that our study has some limitations. Although the use of three separate cohorts allows us the opportunity to study&#x000a0;trends and replicate findings, there are also challenges with harmonisation. HBCS1934&#x02013;1944 used a retrospective identification of participants based on birth records and subsequent follow-up was primarily via register-based data. Due to availability of funding, a small random sample was invited to attend a clinical examination in later life which resulted in a considerably smaller number of participants included in the present study, particularly in analysis of social mobility. Participants of the cohorts were of different ages at the time of the measurement of BMI&#x000a0;and maternal BMI was measured during late pregnancy in the HBCS1934&#x02013;1944 and not in pre-pregnancy as in NFBCs. We did not conduct meta-analysis due to these differences and high expected heterogeneity of the studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Whilst the&#x000a0;PRS for BMI explained only about 10&#x02013;12% of variation of BMI, this is expected with the methodology used and similar to the variation explained in similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In addition, we have used ranking of participants within their study populations in order to compare how their position within society has changed over time, however we have not been able to account for changes in environment during this period, which is an inherent limitation of longitudinal studies exploring social factors. Social mobility was not&#x000a0;available&#x000a0;in&#x000a0;NFBC1986 as adult data is not yet available for this cohort.</p><p id="Par51">We&#x000a0;conducted sensitivity analyses for NFBC1966 data using only the early social disadvantage measures used in the HBCS1934&#x02013;1944 (instead of number of persons in room we used material wealth: home ownership, car, electricity, telephone, running water and television). After adjustment for PRS BMI the association between high early social disadvantage and BMI was still significant, but intermediate exposure was no longer associated with later life BMI. It&#x000a0;may be that the effect of early social disadvantage on later BMI is better captured with a range of variables. We used a systematic approach for variables selection and reduction according to the association of the social variables and later BMI. This approach allowed us to reduce the number of variables included in the factor score, which can also improve the interpretability as well as replicability across cohorts. We must acknowledge that this process may remove some variables that may contribute to latent factors and further research, probably based in only one cohort should explore other methods to include more social factors that may influence the risk of obesity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par52">Our results based on three generations of birth cohorts showed that participants exposed to high social disadvantage in early life had a tendency towards higher BMI in later life. This association was most robust in the cohort born in the 1960&#x02019;s, withstanding adjustment for genetic predisposition and maternal BMI. The genetic effect was greatest on those born into a more obesogenic environment in the 1980s. Notably, our results based on the two adult cohorts showed that participants with reduced exposure to social disadvantage during the lifecourse had a lower BMI than those with increased exposure, suggesting a potential pathway for intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>
