The outer membrane proteins PorA and FetA have previously been shown to induce bactericidal antibodies in humans. Despite considerable antigenic variation among PorA and FetA OMPs in meningococci, systematic molecular epidemiological studies revealed this variation is highly structured so that a limited repertoire of antigenic types is congruent with the hyperinvasive meningococcal lineages that have caused most of the meningococcal disease in Europe in recent decades. Here we describe the development of a prototype vaccine against capsular group B meningococcal infection based on a N. meningitidis isolate genetically engineered to have constitutive expression of the outer membrane protein FetA. Deoxycholate outer membrane vesicles (dOMVs) extracted from cells cultivated in modified Frantz medium contained 21.8% PorA protein, 7.7% FetA protein and 0.03 &#x003bc;g LPS per &#x003bc;g protein (3%). The antibody response to the vaccine was tested in three mouse strains and the toxicological profile of the vaccine was tested in New Zealand white rabbits. Administration of the vaccine, MenPF-1, when given by intramuscular injection on 4 occasions over a 9 week period, was well tolerated in rabbits up to 50 &#x003bc;g/dose, with no evidence of systemic toxicity. These data indicated that the MenPF-1 vaccine had a toxicological profile suitable for testing in a phase I clinical trial.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by a Strategic Translation Award from the Wellcome Trust [Award number: 082102/Z/07/A].

The incidence in high income countries has decreased in recent decades, in part driven by the implementation of protein-conjugated polysaccharide vaccines providing protection against capsular group C meningococci [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but perhaps also as a result of environmental changes including reductions in smoking rates [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Changes in the meningococci circulating in asymptomatic carriage and changes in population immunity may also have led to the decrease in disease incidence. Conjugate vaccines are available against meningococci expressing polysaccharide capsules of capsular groups A, C, Y and W, which further reduce disease incidence where they are deployed. The development of a similar capsular group B polysaccharide vaccine has been hampered by poor immunogenicity and a concern about the risk of such a vaccine generating cross-reactive antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] against neural tissue [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>To date, the most successful alternative vaccine formulations have included outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]: these vaccines are shown to be safe, moderately reactogenic, and provide protection against outbreaks of capsular group B meningococcal disease caused by the vaccine strain. However, their routine use against endemic disease is complicated by the high degree of variation in sequence and expression levels among meningococcal outer membrane proteins. The protection provided by OMV vaccines, made from the OMVs of wild type circulating invasive meningococci (wt OMV vaccines), is largely attributed to their ability to induce bactericidal antibodies to the immunodominant and antigenically variable outer membrane protein (OMP) porin A (PorA) [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The challenge has been to produce a vaccine based on OMP antigens that is broadly cross-protective against diverse meningococci. One approach has been to supplement an OMV vaccine formulation with additional antigens identified from genome sequence data such as the recently licensed Novartis vaccine, Bexsero [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In contrast, utilizing the extensive epidemiological data available, we have proposed a multivalent OMV approach based on two OMP antigens, PorA and FetA [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Molecular epidemiological studies have shown that meningococcal antigenic diversity is structured by immunoselection, effectively limiting the number of antigenic variants that would have to be included in a multivalent vaccine to offer broad protection [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The outer membrane protein FetA is present in nearly all invasive meningococcal isolates, and like PorA exhibits a high level of antigenic diversity [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, its expression is dependent on the concentration of available free iron [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], consistent with its function as an iron transporter [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. FetA has, in previous studies, been shown to induce bactericidal antibodies in animals and in humans following infection or vaccination with OMV vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The bactericidal antibodies target one specific variable region (VR, &#x02018;loop 5&#x02019;) of the FetA protein [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] which is immunodominant and shields the second most immunogenic domain (loop 3) [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The FetA content of wild-type OMV vaccines is, however, batch-variable, with relative protein content 1&#x02013;8% depending on the amount of available iron in the growth medium [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, we have generated a meningococcus that was constitutive for FetA expression by genetic modification of the promoter region of the fetA gene to constitutively express high levels of the protein. We demonstrate how a combined PorA and FetA vaccine can be formulated from this strain to produce a PorA/FetA vaccine. Secondly, we demonstrate the suitability of this vaccine concept for scale-up of manufacture, the toxicological profile of the OMV in rabbits and impact of genetic variation on immune responses as demonstrated by use of a well characterized panel of genetically engineered target N. meningitidis strains in the bactericidal assay.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Animal studies were conducted according to the UK Home Office regulations under licence number 80/2157 and were approved by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control ethics committee.

Undigested plasmid DNA (1 &#x003bc;g) was added to and the suspension was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 150 rpm rotational shaking for 4 hours. Cells were collected by centrifugation and plated onto Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid) containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin (Sigma Aldrich) to select from plasmid integration. Kanamycin resistant colonies were screened for the presence of the new promoter region by colony PCR. PCR products were analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel to check for band lengths, which were subsequently checked by nucleotide sequencing to confirm the presence of the promoter region.</p><p>The protein profiles of OMVs prepared by deoxycholate (DOC) detergent extraction as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] were assessed on 8% SDS-PAGE (BioRad) run at 10 mA overnight and stained with Silver Stain Protein kit (Amersham Biosciences). The effect of iron limitation on FetA expression was also assessed by comparing membrane extracts for protein profiles, as described above, derived from strains grown in Tryptone Soya Broth (TSB) with or without 50 &#x003bc;M deferoxamine mesylate (DFAM). Finally, the vaccine strain (3207) was assessed for genetic stability, i.e. whether the inserted construct into the parent strain (2851) was stable after consecutive passages. This was performed by growing strain 3207 on non-selective tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates with Vitox (Oxoid), and comparing the number of colonies recovered on selective (Kanamycin 50 &#x003bc;g/ml) and non-selective TSA plates through 10 consecutive passages. Outer membrane protein preparations and genomic DNA preparations were then prepared from before and after the 10 passages, with and without selective growth agar medium. Outer membrane preparations were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE (Biorad), run at 10 mA overnight and visualized by Coomassie staining. The nucleotide sequence of the promoter region of the fetA gene was determined to assess potential variability as previously described.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Generation of isogenic strains to evaluate vaccine immunogenicity</title><p>Three genetically modified N. meningitidis strains, with combinations of high and constitutive expression of FetA and PorA or knockout mutants of these, were generated for use in serum bactericidal activity (SBA) assay to evaluate PorA and FetA-specific vaccine responses following vaccination of research animals and human volunteers (<xref rid="pone.0134353.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0134353.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0134353.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Meningococcal strains used in this study.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0134353.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0134353.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Strain</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genotype</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PorA expression <xref rid="t001fn001" ref-type="table-fn">

Exogenous human complement without intrinsic bactericidal activity was sourced from consenting healthy adults and used at 25% (vol/vol) with each target strain having a single complement source.

Repetitive sequences due to multiple copies of insertion element transposases and pseudogenes were removed when using the FAM18 annotation as the source of comparator coding sequences. Paralogous loci that matched multiple alleles were also removed from the analysis. Sequence conflicts were checked by remapping using the Bowtie version 1 short-read aligner [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For a specific locus of interest, the contig containing the locus was extracted from the isolate sequence bin and used as the reference segment.

The culture was sampled for yield (OD at 650 nm) and purity by testing with Gram stain and growth on TSA and plate count agar plates. Concentration of the cell mass was performed in a class II biosafety cabinet in a P3 GMP laboratory facility by cross-flow filtration (CFF) using a Millipore CFF filter until a final volume of 0.6&#x02013;1.1 L was reached. pH adjustment was performed by adding 0.1 M Tris/HCl (pH 8.6) with 10 mM EDTA (buffer A), and a second buffer (10% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) in Tris/HCl, pH 8.9; buffer A1) was added to obtain a final concentration of 0.5% DOC; leading to the inactivation of the cell mass and extraction of OMVs. An equal volume of Buffer A was slowly added, homogenized by magnet stirring and pH measured to ensure a pH &#x0003e; 8.0. Ninety mL of Buffer A1 was slowly added and the suspension was kept homogenous by stirring for 30 minutes and then sampled to check the inactivation procedure. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 90 minutes at 2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C, supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 19000 rpm for 10 hours.

<sup>a</sup> Listed are the two variable regions of the two genetically modified genes porA and fetA and the loci where there were sequence differences.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The first three locus differences were: a putative iron-uptake permease inner membrane protein (locus NEIS0577); a cytosine-specific DNA methyltransferase (locus NEIS0771); a putative membrane peptidase (locus NEIS1418). There was a single base pair difference in each of the first two loci and a 240bp indel, and one base pair difference in the latter. The fourth locus difference was at the NEIS1310 locus also known as modA the methylase modification gene of the Neisseria type III restriction/modification system [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The presence of a certain number of the tandem repeat &#x02018;AGCC&#x02019; can render the gene in frame (phase-variable ON) and out of frame (phase-variable OFF). The two FetA-negative strains 3043 and 3311 were phase variable ON. The highly variable pilE gene (locus NEIS0210) also differed amongst all strains tested including these four. This was mainly due to variation in the C-terminal D region of the gene; the class I type pilin in the case of these strains [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The pilS cassette region adjacent to the pilE locus in each genome was the same in 3043, 3311 and for the fragment that was present at the end of a contig for 3312 but differed by 21 bp and 7 bp in strains 2851 and 3207 respectively in the fragments of contig that were aligned to the pilS cassette region allele 29. The pilE alleles in each strain were possibly the result of recombination with different pilS cassettes: 2851 and 3207 with cassettes 19 bp and 5 bp different to the pilS allele 5 from Helm and Seifert retrieved from Genbank [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These pilS donor sequences were present unchanged in the fragment of the pilS cassette region in their respective genomes. The resulting pilE alleles in strains 2851 and 3207 were atypical with an extended C terminal which may result in a non-functional pilin subunit [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The remaining strains were putatively the result of recombination of pilS cassette alleles 2 and 5 and possibly others. The FetA VR also differed in two of the strains (F1-5 instead of F3-3) but this was due to the use of the plasmid pEAT2 [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in the preparation of the FetA knockouts which had the F1-5 VR. Remapping sequence reads using Bowtie and visualization using Tablet showed lower read depth than surrounding regions of the genome in all of these loci apart from pilE. Therefore, caution must be exercised when interpreting changes in poly nucleotide tracts and tandem and complex repeat regions, features commonly associated with phase-variable and complex genes, from draft genomes assembled from short-read data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec021"><title>Development and evaluation of the vaccine strain SMenPF1.2</title><p>The development of a capsular group B meningococcal vaccine with constitutive FetA expression was made possible by genetic modification of strain H44/76. Phenotypic characterisation of the vaccine strain showed it to have a constitutive expression of FetA of ~7% of protein, comparable to the highest level seen in OMVs derived from the wild-type strain H44/76. The fetA gene is regulated by its native, iron-repressible promoter in wild-type H44/76 and consequently FetA represents anything from one to eight percent of the total protein in wtOMV vaccines depending on culture conditions [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is not clear if 7% is the maximum expression level that can be stably attained for FetA in meningococcal outer membranes. Previous data indicate that FetA expression can be at similar levels to those seen for PorA [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and other mechanisms for regulating FetA expression may achieve higher expression levels. Nevertheless, the stable constitutive of expression of FetA was compatible with the use of the SMenPF1.2 strain to manufacture a vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Genomic effects of transformation of the vaccine strain and the evaluation panel strains</title><p>The suitability of the vaccine evaluation strains to assess FetA and PorA-specific immunity was verified in SBA against the 4 isogenic strains of the evaluation panel (<xref rid="pone.0134353.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). Whole genome sequencing of the vaccine and evaluation strain panel demonstrated that the genetic modifications also included changes outside of the PorA and FetA genes; hence, it is possible that some bactericidal effects may not be attributable to the altered PorA and FetA expression levels alone. The majority of differences were single base indels or tandem repeat differences associated with phase variation; however, many of these differences could be the result of sequencing and/or assembly errors due to the nature of these complex and/or repetitive regions. The two fetA knock-outs were phase variable ON for the type III restriction/modification system modification methylase [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] which may indicate some knock-on response to the genetic manipulation of the fetA gene. The highly variable class I pilin gene pilE was different in each of the isogenic strains in this study, underlining its ability to rapidly undergo antigenic diversification. In a global collection of 219 isolates, a different class I sequence was found in each isolate [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This exceptional ability to diversify is mediated in individual strains through unidirectional homologous recombination with multiple pilS cassettes located close to the pilE locus and was demonstrated here [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In summary, genome sequencing allowed for a high-resolution investigation of genome changes that may have occurred as a result of genetic manipulation and demonstrated that the isogenic strains showed remarkably little variation and were essentially identical. The panel of strains was therefore appropriate to elucidate the respective contributions to bactericidal activity of PorA and FetA specific antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Manufacturing process of MenB OMV vaccines&#x02014;lessons learnt</title><p>The small scale manufacturing process for OMV production developed in this study resulted in a consistent product, as indicated by quality control analyses of critical parameters. A stable production process was established, which satisfied both GMP standards and resulted in a sufficient production yield for testing OMV vaccines in phase I and II clinical trials. Advantages with the production methods employed were that they were simple, reproducible, and compatible with criteria for safe handling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The protein yield in in this small scale process (mean 0.79 mg protein per L growth medium) was lower than observed for other OMV vaccine processes. Factors affecting the yield probably included the critical micelle concentration (detergent concentration) affecting the ability of the OMVs to pass the sterility filter. The hydrophobicity and electric charge exerted by the CFF membrane, as well as the salt concentration of the buffer (zeta potential) were parameters likely to be connected with the dispersion and formation of vesicles [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Despite differences in the production processes in Norway, The Netherlands, and Cuba [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the various OMV vaccines produced in these countries have similar safety profiles [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], whereas their ability to induce SBA may differ. The latter may be related to various factors, including the target strain used in the SBA assay and the relative amount of LPS in the vaccine; a potent immune stimulator. The current 9 litre-scale process was used to manufacture three batches of vaccine, each of sufficient yield and containing a consistent amount of the PorA and FetA antigens. Each batch contained a similar amount of LPS to other OMV vaccines and met Ph. Eur requirements for endotoxin content (&#x0003c;10<sup>5</sup> IU/mL as measured by LAL gel clot assay).</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Immunogenicity and stability</title><p>The final product was highly immunogenic in potency tests in NIH mice, demonstrating a dose-response curve (<xref rid="pone.0134353.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). Comparative immunogenicity across three mouse strains showed a strong response measured in ELISA against PorA and no significant response against FetA (Figs <xref rid="pone.0134353.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0134353.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). This discrepancy between PorA and FetA responses was consistent with the fact that, within the administered dose of 2.5 &#x003bc;g total OMV protein, approximately 0.54 &#x003bc;g (21.7%) of this was PorA and 0.19 &#x003bc;g (7.7%) was FetA. Bactericidal antibody testing of serum pools from mice immunized as part of potency testing in batch release and stability testing showed that there was practically no contribution of FetA to the bactericidal activity observed (Figs <xref rid="pone.0134353.g008" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0134353.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). The immunogenicity of both PorA and FetA has been well documented in previous studies, and in particular the role of IgG against PorA in inducing protective antibodies in humans. This latter aspect is not as well characterised for FetA, and will be important to establish in a phase I clinical trial with the MenPF-1 vaccine. The vaccine evaluation panel described in this study will be instrumental to delineate the ability of anti-FetA IgG to mediate bactericidal activity.</p><p>The product was stable, meeting the same identity and purity specifications after 24 months as upon release. Although ELISA-based potency results varied during the observation period (<xref rid="pone.0134353.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>), results from SBA performed on pools of sera from mice immunized with MenPF-1 batches stored for up to 24 months did not suggest any decline in the functional antibody effect (<xref rid="pone.0134353.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0134353.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). Previous studies indicate that aluminium-adjuvanted deoxycholate extracted OMV vaccines are stable for at least 1 year [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and the shelf-life of the MenPF-1 vaccine was consistent with this.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Toxicological evaluation of the MenPF-1 OMV vaccine</title><p>The toxicological profiling of rabbits exposed to 4 intramuscular injections of the MenPF-1 vaccine (i.e. one more than typically administered with the MeNZB and MenBvac OMV vaccines in adults) showed inflammation at the injection site, as well as lymph node enlargement and other signs indicative of an inflammatory response (<xref rid="pone.0134353.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). This was in line with treatment-related findings typically seen in repeat-dose studies with parenterally administered vaccines, as recently reviewed [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Changes observed in this type of studies are typically not severe and are transient. The strong anti-OMV IgG response mounted following administration of MenPF-1 indicates the relevancy of the rabbit model and the doses used for assessing toxicology. The findings are also consistent with previous experience using aluminium adjuvanted vaccines, with expected presence of local inflammation. In addition to boosting the immunological response, another role of the adjuvant for OMVs is to adsorb the free LPS and hence reduce the toxicity of the dOMVs. Ultimately, the vaccine was considered to be well tolerated, if moderately reactogenic, and satisfied the E.U. requirements for testing in a phase I clinical trial [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Future role of OMV vaccines in prevention of meningococcal disease</title><p>Major strengths of using detergent-extracted OMVs from wild-type meningococci as vaccine formulations are that they: (i) are immunogenic and protective, inducing functional antibodies, and (ii) have an established track record of safe effective use in humans. Recent data on the safety and efficacy of the MeNZB OMV vaccines in clinical use in New Zealand supports our manufacturing process as a platform technology for vaccine development [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. MenB vaccine development has in the last decade focused on recombinant OMPs and native OMV vaccines; however, recombinant proteins were found to be more immunogenic when combined with a dOMV [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The recently licensed four component vaccine (4CMenB), consists of similar OMVs to the MeNZB vaccine combined with three recombinant protein antigens identified from meningococcal genome sequence data. Although the performance of a novel MenB vaccine to a large extent can be estimated based on epidemiological mapping, a clinical trial of the MenPF-1 OMV vaccine should be pursued to enable assessment of FetA specific responses in humans.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>The MenPF vaccine concept</title><p>The rationale underpinning the MenPF vaccine is that epidemiological data indicate that the meningococcal PorA and FetA antigens exhibit repertoire structuring and diversity consistent with their generating a protective human immune response in vivo [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although the extensive repertoire of these antigens presents an apparent problem for the design of a broadly cross-protective vaccine that include these antigens, the repertoire structuring apparent in natural population of meningococcal is such a that a multivalent vaccine consisting of relatively few variants has the potential to offer a high level of coverage of invasive meningococci [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This approach contrasts with the development of the currently licensed recombinant protein-based vaccines (4CMenB and the RP2086 fHbp), in which the antigenic components were chosen from a single untypical isolate and subsequently assessed for their ability to elicit cross-reactive antibodies.</p><p>The current study was a first step in the proof-of-concept for the MenPF approach to the prevention of meningococcal disease. We were not able to define a separate contribution of FetA-specific antibodies to the bactericidal response to the vaccine through the immunogenicity studies here described. This could be further studied by assessing other target strains in SBA with a heterologous PorA, controlling for the variable wt FetA expression if possible. Secondly adsorption of sera with rFetA could prove useful. Finally, the bactericidal effect of FetA antibodies could be part of a synergistic SBA effect and be masked by other antibodies in combination in the SBA. A separate study demonstrated that one to four immunizations of mice with 2.5 &#x003bc;g protein per dose induced a small but significantly higher SBA GMT against the vaccine strain SMenPF1.2 compared to against the strain 3043 (FetA off, PorA wt) when assessed using rabbit complement, but not with human complement [Sanders et al. Manuscript PONE-D-14-43371, in revision]. The same study further showed that human complement SBA GMTs were higher against the vaccine strain SMenPF1.2 than against the FetA wild type strain H44/76; the latter expressing a lower level of FetA. The current study has demonstrated that the MenPF-1 vaccine likely is suitably safe for testing in a clinical phase I trial, and the study by Sanders et al. that FetA specific antibodies induced following vaccination may have a small but significant role in conferring bactericidal antibodies following MenPF vaccination. On the basis of previous studies with the MenBvac OMV vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], a high seroconversion rate with anti-PorA IgG induced will likely be observed with the MenPF-1 vaccine in a clinical trial. A key focus will however be to study the relative contribution of FetA antibodies to the induction of protective immunity. We have recently proceeded to evaluate this vaccine in phase I human studies with the data supporting the safety and immunogenicity of this approach, and demonstrating the induction of FetA bactericidal antibodies in humans [<xref rid="pone.0134353.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Further studies are required to investigate the species-specific differences of the ability of FetA to induce bactericidal antibodies, and to which extent the FetA dose level and source of complement affects this evaluation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134353.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Genomic differences.</title><p>Graphical map of H44/76 circular genome, with labels indication genomic positions of loci differing between the vaccine strain SMenPF1.2 and the evaluation strains 3043, 3311 and 3312.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134353.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134353.s002"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>GLP study report.</title><p>Toxicity evaluation of the vaccine MenPF-1 (lot FMOX1102) when given by intramuscular injection for 4 occasions over a 9-week period to New Zealand White rabbits.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134353.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0134353.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Supplemental data.</title><p>Raw data from meningococcal culture, antigenic characterisation of vaccine preparations or sera from mice immunised with OMV vaccine.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0134353.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Bruce Robertson and Elizabeth Donald (Charles River, Pre-Clinical Services, Edinburgh) are thanked for their scientific contributions in the GLP toxicology study.
