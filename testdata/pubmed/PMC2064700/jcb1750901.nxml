We demonstrate that VDAC1 is physically linked to the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release channel inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) through the molecular chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (grp75). Functional interaction between the channels was shown by the recombinant expression of the ligand-binding domain of the IP<sub>3</sub>R on the ER or mitochondrial surface, which directly enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in mitochondria. Knockdown of grp75 abolished the stimulatory effect, highlighting chaperone-mediated conformational coupling between the IP<sub>3</sub>R and the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake machinery. Because organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis influences fundamentally cellular functions and death signaling, the central location of grp75 may represent an important control point of cell fate and pathogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>G.

Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, via a yet to be identified Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel of the inner mitochondrial membrane (the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter), regulates processes as diverse as aerobic metabolism (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hajnoczky et al., 1995</xref>), release of caspase cofactors (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Pinton et al., 2001</xref>), and feedback control of neighboring ER or plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hajnoczky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gilabert and Parekh, 2000</xref>). A corollary of the efficient mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake during IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is the close apposition of ER and outer mitochondrial membranes (OMM; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Mannella et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rizzuto et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Marsh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Frey et al., 2002</xref>). The molecular determinants of this crosstalk, however, are still largely unknown (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Walter and Hajnoczky, 2005</xref>). Recently, PACS2, which is an ER-associated vesicular-sorting protein, was proposed to link the ER to mitochondria (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Simmen et al., 2005</xref>). The knockdown of PACS2 led to stress-mediated uncoupling of the organelles, which was also reflected by the inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal transmission.</p><p>On the other side, the abundant OMM channel voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) was also suggested to participate in the interaction. It was shown to be present at ER&#x02013;mitochondrial contacts and to mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> channeling to the intermembrane space from the high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] microdomain generated by the opening of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gincel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rapizzi et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, VDAC1 mediates metabolic flow through the OMM, forming an ATP microdomain close to the ER and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases (SERCAs; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Ventura-Clapier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Vendelin et al., 2004</xref>), and both VDAC1 and VDAC2 take part in metabolic and apoptotic protein complexes (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Colombini, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lemasters and Holmuhamedov, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The transfer and assembly of components of cellular protein complexes were shown to be assisted by molecular chaperones, adding a novel function to their role in nascent protein folding (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Soti et al., 2005</xref>). Accordingly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding&#x02013;, heat shock&#x02013;, and glucose-regulated chaperone family members are abundantly present along the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer axis, linking the ER and mitochondrial networks. Well known examples are the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding chaperones of the ER lumen (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Michalak et al., 2002</xref>), immunophilins interacting with ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release channels and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bultynck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Forte and Bernardi, 2005</xref>), and several heat shock family members localized at the mitochondrial membranes, which are proposed to interact with the components of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, such as VDAC (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">He and Lemasters, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gupta and Knowlton, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wadhwa et al., 2005</xref>). Still, their exact role at the ER&#x02013;mitochondria interface is not well known, although recently, weak links between chaperones were proposed to stabilize signaling and organellar cellular networks (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Csermely, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Soti et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Considering the central position of VDAC at the ER&#x02013;mitochondrial interface outlined in the previous paragraphs, we used VDAC1 as a starting point for protein biochemical studies, to explore molecular interactions between the ER and mitochondrial networks. We found that through the OMM-associated fraction of the glucose-regulated protein 75 (grp75) chaperone (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Zahedi et al., 2006</xref>), VDAC1 interacts with the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release channel IP<sub>3</sub>R. Organellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements, using targeted recombinant Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes, confirmed functional interaction between the IP<sub>3</sub>R and the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake machinery, which was abolished by grp75 knockdown.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>VDAC1, grp75, and IP<sub>3</sub>Rs are present in a macromolecular complex at the ER&#x02013;mitochondria interface</title><p>We performed yeast two-hybrid screens of human liver and kidney LexA-AD&#x02013;fused libraries, using rat VDAC1-LexA-DNA- BD fusion protein as bait. Among the putative interactors we found cytoskeletal elements, which were previously thought to participate in sorting of VDAC or in mitochondrial dynamics (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Varadi et al., 2004</xref>) and a group of chaperone proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). To investigate whether the chaperones participate in mediating organelle interactions, we focused our attention on the human heat shock 70 kD protein 9B/grp75 (nt 1,456&#x02013;2,089 from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BC000478">BC000478</ext-link>; aa 471&#x02013;681). The yeast homologue of grp75 is part of the protein import motor associated with TIM23 in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Neupert and Brunner, 2002</xref>), but it was also found in the cytosol and in OMM-associated high molecular weight protein complexes (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Ran et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Danial et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Zahedi et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, two further findings indicated that grp75 may be involved in ER&#x02013;mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer: first, its C-terminal domain reduced the voltage dependence and cation selectivity of VDAC1 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzer et al., 2002</xref>), and second, grp75 overexpression was shown to promote cell proliferation and protect against Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated cell death (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wadhwa et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table I.</label><caption><p>

(1993)</xref>. For details see Supplementary materials and methods. Approximately 90% of the clones contained a sub-sequence of the ER-resident chaperone heat shock 70-kD protein 5 (HSPA5, grp-78), most probably reflecting the requirement of efficient folding of the VDAC1 protein in yeast. The results of sequencing of the remaining clones are shown in the table.

We took advantage of a previously developed method to purify a mitochondria-associated ER subfraction (mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) fraction [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Vance, 1990</xref>]). The MAM was previously shown to be enriched in lipid synthases and transferases (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Vance, 2003</xref>), and it likely represents the membrane microdomain engaged in ER&#x02013;mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Filippin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Szabadkai and Rizzuto, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, immunoblot screening of the MAM fraction, purified from rat liver and HeLa cells, revealed the presence of grp75, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels from both the OMM (VDAC1) and the ER (IP<sub>3</sub>R; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In liver cells, given the higher yield, the microsomal fraction and the different mitochondrial extracts (the crude mitochondrial pellet [Mito C], the low-density MAM, and the high-density mitochondrial fraction containing the matrix proteins [Mito P]) were separately analyzed. As expected, VDAC and grp75 are not enriched in the MAM, given that the former is highly expressed throughout the OM (because of its role in ion and metabolite diffusion) and the latter is mostly in the matrix (but the two pools show different macromolecular assembles; see following paragraph). Conversely, the IP<sub>3</sub>R, besides the microsomes, is present in the crude mitochondria and the MAM fractions and is absent in the purified mitochondria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>

The presence of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs was shown by using a non&#x02013;isotype-specific monoclonal antibody. VDAC1 and grp75 were both present in the MAM, whereas it was free of contamination from inner membrane (Cox-II) and matrix (MnSOD; C) proteins. Different preparations are separated by the dotted line. Blots are representative of more than five experiments. (B) Blue-native and SDS-PAGE 2D separation of the MAM fraction (below BN) and Mito P proteins (above BN; for preparation of native subcellular fractions, see Materials and methods and A). The native fractions were solubilized and separated on an acrylamide gradient gel in the first dimension. The capillary gel was stacked over a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated, and the proteins were immunoblotted against the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs, grp75, and VDAC1. A typical result of an immunoblot from three separate experiments is shown. (C) The MAM and Mito P fractions (50 &#x003bc;g of proteins) were subjected to proteinase K digestion (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) and the presence of grp75 and MnSOD was revealed by immunoblotting. Hyposmotic shock (50 mM mannitol, 5 mM Hepes, and 0.1 mM EGTA for 30 min at room temperature) was applied to the Mito P fraction to induce release of matrix proteins.

For this purpose, we separately analyzed the MAM and the Mito P fractions by 2D Blue native (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>; first dimension, central part of the image) and SDS-PAGE protein separation. In the latter dimension, grp75, IP<sub>3</sub>R, and VDAC were revealed by immunoblotting. Although VDAC1 was present in different amounts in complexes of a wide molecular weight range, we found a specific complex characterized by the presence of VDAC, the IP<sub>3</sub>R, and grp75, suggesting their interaction in the native state. The specificity of the complex formation of VDAC, the IP<sub>3</sub>R, and grp75 was corroborated by the finding that SERCA2b showed different localization in the 2D separation (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200608073/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200608073/DC1</ext-link>). In Mito P, grp75 was found in lower molecular weight complexes (&#x0003c;400 kD), which is similar to previous data in yeast (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dekker et al., 1997</xref>), confirming that grp75 is involved in high molecular weight protein&#x02013;protein interactions only in the MAM. To confirm the different location of the two grp75 pools, we verified that whereas the matrix-localized grp75 was resistant to proteinase K digestion (similar to the matrix enzyme MnSOD; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), grp75 of the MAM fraction was degraded by the enzyme, documenting its association with the cytosolic surface of mitochondria.</p><p>To further investigate the arrangement of the grp75&#x02013;VDAC&#x02013;IP<sub>3</sub>R complex, we used coimmunoprecipitation studies of the involved proteins. Immunoprecipitation of both IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and VDAC led to the coprecipitation of grp75 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>, respectively), but no IP<sub>3</sub>R was found in the VDAC precipitate, and no VDAC was detectable in the IP<sub>3</sub>R precipitate. However, immunoprecipitation of grp75 led to the copurification of both VDAC and the IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). These results strongly suggest that grp75 has a central role in setting up the protein complex with VDAC and the IP<sub>3</sub>R.

This scheme was also supported by previous studies showing that the ligand-binding domain of the IP<sub>3</sub>R (aa 224&#x02013;605; denoted as IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub>), located on the surface of the cytoplasmic domain, participates in intramolecular interactions with other IP<sub>3</sub>R domains (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Boehning and Joseph, 2000</xref>), as well as in linking the receptor with other protein partners (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bosanac et al., 2004</xref>). To assess a direct role of the IP<sub>3</sub>R in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, we coexpressed in HeLa cells mRFP1-tagged IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> with cytosolic (cytAEQ) or mitochondrially targeted (mtAEQmut) aequorin-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes, and evaluated global and organellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to agonist stimulation. After reconstitution with the aequorin cofactor coelenterazine, cells were challenged with histamine (in incremental doses from 1 to 100 &#x003bc;M), and luminescence was measured and converted to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Recombinant expression of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> caused a marked increase in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake at each agonist concentration applied, in spite of reduced cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>), because of IP<sub>3</sub> buffering and consequent reduction of IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 [A and B]</xref> and Fig. S2 [available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200608073/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200608073/DC1</ext-link>] for the lower agonist concentrations). The effect of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> was presumably exerted on the OMM because targeting the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> to the OMM surface (by fusing to an N-terminal AKAP1 domain) augmented its stimulatory effect (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> for intracellular localization of the mRFP1-tagged construct and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> for the effect on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>).

Still, most importantly, expression of the ER-targeted IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> augmented mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation after cellular stimulation by histamine, similar to what was observed upon expression of the OMM-targeted IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref> shows the intracellular localization of ER-IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> shows the stimulatory effect of ER-IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>).

We first verified that the effect of IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is independent of IP<sub>3</sub> buffering. For this purpose, we used a point-mutated (K508A) IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub>, which is unable to bind IP<sub>3</sub>. The K508 mutant increased the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> rise in a manner similar to the wild-type (although slightly less efficient), but, as expected, did not modify the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> response (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). The capacity of an IP<sub>3</sub>-insensitive IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> to enhance mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake was also confirmed in digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells. In this case, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is exclusively dictated by the perfused [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], and it is totally independent of IP<sub>3</sub>R activity. In permeabilized cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake was triggered by the perfusion of an intracellular buffer containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffered at 1 &#x003bc;M. Under those conditions, in which protein interactions might have been affected by the application of digitonin, both the wild-type and the K508A OMM-IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> increased the rate of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, although also in this case the wild-type was more efficient (14.71 &#x000b1; 4.66% increase, <italic>n</italic> = 25, P &#x0003c; 0.01 vs. 6.58 &#x000b1; 4.23% increase, <italic>n</italic> = 25, P &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>The notion that IP<sub>3</sub> binding cannot account for the mitochondrial effect was further confirmed by the demonstration that a structurally unrelated IP<sub>3</sub>-binding protein domain, the PH domain of the PLC-like protein p130 (p130PH; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2005</xref>), targeted to the OMM, reduced both the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> responses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Interestingly, the reduction of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> response was more pronounced for the OMM-targeted PH domain than for the untargeted cytosolic version of the IP<sub>3</sub> buffer, although the two proteins were equally effective on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>. These data (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200608073/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200608073/DC1</ext-link>) further stress the strict dependence of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis on the ER&#x02013; mitochondrial contacts, and thus on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release occurring in these microdomains.</p><p>The IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> was also shown to play an important role in the regulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R channel activity by interacting with the N-terminal repressor domain (aa 1&#x02013;223; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Boehning and Joseph, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Varnai et al., 2005</xref>). Still, expressing the entire N-terminal surface domain of the IP<sub>3</sub>R, targeted to the exterior of the OMM (OMM-IP<sub>3</sub>R<sub>1-604</sub>), augmented mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). These results exclude that the stimulatory effect of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> was exerted through unmasking this intramolecular interaction in the endogenous IP<sub>3</sub>R; instead, they support a model in which the entire N-terminal IP<sub>3</sub>R exerts direct activation on the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake machinery.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the regulatory activity on mitochondria of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> when the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> rise is elicited in the cell by the opening of plasma membrane channels. Under those conditions, not only the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> rise is IP<sub>3</sub>R-independent, but the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> and ensuing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> increases are markedly slower and smaller than upon ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. We thus measured [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> after emptying the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> pool with the SERCA blocker tert-butyl-benzohydroquinone (tBHQ) in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium and re-adding CaCl<sub>2</sub>. This protocol induces capacitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, causing a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> rise and subsequent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. As presented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub>&#x02013;expressing cells showed an &#x0223c;60% increase in the influx-dependent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> response (top), even if the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> rise remained unaltered (bottom). This increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> was almost doubled, as compared with the effect after histamine-/IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Thus, we concluded that local IP<sub>3</sub> buffering masks the stimulatory effect of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> upon ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, and, indeed, the effect of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD is established at the ER&#x02013;mitochondrial contacts.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>

A first series of experiments showed that strong inhibition of grp75 expression (48 h after transfection) in itself strongly reduced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, most probably because of alterations of mitochondrial function through inhibition of protein import and &#x00394;&#x003c8;<sub>m</sub> loss (unpublished data). Thus, we opted for a lower silencing efficiency by conducting experiments 24 h after transfection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, inset). We expressed control and grp75 siRNAs in HeLa cells, cotransfecting them with the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> construct and mtAEQmut. Under those conditions, grp75 siRNA had no effect on the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> response to histamine stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). However, the down-regulation of grp75 prevented the stimulatory effect on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub>, which was expressed both on the OMM and the ER surface (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Thus, we concluded that grp75 is not only physically associated with the IP<sub>3</sub>R&#x02013;VDAC1 complex, but is also necessary for functional coupling between these proteins. These results also show that although moderate knockdown of grp75 does not interfere with its function in the mitochondrial matrix, in accordance with previous results on mitochondrial protein import (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sanjuan Szklarz et al., 2005</xref>), the low amount of grp75 at the ER&#x02013;mitochondrial contacts is a limiting factor for the stimulatory effect of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>

Most likely caused by its differentially localized pools, grp75 appeared to modify mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake after IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through diverse mechanisms. Indeed, as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 (A and B)</xref>, overexpression of the wild-type protein led to reduced histamine-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> response. However, at the same time, it also significantly decreased the steady-state [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>er</sub> level (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, right), thus, reducing the driving force for IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, which in turn might be responsible for the dampened mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation. This parallel reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>er</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> may reflect two different effects of grp75: (1) OMM-localized grp75, presumably through the interaction with the IP<sub>3</sub>R or other members of the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling machinery, may increase the Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak from the ER through the IP<sub>3</sub>R, as previously shown for Bcl-2 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Pinton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bassik et al., 2004</xref>); (2) matrix-localized grp75 may modify mitochondrial parameters (e.g., pH) or import of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling proteins, leading to altered mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, as well as the ATP supply for ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation through the SERCA pumps. To dissect these effects, we again used the approach of measuring IP<sub>3</sub>-independent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>uptake after capacitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. In addition, to distinguish OMM-based effects from those in the mitochondrial matrix, we expressed a truncated grp75 lacking the N-terminal 51-aa mitochondrial-targeting sequence, and thus unable to enter the mitochondrial matrix. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was induced by depleting the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store with tBHQ in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as described in the previous section (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This &#x0201c;cytosolic&#x0201d; form of grp75 (grp75<sub>cyt</sub>) did not change the bulk cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] response to readdition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular medium, but significantly increased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). Moreover, grp75<sub>cyt</sub> further potentiated the stimulatory effect of IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>), confirming the results obtained with siRNA grp75 and proving that the amount of grp75 present at the OMM in the VDAC&#x02013;grp75&#x02013;IP<sub>3</sub>R complex is a limiting factor of the positive effect of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Lastly, by coexpressing grp75<sub>cyt</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub>, we achieved a very high stimulation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake rate during capacitative Ca<sup>2+</sup>influx (i.e., upon the increase of bulk [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> to &#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;M). Thus, we concluded that the VDAC&#x02013;grp75&#x02013;IP<sub>3</sub>R complex renders mitochondria more sensitive at low extramitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], as compared with higher local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> increases during IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (compare the effect of IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> or <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).

Thus, only a small fraction of the protein appears to be involved directly in preprotein translocation (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dekker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Sanjuan Szklarz et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting the existence of different pools of the protein. Previous work also reported extramitochondrial localization of grp75 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Ran et al., 2000</xref>), and its interaction with extramitochondrial proteins such as the cytosolic p53 or the ER luminal grp94 (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Takano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Wadhwa et al., 2002b</xref>), although the mechanisms that control the differential sorting of the protein are still completely unknown. According to our immunofluorescence and GFP-tagging studies in HeLa cells grp75 shows complete mitochondrial localization, but obviously cannot be discriminated from an OMM-associated pool. Biochemical studies, however, demonstrate that a matrix-localized pool participates in forming complexes in the 200&#x02013;400-kD range and represents the major fraction of the total mitochondrial grp75 content, whereas a minor grp75 pool resides in the low-density (MAM) mitochondrial fraction, participating in complexes in the megaDalton range and comprising OMM and ER membrane proteins. To further support an independent function of the nonmatrix pool, we constructed a grp75 mutant lacking the mitochondrial presequence, and thus incompetent for import in the matrix. This protein retained the capacity to enhance mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation, strongly arguing for the notion that this role of grp75 is not only independent from its chaperone activity in the matrix but also depends on a physically separated protein pool.</p><p>How is the newly identified regulatory activity on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake exerted? In principle, two different mechanisms can be envisioned. In the first, grp75 could be involved in scaffolding the ER&#x02013;mitochondria contacts, and thus determines the number of sites in which mitochondria are exposed to the high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] microdomains generated at the mouth of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs. Fluorescent labeling studies of the ER and mitochondria revealed a partial (5&#x02013;20%) colocalization, reflecting these interactions. However, no increase in colocalization has been observed by overexpression of grp75 (or of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub>; unpublished data), suggesting that they do not directly function as structural determinants of the contacts. In a second scenario, grp75 could control the interaction of ER and mitochondrial proteins at the existing organelle contacts, and thus allow cross-talk between signaling partners, e.g., the ion channels of the two membranes. Indeed, grp75, as shown by its knockdown and overexpression models, was necessary and sufficient for the stimulatory effect of the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Moreover, the proteomic data also highlight the central role of grp75 in this interaction. VDAC and IP<sub>3</sub>Rs coprecipitate with grp75, and the chaperone is coimmunoprecipitated by both anti-IP<sub>3</sub>R and -VDAC antibodies, indicating that it is the key assembling molecule in the loose interaction between the two ion channels.</p><p>Within the IP<sub>3</sub>R&#x02013;grp75&#x02013;VDAC complex, potentiation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation by the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> does not require IP<sub>3</sub> binding, as demonstrated by the fact that it is retained by the K508A mutant, which is unable to bind IP<sub>3</sub> (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Varnai et al., 2005</xref>). Although the mutant shows the same stimulatory effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), one should remember that wild-type IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub>, because of IP<sub>3</sub> buffering, reduces ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, and thus conclude that the wild type is somewhat more effective than the mutant. To further confirm independence from IP<sub>3</sub> buffering, we measured mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake after capacitative influx through the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Also, under those experimental conditions, the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> potently stimulated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake.</p><p>As for the molecular mechanism of the effect on the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> machinery, different scenarios could be envisioned. In the first, the recombinantly expressed IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD, both from the OMM and ER side, could interact with the endogenous IP<sub>3</sub>R itself, and modify the probability of its interaction with grp75/VDAC. Indeed, it was previously shown that intramolecular interactions between different domains of the IP<sub>3</sub>R, such as the 224&#x02013;605 minimal IP<sub>3</sub>-binding domain and the 1&#x02013;223 N-terminal repression domain, regulate IP<sub>3</sub>R channel opening upon IP<sub>3</sub> binding. Thus, one could hypothesize that the high expression levels of IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> represses an interaction between the extreme N-terminal of the endogenous receptor and grp75/VDAC. To clarify this issue, we expressed the whole (aa 1&#x02013;604) IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD, which is targeted to the OMM. The IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>1-604</sub> had the same effect as IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub>, thus, excluding competition of these two cytoplasmic, N-terminal domains of the IP<sub>3</sub>R. In the second, simpler scenario, the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub> mimics the effect of the endogenous IP<sub>3</sub>R. Thus, it directly enhances mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by maximizing, within the macromolecular complex, the interaction with the mitochondrial VDAC channel. Indeed, the density of the exogenous IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD<sub>224-605</sub>, based on fluorescence labeling (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Varnai et al., 2005</xref>) and Scatchard plot analysis of IP<sub>3</sub> binding (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wibo and Godfraind, 1994</xref>), can be assumed to be at least one order of magnitude higher than the endogenous receptor, and indeed, high expression levels were necessary for the effect of IP<sub>3</sub>R on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake.</p><p>The central role of grp75 in the IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD&#x02013;induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake was clearly shown by the siRNA-driven silencing of the protein, leading to the abolition of the effect. Conversely, high-level expression of grp75 induced a compound effect involving at least three different locations, as follows: (1) the ER, decreasing the steady [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>er</sub> level; (2) the OMM, interacting with VDAC, whose permeability/ion selectivity was shown to be modified by grp-75 binding (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzer et al., 2002</xref>); and (3) the mitochondrial matrix, modifying mitochondrial parameters, such as pH or Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity. Expression of the cytosolic grp75 and measurement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx&#x02013;induced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake allowed us to eliminate the intramitochondrial effect and changes of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling. Importantly, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in this approach was markedly increased, and grp75<sub>cyt</sub> potentiated the effect of OMM-IP<sub>3</sub>R-LBD, clarifying the effect of the OMM-associated pool of grp75.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that the IP<sub>3</sub>R is part of a signaling complex that directly controls Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into mitochondria. Much remains to be understood, but by these results the concept of macromolecular assembly of signaling elements, previously put forward for several plasma membrane channels, can be extended to defined microdomains at the ER&#x02013;mitochondrial interface. Such an arrangement highlights novel routes for pharmacological intervention that may be used for the modulation of downstream events such as metabolism and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid screening</title><p>Yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out using the pLexA system according to the protocol of <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gyuris et al.
