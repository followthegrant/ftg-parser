a driver for many biological processes, phosphorylation remains
an area of intense research interest. Advances in multiplexed quantitation
utilizing isobaric tags (e.g., TMT and iTRAQ) have the potential to
create a new paradigm in quantitative proteomics. New instrumentation
and software are propelling these multiplexed workflows forward, which
results in more accurate, sensitive, and reproducible quantitation
across tens of thousands of phosphopeptides. This study assesses the
performance of multiplexed quantitative phosphoproteomics on the Orbitrap
Fusion mass spectrometer. Utilizing a two-phosphoproteome model of
precursor ion interference, we assessed the accuracy of phosphopeptide
quantitation across a variety of experimental approaches. These methods
included the use of synchronous precursor selection (SPS) to enhance
TMT reporter ion intensity and accuracy. We found that (i) ratio distortion
remained a problem for phosphopeptide analysis in multiplexed quantitative
workflows, (ii) ratio distortion can be overcome by the use of an
SPS-MS3 scan, (iii) interfering ions generally possessed a different
charge state than the target precursor, and (iv) selecting only the
phosphate neutral loss peak (single notch) for the MS3 scan still
provided accurate ratio measurements. Remarkably, these data suggest
that the underlying cause of interference may not be due to coeluting
and cofragmented peptides but instead from consistent, low level background
fragmentation. Finally, as a proof-of-concept 10-plex experiment,
we compared phosphopeptide levels from five murine brains to five
livers. In total, the SPS-MS3 method quantified 38&#x0202f;247 phosphopeptides,
corresponding to 11&#x0202f;000 phosphorylation sites. With 10 measurements
recorded for each phosphopeptide, this equates to more than 628&#x0202f;000
binary comparisons collected in less than 48 h.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ac503934f</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ac-2014-03934f</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="sec1">As a key

a homogenizer in SDS lysis buffer [2.0% SDS w/v, 250 mM NaCl, PhosSTOP

residues alkylated with iodoacetamide (14 mM) in the dark (30 min).
Protein was extracted by methanol&#x02013;chloroform precipitation
and subsequent ice cold acetone washes. Pellets were dried and resuspended
in 8 M urea containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5). Protein concentrations

the amount of starting material, it is prudent to consider the costs
of TMT reagents. The methods have been optimized to incorporate TMT
labeling post phosphopeptide enrichment, resulting in a significant
cost reduction. For example, TMT labeling post phosphopeptide enrichment
results in at least a 40-fold reduction in peptide concentration,

All other experiments utilized only the Mouse UniProt database. In

interference measurements from peptides shared by yeast and mouse,
the 2-phosphoproteome FASTA database was ordered such that protein

channel followed that of the MS3 single notch method (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Distributions were tight and centered about
the expected ratio of 5:1. However, as more of the MS2 spectral space
was included in the MS3 scan, we observed a subtle shift in the distributions
of ratios (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C&#x02013;E). This is apparent
as the difference between the noninterference distribution (blue)
and the interference distribution (red) increased as the number of
notches increased. The correlation between the increase in TMT reporter
ion distortion and the number of notches is likely a phenomenon specific
to phosphopeptide analyses (see below).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Neutral Loss and TMT Accuracy</title><p>A common characteristic
of phosphopeptide analysis is the presence of a dominant neutral loss
peak following CID fragmentation. We examined the 2-phosphoproteome
data set to assess the impact, if any, a dominant phosphate neutral
loss fragment plays in quantitative accuracy. Identification of typical
phosphate neutral loss fragments was accomplished by searching MS2
spectra for fragment ions corresponding to the expected neutral loss
masses based on precursor charge state and <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> (see <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Experimental Procedures</xref>).</p><p>Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A depicts the proportion of mouse
phosphopeptides with and without a neutral loss fragment (neutral
loss greater than 10% of base peak intensity). An overwhelming 82%
of phosphopeptides exhibited a neutral loss fragment following CID
fragmentation. Among those phosphopeptides that produced a neutral
loss, 70% of the neutral loss fragments were identified as the most
intense fragment in the MS2 spectrum, which translates to 57% of all
phosphopeptides. Across phosphopeptide charge states 2&#x02013;5, neutral
loss fragments are consistently observed; although, as previously
reported the intensity of the neutral loss decreases as charge state
increases (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, inset).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(A) Production of a neutral loss fragment from the single notch
MS3 experiment was assessed and determined that 82% of mouse phosphopeptides
yielded a neutral loss of phosphoric acid. In total, 50% of the neutral
loss fragments were the most intense ion in the spectrum. (Inset)
A neutral loss fragment was routinely present among charge states
two and three. The intensity of the neutral loss fragment decreased
as the charge state increased. (B) Phosphopeptides containing a rank
one neutral loss, from the single notch MS3 method, were selected,
and the mean relative TMT abundances were determined for each channel
(error bars &#x000b1; 1 SD). Channels containing interference (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 126/127/128) and without interference
(<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 129/130/131) are shown. Ratios
between channels with and without interference were near expected
values (10:1, 5:1), which indicated that the neutral loss fragment
ion was a viable MS3 precursor ion that maintains the quantitative
accuracy of the method.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ac-2014-03934f_0003" id="gr3" position="float"/></fig><p>For the SPS methods, we observed an increase in the degree
of TMT
reporter inaccuracy as the number of MS2 fragment ions included in
the MS3 analysis was increased. The SPS-MS3 approach utilizes an intensity
based rank order when selecting MS2 fragments ions. That is, for a
single notch MS3 method, the most intense ion will be isolated for
subsequent MS3; for a three notch SPS method, the three most intense
fragment ions will be selected and so on. We believe that the increase
in interference may be due to the neutral loss retaining the bulk
of the precursor ion population, as observed by the rank order intensity
of the neutral loss. The inclusion of additional MS2 fragment ions
via the SPS-MS3 method results in an increase in the amount of MS2 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> space included in the MS3 spectrum
without a corresponding increase in the target precursor ion population.
This contrasts directly with nonphosphorylated peptides, which exhibit
heterogeneous fragmentation, where additional notches in the SPS-MS3
method will likely correspond to additional fragment ions from the
intended precursor. For nonphosphorylated peptides this ultimately
provides a proportionate increase of <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> space and target precursor ion current (Supp. Figure 1 in the <xref rid="notes-2" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). Therefore, a future
iteration of the SPS-MS3 method could include an online, dynamic adjustment
of the number of notches in order to account for the heterogeneity
of the MS2 fragment ion population.</p><p>In order to isolate the
effect, if any, of the neutral loss fragment
on quantitative accuracy, we only looked at the quantitative accuracy
of the population of phosphopeptides where the most intense fragment
ion corresponded to the neutral loss of the phosphate group. Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B displays a summary of TMT reporter ion intensities
for this select group of phosphopeptides from the single notch MS3
experiment. The noninterference channels (blue bars) produced ratios
of 9.9:1 (10:1 expected) and 4.8:1 (5:1 expected). The interference
channels (red bars) produced remarkably similar ratios of 9.7:1 and
5.1:1 (10:1 and 5:1 expected, respectively). This suggests that the
inclusion of a neutral loss fragment within the MS3 method does not
significantly affect the accuracy of the TMT quantitation. Furthermore,
this supports the notion that reporter ion interference may be caused
by species that are not the same charge state and mass as the target
precursor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Large-Scale Comparison

differs from proteome analysis in at least
two ways. First, phosphopeptide enrichment creates a sample of dramatically
reduced complexity (and potential interference) since most peptides
do not contain a phosphate molecule. Nevertheless, we detected significant
distortion using the 2-proteome model where both proteomes were made
up of phosphopeptides, demonstrating that interference remains a problem
for phosphorylation analysis. The starting amounts for phosphorylation
analysis are up to 100 times greater than for proteome analysis. Thus,
the phospho-enriched mixture from 10 mg of starting material may actually
be of similar complexity to the 100 &#x003bc;g of proteome material.</p><p>Second, MS/MS spectra derived from phosphopeptides are commonly
dominated by an intense fragment ion corresponding to the neutral
loss (NL) of phosphoric acid. Prior to this work, there was some concern
that the NL peak might correspond with a significant population of
interfering ions. However, excluding these peaks was not an option
because it would limit the resulting TMT-MS3 reporter ion population
too much. We found that ratio accuracy was only minimally affected
by including the NL peak. Indeed, using a single MS3 notch, which
selected the NL peak as the only source for MS3 ions, did not result
in significant ratio distortion. These results strongly suggest that
ratio distortion is caused by species that are coisolated at the MS1
level and that differ in charge state from the target ion. This finding
is in agreement with the previous work by Coon and colleagues that
demonstrated that an alternative TMT purification technique based
on a proton transfer reaction (PTR) also improves quantitative accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> On the basis of these results, we no longer believe that ratio distortion
is caused by coeluting peptides, which are coisolated and cofragmented.
Rather, we suspect that the majority of interference is likely caused
by sustained, low levels of singly charged fragment ions created through
the electrospray process (e.g., in source dissociation), which are
in-turn coisolated and cofragmented with the target precursor peptide.</p><p>Multiplexing experiments with isobaric tags have the advantage
that within one experiment there are no missing values. This is in
contrast to binary comparisons where multiple experiments are required
to compare all samples. For example, we quantified more than 38&#x0202f;000
phosphopeptides. Each phosphopeptide quantified produced 10 measurements
from the 10 reporter ions, greatly facilitating the statistical analyses.
Phosphorylation differences between brain and liver tissue were very
reproducible across biological replicates. Given that the phosphopeptide
enrichment step was performed prior to TMT labeling and mixing, the
enrichment step was also reproducible. This is important because the
alternative would be to label 1 mg or more of peptides with each reagent
and then to combine them prior to enrichment, which would have dramatically
increased the cost of the experiment.</p><p>We found that most phosphopeptides
were present at differing levels
depending on their tissue source. Only 17% of phosphorylation sites
were not assigned as significantly enriched in either the brain or
the liver. Sites assigned to the liver or brain were significantly
enriched for gene ontology categories representative of the tissue
of origin. For example, categories such as &#x0201c;synapse&#x0201d;
and &#x0201c;ion channel activity&#x0201d; were frequently identified
in brain and they are representative of the underlying difference
in signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Quantitative multiplexed
phosphoproteome characterization, utilizing
TMT reagents, presents an opportunity for unbiased biological discovery.
The ability to multiplex up to 10 replicates or conditions in a single
sample signifies a landmark shift in throughput, reproducibility,
and robustness of these workflows. While MS2-based quantification
of phosphopeptides via isobaric tagging was found to have distorted
accuracy, utilizing an SPS-MS3 scan dramatically improved phosphopeptide
quantitative accuracy. We demonstrated the technique via the quantification
of tens of thousands of phosphopeptides from five mouse livers and
