We found that three gene loci, which produced miR-26a and miR-26b, were embedded within introns of genes coding for the proteins of carboxy-terminal domain RNA polymerase II polypeptide A small phosphatase (CTDSP) family, including CTDSPL, CTDSP2 and CTDSP1. We conducted serum starvation-stimulation assays in primary fibroblasts and two-thirds partial-hepatectomies in mice, which revealed that miR-26a/b and CTDSP1/2/L were expressed concomitantly during the cell cycle process. Specifically, they were increased in quiescent cells and decreased during cell proliferation. Furthermore, both miR-26 and CTDSP family members were frequently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. Gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that miR-26a/b and CTDSP1/2/L synergistically decreased the phosphorylated form of pRb (ppRb), and blocked G1/S-phase progression. Further investigation disclosed that miR-26a/b directly suppressed the expression of CDK6 and cyclin E1, which resulted in reduced phosphorylation of pRb. Moreover, c-Myc, which is often upregulated in cancer cells, diminished the expression of both miR-26 and CTDSP family members, enhanced the ppRb level and promoted the G1/S-phase transition. Our findings highlight the functional association of miR-26a/b and their host genes and provide new insight into the regulatory network of the G1/S-phase transition.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to a class of endogenously expressed, small non-coding RNAs that cause translational repression and/or mRNA destabilization by binding to the 3&#x02032;-untranslated regions (3&#x02032;-UTRs) of the target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B1">1</xref>). Approximately 40% of all miRNAs are located within intronic regions of protein-coding transcriptional units (TUs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B2">2</xref>). Analysis of 175 human miRNAs across 24 different human organs reveals that the expression of intronic miRNAs largely coincides with the transcription of their host TUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B3">3</xref>), indicating that the intronic miRNAs and their host genes may be co-regulated and are generated from a common precursor transcript.</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests that intronic miRNAs may be functionally associated with their host genes. Few reports suggest that there is an antagonizing effect of the intronic miRNA on the function of its host gene, as with miR-218 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B4">4</xref>) and miR-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B6">6</xref>). The secreted Slit ligands and their Robo receptors constitute a Slit&#x02013;Robo signaling pathway that controls the directed migration of neurons and vascular endothelial cells during embryonic development. miR-218 is localized in the intron of the <italic>Slit</italic> gene, and similar expression patterns are observed between miR-218 and Slit in different tissues. Furthermore, miR-218 inhibits the expression of Robo1 and Robo2, which generates a negative feedback loop in response to <italic>Slit</italic> gene activation and thereby contributes to the &#x02018;fine-tuning&#x02019; of the Slit&#x02013;Robo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B4">4</xref>). Another example of miRNAs associating with their host genes are the miR-10 family members, whose gene loci are retained within the Hox clusters that encode for developmental regulators. Interestingly, Hox transcripts are targets of the miR-10 family members in several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B6">6</xref>). However, there may be a synergistic effect of miRNA with its host gene. miR-33a/b act in concert with their SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) host genes to control cholesterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B7 gkr1278-B8 gkr1278-B9 gkr1278-B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>). miR-208a/b and their <italic>Myh6/7</italic> host genes cooperate to govern myosin expression and muscle performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B11">11</xref>). The miR-106&#x02013;25 cluster and its host gene <italic>MCM7</italic> transforms cells synergistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B12">12</xref>). miR-151 and the host gene <italic>FAK</italic> work together to enhance the motility and spreading of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B13">13</xref>). An extensive investigation of the functional association between intronic miRNAs and their host genes will help to disclose the elaborate regulatory network of cellular activity.</p><p>Over the course of evolution, the genomic loci of miR-26a and miR-26b have been localized to the introns of genes coding for the proteins of carboxy-terminal domain RNA polymerase II polypeptide A small phosphatase (CTDSP) family. However, the functional association of miR-26 with CTDSP family members and the biological significance of this association remain unknown. Herein, we show that miR-26 family members are expressed concomitantly with their host genes in physiological and pathological conditions. We further disclose that miR-26a/b and their host genes cooperate to block the G1/S-phase transition by synergistically activating the pRb protein. Our findings highlight the functional association of miR-26a/b and their host genes and the potential implication of this association in physiological and pathological processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and human tissue specimens</title><p>Cancer cell lines, which were derived from the liver (MHCC-97L, HepG2 and Huh7), lung (95D), breast (MCF7) and cervix (HeLa), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria).

However, if a miRNA family always resides within the gene loci of a protein family, they are more likely to be physiologically relevant. To identify miRNAs that exhibit a functional association with their host genes, we first mapped the gene loci of miRNA families to hosting TUs. Among 108 miRNA families with at least two members that have been identified in human, 13 of them were mapped to the introns of protein families (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1278/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>).

Moreover, miR-26a/b and CTDSP1/2/L synergistically blocked the G1/S transition by activating the same protein, pRb.</p><p>The pRb-pathway acts as a master checkpoint in cell cycle progression. Cyclic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the pRb protein control the entry of cells into S-phase. Here, we found a synergistic effect of miR-26a/b and CTDSP1/2/L in decreasing the ppRb level and blocking the G1/S progression. Both miR-26a and miR-26b reduced the amount of ppRb by repressing the CDK and cyclins that mediate the phosphorylation of pRb. On the other hand, CTDSP1/2/L may directly dephosphorylate ppRb because CTDSP1/2/L possess phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B29 gkr1278-B30 gkr1278-B31">29&#x02013;31</xref>). It is intriguing to find that miR-26a/b and their host genes regulate pRb phosphorylation through different molecular mechanisms. The cooperation of miR-26 and CTDSP1/2/L in the pRb pathway may provide a &#x02018;double guarantee system&#x02019; for the activation of the pRb protein, which guards cells from excessive proliferation. Our observations give new insight into the elaborate control of G1/S transition and suggest the existence of a single gene locus that harbors two independent, but cooperating growth-suppressive elements.</p><p>c-Myc is essential for progression from G0/G1 to S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B32">32</xref>).

Here, we showed that c-Myc could downregulate both miR-26 and CTDSP family members, which enhanced ppRb levels and ultimately promoted the G1/S transition. Our findings disclose a novel mechanism by which c-Myc promotes cell cycle progression by suppressing one gene locus that carries both miRNA and protein-coding gene.</p><p>The serum starvation&#x02013;stimulation assay in primary fibroblasts and the two-thirds partial hepatectomy in mice revealed the increased expression of miR-26a/b and CTDSP1/2/L in quiescent cells and the downregulation of both families during cell proliferation. Furthermore, the levels of miR-26a/b and CTDSP1/2/L were reduced in HCC tissues. These data suggest that miR-26a/b and CTDSP1/2/L may keep fibroblasts and hepatocytes in a non-dividing state, and their deregulation may promote malignant transformation. The underlying mechanism responsible for the decreased expression of these two families in HCC is still unknown. Notably, c-Myc activation is a common event in HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B33">33</xref>). Amplification of chromosome 8q24, in which c-Myc is located, and upregulation of c-Myc and its downstream target genes are observed in viral and alcohol-related HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B34">34</xref>). Studies from animal models have also revealed that c-Myc overexpression promotes HCC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B33">33</xref>). Thus, abnormal c-Myc activation may represent an important mechanism underlying the downregulation of miR-26a/b and CTDSP1/2/L. In addition, CTDSP1/miR-26b is located at chromosome 2q35, a region that is frequently deleted in human cancers, especially HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B35">35</xref>). We were also able to computationally map CpG islands in the promoter regions (between &#x02212;2000 and 600 bp) of CTDSP1/2/L and miR-26a/b. Therefore, deletion and promoter hypermethylation may also account for the reduced expression of CTDSP1/2/L and miR-26a/b in HCC.</p><p>CTDSP1, CTDSP2 and CTDSPL belong to a protein family of small C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatases, also known as the SCP family. They can negatively regulate RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) by dephosphorylating its CTD on Ser-5 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B31">31</xref>), and also function as transcriptional co-repressors that inhibit the transcription of neuronal gene in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B36">36</xref>). Growing evidence also suggests that CTDSP1/2/L act as phosphatases of Smad1, Smad2/3 and snail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B30">30</xref>). It has been demonstrated that CTDSPL dephosphorylates the ppRb protein and presumably regulates the cell cycle. CTDSPL is homozygously deleted in &#x0223c;15% of cervical carcinomas, and CTDSPL suppresses the ability of renal carcinoma cells to form colonies <italic>in vitro</italic> and to develop tumors in <italic>SCID</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr1278-B22">22</xref>). However, the effect of the other two family members, CTDSP1 and CTDSP2, on the cell cycle and tumorigenesis is still unknown. Here, we showed that CTDSPL, CTDSP1 and CTDSP2 could block G1/S progression, and all CTDSP family members were downregulated in HCC tissues, suggesting that CTDSP1/2/L dysfunction may be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis.</p><p>In summary, we disclosed the cooperative effect of miR-26a/b and their host genes CTDSP1/2/L in the cell cycle control and their potential implication in physiological and pathological processes. Our findings highlight the functional association of miR-26a/b and their host genes, provide new insight into the regulatory network of the cell cycle and open the possibility for future therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr1278/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Tables S1&#x02013;S3, Supplementary Figures S1&#x02013;S8.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source>Ministry of Science and Technology of China</funding-source> (<award-id>2010CB912803</award-id>, <award-id>2011CB811305</award-id>); <funding-source>National Natural Science Foundation of China</funding-source> (<award-id>30870964</award-id>, <funding-source>30925036</funding-source>); and the <funding-source>Ministry of Health of China</funding-source> (<award-id>2012ZX10002-011</award-id>).
