The novel protein Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) is associated with osteoprotection by regulating bone cells. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of mechanical loads on Sema3A production and bone quality based on bone cells and collagen fibers around implants in rat maxillae. Grade IV-titanium threaded implants were placed at 4 weeks post-extraction in maxillary first molars. Implants received mechanical loads (10 N, 3 Hz for 1800 cycles, 2 days/week) for 5 weeks from 3 weeks post-implant placement to minimize the effects of wound healing processes by implant placement. Bone structures, bone mineral density (BMD), Sema3A production and bone quality based on bone cells and collagen fibers were analyzed using microcomputed tomography, histomorphometry, immunohistomorphometry, polarized light microscopy and birefringence measurement system inside of the first and second thread (designated as thread A and B, respectively), as mechanical stresses are concentrated and differently distributed on the first two threads from the implant neck. Mechanical load significantly increased BMD, but not bone volume around implants. Inside thread B, but not thread A, mechanical load significantly accelerated Sema3A production with increased number of osteoblasts and osteocytes, and enhanced production of both type I and III collagen. Moreover, mechanical load also significantly induced preferential alignment of collagen fibers in the lower flank of thread B. These data demonstrate that mechanical load has different effects on Sema3A production and bone quality based on bone cells and collagen fibers between the inside threads of A and B. Mechanical load-induced Sema3A production may be differentially regulated by the type of bone structure or distinct stress distribution, resulting in control of bone quality around implants in jaw bones.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></funding-source><award-id>25870523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawase</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></funding-source><award-id>15K11258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawase</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant nos. 25870523 and 15K11258 to TS).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dental implants are constantly subject to mechanical loads such as masticatory and swallowing forces via superstructures. In particular, mechanical stresses concentrate on the marginal bone around dental implants [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], suggesting that the maintenance of marginal bone levels for the long-term is important for successful clinical outcomes. To determine the effects of mechanical stimulation on bone around dental implants, finite element analyses have been mainly used [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, some studies have reported the effects on the jaw bone around implants using occlusal forces [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, occlusal forces are unstable, as the magnitude, frequency, cycles and direction of the loads can change irregularly. Thus, animal studies using controlled-mechanical stimuli are absolutely required to clarify the net effect of mechanical loads on jaw bone reactions around implants.</p><p>Prior to 2000, bone strength was synonymous with bone mineral density (BMD). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has since proposed a new clinical parameter; &#x0201c;bone quality&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Bone quality, which is completely independent of BMD, comprises bone architecture, bone turnover, bone mineralization and micro-damage accumulation [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, bone cells such as osteoblasts and osteocytes, and characteristics of collagen fibers, including type and alignment, are thought to be the determinant factors of bone quality [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the intact mandible, basically, orientation of collagen fibers and the related biological apatite crystals uni-directionally aligns along the mesiodistal axis; however, the direction of maximum orientation has been demonstrated to change locally along the biting direction just beneath the teeth, indicating that biting stress is effectively and continuously transmitted from teeth to the host bone in a normal tooth-mandible system [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, the appropriate orientation of calcified collagen fibers should be obtained in the regenerative bone surrounding dental implants. Our recent studies using rabbit tibiae demonstrated that mechanical repetitive load along the long axis of implants improves bone quality around dental implants orthogonally placed to the long axis of tibiae, with the development of osteocyte networks and preferential alignment of collagen fibers [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In particular, bone quality inside the grooves of the implant neck are improved by mechanical repetitive load using rabbit long bones [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, bone structures of rabbit tibiae are entirely different from jaw bone structures, specifically with regard to the small amount of trabecular bone, suggesting that rabbits are an undesirable species to investigate bone reactions to mechanical loads around dental implants [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, stress distributions differ between jaw and long bones around implants, due to the differences in bone structure and density [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and loading direction (parallel vs. orthogonal along the long axis of implants). Therefore, the use of jaw bones, but not long bones, is strongly recommended to clarify the net effect of mechanical load on bone around dental implants.</p><p>Some mechanisms by which bone reacts to mechanical stresses have been demonstrated. Mechanical loads are mainly converted into mechanical stimuli such as fluid shear stress, hydrostatic pressure, and direct cell deformation. Mechanical stimuli induce matrix deformation around osteocytes and cell processes, promoting the production of signaling molecules by osteocytes [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, osteocytes play an important role as mechanosensors. Recently, our study indicated that osteocytes determine the normalization of collagen alignments when osteocytes properly respond to mechanical stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We also demonstrated that collagen fibers produced by osteoblasts preferentially orient along the osteoblast-elongated direction, suggesting that osteoblast alignment determines extracellular matrix orientation [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Impaired cross-linking in collagenous matrix affects osteoblast differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. On the other hand, osteoclast functions, including resorption of extracellular matrix, have been shown to be controlled via regulation of osteoclastogenesis in response to several mechanical stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, bone cells, especially osteoblasts and osteocytes, are interdependently linked with collagen fibers under loaded-conditions. However, scientific evidence for bone quality based on bone cells and collagen fibers around implants in jaw bone remains elusive. Thus, the investigation of bone cells with collagen fibers is required to elucidate bone quality around implants under loaded conditions.</p><p>Semaphorin3A (Sema3A), a novel secreted protein, has mainly been studied in the nervous system, oncology (e.g., multiple myeloma and tumor progression) and several types of autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus) [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Recently, Sema3A, which is expressed by osteoblasts and osteoclast-like multinuclear cells, has been demonstrated to play an important role in osteoblast and osteoclast regulation, also known as osteoprotection [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The latest study reported that Sema3A mRNA levels are upregulated by centrifugation stress in MC3T3-E1 cells [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, Sema3A in bone tissue around implants is not fully understood under non-loaded and loaded-conditions.</p><p>Accordingly, our hypotheses are that: (1) mechanical loads improve bone quality around implants, based on bone cells and collagen fibers; and (2) osteoprotection occurs in bone around implants via mechanical load-induced Sema3A production. To evaluate the net effect of mechanical load on &#x0201c;bone quality&#x0201d; around implants, the jaw bone, but not long bones, should be used. The aims of this study were: (1) to clarify the effects of mechanical repetitive load on bone quality based on bone cells and collagen fibers around implants in rat maxillae, and (2) to investigate the effects of mechanical load on Sema3A production in bone around implants in rat maxillae.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals and surgical procedures</title><p>Seven female Wistar rats (9-month-old) were purchased (Kyudo Co., Ltd, Saga, Japan). Grade IV-titanium threaded implants with 2.0 mm in diameter, 3.5 mm in length, and 400 &#x003bc;m and 200 &#x003bc;m thread pitch and height, respectively were obtained (Kyocera Co., Kyoto, Japan; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189893.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Thread angles were 60&#x000b0; along the long axis of implants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189893.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To compensate for complete wound healing after tooth extraction [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], implants were placed under general and local anesthesia at 4 weeks after the removal of both maxillary first molars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189893.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Randomly selected implants from each rat were stimulated at 10 N with a frequency of 3 Hz for 1800 cycles, 2 days/week for 5 weeks using a custom-made loading device (Higuchi Co., Nagasaki, Japan) to mimic rat mastication [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (loading group; n = 7 sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189893.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

Bone around implants was segmented and reconstructed by semi-manual contouring and was analyzed with a TRI/3D-Bon (Ratoc System Engineering, Tokyo, Japan).

However, our previous study using rat mandible indicated that complete bone healing takes 21&#x02013;28 days following tooth extraction [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hence, in the present study, a period of 4 weeks was selected in order to allow complete wound healing following tooth extraction. On the other hand, bone integration to implants takes at least 3 weeks in rat maxillae [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Combined with bone remodeling after tooth extraction, a 3-week healing period should be appropriate until the initiation of mechanical loads. Thus, mechanical repetitive load does not affect bone healing after implant placement, suggesting that mechanical repetitive load influences bone modeling and remodeling around implants, but not wound healing. Loading conditions such as load magnitude, frequency and cycles are important factors determining bone reactions in response to mechanical loads. In rats, occlusal forces and mastication frequency are 7&#x02013;11 N and 3&#x02013;4 Hz, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, 10 N and 3 Hz were used to mimic rat mastication in this study. On the other hand, load cycles remain controversial. Both 36 and 1800 cycles/day has equally resulted in increasing bone mass and formation using an avian loading model [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Conversely, tooth contact occurs at 1800 cycles/day during chewing and swallowing in humans [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Hence, 1800 cycles/day were selected as a load cycle in this study.</p><p>Caution should be exercised when microCT scanning is performed using bone samples including dental implants, as metal artifacts affect analyses of bone structures. A recent study has indicated that a 48-&#x003bc;m exclusion zone from the implant surface was needed to avoid microCT scanning-induced metal artifacts [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The authors have inserted titanium implants into long bones, and they used microCT at 16-&#x003bc;m voxel resolution with an energy level of 70 kV [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Scanning conditions and materials used in the present study were similar to that study. Hence, the data obtained from microCT analyses should be reliable in this study, as the ROI was defined as the region cross-sectionally surrounding between 50 &#x003bc;m and 550&#x003bc;m away from the implant surface. Our previous studies indicated that mechanical loads significantly increased both bone volume and BMD around dental implants in rabbit long bones [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, in this study, mechanical loads significantly increased BMD around implants without affecting bone volume. Distinct experimental conditions such as animal species and loading protocol may be correlated with the different results between the present and previous studies. In particular, rabbit long bones possesses a small amount of trabecular bone [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], suggesting that stress distribution could differ from rat jaw bones. BMD, which is completely independent of the latest concept of &#x0201c;bone quality&#x0201d; proposed by the NIH, plays an important role in bone mechanical function with bone quality [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, increased BMD by mechanical loads around implants may contribute to the long-term stability of bone around implants in clinical situations. In clinical settings, occlusal forces do not increase bone volume around dental implants, supporting the notion that our new finding&#x02013;increased BMD with no change in bone volume&#x02013;is a jaw-specific event in response to mechanical loads.</p><p>Interestingly, bone quality based on the number of bone cells inside thread B changed markedly under loaded conditions, but no changes were seen in thread A in the present study. A previous study indicated that the thickness of cortical bone in rat maxillae was approximately 400 &#x003bc;m [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The thread pitch of the implant was 400 &#x003bc;m in the present study. Thus, bone structures around threads A and B were positioned in the cortical and trabecular bone, respectively. It has been reported that osseous healing between cortical and trabecular bones differs after implant placement in rabbit long bones [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. No studies separately investigating trabecular and cortical maxillary bones regarding bone reactions after implant placement have been found, regardless of mechanical load. Therefore, the distinct bone reactions in response to mechanical loads in threads A and B may be due to different bone structures (cortical vs. trabecular bone) in maxillary bones.</p><p>Our previous studies have demonstrated that bone cells such as osteoblasts and osteocytes are determinant factors of the new concept of &#x0201c;bone quality&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It has been revealed that development of the osteocyte network induced by mechanical loads via dental implants contributes to improved bone quality in rabbit long bones [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the other hand, Osteoprotection, which consists of promoted osteoblast differentiation-induced increases in bone formation and osteoclast differentiation suppression-induced decreases in bone resorption, has recently been proposed [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Osteoprotection is regulated by Sema3A predominantly produced by osteoblast lineage cells [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Of course, no reports have indicated that Sema3A in bone around implants is controlled by mechanical load. Hence, this is the first report showing that mechanical load via implants increased Sema3A production in bone around implants, although this was site-specific. Different stress distribution between the inside of threads A and B, and distinct stress distribution due to bone structure type could be the cause of different bone reactions to mechanical stimuli in terms of Sema3A production. Mechanical repetitive loads contributed to increases in the number of osteoblasts inside thread B, resulting in the development of an osteocyte network, although no changes in Sema3A production occurred inside thread A without increases in the number of osteoblasts and osteocytes. These conflicting findings inside threads A and B indicate that mechanical repetitive load-induced Sema3A production may be correlated with the control of bone quality by regulating the number of osteoblasts and osteocytes around the implant neck. On the other hand, osteoclast numbers did not change under loaded conditions, irrespective of Sema3A production. It has been demonstrated that Sema3A suppressed proliferation and differentiation of osteoclasts [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The reasons are unknown, but molecules other than Sema3A induced by mechanical loads via implants may also affect the number of osteoclasts.</p><p>Bone is composed of 85&#x02013;90% collagenous proteins. Type I collagen is the most abundant bone matrix protein produced by osteoblasts [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Interestingly, lower production of type I collagen inside thread B under non-loaded conditions was comparable to that outside the thread at 200&#x02013;400 &#x003bc;m away from implants by mechanical repetitive loads, although no changes occurred in thread A under loaded conditions. The increases in the number of osteoblasts inside thread B could be linked with the increased production of type I collagen fibers by mechanical loads. On the other hand, type III collagen production occurs in early phases of wound healing in many connective tissues, including bone. Until recently, type III collagen was only known as a regulator of type I collagen fibrinogenesis. However, more recently, it has been reported that type III collagen regulates osteoblastogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], bone repair and maintenance of osteoblast growth [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and preservation of the osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Hence, in this study, increases in type III collagen fibers by mechanical loads could improve bone quality based on the maintenance and improvement of osteoblastogenesis including mesenchymal stem cells.</p><p>The preferential alignment of collagen fibers is one of the most important factors determining bone quality. We have demonstrated that mechanical loads have enhanced bone quality around hip implants by improving collagen alignment parallel to the direction of principal stresses [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, we have shown that mechanical repetitive loads also significantly induced the preferential alignment of collagen fibers inside grooves of the implant neck using rabbit long bones [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In these studies, thread angles have been demonstrated to be a key factor determining the preferential alignment of collagen fibers. This angle was 60&#x000b0; downwards direction to a plane perpendicular to the long axis of implants in our previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, according to the International Organization for Standardization 724 and the Japanese Industrial Standards, triangle threads with 60&#x000b0; angle are basically standardized in metric screw threads including dental implants. Indeed, triangle threads with 60&#x000b0; angle are provided for commercial dental implants in clinical settings [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, 60&#x000b0; thread angle along the long axis of the implants was selected in the present study. Under non-loaded conditions, collagen alignment along the long axis of implants was the same between the inside and outside of threads A and B, indicating that preferential alignment of collagen fibers is not linked with bone quality around implants if they do not receive mechanical loads. It has been reported that collagen alignment was also influenced by material directions, regardless of mechanical load [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, absolute values of collagen alignment along the long axis of implants between the upper and lower flanks did not change under non-loaded and loaded-conditions in this study (data not shown). Interestingly, mechanical repetitive load significantly induced the preferential alignment of collagen fibers at only the lower flank of thread B, suggesting that preferential alignment of collagen fibers is locally linked with bone quality around implants when mechanical loads are applied. Local changes in collagen alignment by mechanical load may be due to the distinct stress distribution between upper and lower flank of the implant threads [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189893.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, mechanical stretches have been demonstrated to induce the preferential alignment of osteoblasts and collagen fibers <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that load-affected osteoblasts and collagen fibers contribute to the adaptation of bone quality [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Further studies investigating the short-term effects of mechanical repetitive loads on collagen alignment are required to clarify the adaptation of bone quality around dental implants in response to mechanical loads.</p><p>Taken together, the present results show that mechanical repetitive load via implants contributes to improve bone quality and BMD, but not bone quantity (volume) in the jaw bone, although the same responses may not occur when using long bones under loaded conditions in rats. A previous clinical study suggested that the new concept of &#x0201c;bone quality&#x0201d; plays an important role in osseous healing after tooth extraction in the oral cavity in humans [<xref rid="pone.0189893.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which indicates that the new concept of &#x0201c;bone quality&#x0201d; is an important factor in clinical situations. In implant dentistry, therefore, our present findings using the jaw bone contribute to understanding the new concept of &#x0201c;bone quality&#x0201d; based on bone cells and characteristics of collagen fibers with preferential alignment under loaded conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrated that mechanical repetitive load had different effects on Sema3A production and bone quality around implants between the inside of threads A and B. We also showed that mechanical repetitive load improves bone quality based on an increased number of osteoblasts and osteocytes, and increased production of type I and III collagen with preferential alignment inside thread B. Mechanical load-induced Sema3A production may be differentially regulated by the types of bone structures (cortical and cancellous bones) or distinct stress distribution, resulting in the control of bone quality around implants in jaw bones.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Nos. 25870523 and 15K11258).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0189893.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Hudieb</surname><given-names>MI</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wakabayashi</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kasugai</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>.
