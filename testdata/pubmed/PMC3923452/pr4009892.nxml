purification coupled to 1-D gel-free liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS) is a well-established and widespread
approach for the analyses of noncovalently interacting protein complexes.
In this study, two proteins conjugated to a streptavidin-binding peptide
and hemagglutinin double tag were expressed in the respective Flp-In
HEK293 cell lines: green fluorescent protein (SH-GFP) and TANK binding
kinase 1 (SH-TBK1_MOUSE). Fluorescent anti-HA immunoblots revealed
that the expression level of SH-GFP was &#x0223c;50% lower than that
of SH-TBK1_MOUSE. Subsequently, the input material was normalized
to obtain a similar quantity of purified SH-tagged proteins. Optimization
of the release of protein complexes from the <italic>anti</italic>-HA-agarose with different eluting agents was then assessed. With
respect to the total number of protein groups identified in the purified
complexes, elution with 2% SDS surpassed both 100 mM glycine and 100
mM formic acid. Relative quantitation of the purified protein complexes
using TMT 6-plex reagents confirmed the higher efficiency of the 2%
SDS elution followed by filter-aided sample preparation (FASP). The
data presented in this study provide a new application of FASP to
quantitative MS analysis of affinity-purified protein complexes. We
have termed the approach abFASP-MS, or affinity-based filter-aided
sample preparation mass spectrometry.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>affinity purification</kwd><kwd>orbitrap velos</kwd><kwd>SDS

coupled to liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS) have gained considerable momentum
in the investigation of near-physiological protein complexes. Studies
have ranged from the investigation of yeast,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> autophagy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> immune modulators,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> kinases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> to viral-human interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Thus,
the broad applicability and power of such approaches has been firmly
and undoubtedly established. Although outside the scope of these particular
studies, interestingly, no quantitative approaches such as SILAC or
chemical labeling were utilized in these large-scale investigations.
Naturally, any study on protein complexes can only be further enhanced
by understanding the quantitative nature of the protein complex formation.
On a much smaller scale, it would be very important to be able to
determine changes in protein quantities within a single complex after
for example, treatment with either a stimulant or perturbant or between
mutant versions of the same protein. It is imperative that there is
a high degree of experimental normalization and standardization of
the entire biochemical and analytical procedure to achieve this goal.</p><p>An inducible expression system in Flp-In HEK293 cells is routinely
used in our laboratory to purify naturally folded, noncovalently interacting
protein complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> In our hands, the approach
has proven to be robust and efficient for the production of recombinant
proteins (baits) for tandem affinity purification (TAP) and qualitative
LC&#x02013;MS analysis of purified protein complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Two cell lines were used throughout the study. One expressing green
fluorescent protein N-terminally tagged with streptavidin-binding
peptide and hemagglutinin (SH-GFP) and the other expressing the similarly
tagged mouse TANK binding kinase 1 (SH-TBK1_MOUSE). Because GFP is
absent in human cells, any potential interaction established with
human proteins is due to nonspecific physicochemical properties rather
than true physiological interactions. Recombinant SH-GFP is thus used
as a control for TAP-MS experiments to determine the proteins that
nonspecifically bind to the 3-D structure of GFP, the SH-tag, and/or
the sepharose beads used throughout the protein purification procedure.
TBK1 plays an essential role in controlling the innate immune response,
cell proliferation, and oncogenesis and is one of the central proteins
that leads to induction of type-I interferon (IFN) in response to
pathogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> TAP-MS experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> have identified TBK1 and three primary core complex
adaptor components: TRAF family member associated NF-&#x003ba;B activator
(TANK); TBK binding protein 1 (TBKBP1 or SINTBAD); and AZI2 (NAP1
or TBKBP2).</p><p>Experience has shown that HEK293 Flp-In cells express
SH-tagged
proteins at variable levels. Subsequently, it is quite challenging
to directly qualitatively or quantitatively compare the TAP-MS data
from different proteins or even the same protein under several conditions.
Thus, to compensate for these difficulties, it is important to normalize
to the expression level of the SH-tagged protein to obtain comparable
results subsequent to the biochemical purification steps and the analytical
analysis by LC&#x02013;MS. Additionally, elution of the proteins in
the second step of the TAP is sometimes less efficient compared with
the first step of the purification. Often this reduced efficiency
is due to the physicochemical properties of the bait; however, other
contributing factors are lack of experience of the researcher performing
the TAP, slight pH variations in the buffers, desiccated column beds,
contamination from residual detergent in the buffers, and so on. As
a consequence, such small variations throughout the procedure become
compounded, thus affecting the number and nature of the proteins that
are eluted. Ultimately, inefficient elution of the proteins can lead
to a distorted view of the true composition of the protein complex
in question. Such anomalies are further exacerbated following a quantitative
experiment when incorrect assumptions are made concerning the variation
in protein levels and the relative stoichiometric configuration of
a complex. Thus, there is a need to find a means to elute the proteins
more efficiently and consistently, thereby maximizing the information
on protein complex composition and stoichiometry. This is necessary
to ensure that the quantitative data generated from a chemical labeling
experiment is reliable and trustworthy.</p><p>Therefore, the aims
of this study were to: (i) normalize the quantity
of protein input for different SH-tagged proteins with dissimilar
expression or purification yield levels prior to the tandem affinity
purification mass spectrometry experiment; (ii) compare alternative
elution methods for the second step of the purification; and (iii)
couple the most efficient elution condition to the quantitative analysis
of protein complexes via chemical labeling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials" id="sec2.1"><title>Materials</title><p>The following materials were used: iodoacetamide

nanoflow system (dual pump system with one precolumn and one analytical
column) (Agilent Biotechnologies, Palo Alto, CA) via a nanoelectrospray
ion source using liquid junction (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark). Solvents
for LC&#x02013;MS separation of the digested samples were as follows:
solvent A consisted of 0.4% formic acid in water and solvent B consisted
of 0.4% formic acid in 70% methanol and 20% isopropanol. From a thermostatic

with SH-tagged-TBK1_MOUSE and other known contaminants) with the search
engines Mascot (v2.3.02, MatrixScience, London, U.K.) and Phenyx (v2.5.14,
GeneBio, Geneva, Switzerland).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Submission
to the search engines was via a Perl script that performs an initial
search with relatively broad mass tolerances (Mascot only) on both
the precursor and fragment ions (&#x000b1;10 ppm and &#x000b1;0.6 Da, respectively).
High-confidence peptide identifications were used to recalibrate all
precursor and fragment ion masses prior to a second search with narrower
mass tolerances (CID, &#x000b1; 4 ppm and &#x000b1;0.3 Da; HCD, &#x000b1; 4
ppm and &#x000b1;0.025 Da). One missed tryptic cleavage site was allowed.
Carbamidomethyl cysteine and TMT 6-plex (N-terminii and lysine) were
set as fixed modifications, and oxidized methionine was set as a variable
modification. To validate the proteins, we processed Mascot and Phenyx
output files by internally developed parsers. Proteins with &#x02265;2
unique peptides above a score T1 or with a single peptide above a
score T2 were selected as unambiguous identifications. Additional
peptides for these validated proteins with score &#x0003e;T3 were also
accepted.
For Mascot and Phenyx, T1, T2, and T3 peptide scores were equal to
16, 40, 10 and 5.5, 9.5, 3.5, respectively (<italic>P</italic> value
&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup>). The validated proteins retrieved by the
two algorithms were merged, and any spectral conflicts were discarded
and grouped according to shared peptides. A false positive detection
rate (FDR) of &#x0003c;1 and &#x0003c;0.1% (including the peptides exported
with lower scores) was determined for proteins and peptides, respectively,
by applying the same procedure against a reversed database. Comparisons
between analytical methods involved comparisons between the corresponding
sets of identified proteins. This was achieved by an internally developed
program that simultaneously computes the protein groups in all samples
and extracts statistical data such as the number of distinct peptides,
number of spectra, and sequence coverage.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.9"><title>Tandem Mass Tag Quantitation</title><p>The quantitation module

using the default settings for centroid peak detection at the highest
confidence and a mass tolerance of 20 ppm. Correction for isotopic
impurities was not performed. In addition, spectra with reporter ion
intensities below 100 counts and spectra with coisolation of contaminating
peptides exceeding 40% of the selected precursor ion were excluded
from the protein ratio calculations. The median ratios for all peptides

and specific elution method that could then be coupled to relative
protein quantitation using chemical labels such as iTRAQ or TMT. In

to 5% of the
digested sample) from the second step of the TAP maximizes the protein
identification from a 1D gel-free LC&#x02013;MS analysis on our laboratory
and thus was used to evaluate the three different elution conditions.
The proteins identified in all analyses are given in Supplementary
Table S1 in the <xref rid="notes-3" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>.
The total number of proteins &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) that were
identified for the three elution strategies are given in Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B (<italic>n</italic> = 4). The data is an average
of two biochemical and two technical replicates and shows that the
efficiency of eluting the highest number of proteins for both SH-GFP
and SH-TBK1_MOUSE cell lysates was 2% SDS &#x0003e; 100 mM glycine &#x0003e;100
mM
formic acid. Note that the standard deviation for the 2% SDS-eluted
SH-GFP is rather high. This was attributed to storage of the SH-GFP
cell lysate for a period of time between performing the first and
second purification and emphasizes the necessity of conducting simultaneous
back-to-back replicates to ensure optimal reproducibility. For the
three elution conditions, all proteins that were identified in the
TBK1 experiments that were &#x02265;2-fold more abundant in median
spectral counts compared with the GFP control are given in Supplementary
Table S2 in the <xref rid="notes-3" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>.
Summarized in Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C is the average sequence
coverage &#x000b1; SD for the main core interactors of SH-TBK1_MOUSE
plus a selection of additional interactors: OPTN, TRAF2, CACO2, and
LETM1. Several points are apparent from this Figure. First, from the
2% SDS eluted sample, the average sequence coverage for SH-TBK1_MOUSE,
TBK1_HUMAN, and TANK_HUMAN all decrease; although the spectral counts
are approximately two to three times higher compared with the elution
with either formic acid or glycine (Supplementary Table S2C in the <xref rid="notes-3" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). Second, the sequence
coverage for TBKB1_HUMAN remains relatively similar regardless of
the elution strategy. Third, and most importantly, the sequence coverage
of AZI2_HUMAN increases dramatically from 23 (formic acid) to 29 (glycine)
to 38% (SDS). OPTN, TRAF2, and CACO2 showed a similar trend. Finally,
LETM1_HUMAN was only observed in the SDS elution. These data indicate
that the efficiency of protein elution from the anti-HA agarose in
the second step of the tandem affinity purification is markedly enhanced
by using 2% SDS coupled to FASP and that less abundant interactors
are identified more confidently. We have termed our new approach affinity-based
filter-aided sample preparation mass spectrometry, or abFASP-MS.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Relative Quantitative Comparison of Elution Conditions</title><p>The
final step was to quantitate the identified proteins between
the three elution conditions. To achieve this goal, we conducted a
TMT 6-plex experiment. As indicated in the <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">Materials
and Methods</xref> section, the tandem affinity purifications of SH-GFP
and SH-TBK1_MOUSE eluted with 100 mM formic acid, 100 mM glycine,
and 2% SDS were labeled with TMT 126, 127, and 128 and 129, 130, and
131, respectively. The quantitative data summarized in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref> (<italic>n</italic> = 2) revealed that the average
ratio for SH-GFP (peptide-to-spectrum-match, PSM = 1970) eluted with
glycine compared with formic acid was 1.88 (TMT 127/126). The average
ratio, however, for SH-GFP eluted with 2% SDS compared with formic
acid was 6.94 (TMT 128/126) (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>A). This
finding clearly indicated that elution of SH-GFP with 2% SDS was substantially
more efficient than the elution with either formic acid or glycine.
The average ratio for SH-TBK1_MOUSE (PSM = 4780) eluted with glycine
and 2% SDS compared with formic acid was 1.88 (TMT 130/129) and 2.28
(TMT 131/129), respectively. Co-elution of peptides with similar <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> values during an LC&#x02013;MS/MS analysis
of isobaric, chemically labeled peptides leads to an inherent fold
change compression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Such compression
issues are evident in our data when peptides from SH-TBK1_MOUSE and
the core interacting proteins are compared with the SH-GFP data (i.e.,
TMT labels 129/126, 130/127, and 131/128) (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>B). Despite this, however, the data do show the improved elution
efficiency for glycine and 2% SDS compared with formic acid. The average
ratio for PRKDC (a nonspecific protein identified in both SH-GFP and
SH-TBK1_MOUSE purifications; PSM = 126) was compared for the three
elution conditions (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>C). The ratio of
PRKDC between the SH-TBK1_MOUSE and SH-GFP purified products for the
formic acid, glycine, and 2% SDS elutions was 1.09 (TMT 129/126),
0.94 (TMT 130/127), and 0.92 (TMT 131/128), respectively. Namely,
for each elution condition for two unrelated SH-tagged proteins, similar
quantities of PRKDC were eluted.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Average Quantitative

the quantitative
experiment would be that all nonspecific proteins should show a similar
trend to PRKDC. This is the case for the majority of the contaminants
identified in the TMT experiment (Supplementary Table S3 in the <xref rid="notes-3" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>). The structure and physicochemical
properties offered by control proteins (in this case, GFP), however,
are usually insufficient to encompass all possible nonspecific interactions
that occur during the purification. Thus, some &#x02018;background&#x02019;
proteins may preferentially interact with certain baits but not with
others and be released from the agarose beads in quantities comparable
to some specific interactors (primarily low- to medium-abundance binding
proteins). The question that arose was whether the high protein elution
efficiency shown by the abFASP method would translate into a clearer
separation between specific and nonspecific interactors. As shown
by the distribution densities reported in Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the abFASP-MS provides more accurate protein quantitation
(average log<sub>2</sub> TMT 131/129 of &#x0223c;2) than the acid elution-based
MS data but also a broader TMT 131/129 distribution. This suggested
that specific interactions should be retained even after aggressive
filtering of the data. In the analysis of the TMT data shown in Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, for each elution condition, emphasis was placed
on proteins identified with at least two unique peptides and that
were &#x0003e;3-fold higher in the SH-TBK1 TAP compared with the corresponding
levels in the SH-GFP TAP (TMT 129/126, 130/127, and 131/128). Note
that among the protein isoforms identified with only one unique peptide,
many showed a total peptide number of &#x0003e;2 (for the corresponding
protein
groups). For example, both isoform 1 and 2 of OPTN were identified
with a total of 38 shared peptides and only a single unique peptide
each. Naturally, these proteins would not be excluded from the final
detailed list of specific interactors. For our purposes, however,
proteins such as OPTN were not evaluated in the quantitative analysis
of the comparative elution conditions. As is common practice in quantitative
proteomic experiments to obtain higher confidence data, only the unique
peptides were used to calculate the relative ratios. As shown in Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, 37 proteins were common to all three elution
conditions; 18 proteins were common to glycine and SDS only; 4 proteins
were common to formic acid and glycine only; and 1 protein was common
to formic acid and SDS only. 7, 9, and 12 proteins were uniquely identified
in the formic acid, glycine, and SDS-eluted samples, respectively.
The proteins in each group are shown in Supplementary Table S4 in
the <xref rid="notes-3" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref>. As expected,
the bait, the main interactors, and the pathway-related proteins were
the most abundant in all three elution methods and were identified
with a relatively higher number of unique peptides than other interactors
(also shown in Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B, left side of the
plot, &#x0003e;10 peptides). The only exceptions were AZI2, TRAF2, and
CACO2,
which did not pass the threshold in the formic acid elution condition
(although still present at a 129/126 ratio of &#x0003e;2-fold). In general
and with few exceptions, proteins that passed the filtering with one
elution method only showed ratios near the chosen &#x0003e;3-fold threshold.
Interestingly, STX5 was one of the most abundant proteins in the SDS
elution only (131/128 = 11.24). Other members of the syntaxin family
were observed under all three elution conditions with high TMT ratios,
thus indicating a possible functional role in the TBK1 network. Other
Golgi-resident proteins involved in vesicular trafficking were also
above the threshold under the SDS condition only (YKT6), in the overlap
between glycine and SDS conditions (SC22B, BET1), and under the formic
acid condition only (MPRD). In Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B, the
relative TMT ratios of the 37 SH-TBK1 shared interactors for each
elution method are compared (all ratios are relative to the TMT 129
label). The direct comparison confirms that the elution of SH-TBK1_MOUSE
protein complex with 2% SDS was considerably more efficient than elution
with formic acid and more efficient than elution with glycine with
respect to the majority of the identified interactors. The data presented
in Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Table S2 in the <xref rid="notes-3" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref> further emphasize
the improvement that is achieved when eluting proteins with 2% SDS
coupled to FASP. In general, this approach provides the most efficient
conditions for removing proteins from the anti-HA agarose and subsequently
the observation of higher TMT ratio values. Our data also complement
the recent publication on the coupling FASP with chemical-labeling-based
protein quantitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Density distribution

of affinity purifications coupled
to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is indisputable. Such data
sets can only be further enhanced by applying quantitative approaches
such as SILAC or chemical labeling, for example, iTRAQ or TMT-plexing.
To achieve this, however, it is imperative that there is a high degree
of experimental normalization and standardization of the entire biochemical
and analytical procedure. Namely, it is essential to: (i) assess the
expression level of the SH-tagged proteins of interest in the cell
lysate by anti-HA immunoblotting, (ii) assess the level of the SH-tagged
proteins following affinity purification and subsequent normalization
of the total protein input, and (iii) maximize elution of the SH-tagged
proteins and interactors with a strong denaturing agent such as 2%
SDS coupled to digestion by FASP. The new application of FASP to protein
complexes is termed abFASP-MS or affinity-based filter-aided sample
preparation mass spectrometry. abFASP-MS is directly compatible with
chemical labeling of peptides and can provide reliable relative quantitation
on protein interactor abundance between unrelated SH-tagged proteins.
It is envisaged that abFASP-MS will also provide accurate information
on proteins with a low expression profile and low-abundance interactors,
SH-tagged proteins under altered conditions, for example, drug treatment,
or comparison of protein complexes associated with a wild-type and
mutant protein.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="notes-3" notes-type="si"><title>Supporting Information Available</title><p>Supplementary Table S1: All
