In this study, we further assess the anti-metastatic properties of mifepristone, by studying whether cytostatic doses of the drug can inhibit the migration and invasion of various cancer cell lines using a double fluorescence cytochemical labeling approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Cell lines representing cancers of the ovary (SKOV-3), breast (MDA-MB-231), glia (U87MG), or prostate (LNCaP) were treated with cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone. Wound healing and Boyden chamber assays were utilized to study cellular migration. To study cellular invasion, the Boyden chamber assay was prepared by adding a layer of extracellular matrix over the polycarbonate membrane.

One key aspect of metastasis is the invasive capacity of the cells, which is mainly driven by cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Cancer cell motility, in turn, is heavily dependent on changes in tumor cell morphology caused by dynamic modifications in the polymerization of actin leading to rearrangements of the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The changes in cellular morphology and their impact on motility are associated with changes among epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, a process known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The transition from an epithelial to a more mesenchymal state is linked to morphological modifications, loss of tight junctions, remodeling of the cytoskeleton, and acquisition of migratory and invasive capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Such migratory and invasive capacities are commonly assessed by a variety of experimental approaches which have been amply described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The rationale for classical anti-cancer therapy has long been to target cell proliferation at the primary site without, unfortunately, discriminating cancer cells from normal cycling cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This approach was improved by the introduction of targeted therapies and immunotherapies that brought about reduced toxicities as they target cancer cells while sparing normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, to treat cancer more effectively, we should further focus on preventing the formation and growth of metastatic carcinoma cells. We should consider that inhibition of migration, associated with the process of metastasis, might be as important as inhibition of cell proliferation. Agents that negatively influence <italic>both</italic> mechanisms might provide a novel tool to fight cancer, in particular if they inhibit cell proliferation at the sites of metastasis while preventing migration of such cells to new niches.</p><p id="Par7">Previous work in our laboratory has shown that the prototypical member of the family of antiprogestins, mifepristone (MF), can efficiently inhibit the growth of cancer cells of ovarian, breast, prostate, and glial origin, all known for their high metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We demonstrated that the anti-cancer effect of MF does not require the presence of progesterone receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], involves cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle associated with the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and triggers cellular stress and autophagy, making it useful in combination therapies with proteasome inhibitors and autophagy blockers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, we provided evidence that MF interferes with the adhesive capacity of cancer cells by altering fibrillar actin (F-actin) distribution and promoting the formation of membrane ruffling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], represented by sheet-like membrane protrusions devoid of adhesive properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In this work, we demonstrated that MF inhibits migration and invasion via standard approaches, and validated and enhanced a method for visualizing migratory and invasive cells upon double fluorescence cytochemical staining. Labeling migratory and invasive cells with a fluorescent probe linked to Phalloidin allowed us to observe the changes in F-actin distribution while cells are migrating and invading. Furthermore, the simultaneous labeling of the nucleus with a second fluorescent agent capable of binding DNA added further detail to visualize the position of the nucleus relative to the cytoplasm while cells are migrating and invading. The double fluorescence cytochemical labeling increases the value of two well-known approaches&#x02014;the wound healing and Boyden chamber assays&#x02014;to study cell movement by simple staining, increasing the level of detail of cell morphology in motion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par9">The carcinoma cell lines were all obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). SKOV-3 (ovarian cancer; Cat. HTB-77) were obtained in 2003 (lot 1659235). U87MG (gliobastoma, Cat. HTB-14), MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer, Cat. HTB-26), and LNCaP (prostate cancer, Cat. CRL-1740), were all obtained in 2008 (lots 5105357, 57618051, and 7658493, respectively). All cell lines were cultured as previously described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Wound healing assays</title><p id="Par10">For all cell lines studied, the concentrations of mifepristone used (MF; Corcept Therapeutics, Menlo Park, CA) were those that were previously demonstrated to cause inhibition of cell growth by inducing cytostasis, without triggering cell death (i.e. lethality) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In a first approach (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), SKOV-3 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well. Cells were allowed 24&#x02009;h to attach in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) containing culture media as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The media was then removed and replaced with 5% FBS-containing media with vehicle [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA], or MF for 72&#x02009;h. After treatment, a wound or denuded region was created with a p20 pipette tip in a consistent angle and using consistent pressure following recommended standard operating procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Mediatech) to remove detached cells. The PBS was removed and replaced with 5% FBS-containing media with vehicle or MF. Migration of cells was monitored for 18 and 30&#x02009;h. Multiple images were taken of each well using a Zeiss Axiovert M200 inverted phase-contrast microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).

Statistical analysis of individual treatment groups over time (vs. time&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x02009;h) was done using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tuckey&#x02019;s multiple-comparison test.

Notice that the dark line detected by the microscope to the left of the border of the wounded area, denoted in yellow, represents the original line traced with a pen underneath the plate before the wound was created. This artifact does not preclude us for counting the cells that migrated away of the wound. Similar migratory experiments in response to 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;M MF for 72&#x02009;h were done using LNCaP (<bold>g</bold>) and U87MG (<bold>h</bold>) cells. The statistical analysis done in <bold>e</bold>, <bold>g</bold>, and <bold>h</bold> is similar to that described for <bold>c</bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2019_5587_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">A second approach was used for U87MG, LNCaP, and MDA-MB-231 cells, because we encountered difficulties in clearly assessing cell migration into the wound using phase-contrast microscopy: these cells do not retain intercellular junctions entirely, having the tendency to move more individually rather than in sheets. Thus, we developed a modified scratch assay in which, instead of wounding a selected segment with a pipette tip, we removed the entire half of the cells in the otherwise confluent cell culture. Thus, we were able to count migrating cells into the clear area (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Cells were plated as described above, and treatment with MF was performed for 72&#x02009;h before wounding. A reference line was then drawn on the bottom of each well, effectively separating the well into two halves. A sterile cotton swab was then used to remove all cells on the right of the reference line (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The wells were washed three times with PBS to remove all detached cells and debris. The PBS was removed and replaced with the appropriate 10% FBS-containing media with vehicle or MF. Migration of cells was recorded using a Zeiss Axiovert M200 inverted phase-contrast microscope. Cells moving into the open area to the right of the reference line were then counted.</p><p id="Par12">To validate the double fluorescence staining method, we were able to perform the same wound healing experiments using approach one (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) for all cell lines with the addition of Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; 594 Phalloidin followed by DAPI labeling to improve the visualization of cytoplasm and nuclear morphologies. Cells, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 5&#x02009;min. To reduce background staining, cells were then incubated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Wisent Bioproducts, St. Bruno, QC) for 20&#x02009;min. The stock solution of Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; 594 Phalloidin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was diluted from its 6.6&#x02009;&#x003bc;M at a 1:40 ratio, in PBS containing 1% BSA (5&#x02009;&#x003bc;L stock solution in 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;L PBS). Cells were incubated with diluted Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; 594 Phalloidin for 20&#x02009;min. The 5&#x02009;mg/mL stock solution of DAPI (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was diluted to a final working concentration of 300&#x02009;nM, in PBS containing 1% BSA. Cells were incubated with diluted DAPI solution for 10&#x02009;min. As the visibility of individual cells was enhanced by the contrast provided by fluorescence, we were able to assess the cells migrating into the wounded area with sufficient precision, despite the different movement modalities encountered among the four cell lines. Using a Leica DMi8 inverted fluorescence microscope and a Leica LAS X software (Leica Microsystems Canada, Concord, ON), migratory cells going into the wound were imaged to visualize wound closure and migration patterns of each cell line.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Filter-based assays</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Migration</title><p id="Par13">Cells were treated in cell culture flasks for 72&#x02009;h with either regular media or MF-containing media at the concentrations previously selected to be cytostatic for each cell line (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The cells were then trypsinized and resuspended in serum-free media containing vehicle or MF, and plated in the wells containing the insert chambers at a density of 50,000 cells per well. A 10% FBS-containing media was then added to the lower chamber to serve as a chemoattractant. Cells were allowed 9, 18, or 24&#x02009;h to migrate across the 8&#x02009;&#x003bc;m polycarbonate membrane, at which point the cells were fixed in 100% methanol (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) for 30&#x02009;min. Using a sterile cotton swab, the non-migratory cells remaining in the upper chamber were removed. The inserts were then stored in PBS at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The membranes and attached cells were stained with 0.25% crystal violet (Sigma) for 20&#x02009;min. Inserts were rinsed multiple times with PBS. The migratory cells were counted colorimetrically with a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope (Nikon, Garden City, NY) using an average of nine 20x fields per insert.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Invasion</title><p id="Par14">To study the invasion of cancer cells using the Boyden chamber inserts, cells were grown and treated as described in the migration section. However, before plating, the inserts were coated with a layer of extracellular matrix (ECM) gel from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm murine sarcoma (Sigma). The stock ECM gel (9.1&#x02009;mg/ml) was thawed overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and then diluted in cold serum-free media to a working amount of 60&#x02009;&#x003bc;g per insert. Each insert was coated with 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of diluted ECM gel and incubated overnight at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere in the presence of 5% CO2. Following incubation of the gel layer, cells were plated at the same density and in the same manner as described in the migration section.

Migrated cells were then fixed with 4% PFA for 20&#x02009;min. The fixed cells were first permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5&#x02009;min at room temperature, after which they were pre-incubated with PBS containing 1% BSA for 20&#x02009;min in order to reduce background staining.

Thus, due to the importance of this process, we studied the impact of morphological changes triggered by cytostatic concentrations of MF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) on cellular migration.</p><p id="Par21">The migration of SKOV-3 cells in a wound healing assay was impaired at both 18 and 30-h time-points. At 30&#x02009;h, vehicle-treated cells had substantially closed the wound, whereas MF-treated cells were unable to move any farther than they had after 18&#x02009;h, leaving the wound relatively at the same initial size (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, d).</p><p id="Par22">In MDA-MB-231 cells treated with MF, migration was impaired by 18&#x02009;h and significantly inhibited by 30&#x02009;h.

The LNCaP prostate cancer cells were by far the slowest moving cells.

Two distinct patterns of migration have been described: single-cell and collective-cell migration (rev. in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). In single-cell migration, cells migrate individually and invade surrounding tissues independent of each other. Collective-cell migration involves groups of cells adherent to one another, migrating and invading surrounding tissues as multicellular aggregates. By enhancing the wound healing and Boyden chamber assays with the addition of a double fluorescence staining&#x02014;labeling actin cytoskeleton and nuclear DNA&#x02014;it is possible to better observe such migration patterns.</p><p id="Par30">When observing SKOV-3 cells in a wound healing assay, it was noticed that cells treated with vehicle formed a sheet as they closed the wound, suggesting collective-cell migration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, i; and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). SKOV-3 cells having migrated through the pores in the Boyden chamber seemed to recreate this phenomenon, as cells were observed to be covering the entire surface of the image, almost always touching one another (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, iii). When SKOV-3 cells were treated with MF, the cells in the front leading edge were more isolated and less adherent to one another. This change in organization can be visualized through both wound healing and Boyden Chamber methods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, ii and iv; and Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). In both wound healing and Boyden chamber migratory assays, U87MG and MDA-MB-231 were observed to express a similar migration pattern, with vehicle-treated cells loosely organized and with very little attachment to one another (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, i and iii; and c, i and iii). This behavior indicates that these cancer cell lines most likely undergo single-cell migration. When both U87MG and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with MF, although the pattern remained similar to that of vehicle-treated cells, there was an obvious decrease in the number of migratory cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, ii and iv; and ,c ii and iv). Finally, LNCaP cells demonstrated a mixed migration pattern (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d, i and iii). In the wound healing assay, some LNCaP leading cells show a mix of collective and individual migration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d,i). The collective migration was more obvious when the cells traversed the pores of the polycarbonate membrane of the Boyden chamber and appear as tri-dimensional clusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d, iii). When LNCaP cells were treated with MF, in the wound healing assay, cells were observed to be less cohesive; yet, the front leading edge retained grouped cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d, ii). Such grouping or clustering was also maintained when cells migrated through the pores of the Boyden chamber (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d, iv).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Enhancing the wound healing and Boyden chamber assays with a double fluorescence labeling allows for the visualization of different migration patterns between cell lines.

Furthermore, we validated these approaches using an enhanced version of standard migration and invasion assays adding an extra, yet simple, visualization step involving double fluorescence staining of the cytoskeleton and the DNA, upon cytochemical reactions.</p><p id="Par32">The use of fluorescent labeling of the cells to assess their migration and invasion capacities is not novel. However, these methods usually rely on the in vivo labeling of the cells with vital fluorescent stains that are retained by the cells for a number of hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], adding the confounding factor that another chemical is added to the cells while assessing mobility. In our work, we stained the cells with fluorescent stains post-fixation, providing certainty that the staining did not influence migration/invasion. Another advantage of the method is that it does not involve an immune reaction: it is based on the affinity of Phalloidin to F-actin, and of SYTOX&#x000ae; Green or DAPI to DNA, making the approach easy to perform, robust, and straightforward. Finally, the double staining provides extra-information on the morphology of the cytoskeleton while cells are migrating under different conditions. The addition of fluorescence labeling uncovered varying migration patterns between different cancer cell lines. Certain cell lines were found to undergo single-cell migration, while others were found to undergo collective-cell migration (rev. in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). Notably, staining F-actin and DNA allowed the distinction of these two types of migratory patterns, as well as the recognition of cell lines with a mixed pattern of migration.</p><p id="Par33">Moreover, in the assays involving movement through a membrane, the double staining allows for detailed visualization of how cellular compartments move through the 8&#x02009;&#x003bc;m membrane pores, giving precise information on the localization of the nucleus relative to the movement of the cytoplasm. This is important as the positioning and movement of the nuclei are essential for the process of migration and, hence, invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For instance, whereas in bi-dimensional models the nucleus is often positioned in the back of the cell, during tri-dimensional migration the nucleus may be positioned in the front or back of the cell depending on cellular type (rev. in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). During metastasis, the nucleus leading edge is the main barrier when migrating through tight spaces, such as when cancer cells pass through an endothelial cell layer. Supporting this concept, it was demonstrated with leucocytes that the localization of their nuclear lobes at the forefront of the cells act as a &#x02018;drilling&#x02019; device by bending endothelial actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Finally, another feature that was enhanced using dual fluorescence along tri-dimensional migration (Boyden chamber assay) was the capacity to detect modifications in the distribution of F-actin among the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This was evident in SKOV-3 and LNCaP cells in which treatment with MF increased the number of cells showing yellow fluorescence in the nucleus, signifying an overlapping of SYTOX&#x000ae; Green Nucleic Acid Stain binding DNA (green) with that of AlexaFluor&#x000ae;594 Phalloidin binding F-actin (red) (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3). This feature is important to point out as F-actin can be visualized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus under particular conditions as a result of its movement via transport molecules (rev. in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). For instance, nuclear actin has been shown to be important in chromatin remodeling and organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and during cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], highlighting the relevance of its location, in particular, when exposing cells to cytotoxic agents.</p><p id="Par35">Expectations suggest that the impairment in the adhesive capacity of cells exposed to MF should negatively impact their dissemination capacity, because both de-adhesion and adhesion are critical to cancer cell metastasis, since they reflect the initial detachment from the primary tumor site and the re-attachment leading to re-growth at a secondary location. In addition, cell migration is characterized by cyclic detachments of the rear of the cells and attachments to the front, which propel the cell forward. The turnover rate of these adhesions and de-adhesions is critical for migration, and a relationship has been shown between cell de-adhesion and rate of migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that when cancer cells are exposed to cytostatic concentrations of MF, they suffer significant decrease of their ability to attach to various extracellular matrix proteins while suffering major alterations in the distribution of F-actin associated with an increase in the formation of actin ruffles with no adhesion capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These results were recently confirmed in two ovarian cancer cells lines in which MF caused a decrease in the visualization of stress actin fibers, with a concomitant increase in cortical actin and reduced adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. MF also retained the anti-adhesive properties against human melanoma cells when given in combination with doxycycline, aspirin, and lysine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the major metabolite of MF, a mono-demethylated derivative termed metapristone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], is capable of diminishing adhesion of HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells to human extracellular matrix and to umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">The effect of MF reducing cellular adhesion and changing cellular morphology, from their original epithelial shape towards a spindle-like appearance, suggests that the speed of migration may also be positively affected, likely involving EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; however, contrary to the expectation, in all cancer cells studied, treatment with MF significantly attenuated migration of cells in wound healing assays. Firstly, we validated the results of the wound healing assay by showing that cells transiting M phase seem to only be found away from the wound, but not at the wound site, as demonstrated by the expression of the mitotic marker pHH3 (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. As mitoses are usually coupled to cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], labeling with pHH3 could prevent the need to use serum starvation or mitotic poisons to block cell division without killing the cells and, at the same time, allows closure of the wound to be attributed to migration and not cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Secondly, we validated the negative action of MF on migration in a tri-dimensional (Boyden chamber) assay. MF was capable of diminishing cell migration through the 8&#x02009;&#x003bc;m pore polycarbonate membrane as early as 6&#x02009;h in each cell line studied. Supporting our data with ovarian, breast, glial, and prostate cancer cell lines, it was reported very recently that MF inhibited migration induced by progesterone in human astrocytoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], that both MF and its metabolite metapristone inhibited the chemotactic migration and mobility in SKOV-3 and IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cell lines facilitated by activation of the chemokine SDF-1/CXCR4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and that MF inhibited migration and invasion of endometrial carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">MF may have the simultaneous ability to inhibit cell growth and migration via a common mechanism: increase in expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21<sup>cip1</sup>.
