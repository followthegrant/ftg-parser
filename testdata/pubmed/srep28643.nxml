By fusing single-domain antibodies from camelid heavy-chain-only immunoglobulins (V<sub>HHs</sub>) to the N-terminus of a human collagen XVIII trimerization domain (TIE<sup>XVIII</sup>) we produced monospecific trimerbodies that were efficiently secreted as soluble functional proteins by mammalian cells. The purified V<sub>HH</sub>-TIE<sup>XVIII</sup> trimerbodies were trimeric in solution and exhibited excellent antigen binding capacity. Furthermore, by connecting with two additional glycine-serine-based linkers three V<sub>HH</sub>-TIE<sup>XVIII</sup> modules on a single polypeptide chain, we present an approach for the rational design of multispecific tandem trimerbodies with defined stoichiometry and controlled orientation. Using this technology we report here the construction and characterization of a tandem V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbody capable of simultaneously binding to three different antigens: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and green fluorescence protein (GFP). Multispecific tandem V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies were well expressed in mammalian cells, had good biophysical properties and were capable of simultaneously binding their targeted antigens. Importantly, these antibodies were very effective in inhibiting the proliferation of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. Multispecific V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies are therefore ideal candidates for future applications in various therapeutic areas.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The development of hybridoma technology in 1975 by Kohler and Milstein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> provided an invaluable tool for the generation of highly specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with a plethora of applications in research, diagnosis, and therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Up to date, forty-three mAbs have been approved by US or EU regulatory agencies for therapeutic use<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. These molecules are generally well tolerated and constitute powerful treatment options for a variety of pathological conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, conventional bivalent monospecific mAbs have limitations, such as inadequate pharmacokinetics and tissue accessibility and unwanted Fc-mediated interactions, at least in some contexts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p><p>To overcome these handicaps, considerable efforts have focused on the development of next generation antibody-based therapeutics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Conversion of monovalent antibody fragments [e.g. fragment antigen-binding (Fab), single-chain variable fragment (scFv), or single-domain antibody (sdAb)], into multivalent formats enhances functional affinity, decreases dissociation rates and improves biodistribution<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The most common strategies to produce multivalent formats have been the engineering of fusion proteins in which the antibody fragment makes a complex with oligomerization domains, and the generation of concatenated &#x0201c;tandem&#x0201d; subunit constructs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>Recently, we have developed a technology platform for the rapid and efficient generation of multivalent antibodies, termed trimerbodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Engineered homotrimeric antibodies have been obtained by fusing scFv fragments with collagen-derived trimerization (TIE) domains, composed of the N-terminal trimerization region of collagen XVIII NC1 or collagen XV NC1 flanked by flexible peptide linkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Using this technology we have generated monospecific trivalent trimerbodies (N-trimerbodies or C-trimerbodies; 110&#x02009;kDa) and monospecific or bispecific hexavalent trimerbodies (N/C-trimerbodies; 190&#x02009;kDa). Trivalent and hexavalent scFv-based trimerbodies demonstrated excellent antigen binding capacity and multivalency <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor-targeting efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic> in several mouse models of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we have generated N-terminal trimerbodies by fusing sdAbs from camelid heavy-chain-only immunoglobulins (V<sub>HHs</sub>) to the N-terminus of a TIE<sup>XVIII</sup> domain. V<sub>HH</sub> antibodies are of particular interest for protein engineering approaches. Despite their small-size (12&#x02013;15&#x02009;kDa) and strict monomeric behavior they possess affinities in the same range of conventional antibodies with paired V<sub>H</sub>/V<sub>L</sub>domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Furthermore, we present an approach to the rational design of multispecific tandem V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies with defined stoichiometry. Tandem trimerbodies were built by connecting with two additional glycine-serine-based linkers three V<sub>HH</sub>-TIE<sup>XVIII</sup> modules on a single polypeptide chain. Recombinant V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies were efficiently secreted as soluble proteins by transfected human HEK-293 cells and were able to recognize their cognate antigen/s with high affinity and specificity. The strategy described herein can be used to efficiently produce multispecific molecules from pre-existent sdAbs. As this new antibody format can target two or more antigens it might have therapeutic potential in multiples diseases, simultaneously inhibiting different pathways involved in their etiopathogenesis as a mean<bold>s</bold> to avoid the appearance of resistance.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Design and expression of V<sub>HH</sub>-based N-terminal trimerbodies</title><p>In this study we generated N-terminal trimerbodies using sdAb fragments (V<sub>HH</sub>) as binding domains. We fused the CEA-specific CEA.1 V<sub>HH</sub> to the N-terminus of a TIE<sup>XVIII</sup> domain through flexible linkers of 17 or 7 residues (&#x003b1;CEA<sup>N17</sup> or &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Both constructs were produced in HEK-293 cells more efficiently than the anti-CEA scFv-based trimerbody (MFE23<sup>N21</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (&#x003b1;CEA<sup>N17</sup>, 2.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> cells/48&#x02009;hours; &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup> 2.9&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> cells/48&#x02009;hours; MFE23<sup>N21</sup>, 1.3&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> cells/48&#x02009;hours). Western blot analysis under reducing conditions also showed a migration pattern of &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N17</sup> and &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup> consistent with the molecular weights calculated from their amino acid sequences (27.6 and 25.8&#x02009;kDa, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). ELISA analysis demonstrated that both &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N17</sup> and &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup> trimerbodies specifically recognize CEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p>To validate the ability of TIE domains to trimerize V<sub>HH</sub> antibodies with different specificities, we designed N-terminal trimerbody constructs bearing an anti-GFP V<sub>HH</sub> (&#x003b1;GFP) or an anti-EGFR V<sub>HH</sub> (&#x003b1;EGFR) fused to the N-terminus of a TIE<sup>XVIII</sup> domain through a 7-residue-long flexible linker (TIE<sup>N7</sup>). Both &#x003b1;GFP<sup>N7</sup> and &#x003b1;EGFR<sup>N7</sup> constructs were secreted by transfected human HEK-293 cells, to similar levels as the &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup> (&#x003b1;GFP<sup>N7</sup>, 1.9&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> cells/48&#x02009;hours; &#x003b1;EGFR<sup>N7</sup> 2.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> cells/48&#x02009;hours). Western blot analysis, under reducing conditions, demonstrated that &#x003b1;GFP<sup>N7</sup> and &#x003b1;EGFR<sup>N7</sup> trimerbodies were single-chain-type molecules with a migration pattern consistent with the molecular weights calculated from their amino acid sequences (22.4 and 27.1&#x02009;kDa, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p>ELISA analysis demonstrated that both secreted &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup> and &#x003b1;GFP<sup>N7</sup> trimerbodies specifically recognize their cognate antigens immobilized on plastic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>). The ability to detect antigen in a cellular context was studied by immunofluorescence labeling of human tumor cells (Jurkat or HeLa). Fluorescence staining was observed after incubation of the EGFR-expressing human cervix adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa with &#x003b1;EGFR<sup>N7</sup>, while no binding was detected for &#x003b1;GFP<sup>N7</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). The EGFR-negative human T lymphoblastoid cell line Jurkat showed no binding of &#x003b1;EGFR<sup>N7</sup> and &#x003b1;GFP<sup>N7</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). These results demonstrated that the V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies recognized not only purified immobilized antigen, but also the antigen when expressed on the cell surface.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Design and expression of tandem V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies</title><p>Next, we designed a V<sub>HH</sub>-based monospecific trimerbody in a single-chain format consisting of three &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup> trimerbodies connected by two glycine-serine-based linkers on a single protein chain (V<sub>HH</sub>-based tandem trimerbodies; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The anti-CEA tandem trimerbody (tt&#x003b1;CEA) was secreted as soluble functional protein by transfected HEK-293 cells (0.8&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> cells/48&#x02009;hours). Western blot analysis demonstrated that under reducing conditions the migration pattern of the secreted tt&#x003b1;CEA is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass consistent with the 69.9&#x02009;kDa calculated from its amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The functionality of tt&#x003b1;CEA was demonstrated by ELISA against plastic immobilized CEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The differences in the ELISA signals may be a result of the number of c-myc tags, three copies in the conventional multi-chain trimerbody (&#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup>) and one copy in the tandem single-chain trimerbody (tt&#x003b1;CEA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p>To further assess the multivalency and multispecificity of tandem V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies we designed a construct containing one copy of the &#x003b1;GFP<sup>N7</sup> gene and two copies of the &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup> gene connected by the described flexible linkers [tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This construct was produced as soluble functional protein by gene-modified HEK-293 cells (1.3&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> cells/48&#x02009;hours). Western blot analysis under reducing conditions demonstrated that tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup> is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass consistent with the 69.6&#x02009;kDa calculated from its amino acid sequence (66.9&#x02009;kDa without the signal sequence; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The bispecificity of the tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup> was analyzed by ELISA using immobilized human CEA and GFP. Whereas the tt&#x003b1;CEA showed specific binding to CEA, the tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup> showed binding to both antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>). GFP has a molecular mass (27&#x02009;kDa), which is significantly smaller than CEA (77&#x02009;kDa). This determines a higher antigenic density in the GFP-coated ELISA plate, which allows to reach signal saturation even to the single c-myc-tagged tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup>. Furthermore, when conditioned medium from cotransfected (&#x003b1;GFP<sup>N7</sup> and &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup>) or single-transfected (tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup>) HEK-293 cells was added to CEA-coated wells and, after washing, the CEA-bound trimerbodies were able to capture soluble GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Anti-CEA V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies (&#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup> and tt&#x003b1;CEA) were found to bind to CEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>), but the bound trimerbodies did not capture soluble GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p><p>In a further approach, we designed a tandem V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbody construct containing three different V<sub>HH</sub> (&#x003b1;GFP<sup>N7</sup>, &#x003b1;EGFR<sup>N7</sup> and &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup>) connected by the described flexible linkers [tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The trispecific tandem trimerbody was secreted by transfected HEK-293 cells (1.0&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> cells/48&#x02009;hours). Western blot analysis under reducing conditions revealed that tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass consistent with the 72.2&#x02009;kDa calculated from its amino acid sequence (68.5 without the signal sequence; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Conditioned media from HEK-293 cells transfected with tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA recognized GFP and CEA immobilized on plastic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Tandem trimerbodies were further analyzed by flow cytometry for binding to EGFR-negative and EGFR-positive tumor cell lines. Fluorescence staining was observed after incubation of EGFR-expressing HeLa cells with tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA trimerbody, demonstrating its ability to detect the antigen in a cellular context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, incubation of HeLa cells with tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup> trimerbody or incubation of Jurkat cells with tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA trimerbody revealed no staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Conditioned medium from HEK-293 cells transfected with plasmids tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup> or tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA was added to CEA-coated wells and, after washing, the CEA-bound trimerbodies were able to capture soluble GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies in the supernatant from HEK-293 transfected with plasmid encoding tt&#x003b1;CEA did not capture soluble GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). To further assess the multivalency and multispecificity of tandem V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies we performed adhesion assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>, EGFR-positive HeLa cells adhered to GFP- and CEA-coated wells after incubation with conditioned medium containing tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA. Moreover, trispecific tandem trimerbody was as efficient as laminin in supporting the adhesion of EGFR-positive cells. The adhesion of HeLa cells was specific since no adhesion of EGFR-negative Jurkat cells to GFP- and CEA-coated wells was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Furthermore, GFP- and CEA-coated wells, preincubated with conditioned medium from HEK-293 cells transfected with tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup> plasmids did not support any significant cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Purification and structural characterization of V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies</title><p>The &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup>, tt&#x003b1;CEA, tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup> and tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA trimerbodies were purified from conditioned medium by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, which yielded proteins that were &#x0003e;90% pure, as estimated by visual inspection of reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The trimeric nature of the molecules was confirmed by SEC-MALLS measurements. The sample of &#x003b1;CEA<sup>N7</sup> eluted from the size exclusion column as a major symmetric peak, and the mass calculated from the dispersed light at the center of the peak was 70.2&#x02009;kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This value is smaller than the 77.3&#x02009;kDa calculated for a trimer based on the amino acid sequence of this protein, but very close to the 69.2&#x02009;kDa of a trimer calculated from the sequence excluding the N-terminal oncostatin M signal sequence. Mass spectrometry by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization confirmed the absence of the N-terminal 25 residues, suggesting that the signal sequence was cleaved during protein secretion. Purified tandem trimerbodies eluted from the size exclusion column as major symmetric peaks, with a very small portion of high molecular weight aggregates eluting at the exclusion volume of the column (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The masses calculated from the dispersed light at the center of the peaks were 65.7, 63.2, and 76.3&#x02009;kDa for tt&#x003b1;CEA, tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup>, and tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA respectively, close to the calculated values of 67.2, 66.9, and 68.5&#x02009;kDa excluding the signal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p><p>The structure of the trimeric antibodies was investigated by circular dichroism. The spectra of the four proteins are very similar, with a minimum at around 218&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), typical of proteins with predominantly &#x003b2;-sheet secondary structure. The trimerbodies are globally folded into stable three-dimensional structures, as seen by their cooperative thermal denaturations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>).

Regardless of the presence of the additional linkers, the sterically allowed spatial distribution of the V<sub>HH</sub> domains have an oblate shape, but slightly bigger for the multi-chain trimerbody with approximately 125 and 110&#x02009;&#x000c5; axes, than for the tandem trimerbody, with 125 and 105&#x02009;&#x000c5; axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). The tandem V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbody is, on average, more compact, likely due to the restrictions in movement imposed by the extra linkers on the internal and C-terminal V<sub>HH</sub> domains, but the difference is small (84% surface area as compared with the multi-chain trimerbody). However, the relative orientation of the V<sub>HH</sub> domains is severely restricted in both trimerbodies, with defined regions on the surface predominantly occupied by each of the three V<sub>HH</sub> domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). As the multi-chain trimerbody contains three identical segments, each one of the V<sub>HH</sub> domains explores similar surface areas. In the tandem trimerbody, however, the internal and C-terminal V<sub>HH</sub> domains are linked to TIE trimerization domains by two linkers, but only one in the case of the N-terminal V<sub>HH</sub> domain. As a consequence, the surface area sampled by the N-terminal V<sub>HH</sub> domain is approximately 30% larger than that sampled by anyone of the other two (which sample approximately the same surface area).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we used the trimerbody technology platform for the production of trivalent V<sub>HH</sub>-based molecules. We fused V<sub>HH</sub> antibodies with different specificities to the N-terminus of a human TIE<sup>XVIII</sup> domain using linker sequences of different lengths. All the V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies were expressed in functional active form from conditioned medium of transfected HEK-293 cells, and importantly their production levels were higher than those of scFv-based trimerbodies with the same configuration. The purified V<sub>HH</sub>-based molecules were trimeric in solution and shown specific binding to their cognate antigens.</p><p>Furthermore, we demonstrated that multispecific molecules can be generated by co-transfecting HEK-293 cells with plasmids encoding several V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies with different specificities. However, assuming that the rate of synthesis is the same for all the proteins and that trimerization happens randomly one would expect 10% of the total trimerbody to be trispecific. Therefore, this strategy would require the isolation of the trimerbody with the desired V<sub>HH</sub> combination, for instance by means of three purification steps based on three orthogonal affinity tags. Such a process may be feasible but not efficient.</p><p>Taking advantage of the small size and favorable biophysical properties of V<sub>HH</sub> antibodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and human TIE<sup>XVIII</sup> domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, we present an approach to rationally design multispecific V<sub>HH</sub>-based N-trimerbodies with defined stoichiometry. We built tandem trimerbodies by connecting with additional glycine-serine-based linkers the C-terminus of the N-terminal and central TIE domain with the N-terminus of the central and C-terminal V<sub>HH</sub> antibodies. Recombinant monospecific and multispecific (bi and trispecific) tandem V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies were efficiently secreted as soluble proteins by transfected human HEK-293 cells, and were easily purified using standard chromatographic methods. The purified tandem trimerbodies were highly homogeneous non-aggregating molecules in solution, as unambiguously shown by the light scattering measurements. The intramolecular assembly versus intermolecular assembly during the folding of the chains in the cell could be favored by the design of the linkers connecting the trimerization and the V<sub>HH</sub> domains. Alternatively, intermolecular assemblies may be formed but are not secreted. The high level of protein production, however, suggests that intramolecular trimerization is favored.</p><p>The purified monospecific and multispecific tandem V<sub>HH</sub>-based trimerbodies were very efficient at recognizing antigen. Biolayer interferometry analysis revealed that the trispecific tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA tandem trimerbody was capable of binding concurrently to three antigens, indicating that each domain independently binds to its cognate antigen. Importantly, this molecule recognized surface EGFR as efficiently as the anti-EGFR mAb panitumumab, and it was very efficient and specific at inducing cell adhesion of EGFR-expressing cells when pre-incubated on plastic-bound CEA or plastic-bound GFP, but not on plastic-bound BSA. Furthermore, the purified tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA trimerbody was shown to block EGFR proliferation almost as efficiently as cetuximab in A431 cells. One could speculate that for some applications where a strong cross-linking of cell surface receptors is necessary, the presence of two V<sub>HH</sub> domains with limited mobility could be favorable. The flexible linkers in the trimerbodies are long enough to allow the V<sub>HH</sub> domains to access a large surface area around the trimerization domain but short enough to restrict their relative orientations, and in the tandem trimerbody, the additional linkers reduced the surface accessible to the central and C-terminal domains. Therefore, this design allows for tuning the relative mobility and orientation of the individual V<sub>HH</sub> domains.</p><p>Monovalent V<sub>HH</sub> antibodies are not optimal for the <italic>in vivo</italic> therapeutic applications.

The column was equilibrated with running buffer (PBS&#x02009;+&#x02009;0.03% NaN<sub>3</sub>, 0.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;m filtered) and the SEC-MALLS system was calibrated with a sample of BSA at 1&#x02009;g/L in the same buffer.

Data acquisition and analysis were performed using ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology). The molar mass data shown in the figures were smoothed (the mass measured at the center of the peak changes by less than 0.5% after smoothing).

An Autoflex III MALDI-TOF/TOF spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) was used in linear mode with the following settings: 5000&#x02013;40000 Th window, linear positive mode, ion source 1: 20&#x02009;kV, ion source 2: 18.5&#x02009;kV, lens: 9&#x02009;kV, pulsed ion extraction of 120&#x02009;ns, high gating ion suppression up to 1000 Mr. Mass calibration was performed externally with protein 1 standard calibration mixture (Bruker Daltonics).

Following re-equilibration in kinetics buffer (0.1% BSA in PBS, 0.05% Tween20), association was measured over 2&#x02009;hours against 50, 25 and 12.5&#x02009;nM of CEA diluted in kinetics buffer, followed by 2&#x02009;hours of dissociation in analyte-free kinetics buffer. The experiments were performed at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C on an Octet RED96 instrument (Fortebio) while shaken at 1000&#x02009;rpm. Sensorgrams obtained from individual biosensors were analyzed by local fitting to a 1:1 model with Octet Data Analysis software (Fortebio). The multispecificity of tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup> and tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA trimerbodies were demonstrated by measuring their simultaneous binding of multiple antigens. First, GFP was immobilized onto AR2G biosensors at 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL in loading buffer, for 20&#x02009;minutes, to a signal of 0.77&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.12&#x02009;nm. The GFP-coated biosensors were loaded with tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup> or tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA trimerbodies at 30&#x02009;nM for 1&#x02009;hour in kinetics buffer. The trimerbody-loaded biosensors were then moved into wells containing 50&#x02009;nM of CEA in kinetics buffer for 1&#x02009;hour. Finally, the biosensors were moved into wells with 10&#x02009;nM of EGFR in kinetics buffer for 1&#x02009;hour, followed by 1&#x02009;hour of dissociation in analyte-free kinetics buffer. For every step involving analyte (e.g. trimerbody, CEA, and EGFR), a control biosensor was included which was moved into an analyte-free well, and a trimerbody-free biosensor was used to monitor the non-specific binding of CEA and EGFR to the GFP-coated biosensor surface. BSA-coated biosensors gave no response against 30&#x02009;nM of tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;CEA<sup>(1:2)</sup> or tt&#x003b1;GFP-&#x003b1;EGFR-&#x003b1;CEA trimerbodies in kinetics buffer (data not shown).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Analysis of the active surface</title><p>The comparative analysis of the sampling space accessible for the V<sub>HH</sub> domains in the intermolecular versus the intramolecular (single chain) trimerbodies was performed through homology modeling with MODELLER<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.
