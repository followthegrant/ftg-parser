This process initiates at the plasma membrane, converges with autophagy, and terminates at the lysosome. It is well-established that cellular uptake of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) proceeds through the endocytic pathway; however, only a small fraction escapes endosomal trafficking while the majority are rendered inactive in the lysosome. Since these pathways converge and share common molecular machinery, it is unclear if autophagy-related trafficking participates in ASO uptake or whether modulation of autophagy affects ASO activity and localization. To address these questions, we investigated the effects of autophagy modulation on ASO activity in cells and mice. We found that enhancing autophagy through small-molecule mTOR inhibition, serum-starvation/fasting, and ketogenic diet, increased ASO-mediated target reduction <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, autophagy activation enhanced the localization of ASOs into autophagosomes without altering intracellular concentrations or trafficking to other compartments. These results support a novel role for autophagy and the autophagosome as a previously unidentified compartment that participates in and contributes to enhanced ASO activity. Further, we demonstrate non-chemical methods to enhance autophagy and subsequent ASO activity using translatable approaches such as fasting or ketogenic diet.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Ionis Pharmaceuticals</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100013669</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="20"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have been extensively developed for use as research tools and therapeutic agents that modulate gene expression through various cellular mechanisms (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). To improve chemical stability and pharmacological efficacy, ASOs are commonly synthesized with a phosphorothioate (PS) backbone and also contain sugar modifications that include but are not limited to 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methoxyethyl (MOE) or constrained ethyl (cEt) at the 2&#x02032;-position of the ribose (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). An employed mechanism involves chimeric or &#x02018;gapmer&#x02019; design ASOs, whereby residues at each terminus of the oligo are chemically modified and flank a central DNA region, enabling knockdown of their RNA target via direct sequence-specific cleavage mediated by the RNase H1 endonuclease (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A major advantage of ASOs is their hydrophobicity and interactions with surface proteins which enables them to enter cells independent of nanoparticles, liposomes or conjugation to cell-penetrating peptides (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). For example, ASOs interact with receptors including stabilin and EGFR, which mediate ASO uptake through receptor-dependent endocytosis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Upon internalization, ASOs traffic through early endosomes (EE) within 10&#x02013;30 min, transport to late endosomes (LEs) within 20&#x02013;60 min, and ultimately reach the lysosome between 2 and&#x000a0;4 h&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). While differences in endocytic internalization and trafficking of ASOs may vary by cell-type, it is evident that after internalization only a small fraction of intracellular ASOs contribute to overall activity, as the majority of ASOs exist in non-productive compartments such as the lysosome. Thus, one strategy to increase the potency of oligonucleotide therapeutics is to enhance endolysosomal escape, which may also enable effective oligonucleotide activity in a broader range of cell types (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms by which ASOs traffic to and from various membrane-enclosed organelles is critical to understand the processes that ultimately lead to release and accumulation of ASO at target sites.</p><p>An important challenge for conceptualizing endo-lysosomal trafficking of ASOs is the reality that endocytosis is not an isolated pathway leading from the endosome to the lysosome, but rather a complex web of inputs and outputs from other trafficking cascades (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). One such pathway is macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), which is a catabolic pathway that sequesters protein aggregates, damaged organelles, or intracellular pathogens in double-membraned autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes to achieve degradation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Autophagy functions to supplement cellular metabolism during periods of starvation, but also serves as a mechanism to dispose toxic species that would otherwise disrupt cellular homeostasis. Initiation of autophagy is suppressed by the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase complex 1 (mTORC1), whose activity is regulated by nutrient availability and cellular stress (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Following mTORC1 inhibition, the ULK1 and Beclin1/VPS34 kinase complexes trigger the sequential recruitment of autophagy-related (ATG) proteins to nascent phagophores through a ubiquitin-like conjugation cascade that drives autophagosome formation (e.g. ATG5-12-16L) and cargo recruitment (e.g. ATG8/LC3). Active mTOR also functions to maintain cytoplasmic localization of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a critical transcription factor governing the expression of autophagy and lysosome-related genes. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 directly phosphorylates and inhibits TFEB (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Conversely, inhibition of mTORC1 leads to the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB, where it enhances transcription of CLEAR network genes, resulting in biogenesis and activation of autolysosomal machinery (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>).</p><p>Previous work has invoked the idea that pharmacological modulation of autophagy might increase oligonucleotide distribution in cells, resulting in enhanced knockdown activity. Interestingly, it has been suggested that pharmacological modulation of autophagic processes might alter oligonucleotide efficiency, distribution, and activity (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref>). However, these studies inferred a role for autophagy in oligonucleotide uptake and trafficking based on experiments that used artificial lipid-based delivery systems which have been reported to not only induce non-physiological electrostatic-mediated endosomal escape but also result in increased autophagosome production and autophagy induction (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref>). The effects of lipid-based delivery on autophagy and endo-lysosomal trafficking not only complicate these previous interpretations regarding the effects of autophagy on oligonucleotide activity, but also question their relevance to physiological settings involving naked antisense oligonucleotides, which are taken-up freely. Experiments focused on simultaneous autophagy modulation and ASO trafficking and activity would provide an understanding of oligonucleotide intracellular fate, trafficking, and delivery beyond the current paradigm of endosome to lysosome.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the interdependence of autophagy and ASO localization and activity in tissue culture cells and in mice. We examined autophagic flux following free-uptake and electroporated delivery of ASOs and found that both basal and starvation-induced autophagy are insensitive to ASOs as cargo. To investigate the influence of autophagy on the performance of ASO activity, we evaluated target RNA knockdown during autophagy activation and inhibition. To our surprise, autophagy activation resulted in enhanced knockdown efficiency when ASOs were delivered by free-uptake, while inhibition of the pathway either early in induction or late in maturation resulted in decreased knockdown efficiency. Furthermore, quantitative fluorescence microscopy indicated that the increased activity we observed was clearly associated with enhanced localization of ASOs to autophagosomes. These results were consistent across various cell lines, ASO chemistries and target RNAs. In addition, pharmacological, starvation and ketogenic diet-induced autophagy enhanced ASO activity in mouse liver, providing robust confirmation that this mechanism extends <italic>in vivo</italic>. This work identifies that the autophagosome is an important dynamic compartment that contributes to intracellular ASO trafficking and activity and suggests a novel mechanism to enhance ASO-mediated knockdown efficiency potentially through fasting or autophagy enhancing diets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Antibodies, plasmids, siRNAs, ASOs and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) primer probe sets, and pharmacokinetic analysis protocols are described in Supplementary Data.</p><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ionis is AAALAC accredited and follows the 8th Ed. of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the 2013 AVMA guidelines for the euthanasia of animals.

Cell lines were treated with baculovirus expressing the tandem fluorescent-LC3B reporter, which utilizes an acid-sensitive GFP with an acid-insensitive RFP to indicate the transition from autophagosome (neutral pH) to autolysosome (acidic pH). Thus, autophagosomes exhibit RFP/GFP colocalization (yellow), while after fusion with lysosomes, autolysosomes are only shown as red puncta. Cells were treated with either DMSO or AZD8055, a potent catalytic inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), for 14 h prior to administration of an ALEXA647-conjugated ASO for 10 h. Live-cell imaging revealed clear co-localization of ASO and autophagosomes in both cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We quantified the number of surface-rendered GFP-LC3B-positive vesicles containing a mean intensity signal ASO and compared this to total autophagosome counts between DMSO- and AZD8055-treated cells. In both cell lines, AZD8055 significantly enhanced autophagy, autophagosome production, and localization of ASO into the autophagosome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; Supplemental Figure S1).

However, upon Atg5 or Atg7 knockdown, AZD8055 had no significant impact on ASO activity relative to DMSO-treated cells indicating that AZD8055-mediated enhancement of ASO activity is dependent on phagophore formation and activation of autophagy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-7"><title>Autophagy induction correlates with enhanced ASO activity <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Finally, we sought to evaluate the ability of autophagy activation to increase the efficacy of ASO-mediated gene reduction <italic>in vivo</italic>. To activate autophagy in male C57BL/6J mice, we administered 5 mg/kg DMSO, Rapamycin, or AZD8055 every 10&#x02013;12 h for three total injections, or subjected mice to either a short 16-hour fast or a 5-week ketogenic diet, both of which have been shown to inhibit mTORC1 activity and activate autophagy in mice (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Mice were also given a single 5 mg/kg dose of either PBS, control ASO, or Malat1 MOE ASO (cEt chemistry for Ketogenic Diet) concurrently at the time of initial mTOR inhibitor dosing, food restriction (fasting study), or after 5 weeks on ketogenic diet (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Twenty four hours following initial ASO administrations (or 16 h for fasting study), mice were sacrificed and liver tissue was collected to examine the effects of autophagy induction on ASO activity. In mice treated with either AZD8055 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), Rapamycin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>), a short fasting paradigm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>), or 5-week ketogenic diet (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>), autophagy was significantly activated in livers as indicated by suppression of mTOR kinase activity (pS6/S6 levels) and increased LC3B II/I ratio. Consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, activation of autophagy significantly enhanced ASO activity as demonstrated by greater Malat1 gene expression reduction in the livers of mice treated with AZD8055, Rapamycin, 16-hour fasting regimen, and ketogenic diet (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>). Autophagy activation did not result in a significant or consistent change in liver ASO concentrations as measured by LLE/SPE and analysed by LC&#x02013;MS/MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9A&#x02013;D</xref>). Additionally, no significant changes in plasma ALT/AST levels, organ, or animal weights were observed in any of the treatment groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10A&#x02013;D</xref>). Finally, we sought to evaluate the short and long-term kinetics of the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of ketogenic diet-induced autophagy on ASO activity. Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a 5-week ketogenic diet prior to administration of a single bolus 5 mg/kg dose of either PBS, control ASO, or Malat cEt ASO for either 24, 48 or 72 h&#x000a0;(short term) or 1, 2&#x000a0;or 3 weeks prior to tissue collection. Mice fed a ketogenic diet exhibited significantly enhanced ASO activity across all three short-term time points relative to normal diet-fed mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that ASO-mediated gene reduction continued to increase from &#x0223c;81% at 24 h to &#x0223c;90% target reduction at 72 h following a single ASO injection in mice fed a ketogenic diet versus mice fed a normal diet in which ASO activity plateaued at &#x0223c;70% target reduction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Upon examining long term ASO activity, we found that mice fed a ketogenic diet consistently maintained a significant enhancement in activity (&#x0223c;20&#x02013;30%) versus normal diet at 1, 2&#x000a0;and 3 weeks post-single ASO administration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). These findings suggest that administration of ASOs into an activated autophagic state driven by ketosis does not result in saturated activity at 24 h but rather continual enhancement of activity over a short-term period (&#x0223c;72 h) followed by maintained enhancement over time following a single ASO dose (3 weeks). Given previously published findings of mTOR inhibition and autophagy activation in muscle tissue following ketogenic diet administration (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), we examined whether ASO activity was also enhanced in muscle similar to liver, following single-dose administered ASO. We found that mice treated with ketogenic diet had significantly enhanced ASO activity, as measured by Malat1 gene expression in muscle tissue, 1-week following single-dose ASO administration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Autophagy induction in liver enhances ASO activity in C57/BL6 mice.

In this study, we identified that autophagosomes, which are known to interact with LEs, contribute significantly to ASO trafficking and activity under physiologically-relevant ASO uptake and delivery mechanisms in both cultured cells and animal models. When nutrients are non-limiting and/or mTORC1 is active, the default contribution of autophagy to ASO activity is relatively low. However, activation of the autophagy pathway prior to or following free-uptake of ASOs significantly enhances colocalization of ASOs with autophagosomes. Further, there is a clear correlation between ASO-autophagosome colocalization and enhanced target RNA knockdown suggesting that this compartment may contribute to productive activity and/or release of ASOs.</p><p>Although the properties of oligonucleotide trafficking and delivery have been extensively studied and optimized for many years, the precise mechanisms by which endo-lysosomal escape occurs are not fully understood. Autophagy is a key pathway that bridges endosome-to-lysosome trafficking, but its role in ASO biology has been understudied. A better understanding of the interactions between autophagy and intracellular oligonucleotide trafficking is critical to uncover mechanisms of ASO escape from non-productive compartments. The main features of autophagy are the biogenesis and maturation of autophagosomes, processing, and delivery of certain cargo to the lysosome, suggesting that autophagy may somehow contribute to intracellular ASO delivery and trafficking through its interactions with the endo-lysosomal cascade. Interestingly, the effects we observed upon modulating autophagy both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> on ASO activity are dose-responsive and depend on the level of autophagy activation achieved. AZD8055 administration consistently showed the most potent activation of autophagy and autophagosome production, followed by Rapamycin, and then fasting or nutrient deprivation. The level of enhancement of ASO activity with these treatment paradigms followed similar trends. Additionally, ketogenic diet groups demonstrated a 57% enhancement of cEt ASO activity compared to control diet-fed mice which was marked by a robust suppression of mTORC1 activity and activation of autophagy. These effects may be due to the inherent mechanisms by which autophagy and autophagosome biogenesis is initiated. Recent reports have shown that acute starvation-mediated activation of autophagy initially involves endosomal microautophagy and that only after prolonged nutrient deprivation, does macroautophagy turn on (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). During this acute selective autophagy, many autophagosomal factors become substrates for endolysosomes. This delay in canonical autophagosome biogenesis during the early stages of starvation-induced autophagy when compared to small molecule-mediated or ketogenic diet-mediated mTOR inhibition may explain the weaker effect observed with fasting compared to the other treatment groups. Accordingly, a longer fasting regimen may provide sufficient time for macroautophagy to commence and have greater impact on ASO activity. These observations suggest that ASO activity may correlate, beyond a certain threshold, with the level of autophagy activation and the rate of autophagosome biogenesis. Additionally, our findings that ASO activity can be continuously enhanced in mice treated with a ketogenic diet over time suggests that this effect may be propagating rather than saturating.</p><p>A critical question stemming from these studies is how is ASO localization within autophagosomes resulting in enhanced ASO activity. Similar to endosomes, the primary termination point for autophagosomes is fusion with the lysosome. Because of this, it is surprising that ASO localization within autophagosomes is correlated with higher ASO activity, as endosomal and lysosomal escape has been suggested to be the rate-limiting step in antisense activity. A possible explanation for these results may lie within the autophagosome formation process itself. Autophagosomes appear de novo and while the exact origins and mechanisms of their formation is still under investigation, it has been suggested that a potential frequent and proximal membrane source for new forming phagophores upon autophagy induction is the ER and Golgi (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Interestingly, ASOs have been shown to localize in various perinuclear structures and Golgi-58K-related cytoplasmic vesicles upon free-uptake (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It is possible that, upon initiation of autophagosome production, various membrane pools containing ASO are shuttled to the forming phagophore and subsequently taken up. It is potentially at this point during autophagosome formation, just prior to phagophore closure and completion, that ASOs may potentially leak and escape delivery to the lysosome.</p><p>Another possible membrane and potential source of ASOs for forming autophagosomes is the endo-lysosomal network itself. Given that autophagosomes interact at several nodes within the endo-lysosomal system, one question is whether autophagy activation is shuttling ASO away from the late endosome (LE) compartment. While we attempted to examine this effect concurrently with our investigation of early endosomes and lysosomes, we were unable to examine potential ASO localization shifts to and from the LE. This was primarily due to the observed and reported involvement of canonical LE proteins and selection markers (e.g. Rab5, Rab7, CD63, LBPA) in the normal progression and initiation of autophagy (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47&#x02013;51</xref>). Shortly after autophagosomes form, they acquire proteins and enzymes that are normally found in multivesicular bodies, LEs, and lysosomes (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), which supports a model in which diverse membrane components are delivered by vesicle fusion to the forming autophagosome membrane. For example, we find that almost immediately upon activation of autophagy, Rab7 colocalizes with LC3B-positive autophagosomes, making it challenging to distinguish LE vesicle pools from newly formed autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>). This may provide some evidence that the autophagosome-localized ASO is derived from LE pools. Indeed, it has been suggested that endosomes, in addition to other compartments such as recycling endosomes, trans-Golgi vesicles, and endoplasmic reticulum, may serve as possible sources for the lipid bilayers of forming autophagosomes (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54&#x02013;56</xref>). Interestingly, we did not observe a significant change in ASO distribution to the autophagosome or enhancement of ASO activity upon autophagy activation through TFEB overexpression. One explanation for this may be that the lipid and membrane pools by which autophagosome biogenesis occurs are different between mTORC1-direct versus TFEB-mediated induction. While it is important to note that TFEB does have extensive interplay with regards to mTOR signaling (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), little is known about the differences in autophagosome biogenesis between activation of the two. Additionally, we observed that TFEB-overexpressing cells have a significantly decreased ratio of total lysosomes that contain ASO along with overall decreased concentration of ASO within the cell, suggesting there may be enhanced clearance of lysosomal cargo. Interestingly, knockdown of TFEB resulted in slightly enhanced ASO activity independent of mTOR inhibition further suggesting that lysosomal biogenesis and sequestration into this non-productive sink may contribute to inactivity of ASOs. Moreover, alterations in vesicle trafficking facilitated by simultaneous lysosome and autophagosome biogenesis may also contribute to the lack of an effect on ASO activity with TFEB activation. Presumably, certain lipid sources may contain pools of accumulated ASO, which may consequently shuttle to forming phagophores upon autophagy induction and thus shift oligonucleotide localization from a non-productive to potentially productive compartment. A better understanding with regards to phagophore formation, lysosomal contributions, and vesicle dynamics will be needed to tease apart these mechanisms in the future.</p><p>Autophagosomes are believed to form randomly throughout the cytoplasm, are trafficked along microtubules toward and away from the nucleus, and ultimately fuse with lysosomes near the perinuclear region of the cell (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Various live-imaging studies have shown that mature autophagosomes move along microtubule tracks toward lysosomes and that the localization of lysosomes determines the rate of autophagosomal fusion. Increasing the perinuclear localization of lysosomes by depletion of certain kinesin factors such as KIF1B-&#x003b2; and KIF2A leads to increased autophagosomal fusion, whereas dispersion of lysosomes to the periphery by overexpressing these motors, decreases fusion rates (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). It is possible that by significantly enhancing the number of inputs to the lysosome through simultaneous endocytic and autophagic activity that the rate of autolysosomal fusion is slowed. In addition to this process is the balance between bulk conversion by compartment fusion with the lysosome versus conversion of an autophagosome to an endosome-like compartment mediated by vesicle trafficking and fusion. The former would be an efficient and rapid single-fusion event, whereas the latter would be presumably a slower process, but would allow a stepwise remodeling of the maturing autophagosome. In both cases, the unresolved issue is how recognition between fusion partners is established and how the rate of these fusions impacts trafficking and localization of internalized cargo. Further these intermediate-vesicles may perhaps be more inherently leaky should they persist due to a deficiency of dense and mature lysosomes with which to fuse. In fact, it has been shown that autophagosomes dock onto lysosomes, independent of lysosomal acidification and that two kinds of fusion events can potentially occur: complete fusions which generate a hybrid organelle such as an amphisome, or more often kiss-and-run interactions where there is partial transfer of some content while still maintaining two separate vesicles (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). The rates of these events are thought to depend largely on vesicle numbers and flux and thus, may potentially contribute to oligonucleotide trafficking and escape. Though several molecular components have been identified to support these processes, there are still many unanswered questions that await an understanding of the full molecular mechanism and dynamics of how autophagosome biogenesis occurs and how the autophagy pathway interacts with other trafficking networks.</p><p>The pharmacological effects of ASOs are highly varied such that even upon comparable levels of uptake, activities of ASOs can be rather different between cell types (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). On a broader scale, given the reported wide range of basal autophagy and flux across cell lines, tissues, and systems (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60&#x02013;62</xref>), it is possible that the differing rates of forming autophagosomes and subsequent interactions with the endo-lysosomal network may contribute to the differences in ASO activity observed. Future studies will be needed to tease apart the contributions and crosstalk between vesicle trafficking and autophagy, and ASO uptake and activity across cell types where these differences are observed. Our findings that metabolic cellular changes induced by serum starvation in cells or fasting and ketosis in mice can contribute to progressive enhancement of ASO activity may provide a rationale for evaluating the interplay between basal autophagy state, autophagy flux changes in response to cell perturbation, and respective ASO therapeutic activities. Given the reported engagement of mTOR inhibition and autophagy activation following ketogenic diet administration in the CNS tissues such as hippocampus (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), one would predict similar findings of enhanced ASO activity to that demonstrated in the liver and muscle, in brain tissue following ICV-administered compounds. Additional studies will be needed to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p>In the present study, we have shown that altered autophagy levels both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> can influence ASO knockdown efficiency and localization. Our studies suggest a novel mechanism to enhance ASO-mediated knockdown efficiency potentially through co-delivery or treatment with activators of autophagy. Unlike the development of novel lytic peptide vectors or potentially toxic carrier systems, appropriate fasting paradigms, specific high-fat ketogenic diets, or other autophagy-enhancing diets would be a more convenient, safe, and flexible approach to enhancing oligonucleotide therapeutic activity. More broadly, these findings ultimately underscore the importance of understanding ASO trafficking in models and diseases where autophagy and lysosomal storage networks are altered and suggest that when developing oligonucleotide therapeutics, the status of autophagy in the disease state should also be taken into consideration when characterizing oligonucleotide molecules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>gkz901_Supplemental_Files</label><media xlink:href="gkz901_supplemental_files.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ACK1"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We wish to thank Dr Frank Bennett, Dr Brett Monia, and Dr Shiyu Wang for stimulating discussions; Gemma Ebeling for experimental and technical assistance; Tracy Reigle and Wanda Sullivan for graphics support.</p></ack><sec id="SEC5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>
