Adaptive system behaviour emerges via these interactions, which integrate the activity of the sub-units. To understand the system level it is necessary to understand the underlying local interactions. Successful models of local interactions at different levels of biological organisation, including epithelial tissue and ant colonies, have demonstrated the benefits of such &#x02018;agent-based&#x02019; modelling <xref rid="pone.0002367-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002367-Walker2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Here we present an agent-based approach to modelling a crucial biological system &#x02013; the intracellular NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathway. The pathway is vital to immune response regulation, and is fundamental to basic survival in a range of species <xref rid="pone.0002367-Carlotti1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002367-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Alterations in pathway regulation underlie a variety of diseases, including atherosclerosis and arthritis. Our modelling of individual molecules, receptors and genes provides a more comprehensive outline of regulatory network mechanisms than previously possible with equation-based approaches <xref rid="pone.0002367-Pogson1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The method also permits consideration of structural parameters in pathway regulation; here we predict that inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B is directly affected by actin filaments of the cytoskeleton sequestering excess inhibitors, therefore regulating steady-state and feedback behaviour.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is a transcription factor which is central to the regulation of genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and its associated pathway of interactions is controlled by inhibitors of NF-&#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B) proteins, which sequester the majority of NF-&#x003ba;B in the cytoplasm as complexes by masking their nuclear localisation signals <xref rid="pone.0002367-Beg1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. During activation, I&#x003ba;B is phosphorylated by I&#x003ba;B kinases (IKK), causing its destruction <xref rid="pone.0002367-Taussig1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002367-Ghosh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The newly freed NF-&#x003ba;B is consequently transported into the nucleus, inducing inflammatory genes, including those encoding I&#x003ba;B, thus regulating the pathway through negative feedback <xref rid="pone.0002367-Baeuerle1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002367-Kopp1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Pathway activation is tightly controlled at multiple levels. Detailed information of the parameters regulating specific steps and their impact on activation is of fundamental importance for understanding the pathway as a whole. Recently, modelling of regulation at the level of the inhibitor has been performed using differential equations, helping to improve understanding of pathway operation and regulation <xref rid="pone.0002367-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002367-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We aim to take a different approach to modelling the pathway in order to gain a different perspective on its operation, with a greater focus on spatial detail and a more direct comparison with experiment.</p><p>Our agent-based model can provide a more complete appreciation of the regulatory mechanisms within the signalling network as a whole, demonstrating predictive behaviour at all steps from initiation at the level of the cell-surface receptor (TIR) to resultant gene regulation. The model extends the capabilities of reaction kinetics and stochastic simulation models by including explicit spatial and structural parameters such as localisation, transport, and complex formation of signalling intermediates, thus relating directly to real time single cell analysis.</p><p>Any number (within computational limitations) and distribution of molecules can be modelled, time delays in key processes are properly accounted for, and individual interactions of agents are characterised by stable and well-defined parameters. The model reflects the discrete stochastic nature of interactions, and provides a realistic description of subcellular events.</p><p>Computational modelling is a rapidly developing methodology for investigating the organisation of complex biological systems. Such modelling allows in virtuo experiments to complement the in vitro and in vivo methods that are already well-established in biology. The flexible, intuitive and extensible nature of agent-based modelling makes it well-suited to modelling biological systems. It requires the identification of an appropriate level to model (in our case the cell) and the entities to be modelled (here individual molecules); the complete system is derived from considering interactions of the individual components with the environment and neighbouring components, and the behaviour of the complete system is an emergent property. The behaviour of an individual component is determined by the dynamics of its internal characteristics (state), its physical location, and its relationships with those components around it (communication). Modern computing power and experience of modelling complex systems composed of many interacting autonomous parts have provided the foundation for this approach to understanding complex biological systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>In the model, molecular agents diffuse through the cell, binding and dissociating from other molecules, receptors and cell structures in accord with signals they send and receive from surrounding agents. Every agent is represented by a complete computational model &#x02013; the communicating stream X-machine &#x02013; which provides an intuitive and rigorous basis to model the functional behaviour of systems in a flexible and extensible manner <xref rid="pone.0002367-Holcombe1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002367-Balanescu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. An important feature is the memory of each agent's X-machine, which contains its physical location, meaning that the number of states required to model the system is manageably small.</p><p>It is essential that the agents are both biologically plausible as entities and that their behaviour is based on experimental measurements. In the model, as in reality, molecular interactions are local events that depend only on the position and current state of the molecules involved, where the state of a molecule is whether or not it is already bound. The physics of a molecule is modelled according to specific agent-based characteristics, including which types of interaction are possible. If two molecules may interact according to the rules, they must satisfy criteria on their state and proximity, derived from standard rate constants <xref rid="pone.0002367-Andrews1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. If interaction occurs, the state of each agent changes to a &#x02018;bound&#x02019; state, which can be reversed through random thermal separation. The model agrees with reaction kinetics in homogenous situations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002367-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0002367-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002367.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Agent interactions.</title><p>Agreement of agent-based model of chemical interactions with a model based on reaction kinetics ODEs.

Each NF-&#x003ba;B, I&#x003ba;B and I&#x003ba;B-kinase (IKK) molecule is an individual agent, as are the importing and exporting nuclear and cell surface receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002367-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). Soluble extracellular agonists are not modelled as agents but treated as a whole chemical entity whose fluctuating local concentrations at the cell surface must rise above a certain level to initiate signal transduction in nearby receptor agents. Similarly, in relation to the cytoplasmic TIR domain, the local concentrations of certain molecules in the cytoplasm must be above a defined level in the vicinity of an active receptor to complete the process. Following this, a temporary agent with an internal time delay is created to account for the cascade that triggers the I&#x003ba;B kinases (IKKs). At the final steps of activation, an analogous temporary agent method is used to account for the translation of I&#x003ba;B.</p><fig id="pone-0002367-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002367.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Formulation and validation of the agent-based model.</title><p>(a) Simplified diagram of the principal pathway agents in the model.

The following filter sets (Omega Optical) were used: XF114 for ECFP (440DF21 excitation, 455DRLP dichroic, 480DF30 emission), XF104 for EYFP (500DF25 excitation, 525DRLP dichroic, 545DF35 emission) and XF88 for FRET (440DF21 excitation, 455DRLP dichroic, 545DF35 emission). Relative fluorescence was calculated by determining the intensity per pixel for the various emission settings, by measuring the mean intensity of representative areas of nucleus or cytoplasm and normalised by dividing by the attenuation, as above. All images were background corrected and the FRET images were further processed by subtracting overspill of ECFP (50.7&#x00025;) and EYFP (30.4&#x00025;), and fluorescence calculated as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4b4"><title>Cross linking and Immunoprecipitation</title><p>Cells grown in a 10 cm dish (10<sup>6</sup>) were transfected with I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;-EGFP using the calcium phosphate method, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0002367-Carlotti1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were cross-linked with 5 mM DSS (Pierce) in PBS pH 8.0 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The solution was quenched with 1 M TrisHCl pH 7.5 to a final concentration of 10 mM and left for 15 minutes. Cross-linked cell lysate was prepared using a RIPA buffer kit (Santa Cruz) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Supernatant lysate (S1) was pre-cleared with Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose Immunoprecipitation Reagent (Santa Cruz) and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes with appropriate IgG (Santa Cruz). One ml of the lysate was incubated at 4&#x000b0;C overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-Actin antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-1616) and A/G agarose beads and cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm). The pellet (P1) was reserved for Western analysis and the supernatant lysate (S1) was used in a second immunoprecipitation, and incubated with an anti-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz sc-1643; 4&#x000b0;C,30 min). Extracts recovered from the pellet after a second centrifugation (13,000 rpm) (P2) were analysed by Western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4b5"><title>SDS-PAGE and western analysis</title><p>Immunoprecipitates were boiled in 1&#x000d7; Laemelli sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE (10&#x00025;) and transferred onto PVDF membrane (Hybond-P, Amerham). Following blocking (5&#x00025; milk powder in TBS/Tween ,1 hr, rt) membranes were incubated for with a rabbit polyclonal anti-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; antibody (Santa Cruz sc-371, 1 &#x000b5;g/ml, 2 hrs, rt). Following washes (TBS/Tween and TBS), membranes were incubated with HRP conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1&#x02236;2000, Santa Cruz, 1 hour) and subsequently with Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz,1 min) before visualisation by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Controls included incubation with second antibody alone, and the level of IgG was used as loading control.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Confocal and FRET analyses were carried out by Lin Yang and Ian Palmer and the biochemical analysis by David Anderson.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>The work was supported by an EPSRC research studentship and by BBSRC Grant BB/C515798/1.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0002367-Jackson1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
