Autologous mitochondrial supplementation has been proposed as an assisted reproductive technology to overcome these problems. However, its safety remains to be tested in an animal model to determine if there are transgenerational effects. We have supplemented oocytes with autologous populations of mitochondria to generate founders. We mated the female founders and their offspring to produce three generations. We assessed litter size, the ovarian reserve, and weight gain and conducted a full histopathological analysis from each of the three generations. Across the generations, we observed significant increases in litter size and in the number of primordial follicles in the ovary matched by changes in global gene expression patterns for these early-stage oocytes. However, full histopathological analysis revealed that cardiac structure was compromised in first and second generation offspring, which could seriously affect the health of the offspring. Furthermore, the offspring were prone to increased weight gain during early life. Mitochondrial supplementation appears to perturb the regulation of the chromosomal genome resulting in transgenerational phenotypic gains and losses. These data highlight the need for caution when using autologous mitochondrial supplementation to treat female factor infertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Embryology</kwd><kwd>Development</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">An increasing number of couples are seeking assisted reproductive treatment as they fail to achieve a pregnancy of which approximately 61% of the female partners are over the age of 35<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Many suffer from either failed fertilisation or their embryos arrest during preimplantation development, which can persist through several rounds of treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Although a number of causes have been cited including aneuploidy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, it has become increasingly evident that this failure also arises from the oocytes of these patients having too few copies of the maternally-only inherited mitochondrial genome (mtDNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">mtDNA is located in each of the cell&#x02019;s mitochondria and encodes 13 subunits of the electron transfer chain, 22 tRNAs and 2 rRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. It has one major non-coding region, the D-Loop that interacts with nuclear-encoded factors to transcribe and replicate mtDNA. MtDNA replication is strictly regulated during development. During oogenesis, the primordial germ cells differentiate into mature, metaphase II oocytes. Each primordial germ cell possesses ~200 copies of mtDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, which are clonally expanded at later stages to provide mature metaphase II oocytes with &#x0003e;150,000 copies of mtDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> to surpass the threshold required for successful fertilisation outcome.

Indeed, human oocytes with fewer than 100,000 copies of mtDNA have significantly lower rates of fertilisation than oocytes with greater than 150,000 copies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Autologous mitochondrial transfer has been proposed as an assisted reproductive technology to ensure sufficient copies of mtDNA are present to support post-fertilisation developmental events in embryos until post-gastrulation when mtDNA replication is initiated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Autologous transfer would not compromise the genetic identity of the offspring as is the case when third party or &#x02018;donor&#x02019; mitochondria are used in an approach commonly referred to as &#x02018;3-parent IVF&#x02019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Likewise, in a bovine model of somatic cell nuclear transfer, it has been shown that oocytes with sufficient mtDNA also benefited from mtDNA supplementation (~560 copies) with there being increased levels of expression of genes involved in glycolysis and decreased levels of expression of genes involved in embryonic death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which promote cell proliferation and embryonic development. In addition, the blastocyst-stage embryos possessed significantly higher numbers of mtDNA copy when compared with non-supplemented counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">As oocytes for assisted reproduction are normally collected following hormonal stimulation or less frequently through <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation and the mtDNA content of an oocyte cannot be directly assessed prior to treatment, we have supplemented superovulated mouse oocytes at the time of fertilisation with autologous populations of mitochondria to generate founders. This enabled us to determine if the transfer of additional mtDNA is safe practice and if subsequent generations are compromised, irrespective of whether the oocyte has sufficient mtDNA or not. We mated the female founders and their female offspring to produce three generations of offspring and analysed litter size, the ovarian reserve, and weight gain during neonatal development, and conducted a full histopathological analysis of the three generations of offspring. We found that autologous supplementation enhanced fertility but led to structural defects in cardiac tissue suggesting that the regulation of chromosomal gene expression that is established during oogenesis is perturbed by this process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">To generate founders, superovulated oocytes from F1: C57BL6/J/MARP &#x000d7; CBA/MARP females were supplemented with an isolate of mitochondria from the same strain&#x000a0;at the same time as a spermatozoon obtained from the same strain of proven stud colony males was introduced into the oocyte by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

From three transfers, seven founder females and one male were generated. Once the founder females had reached sexual maturity, they were mated with proven stud colony males to determine their fertility using litter size as a readout, which is an important indicator of fertility in multiparous species such as mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The first litter from each of the seven founders produced litter sizes of 6.57&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.48 (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SEM; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). We again mated the founders with colony males to produce a further four parities from three of the founders. There were no significant differences between each of the parities (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Collectively, the parities from the first generation produced a mean litter size of 7.48&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.55 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), which was significantly larger than colony controls conceived through natural matings (6.07&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.26; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Female offspring from the first generation were mated with colony males to produce a second generation of offspring comprising three parities. There were no significant differences in litter size amongst the parities (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). However, litter size for the second generation was also significantly larger than colony controls (7.95&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.44; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) but not to the first generation. Finally, we mated the females from the second generation to produce a third generation comprising one parity. The mean litter size for the third generation (8.25&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.73; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) was also significantly higher than the colony controls (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) but not higher than the first and second generations (p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). We conclude that the introduction of additional mtDNA into superovulated oocytes results in a transgenerational enhancement of fertility, as demonstrated through increased litter size.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The effects of mitochondrial supplementation on litter size and the ovarian reserve.

Using the Panther Ontology Classification System, cellular, metabolic and developmental processes were the most modified biological processes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), whilst binding, catalytic activity and receptor activity were the molecular functions most modified (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that mitochondrial supplementation at the time of fertilisation can act on the germline to modify chromosomal gene expression profiles that can influence primordial follicle numbers, which, in turn, results in a transgenerational increase in litter size and to phenotypically promote fertility.</p><p id="Par11">To determine if the unexpected enhancement of one phenotypic trait would impact on other phenotypic traits, we conducted physiological and anatomical assessments of females from each of the three generations. Firstly, we weighed offspring after the first week of birth over eight consecutive weeks. For the first generation of offspring derived from mitochondrial supplementation (inclusive of parities 1 to 5), we observed significant incremental increases in weight from weeks 1 to 2 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), 2 to 3 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), 3 to 4 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), and 5 to 6 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Similar incremental increases were observed in mice derived through ICSI, although weeks 5 to 6 were not significant (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). A comparison between mitochondrial supplemented- and ICSI-derived mice showed that the mice derived from mitochondrial-supplemented founders were significantly heavier in weeks 1 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), 2 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and 3 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). However, there were no differences from week 4 onwards, although the trend was for the mitochondrial-supplemented mice to be heavier. For each of the five parities from the first generation of mitochondrial-supplemented mice, we observed significant differences in weeks 1 (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), 2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) and 4 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>) with the third parity being predominately heavier. The most significantly affected time period during development was week 1 (<italic>cf</italic> Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b,c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>). Interestingly, the trends set in the first generation were maintained across the second and third generations as there were no significant differences in weight following each weekly recording (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3d</xref>), although there were incremental increases from week to week when the values from each generation were combined (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). When the combined values for the three generations were compared with ICSI-derived offspring, there were once more significant differences at weeks 1, 2 and 3 with mitochondrial supplemented mice being heavier (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Differences in patterns of neonatal weight gain were not observed between the mitochondrial-supplemented founders and their three generations of offspring. We found a significant difference in weight for founders between weeks 1 and 2 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>) but did not observe differences between ICSI and mitochondrial-supplemented founders (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>) and between mitochondrial-supplemented founders and the first generation of their offspring (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref>) and all three generations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).

Some minor anomalies were identified such as a thymic cyst in one animal; mild hyperplasia and inflammation in the stomach of another; and evidence of inflammation in the kidney of a third animal. Animals from all three generations also exhibited some mild extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen, which is a common finding in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, a major abnormality was observed in all three of the first generation mice and one from the second generation. They typically displayed lesions of, and thickening to, the connective tissue of the atria-ventricular valves (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These changes in valvular pathology suggest that with age, complications may arise. To confirm this finding, a further four hearts from the cohort of first generation mice derived from mitochondrial supplementation were micro-pathologically assessed. Whilst the cardiac muscle, including muscle fibres, chambers and vessels of these mice showed typical micromorphology, as seen in the three first generation and one second generation mice examined previously, all four hearts displayed varying degrees of severity of mucoid degeneration of the valves (Supplementary File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>; <italic>cf</italic> Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a&#x02013;f</xref>). Although this defect has been reported in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, it was limited to the offspring derived from the mitochondrial supplemented founders in our study. This defect could lead to severe heart abnormalities later in life that, frequently, in humans require surgery to correct. In all, these histopathological assessments indicate several minor defects and the generational transmission of a potentially severe heart defect as a result of mitochondrial supplementation, although the heart defect did not appear to be present in the third generation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Heart valve defects.

Primordial follicles comprise the early stage oocytes that have the potential to mature into fertilisable oocytes and, thus carry the mtDNA that is transmitted through the maternal lineage to subsequent generations. After mapping the reads against a reference genome, and then deriving a consensus sequence for each sample, which is indicative of the most frequently called base at each site, we observed differences in mtDNA sequence for each set of primordial follicles and EPC mitochondrial isolates. These were at nt9348 (G&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;A), nt9461 (T&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;C), nt9829 (InsA) and nt9830 (InsA) (Supplementary File&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). However, analysis of all reads showed these were sites exhibiting varying degrees of heteroplasmy. Of these variants, nt9348 (G&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;A) was predicted to be damaging following analysis using Panther&#x02019;s Evolutionary Analysis of Coding SNPs (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Moreover, we identified seven other sites with lower levels of heteroplasmy, which had frequencies for the minor base called at 3.1 to 23.6% (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Of these variants, 12581(C&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;A) was predicted to be damaging although its level of heteroplasmy was only 9.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.75 (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This outcome indicates that the mtDNA populations were from the same maternal lineage. However, it is evident from the loss and gain of mtDNA variants between the EPC and the primordial follicles, both fixed and at low levels, that there is preferential selection for and against certain variants, which could account for the heart defect or minor anomalies identified through pathology. This is certainly the case for the Insertion/deletion at nt9821 (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and the single nucleotide variant at nt12581 (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par14">The number of mtDNA copies present in the oocyte at fertilisation is regarded as an essential genetic investment in embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This is exemplified by events during pig preimplantation development where there are very significant reductions in mtDNA copy number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, with each newly divided embryonic cell having fewer copies of mtDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Studies in human embryos highlight this process whereby there appears to be an active process of shedding mtDNA, which promotes development to the blastocyst stage, the final stage of preimplantation development, and implantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The inner cell mass cells, which form the embryo proper and the foetus, continue to reduce mtDNA copy number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> as they remain in an uncommitted state through to gastrulation, which is when differentiation first starts, and establish the &#x02018;mtDNA set point&#x02019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The mtDNA set point comprises a small founder population of mtDNA that segregates to all cells of the body. This population of mtDNA is maintained at low levels as undifferentiated cells progress to organogenesis, when tissues and organs first form, and is then replicated in a cell specific manner. As a result, each mature cell type acquires a distinct number of mtDNA copies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, which enables them to support their specialised functions with appropriate levels of ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">mtDNA supplementation at the time of fertilisation can increase the amount of mtDNA available to support development to a post-gastrulation stage when mtDNA replication is first initiated in the newly formed embryo. This enhancement would, for example, provide mtDNA-deficient oocytes with sufficient mtDNA to establish the &#x02018;mtDNA set point&#x02019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> that, in turn, ensures sufficient template is available to initiate mtDNA replication, which takes place in the mouse at E6.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Indeed, initiation of mtDNA replication at this stage of development appears to be critical to development as mice homozygous for the mtDNA-specific replication factor (Polg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) die <italic>in utero</italic> due to insufficient template being available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In a pig model of oocyte mtDNA deficiency, it is evident that supplementation with similar amounts of autologous populations of oocyte mtDNA can enhance embryo development rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This is mediated by the additional mtDNA inducing an mtDNA replication event between fertilisation and the 2-cell stage that increases mtDNA copy number by 4.4-fold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> accompanied by changes to the DNA methylation status of POLG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, the mtDNA-specific replication factor. Indeed, it has been shown that POLG is DNA methylated in a cell-specific manner in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and mouse cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, mtDNA supplementation improves chromosomal gene expression patterns of the resultant blastocyst stage embryos whereby gene networks and pathways associated with metabolic disease and the mitochondrial regulation of epigenetic control are more or less fully restored when compared with blastocysts derived from oocytes with sufficient mtDNA copy number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This suggests that mitochondrial supplementation influences chromosomal gene expression profiles during early development to promote improved embryo quality.</p><p id="Par16">However, our data show in a mouse model that has normal reproductive function and is not hindered by poor gamete quality that the supplementation of superovulated oocytes with EPC mitochondria can alter an offspring&#x02019;s phenotype and this persists over several generations. Firstly, we see increased fecundity through increased litter size, which is also reflected in primordial follicles having increased germ cell numbers and differences in gene expression profiles. However, this appears to be at the expense of increased weight gain during neonatal and juvenile development, and structural defects of the heart, which appear in at least one or more subsequent generations. Consequently, the simple addition of extra copies of mtDNA to a mature oocyte appears to influence the chromosomal genome perhaps by altering its epigenetic regulation through metabolites secreted from the mitochondria that, for example, can modulate DNA methylation. To this extent, &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate can mediate the transition of a DNA methylated to a DNA demethylated state by acting as a co-factor with the TET family of proteins that are largely involved in this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Indeed, in our porcine model, BCAT2, a regulator of amino acid metabolism and &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, was modulated as a result of mitochondrial supplementation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. As such, there appears to be a relationship between the differentiated state of the chromosomal genome and mtDNA copy number, which is likely established during oogenesis. During oogenesis, mtDNA copy number increases in a synchronous manner with the differentiation of early germ cells into mature metaphase II oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Indeed, a similar process takes place as embryonic stem cells differentiate from their na&#x000ef;ve state into mature, functional adult cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Likewise, mtDNA depletion experiments have shown that the reduction in mtDNA copy number&#x000a0;can diminish the differential potential of tumour-initiating cells to more of a semi-pluripotent state and they thus resume a more na&#x000ef;ve status with reduced or delayed tumorigenic capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Indeed, these tumours require the restoration of mtDNA copy number in order for tumorigenesis to proceed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">Phenotypic trade-off is not unusual in breeding programs. For example, in livestock breeding, the attraction of increasing frame size and muscle mass is tempered by frequently observed declines in fertility of these enhanced animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In other species, such as birds, it is evident that there is a &#x02018;trade-off&#x02019; between enhanced fertility at the expense of metabolic efficiencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Furthermore, differences between mtDNA haplotypes, which determine the common maternal origins of an individual, have been used to explain why pigs with better muscle depth and fatness to leanness ratios often have reduced fertility as indicated by poorer oocyte quality and smaller litter sizes, and vice versa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In cattle, oocyte quality through decreased mtDNA copy number can also be accounted for by certain mtDNA haplotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Similarly, cattle mtDNA can affect the phenotype of bison whereby bison carrying cattle mtDNA are smaller irrespective of whether the environment is nutritionally poor or rich<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">However, our studies show that simply introducing ~530 copies of mtDNA, less than 1% of an oocyte&#x02019;s total mtDNA content, can induce a phenotypic trade-off, which appears to be at the expense of the structure of a key organ, namely the heart. If affected, this is likely to lead to serious health complications later in life, and, as it is a transmissible defect, it would affect subsequent generations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The heart is most likely affected as it is a high ATP requiring organ that is highly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for the production of energy through the electron transfer chain and, thus, possesses high mtDNA copy number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Consequently, the potential dysregulation of mtDNA segregation or mtDNA replication during development following mitochondrial supplementation could manifest in a high-ATP requiring tissue, as is the case with many of the mtDNA disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. As a result, the strict regulation of mtDNA copy number during oogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> is perturbed by mitochondrial supplementation and questions whether autologous supplementation could lead to health problems when used to improve fertility outcomes in humans and livestock species.</p><p id="Par19">Whilst there has been much concern about the health and well-being of humans and mice generated from third party mitochondrial supplementation (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>), it appears that there is also cause for concern regarding autologous mitochondrial supplementation. In this instance, there appears to be preferential selection for four variants, which were identified in the female germline, as evidenced by their presence in the primordial follicles. One of these variants was deemed to be deleterious and, thus, harmful. However, another variant was also deemed to deleterious but it was present at a level sufficiently low enough that is unlikely to affect a phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Therefore, a degree of caution is required by regulators before granting licences or permission to exploit this technology clinically. This outcome is similar to third party human mitochondrial supplementation, which has been banned by regulators in a number of countries. Our data also provide a potential reason as to why many cloned offspring, which received a similar amount of mtDNA present in the donor cell as the nucleus is transferred into a recipient oocyte, exhibited poor pathologies and often died shortly after birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our data offer a cautionary note to proponents of nuclear transfer to treat mitochondrial disease and argue that the transfer of a small amount mitochondria with the metaphase II spindle or pronuclei, as proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, may have a profound effect on the offspring.</p><p id="Par20">In all, we show that autologous mitochondrial supplementation can enhance reproductive function in a small cohort of founder mice by increasing litter size and the ovarian reserve in subsequent generations. However, this is at the expense of weight gain and the structure of heart tissue. Consequently, it appears that mitochondrial supplementation can induce a phenotypic trade off by modulating chromosomal gene expression profiles and changes in morphology likely by altering epigenetic patterns but also through the preferential selection of mtDNA, both of which are established during early oogenesis. However, it remains to be determined whether this effect is species-dependent and would always be specific to heart tissue or if other high-ATP requiring tissues and organs would also be affected in a random or non-random manner. Consequently, testing in a larger animal model with physiological and anatomical characteristics more similar to the human is also required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethics approval and consent</title><p id="Par21">All animal procedures and experimental protocols were approved by Monash University Animal Ethics Licensing Committee A under licence numbers MMCA 2014/43 and 2017/080 BC.

Briefly, mitochondrial-supplemented (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) and control (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) RNA samples were converted to cDNA and amplified using the single-primer-isothermal-amplification (SPIA) technology (NuGEN Technologies). cDNA samples were then enzymatically fragmented to produce libraries ~320&#x02009;bp in size, verified by the 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies). rRNA was subsequently removed from the final libraries. An equimolar pool of each library was prepared for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 instrument (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) using 75&#x02009;bp single-read chemistry.

Whole mitochondrial genome products for sequencing were generated by amplifying two overlapping fragments (A and B) of the whole mouse mitochondrial genome using long PCR. Each reaction comprised 50&#x02009;ng total DNA, 1x High Fidelity PCR buffer, 100&#x02009;mM MgSO4, 1&#x02009;mM dNTPs (Bioline, London, UK), 1U of Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M each forward and reverse primer (Amplification A: Forward-CCGTGCTACCTAAACACCTTATC and Reverse-CGTCCGTACCATCATCCAATTA; Amplification B: Forward-CCCTTCATCCTTCTCTCCCTAT and Reverse GTGGGATCCCTTGAGTTACTTC).

Briefly, DNA concentrations for the purified amplicons were determined using the Qubit&#x000ae; dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA). The purified amplicon pairs (A and B) from each sample were combined at equal concentrations in order to generate libraries. Firstly, the fragments were sonicated using the S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Ovation Ultralow system V2 (protocol M01380v1; NuGEN) to add adaptors.

In short, the two FASTQ files for each sample were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench v10.0.1 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Base pairs associated with the adaptors were removed using the &#x02018;trimming&#x02019; tool. The reads were mapped to the mouse mitochondrial reference genome (NCBI accession: AJ489607). Reads were mapped without masking, with the built-in criteria of an insertion and deletion cost of 3 and at least 80% identity, after which duplicate reads were removed. From the mapped reads, a reference genome was generated for each sample (consensus sequence) based on the majority of reads at each base. The reads were again mapped against the consensus sequence and the low frequency variant detection tool was used to identify variants, insertions and microdeletions. A 3% minimum threshold was employed for variant calling with the variant being present on both forward and reverse reads. A minimum coverage of 2800 was also required. The &#x02018;alignment&#x02019; tool was used to compare the consensus sequences amongst the EPC and primordial follicle samples. mtDNA sequencing data can be found at NCBI Sequence Read Archive under project accession number PRJNA474546.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Assessment of mtDNA variants and Indels</title><p id="Par41">Further analysis of the mtDNA variants and Indels, including annotation, Position-specific evolutionary preservation (PSEP), and their potential effects on function, was performed using Panther&#x02019;s Evolutionary Analysis of Coding SNPs and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mamit-tRNA.u-strasbg.fr">http://mamit-tRNA.u-strasbg.fr</ext-link>, as described in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Histopathological Assessment of Mice</title><p id="Par42">Histopathological assessments of three 12-week-old female mice from each of the three mitochondrial supplemented generations and three age and sex matched control mice were carried out by the Australian Phenomics Network Histopathology Service (APNHS, Melbourne, VIC, Australia).
