The Fungal one-step IsolatioN Device (FIND) technology allows the isolation of rare fungi from terrestrial and marine samples. The FIND comprises a multi-chambered micro agar plate, where initially only one fungal part (e.g., hyphal cell, mycelial fragment or spore) is located in each chamber. After inoculation the device is placed back into the original natural environment of sample collection, to ensure favourable growth conditions. Experiments were carried out with terrestrial soil and marine sediment, as well as sea water samples to validate this method. This yielded axenic cultures of 12 different filamentous fungi, one of them being the marine-adapted fungal strain <italic>Heydenia</italic> cf. <italic>alpina</italic>. The latter produced two new terpenoids, which are the first secondary metabolites from this genus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>FIND</kwd><kwd>fungal one-step isolation device</kwd><kwd><italic>Heydenia</italic> cf. <italic>alpina</italic></kwd><kwd>natural products</kwd><kwd>terpenes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p>This article is part of the thematic issue "Terpenes".</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural products play a prominent role as lead structures in drug discovery [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Apart from bacteria, fungi are an impressive group of microorganisms in this respect, due to the high structural diversity of their rich secondary metabolism. Fungi are known as producers of many therapeutically important drugs, such as antibiotics (e.g., cephalosporins), immunosuppressants (e.g., mycophenolic acid) and immunomodulators (e.g., fingolimod), as well as cholesterol lowering agents (statins). Generally, fungal metabolites were shown to have antiviral, cytotoxic, antineoplastic, cardiovascular, anti-inflammatory, immune-stimulating, and anticancer activities [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared antibiotic resistance a global threat and urged the search for new antibiotics, the interest in fungal metabolites increased recently.</p><p>In order to find new structural types, novel source organisms have to be targeted. It is however, most difficult to isolate unusual, to date not yet researched microbes in axenic form and to cultivate them. Overall it was estimated that only 1% of all microbes present in our environments are cultivated today (&#x0201c;great plate count anomaly&#x0201d;) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recently the new bacterial species <italic>Eleftheria terrae</italic>, alongside other new microbial species, was isolated from an environmental sample with a device known as iChip. This technology is based on the incubation of a single bacterial cell in its natural environment. After this incubation, strains can be transferred as axenic cultures to the laboratory [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic>E. terrae</italic> produced a novel antibiotic called teixobactin with no detectable resistance, as it interacts with key functions of cell wall synthesis that do not undergo fast evolutionary changes [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Inspired by this approach we developed the Fungal one-step IsolatioN Device (FIND), in order to obtain axenic cultures of rare and less examined filamentous fungi, as several tries before with the iChip were not successful. Apart from terrestrial soil probes we focused on the marine habitat, probing sediment and sea water samples for the presence of fungi. With 150 000 species named and classified, it was suggested that 95% of fungi to date remain unknown [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The so-called dark matter fungi (DMF) are a promising source for novel compounds [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and their isolation and culture is one of the keys to find new pharmacological agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of axenic fungal strains using FIND</title><p>For the isolation of fungal strains from terrestrial and marine environments a device was constructed, i.e., FIND that is similar to the one described by Epstein et al. for &#x0201c;unculturable&#x0201d; bacteria [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For the FIND we adjusted the isolation procedure and technical features, e.g., the dimensions of the through holes utilized as growing chambers, to fungi. The FIND protocol now suits fungal physiology and the prevalence of fungi in different habitats.</p><p>In general, the FIND technology is a multichambered micro agar plate. After inoculation, the device is placed back into the original natural environment of sample collection, to ensure favourable growth conditions for specific fungi. Inoculation is performed in only one step and thus suitable for high throughput approaches. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Scheme 1</xref> illustrates the FIND, consisting of merely three plastic parts crafted from polyoxymethylene, which are solid and durable enough for use in most natural environments. The central plate is a thin plastic board with 96 through holes that function as compartments, capable of holding inoculated agar plugs. Semipermeable membranes are attached to both sides of this plate, this way covering the through holes and preventing contamination by other microbes. These membranes, at the same time, permit diffusion of nutrients and growth factors from the environment through the feeding pores of the upper and lower plates. This way slow growing fungi or to date uncultured fungi can be isolated.</p><fig id="C1" position="float"><label>Scheme 1</label><caption><p>Design and functional parts of the FIND technology.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Beilstein_J_Org_Chem-15-2191-g004"/></fig><p>To test the FIND technology, we used samples from terrestrial and marine environments, i.e., soil from Wuppertal, Germany (experiment 1), marine sediments from the Aegean Sea, Greece (experiment 2), brackish soil samples from the Schlei region around Kappeln, Germany (experiment 3), and sea water samples from Katwijk aan Zee, Netherlands (experiment 4).</p><p>Adjustment of the sample concentration (i.e., number of fungal parts per volume), which is crucial for the success of a FIND experiment, has to take the abundance of fungal parts, i.e., hyphae, mycelial fragments or spores in the collected environmental samples into account. Ideally, for incubation one fungal part per through hole should be present. Thus, for the here presented FIND with 96 through holes each with a volume of 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> mL, a concentration of 320 000 fungal parts/L must be reached in the agar solution, with which the central plate is loaded. The number of fungi in a given volume of a sample is experimentally hard to determine. We thus counted bacterial cells, and applied the ratio of bacteria-to-fungi, which is described in the literature for most environments, to estimate suitable dilution or concentration steps in our experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C2">Scheme 2</xref> illustrates each individual step of a FIND experiment.</p><fig id="C2" position="float"><label>Scheme 2</label><caption><p>Isolation of fungal strains with the FIND technology. 1.

After centrifugation cell counting was performed on the supernatant using a Neubauer Improved or Thoma chamber [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] to determine the abundance of bacterial cells. For our soil sample 2 &#x000b1; 0.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>13</sup> bacteria/L were determined. For experiment 2 (marine sediment) and 3 (brackish water sediment), samples were treated alike, but instead of a NaCl solution, sea water from the respective sampling site was used. For experiment 4 (sea water), sea water was analysed directly. The extant abundances of bacterial cells/L in experiments 2, 3 and 4 were found to be 7 &#x000b1; 0.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>, 13 &#x000b1; 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> and 8 &#x000b1; 0.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> bacterial cells/L, respectively.</p><p>The samples were then diluted, concentrated or used undiluted according to the bacteria-to-fungi ratio, in order to ultimately reach an approximate target concentration of 320 000 fungal parts/L. Literature documented a bacteria-to-fungi ratio as 10&#x000b3; to 1 for terrestrial soil [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, the sample from Wuppertal (experiment 1) was diluted sequentially to a concentration of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10</sup> bacterial cells/L, which should be equivalent to 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> fungal parts/L, and 16 mL of this solution were necessary to be added to one litre of agar solution to obtain the required target concentration.</p><p>For marine sediment samples (experiments 2 and 3), in general, the bacteria-to-fungi ratio was hardly known. Thus, we applied the ratio described for terrestrial soil samples, i.e., 10&#x000b3; to 1. With abundances of 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> and 13 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> bacterial cells/L concentrations of 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> and 13 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> fungal parts/L, respectively, were assumed. The samples were thus used undiluted and 42 and 24 mL, respectively, were added to one litre of agar solution to obtain the required target concentration. Using this ratio, in our experiments, however, we had hardly any success (apart from one fungal isolate, i.e., <italic>Cladosporium allicinum</italic> and <italic>Heydenia</italic> cf. <italic>alpina</italic> from samples 2 and 3, respectively). Obviously in these experiments the concentration of fungal parts was too low, and thus we addressed this question in experiment 4 more carefully.</p><p>Abundances of around 1000 fungi/L sea water were documented for samples from the North Sea [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Considering this information, we performed experiment 4 on the assumption of an abundance of 1000 fungi/L, which required fungal cells of 8 L of sea water in a volume of 25 mL agar solution in step 5 of the FIND procedure. Since our bacterial count on this unprocessed sea water sample had revealed an abundance of 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> cells per L, we ourselves calculated a bacteria-to-fungi ratio of around 10<sup>7</sup> to 1 for subsurface samples from littoral areas of the North Sea. This is in accordance to literature reports for surface slick and subsurface samples from littoral areas of Florida, where ratios of 10<sup>5</sup> to 1 and higher were determined [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Vacuum filtration of the marine water sample (10 L) from Katwijk aan Zee/North Sea through paper disks with a pore size of approx. 2 &#x000b5;m, i.e., wide enough to let pass bacteria, but small enough to concentrate fungal spores and mycelia in the filter cake, was performed. Around 5 mL of filter cake was resuspended in another 5 mL of sterile sea water and mixed with 15 mL agar solution.</p><p>In summary, the diluted sample from experiment 1, the undiluted solutions from experiments 2 and 3, and the concentrated, resuspended sea water solution from experiment 4 were each mixed with a warm agar preparation, containing a minimal nutrient medium and antibiotics (experiment 1: amino acids/peptone, antibiotics; experiments 2&#x02013;4: ditto, but in sea water) to yield the desired concentration of roughly 320 000 fungal parts/L. Then, the central plate of FIND (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Scheme 1</xref>) was lowered into these preparations to fill each chamber with an agar solution, containing in average one fungal part. As the agar solidified, the fungal spore or mycelium was trapped in the chamber and separated from other ones, e.g., competing organisms. Semipermeable membranes were attached to both sides of the central plate and the device was sealed with the upper and lower parts and fixed with screws. To guarantee that the device was sealed properly, commercial aquarium safe silicone without antifungal additive was applied to the edges. All materials and tools were sterilized by autoclaving or surface disinfection and the procedure was performed under the laminar airflow cabinet.</p><p>The sample-loaded and sealed device was then inserted into an appropriate container with 40 L of the original soil for experiment 1, sea water and sediment from the collection sites for experiments 2 and 3, whereas for experiment 4 (sea water) 20 L of sea water from the sample site were used to mimic environmental conditions of the corresponding sample sites.</p><p>At this stage the trapped organisms are separated from each other, but connected to their original environment via semipermeable membranes. This way the fungal seeds are provided with growth factors exclusively found in their natural habitat. The device was incubated for four weeks. Deionized water was applied to the soil of experiment 1 every 2 days. An aquarium water pump provided water current simulation and evaporated tank water was replaced by autoclaved deionized water in experiments 2&#x02013;4.</p><p>After incubation the device was removed from the tanks, rinsed with autoclaved deionized water to remove sediment and soil and opened under a laminar air flow cabinet. Each agar plug was transferred to a corresponding agar plate for cultivation. The agar plates contained the same minimal nutrient medium as the agar solution into which the central plate was dipped earlier. Alternatively, a stamp can be used to punch all agar plugs simultaneously into the wells of a 96 well plate. Fermentation on agar plates was performed in an incubator at 25 &#x000b0;C for another four weeks. Morphology of the axenic colonies was then analysed microscopically, and their taxonomy was additionally identified by DNA sequencing.</p><p>In total, experiments 1&#x02013;4 led to 76 fungal isolates (41 fungi in experiment 1, 1 fungus in experiment 2, 1 fungus in experiment 3 and 33 fungi in experiment 4). All fungal cultures were obtained in single isolation steps directly via the FIND procedure and found to be axenic. From experiment 1, 39 isolates were microscopically identified as belonging to genera common in soil, e.g., <italic>Fusarium</italic>, <italic>Penicillium</italic> or <italic>Trichoderma</italic> and thus were not further processed. The addition of antibiotics prevented bacterial contamination in all marine samples. However, a few antibiotic resistant strains were isolated from soil but also not further processed. One isolate from experiment 4 was found to belong to the genus <italic>Cladosporium</italic>, and therefore was also not considered further. The remaining 36 isolates were identified at least to the genus level (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The pooled results from comparison (BLAST) of DNA sequences (ITS1, ITS2, 18S, 5.8S, 28S, RPBII, tef1&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;-tubulin) with reference sequences deposited in public databases (GenBank) and microscopical analysis of morphological characteristics, identified 12 ascomycetes from 12 different genera. Except for <italic>Scopulariopsis brevicaulis</italic> (25 isolates), all strains were encountered only once, due to the ideally adjusted microbial concentration and homogenisation of the sample material. Nine of those 12 different isolates could be identified to species level, whereas for the remaining three (<italic>Cadophora</italic> sp., <italic>Chrysosporium</italic> sp., <italic>Leucothecium</italic> sp.) no species could be assigned. In the case of fungi of the genus <italic>Cadophora</italic>, genetic information for all 25 hitherto described species (MycoBank) are deposited in GenBank. As the alignments of our sequences with the best matching ones of a cultured species, e.g., <italic>C. orchidicola</italic> reached only 97% identity in BLAST, it can be assumed that our isolate is an undescribed species, as it shows 99% identity with sequences of an undescribed species (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For the 116 legitimate species of <italic>Chrysosporium</italic>, BLAST of our sequences revealed 99% identity with reference sequences of <italic>Ch. submersum</italic>. Unfortunately, sequences for only 33 <italic>Chrysosporium</italic> species are available as reference sequences, and thus no identification on the species level could be achieved. Interestingly, the sequence of our isolated <italic>Leucothecium</italic> species is 100% identical to the reference sequence of an uncultured fungus isolated from cotton in 2014 and seems to be closely related to the type species <italic>L. emdenii,</italic> which is one of only two known species among <italic>Leucothecium</italic>. Most of the isolates obtained in our experiments belong to the Sordariomycetes, the by far biggest class of ascomycetes, and to the Dothideomycetes. Some of our cultures, however, are from less examined classes, e.g., Eurotiomycetes and Leotiomycetes. Only <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic> aggr. comes into consideration as a common air mould.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Fungal taxa obtained by four FIND experiments and identified by sequence comparison with the best BLASTn match within the NCBI GenBank database.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Species/genus [GenBank accession number]</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ID%</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of bp analysed</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Taxonomic class</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" valign="top" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Clonostachys rosea</italic> (Link:Fries) Schroers et al.<sup>1</sup> [KT323182]</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">99<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">506</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sordariomycetes</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Ilyonectria europaea</italic> A.

As outcome the diameter of radial growth was measured after 14 days. All experiments were performed in triplicate on 130 mm agar plates containing bio malt agar medium. For the isolate from the Mediterranean Sea (experiment 2), i.e., <italic>C. allicinum</italic>, our results showed optimal growth conditions at 35&#x02030; salinity, i.e., a diameter of 107 &#x000b1; 2 mm was reached. Only poor growth of 54 &#x000b1; 1 to 89 &#x000b1; 1 mm was observed at levels of salinity of 14&#x02030; and below. For the isolate from brackish water (experiment 3), i.e., <italic>Heydenia</italic> cf. <italic>alpina</italic> levels of salinity above 7&#x02030; were necessary to achieve an adequate growth of 124 &#x000b1; 1 to 130 &#x000b1; 0 mm. Below 7&#x02030; salinity the radial growth rates of latter cultures dropped dramatically to only 67 &#x000b1; 1 mm in diameter. In both cases growth rates were nearly halved when the growth medium was lacking appropriate concentrations of sea salts. Our results show that these fungi require high salt concentrations for optimal growth, and this suggests an adaption of the respective strains to marine conditions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information File 1</xref>, Tables S1 and S2 for full experimental data).</p><p>With the FIND technology we managed to isolate rare fungi.

HMBC correlations between the resonances of H-6 (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 2.73) to both C-4 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 122.1) and C-5 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 206.6), between H<sub>3</sub>-15 (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 2.10) and C-2 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 49.8), C-3 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 174.1) and C-4 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 122.1), and between H<sub>2</sub>-1 (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 2.12; 2.93) and both C-3 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 174.1) and C-5 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 206.6) placed the methyl group CH<sub>3</sub>-15 at carbon C-3 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 174.1), and proved the positions of the carbonyl group C-5 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 206.6) and the double bond &#x02206;<sup>3,4</sup> in the molecule, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. The second partial structure was thus a cyclohexenone ring. The proton resonances of H-2 (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 2.65) and H-6 (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 2.73) appear as a characteristic triplet of doublets caused by a vicinal coupling with proton H-1<sub>b</sub> (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 2.93; <italic>J</italic> = 6.0 Hz), an unusual large &#x0201c;W&#x0201d; coupling to each other (<italic>J</italic> = 6.0 Hz) as well as an allylic coupling to H-4 (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 5.78; <italic>J</italic> = 1.3 Hz). These couplings can only be explained with the rigid structure of <bold>1</bold> supporting the presence of a bicyclo[3.1.1] ring system resembling that of verbenone [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>HMBC correlations of H<sub>3</sub>-14 (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 1.07) to C-2 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 49.8), C-6 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 57.2), C-7 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 58.6) and C-8 (&#x003b4;<sub>C</sub> 38.2) confirmed the presence of a verbenone moiety and connected the methylpentenoic acid moiety to the quaternary carbon C-7, completing the planar structure of <bold>1</bold>. Compound <bold>1</bold> is thus a bergamotene type sesquiterpene, containing a bicyclo[3.1.1] ring system as well as a 2-methylpent-2-enoic acid moiety, accounting for all ring double bond equivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The relative configuration of <bold>1</bold> at C-2, C-6 and C-7 was established by a NOESY spectrum.

The latter ones were performed by Wu et al. using (2<italic>S</italic>,6<italic>S</italic>)-verbenone and (2<italic>R</italic>,6<italic>R</italic>)-verbenone and can be applied here, because of the assumed minor effect of the side chain on the CD spectrum [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Experimental data for <bold>1</bold> showed a negative Cotton effect in the range of 320&#x02013;350 nm (321 nm), which suggested according to the calculated CD spectrum of Wu et al. (321 nm) that the absolute configurations of C-2, C-6 and C-7 in <bold>1</bold> are 2<italic>S</italic>, 6<italic>S</italic>, and 7<italic>S</italic>, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information File 1</xref>, Figure S2 for the CD spectrum of <bold>1</bold>).</p><p>The configuration of the double bond &#x02206;<sup>10,11</sup> could be determined as <italic>E</italic> by NOESY correlations between proton signals H<sub>2</sub>-9 (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 2.32) and H<sub>3</sub>-13 (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 1.89).

NOESY correlation between H<sub>b</sub>-1 (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 2.89) and H<sub>2</sub>-8 (&#x003b4;<sub>H</sub> 1.94) indicated the relative configurations of C-2, C-6 and C-7 to be the same as in <bold>1</bold>.

We developed an isolation method that is straight forward to use, rapidly performed and provides interesting isolates in a single experiment. In contrast to other isolation methods, e.g., direct plating or dilution plating, where the former can be experimentally difficult and the latter needs several days for colony counts, the FIND procedure is less labour intensive and the count can be performed in a few minutes. A strain of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>umbrinum</italic> was isolated by Alvi et al. using dilution plating on a soil sample [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The sample was therefore diluted and spread over the plates and incubated for colony growth. To obtain plates for colony picking several dilutions have to be prepared and inoculated plates have to be incubated only to use a fraction of them for further processing. More challenging is the contamination by fast growing fungi that additionally suppress growth of other species on the same plate. The advantage of FIND lies in the adjustment of the correct dilution before incubation on the one hand and the spatial separation which allows slow growing fungi to form axenic colonies in a single step on the other hand. In times of 3D printers, the device may also be constructed in such a manner. In conventional methods we often experience a mix of species in one colony, which is hard or impossible to separate. In FIND, however, all collected colonies were found to be axenic and ready to be cultivated for further purposes like taxonomic identification or natural product isolation. Isolation methods like baiting may lead to bait-specific fungi only. A strain of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>umbrinum</italic> was isolated by Deshmukh et al. using a hair baiting technique. The majority of those isolates showed keratinolytic activity which proves the bias towards bait-specific fungi [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In FIND, fungi regardless of nutritional preferences can be obtained, as they are cultured within the respective environment. In this respect, the most striking feature of the FIND technology is the possibility to reconnect the isolates with their environment, in order to exchange nutrients and growth factors and therefore to ensure species-specific parameters.</p><p>An important feature to know before inoculating the FIND is the concentration of fungal parts in the collected environmental sample. Our experiments and literature data showed that the abundances of fungi or fungal parts, i.e., hyphal cells, mycelial fragments or spores, in terrestrial soil samples (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> fungal parts/L) is huge compared to those in marine sediments (5.000&#x02013;25.000 fungal parts/L). Only extremely small numbers of fungal parts can be found in sea water (0.3&#x02013;1000 fungal parts/L) [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These findings together with the high bacteria-to-fungi ratios described in the literature [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] explain the low recovery of fungal strains of experiments 2 and 3. To improve the outcome of experiments performed on sea sediment samples we propose using tenfold of the reported sediment and corresponding sea water in step 2 of the FIND procedure. Additionally, it is crucial to apply the herein described concentration protocol (step 4) and to perform the experiment in a volume as small as possible, i.e., 25 mL to achieve the target concentration (step 5).</p><p>Using FIND we isolated and identified 12 ascomycetes belonging to 4 different taxonomic classes (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) from 3 different habitats. For half of these species, e.g., <italic>A. armoraciae, C. allicinum, H.</italic> cf. <italic>alpina, I. europaea</italic> and <italic>M. carneum</italic> to date no secondary metabolites are described in the literature. <italic>A. armoraciae and C. allicinum</italic> are special within their genus, as both belong to chemically underexamined clades, e.g., <italic>Chalastospora</italic> clade and <italic>Cladosporium herbarum</italic> complex, respectively [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For <italic>C. allicinum</italic> our experiments point towards a salt dependency of growth, i.e., an adaption to the marine environment. Halotolerance was to date exclusively reported for members of the <italic>Cladosporium sphaerospermum</italic> complex [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of genes involved in secondary metabolite production suggested <italic>Cadophora malorum</italic> as a producer of bioactive compounds [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], as later confirmed by the results of Almeida et al. [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which highlights FINDs potential in the isolation of bioactive compound producing strains. Using FIND enabled the isolation of rare species of the genus <italic>Chrysosporium</italic>, which are scarcely found in soil [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and of which the world register of marine species only lists four entries, e.g., <italic>C. corda</italic>, <italic>C. pannorum</italic>, <italic>C. magnasporum</italic> and <italic>C. oceanitesii</italic> [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. With <italic>Leucothecium</italic> sp. a rare as well as fastidious fungus was isolated in this study, where cultivation was reported to be difficult for at least one of the two species belonging to this genus. <italic>L. coprophilum</italic> showed poor growth when cultured under laboratory conditions as it was lacking interactions to certain bacteria coexisting in its natural habitat [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast to this, there were no difficulties regarding isolation or cultivation using the FIND technology, thus proving the benefits of the device, i.e., isolation of rare fungal strains that are challenging to cultivate in the laboratory as crucial growth factors are missing in artificial medium.</p><p>For only four species among the 12 isolates (<italic>A. umbrinum, C. globosum, C. rosea, S. brevicaulis)</italic> secondary metabolites were described in the literature. In the case of <italic>C. globosum</italic> these findings were limited to mycotoxins [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] where in the other cases the isolated structures showed remarkable activities in the field of anticancer and antimicrobial agents [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p><italic>H. alpina</italic> is one of only six species known from the less examined genus <italic>Heydenia,</italic> and was mistaken for a member of the genus <italic>Onygena</italic> by Fischer because of its morphological similarities [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Molecular data now allow to distinguish both genera from each other [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Strains of <italic>H. alpina</italic> were isolated from areas with very harsh conditions, e.g., Antarctic lakes and naked silican rock [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. On the basis of its extraordinary growth behaviour, the <italic>H.</italic> cf. <italic>alpina</italic> (strain 824) isolated during this study was selected for further chemical investigations. This led to the isolation of two novel compounds (<bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>). Compounds <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> belong to the bergamotene type of sesquiterpenoids, for which manifold ecological functions were reported [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The biological role of the closely related (+)-(<italic>E</italic>)-<italic>endo</italic>-&#x003b2;-bergamoten-12-oic acid in <italic>Lycopersicon hirsutum</italic> was well investigated. Present in the trichomes of the leaves, it serves as an oviposition stimulant to the moth <italic>Heliothis zea</italic> in LA 1777 [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

FIND allows high throughput approaches and overcomes limitations in nutrition and growth conditions compared to artificial broths and laboratory cultivation. It enables to obtain axenic fungal cultures in a single isolation experiment and at the same time restrains fast growing fungi in favour of rare and less examined species. FIND ultimately supports the isolation of novel natural products by providing promising specimen from an environment of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental</title><sec><title>FIND</title><p>The device was crafted from polyoxymethylene by the technical staff of the Helmholtz-Institute for Radiation- and Nuclear Physics, Nussallee 14&#x02013;16, 53115 Bonn. The central plate (127 mm by 92 mm by 1 mm) and the two symmetrical upper and lower plates, the latter with screw threads, contain 96 through-holes 2 mm in diameter arranged in an 8 by 12 grid in a way that it perfectly aligns with the wells of a 96-well plate. The array of through-holes can be covered by one 142 mm polycarbonate membrane filter with a pore size of 0.03 micron (Sterlitech corp., Kent, WA). The device is sealed by six hex bolts size M3.</p></sec><sec><title>General experimental procedures</title><p>Optical rotations were measured with a Jasco DIP 140 polarimeter. ECD spectra were taken on a Jasco J-810 CD spectropolarimeter. UV and IR spectra were obtained using Perkin-Elmer Lambda 40 and Perkin-Elmer Spectrum BX FTIR instruments, respectively. All NMR spectra were recorded in MeOH-<italic>d</italic><sub>4</sub> using a Bruker Avance 300 DPX spectrometer. Spectra were referenced to residual solvent signals with resonances at &#x003b4;<sub>H/C</sub> 3.35/49.0. HRESIMS were recorded on a LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer.</p><p>HPLC was performed on a Waters HPLC system equipped with a 1525&#x000b5; binary pump, a 2998 PDA detector, Breeze 2 software and a Rheodyne 7725i injection system. A Macherey-Nagel Nucleoshell C<sub>18</sub> column (250 mm &#x000d7; 4.6 mm; 5 &#x000b5;m), Nucleodur PolarTec column (250 mm &#x000d7; 4.6 mm; 5 &#x000b5;m), Pyramid C<sub>18</sub> column (250 mm &#x000d7; 4.6 mm; 5 &#x000b5;m) and Phenomenex Kinetex C<sub>18</sub> column (250 mm &#x000d7; 4.6 mm; 5 &#x000b5;m) as well as a Phenomenex Aqua C<sub>18</sub> column (250 mm &#x000d7; 10 mm; 5 &#x000b5;m) were used.</p></sec><sec><title>Taxonomic identification of strains</title><p>Sequencing of the obtained isolates from the FIND experiments was performed by P. Massart and C. Decock at the Belgium coordinated collections of microorganisms (BCCM/IHEM, Brussels) by extracting DNA using their usual protocols and genomic DNA extraction kits and generation of partial sequences of DNA loci using standard primers of ITS1, ITS2, ITS4, 5.8S, RPBII, tef1&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;-tubulin. Digitalized and formatted DNA sequences were compared to reference sequences using BLASTn. ID% of the ITS regions was used to identify each strain. If multiple strains came into question the ID% of other gene sequences were taken into consideration to find the best match. Additionally, macromorphology was examined by colony observation using a Leica MZ6 stereomicroscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and micromorphology was examined with an Olympus BX51 polarizing microscope (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan) by analysis of conidia and mycelium to support the bioinformatic suggestions.</p></sec><sec><title>Fermentation, extraction and isolation</title><p>For cultivation of the marine isolates from the diffusion chamber device experiments inside and outside of the device a minimal nutrient medium &#x02013; FIND agar medium (FAM: 0.05% casamino acids, 0.025% fish peptone, 1.5% agar in sea water from the given sample) &#x02013; was compiled to oppress growth of fast-growing fungi like common air moulds. For soil samples fish peptone was exchanged with meat peptone and deionized water was added instead of sea water. To the cooled autoclaved medium 250 mg penicillin G potassium salt (Roth, CN29.1) and streptomycin sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, S6501-26G) were added via sterile filtration obtaining a concentration of 250 mg/L each to prevent bacterial growth.</p><p>For scale-up fermentation, <italic>H</italic>. cf. <italic>alpina</italic> was cultivated in 42 Fernbach flasks containing 150 mL of BMS agar medium (20 g biomalt in 1 L artificial seawater) each at 25 &#x000b0;C for 28 days. The fermented material of every two Fernbach flasks was extracted three times with 300 mL ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and the organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum to yield 2 g of crude extract. This crude extract was dissolved in 100 mL 80% (v/v) aqueous methanol (MeOH) and successively shaken three times with 100 mL petroleum ether in a separation funnel. MeOH solubles (250 mg) were fractionated by vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) over Polygoprep 60-50 C<sub>18</sub> stationary phase (Macherey-Nagel) using gradient elution from 0:100 (MeOH/H<sub>2</sub>O) to 100 % MeOH (25% steps) to yield 4 fractions. 100 mL of the mobile phase was used for each fraction. Fraction 3 was again fractionated by VLC under the before mentioned conditions to yield 4 subfractions: 3.1&#x02013;3.4. Fraction 3.2 (44 mg) was analysed with the NMR system. Complex spectra obtained from VLC fraction 3.2 by NMR analysis indicated the presence of a wide range of secondary metabolites. This VLC fraction was thus subsequently subjected to further chromatographic separation.</p><p>RP-HPLC separation of VLC fraction 3.2 (MeOH/H<sub>2</sub>O 55:45 Phenomenex Luna column (250 &#x000d7; 10 mm, 5 &#x000b5;m, 2 mL/min) obtained 10 fractions (3.2H1&#x02013;3.2H9).

Growth media, preparation of spraying suspensions and conditions of incubation were carried out according to Schulz et al. [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. For tested samples, a growth inhibition zone &#x02265;3 mm and/or a complete inhibition &#x02265;1 mm, measured from the edge of the filter disk, were regarded as a positive result. Growth inhibition was defined as follows: growth of the appropriate test organism was significantly inhibited compared to a negative control; total inhibition: no growth at all in the appropriate zone. Benzylpenicillin (1 mg/mL MeOH), streptomycin (1 mg/mL MeOH) and miconazole (0.5 mg/mL DCM) were used as positive controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytotoxicity assay</title><p>HEK293 cells were seeded into a PDL-coated 96-well plate (25.000/well) and allowed to settle for 2 hours prior to addition of the compounds (solubilized in water).

After another 2 hours of incubation the fluorescence has been detected using FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec><title>FIND procedure</title><p>For experiment 1, 5 mL of soil (Falcon tube) was diluted in 45 mL of sterile-filtered NaCl 0.85% solution (Ringer solution). This solution underwent manual agitation for 10 minutes and ultrasonication using a Bandelin Sonorex at 100% amplitude (35 kHz) two times for 5 seconds to detach cells from sample surfaces. After centrifugation using an Thermo Scientific Heraeus Multifuge X1R at 130 gravities for 5 minutes, cell counting was performed on the supernatant using a Neubauer Improved or Thoma chamber on an Olympus BX51 polarizing microscope at 100&#x000d7; magnification, and the abundance of bacteria was calculated by counting bacterial cells in all 25 medium squares of the central large square or all 16 medium squares of one of the large square, respectively. With Neubauer Improved chambers the supernatant was exchanged three times, for Thoma chambers three different large squares were counted. All the cells within each medium square (totally) together with those that are over the top and right sides of the square (even partially) were considered inside of a square. Mean cell counts were calculated and converted into concentrations by multiplying cell counts with the reciprocal value of the volume of a small square in L, considering possible dilution steps. For experiments 2 and 3, samples were treated alike, but instead of a Ringers solution, sea water from the respective sampling site was used. For experiment 4 only sea water was used.</p><p>With the calculated abundances 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>13</sup> as well as 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>, 13 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> and 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> bacterial cells/L for experiments 1&#x02013;4, respectively, volumes between 10 and 50 mL of the solutions were taken according to the corresponding assumed bacteria-to-fungi ratios of the given sample type. These volumes, e.g., 16, 24 and 42 mL, respectively, were then added to a volume of FAM solution to obtain a concentration of 320.000 fungal parts per litre.</p><p>For experiment 4, 500 mL portions of a 10 L sample were poured through a sieve with a mesh size of 35 (0.5 mm) onto Whatman filter paper disks 602H with a pore size of 2 &#x000b5;m attached to a B&#x000fc;chner funnel. The funnel was put onto a 2 L suction bottle which was connected to a KNF Neuberger N811 KN.18 vacuum pump that provided negative pressure in the bottle and therefore ensured filtration of the sample portions. The residues on the filter paper disks (5 mL) were resuspended in 5 mL autoclaved sea sample and also mixed with 15 mL warm FAM solution resulting in a concentration of approximately 320 000 fungal parts/L. The prepared FAM solutions containing the corresponding samples were homogenized by stirring and the central plate was dipped into it. The desired target concentration is necessary to allow only one fungal part per through hole in the central plate. As the agar solidifies, the specimen is trapped in the chamber. A semipermeable polycarbonate membrane filter was attached to both sides of the central plate. The upper and lower parts of the FIND were connected to each other with six M3 hex bolt screws, sandwiching the central plate with the attached membranes between them. To ensure the devices seal commercial aquarium safe and antifungal-less silicone (Soudal) was applied to the edges of the device. The silicone was given time to dry and the device was inserted into a tank containing 40 L of soil for experiment 1, 2 L of sea water and sediment for experiment 2, 20 L of sea water and sediment for experiment 3 and sea water for experiment 4. An aquarium powerhead pump provided water current for simulation, oxygenation and distribution purposes for experiments 2&#x02013;4. Evaporated tank water was replaced by autoclaved deionized water for experiments 2&#x02013;4 and the soil in experiment 1 was watered with autoclaved deionized water every two days.</p><p>After four weeks of incubation inside of the tank the device was removed, rinsed with autoclaved deionized water to remove sediment and soil and opened under a laminar air flow cabinet to transfer each agar plug to a corresponding agar plate for cultivation. For transfer into 96 well plates a Boekel replica plater was used to punch all agar plugs from the central plate into the corresponding wells containing liquid FAM medium. For transfer onto agar plates, autoclaved wooden toothpicks were used to pick each agar plug from the central plate manually and streak them onto agar plates. The plates were stored in a Memmert BE500 incubator at 25 &#x000b0;C for four weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Salt dependency experiments</title><p>Artificial sea water was used for the preparations of the agar plates.

Dilutions with 7, 14, 21 and 28&#x02030; water were achieved by adding deionized water to portions containing 480, 360, 240, 120 mL of the stock solutions, respectively, to obtain 600 mL each. For the 0&#x02030; medium 600 mL deionized water was used. 20 mg biomalt and 15 mg agar per litre were added to the solutions and pH was adjusted at 7 by adding NaOH/HCl. After autoclaving for 20 minutes at 121 &#x000b0;C using an H+P Varioklav autoclave 100 mL of cooled agar solution were poured into petri dishes 130 mm in diameter.
