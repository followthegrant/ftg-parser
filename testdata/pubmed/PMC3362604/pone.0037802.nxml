Cardiac cells in colonies uniformly expressed the gap junction protein connexin 43 (C&#x000d7;43) and displayed a spectrum of differentiation with only a subset of cells exhibiting the late cardiomyogenic marker troponin T (cTnT) and evidence of electrical excitability. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ILK potently increased the number of new aggregates of primitive cardioblasts (p&#x0003c;0.001). The number of cardioblast colonies was significantly decreased (p&#x0003c;0.05) when ILK expression was knocked down with ILK targeted siRNA. Interestingly, overexpression of the activation resistant ILK mutant (ILK<italic><sup>R211A</sup></italic>) resulted in much greater increase in the number of new cell aggregates as compared to overexpression of wild-type ILK (ILK<italic><sup>WT</sup>)</italic>. The cardiomyogenic effects of ILK<italic><sup>R211A</sup></italic> and ILK<italic><sup>WT</sup></italic> were accompanied by concurrent activation of &#x003b2;-catenin (p&#x0003c;0.001) and increase expression of progenitor cell marker islet-1, which was also observed in lysates of transgenic mice with cardiac-specific over-expression of ILK<italic><sup>R211A</sup></italic> and ILK<italic><sup>WT</sup>.</italic> Finally, endogenous ILK expression was shown to increase in concert with those of cardiomyogenic markers during directed cardiomyogenic differentiation in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In the human fetal heart ILK activation is instructive to the specification of mesodermal precursor cells towards a cardiomyogenic lineage.

ILK gain-of-function is shown to induce the differentiation of a resident mesodermal precursor cell toward an early cardiomyocyte characterized by nascent sarcomeric structures, and to lead to subsequent cardiomyogenic maturation through increased sarcomerogenesis.

Further studies are required to identify the specific precursor cells that give rise to cardioblasts in response to ILK overexpression. In further support of the cardiomyogenic role of endogenous ILK, we demonstrate that targeted reduction of ILK expression using siRNA led to a reduction in cardioblast formation. Our studies also demonstrate that expression of endogenous ILK progressively increases during growth factor-induced early cardiogenesis in hESCs.

The ILK R211A mutation possesses a normal kinase domain and thus retains signaling competence, and exhibits high expression levels, and these factors may account for its cardiomyogenic potency. This feature may have translational significance since the R211A mutation appears to be phenotypically inert and thus potentially less oncogenic <xref rid="pone.0037802-Durbin2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> than other prosurvival molecules or stem cell based approaches.</p><p>Since ILK is known to be activated by hypoxia, which normally occurs during fetal heart development <xref rid="pone.0037802-FudimM1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and in postnatal heart disease <xref rid="pone.0037802-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, these findings support the paradigm that stress induction of ILK might serve as a novel endogenous regulator of cardiomyogenesis.
