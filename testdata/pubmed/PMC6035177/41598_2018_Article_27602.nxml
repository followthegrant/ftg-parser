The objective of this research was to investigate the endogenous BMP7 expression in human osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage and the effect of oxygen tension on the single or combined treatment with TGF-&#x003b2;3 and BMP7 on OA chondrocyte redifferentiation in three dimensional (3D) pellet cultures. The results showed the expression of BMP7 and its intracellular signaling target SMAD1/5/8 was decreased in early OA, while it was increased in later stages of OA. The combined treatment with TGF-&#x003b2;3 and BMP7, both in normoxia and hypoxia, was more effective than TGF-&#x003b2;3 or BMP7 alone in redifferentiating chondrocytes. This was reflected by Alcian blue/Safranin O staining and collagen type II protein expression, as well as by gene expression. Hypoxia elevated TGF-&#x003b2;3 and BMP7-induced matrix formation of OA chondrocytes and alleviated the catabolic gene expression. Interestingly, cells cultured under normoxia displayed mild signs of an inflammatory stress response, which was effectively counteracted by culturing the cells under low oxygen tension. Our data underscores the important modulatory role of oxygen tension on the chondrocyte&#x02019;s responsiveness to TGF-&#x003b2;3 and/or BMP7.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Articular cartilage exhibits a poor self-regeneration capacity, and even minor cartilage defects may predispose to early onset osteoarthritis (OA). To break this vicious cycle, surgical intervention is often considered. Several surgical strategies have been developed to repair damaged cartilage. One of the most promising approaches is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This approach is based on isolation of chondrocytes, followed by expansion in monolayer culture to obtain sufficient cells for implantation into the lesion. However, monolayer expansion leads to a rapid loss of typical chondrocyte features, a process known as chondrocyte dedifferentiation, which eventually results in fibrous cartilage formation rather than hyaline cartilage after implantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Consequently, it is important to minimize the negative aspects of chondrocyte dedifferentiation or, alternatively develop effective strategies for chondrocyte redifferentiation.</p><p id="Par3">Transforming Growth Factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) superfamily, including TGF-&#x003b2; and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), is a family of secreted signaling factors with a remarkable ability to induce cartilage and bone formation. Generally, TGF-&#x003b2; induced signaling depends on Sma and Mad related proteins (SMAD) 2 and SMAD3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This results in stabilization of the SOX9 transcription complex while inhibiting <italic>RUNX2</italic> expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. BMP signaling depends on the SMAD1/5/8 pathway to stimulate the expression of typical cartilage hypertrophic markers, such as <italic>COL10A1, MMP13</italic> and <italic>ALPL</italic> during chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and termimal differentiation of primary chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. TGF-&#x003b2; is an effective inducer of chondrogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> by stimulating chondrocyte proliferation while inhibiting chondrocyte hypertrophy and maturation <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. BMPs, such as BMP2 and BMP4, are potent regulators of chondrocyte hypertrophy and matrix degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In contrast, BMP7 distinctly stimulates chondrocyte proliferation and inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">There are a few studies that have shown the combinationatorial effect of TGF-&#x003b2; and BMPs on chondrogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, all these studies have been performed in normoxia (21% O<sub>2</sub>) which is a supra-physiological oxygen concentration compared to the much lower oxygen tension in articular cartilage <italic>in vivo</italic>. Articular cartilage is a typical avascular tissue, and chondrocytes normally reside in a low oxygen environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Hypoxia has a positive influence on the chondrocyte phenotype and has been shown to stimulate cartilage matrix formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, most studies have focused on chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs from different sources with treatment of BMPs or TGF-&#x003b2;s. Few studies have focused on the redifferentiation of chondrocytes under hypoxic conditions in the presence of these factors. The aim of this study was to identify the effects of exogenous BMP7 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 on the redifferentiation of osteoarthritic chondrocytes after expansion in monolayer, using an aggregate pellet culture under low oxygen, and to explore the possibility of using the combination of hypoxia with TGF&#x003b2; and BMP7 to stimulate chondrocyte redifferentiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cartilage samples collection</title><p id="Par5">The collection and use of human cartilage was approved by the local hospital ethical committee (De Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie (METC) TWENTE) and for all samples informed written consent was obtained.

The expression of BMP7 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>) distinctly decreased with increasing severity from 0 to 3 in the early OA development, while it was increased from grade 3 to 5. BMP7 was mainly expressed in the matrix of the superficial layer and highly expressed inside chondrocytes. BMP7 expression was decreased in the middle layer and deep layers, however, it was increased again in hypertrophic chondrocytes. In the early OA stages from grade 0 to 2, positive staining of BMP7 was observed in the whole cartilage section, high to low from the superficial layer to the deep layer. At grade 3, intensity of BMP7 staining was decreased. BMP7 was only detected in chondrocytes in the superficial layer and in hypertrophic chondrocytes in the deep layer. Interestingly, in cartilage specimens with OA stage 4 and 5, and especially in grade 5 specimens, BMP7 was highly expressed in cell clusters, which is a typical characteristic of late OA. The expression of BMP7 was measured by IHC in each patient (Supplemental Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The protein expression of BMP7 and SMAD1/5/8 in human cartilage was visualized by IHC in each donor.

SMAD1/5/8 was mainly present in the chondrocytes of the superficial layer, even in the relatively healthy cartilage (grade 0 and 1). In stage 2 to 4 OA specimens, positive staining of SMAD1/5/8 was hard to observe in the chondrocytes of the middle layer and in hypertrophic chondrocytes of the deep layer.

There was no significant difference between normoxia and hypoxia in the TGF-&#x003b2;3 and BMP7 treated groups. To clarify whether the enhanced pellet size was due to cell proliferation or to matrix production, EdU proliferation assays, Alcian blue and Safranin O staining, and GAG assays were performed. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C,D</xref>, the proliferation ratio after treatment with TGF-&#x003b2;3 did not change between normoxia and hypoxia, while BMP7 treated pellets under hypoxia presented less positive Edu staining than pellets in normoxia. Moreover, treatment of TGF-&#x003b2;3 or BMP7 pellets of hypoxia showed lower cell density than pellets cultured in normoxia, as can be derived from the DAPI staining. TUNEL assay showed that the amount of apoptotic cells was increased in hypoxia as compared to normoxia for TGF-&#x003b2;3 treatment and that no difference was observed for the BMP7 treated group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E,F</xref>).

To the best of our knowledge, this study has evaluated for the first time the protein expression of endogenous BMP7 and its intracellular signaling target SMAD 1/5/8 in different grades of OA in human cartilage. We show that BMP7 and SMAD1/5/8 are predominantly present inside cells and in the surrounding pericellular matrix of chondrocytes in the superficial and upper middle layers, and in chondrocytes of the transitional layer. Their expression initially decreased in early OA from grade 0 to 3 and then started to increase again from grade 3 to 5. At grade 5, BMP7 was especially highly expressed in chondrocyte clusters. Bobinac and his colleagues also found that BMP7 is strongly expressed in chondrocyte clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Given the anabolic role of BMP7 in cartilage homeostasis, increased expression in chondrocyte clusters may be considered as a reparative response of the tissue. The expression of SMAD 1/5/8 followed the pattern of BMP7 expression albeit at a lower level.</p><p id="Par25">Chondrocytes are the only cell type responsible for maintaining the surrounding matrix by synthesizing cartilage specific matrix proteins such as type II collagen and aggrecan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) has proven to be a pivotal approach as restorative cartilage surgery. However, even the most recent ACI techniques have some limitations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. It has been shown that the transplanted chondrocytes are able to form new cartilage, which appears to be of hyaline nature and expresses typical cartilage markers such as type II collagen, aggrecan and COMPs. However type I collagen and fibrous cartilage matrix are also detected in the newly formed tissue after two years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. There are plenty of cytokines and growth factors in the cartilage or synovial fluid to modulate the balance between the synthesis and degradation of ECM, or the balance between anabolism and catabolism. BMP/TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is extremely important in chondrocyte development. TGF-&#x003b2; induces collagen II and SOX9 deposition through SMAD2/3 phosphorylation pathway, while BMP7 promotes chondrocyte matrix production and inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy via SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation. The balance between SMAD 2/3 and SMAD 1/5/8 signaling, which are activated by TGF-&#x003b2; and BMP7 play a key role in cartilage homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. During ACI surgery, chondrocytes are isolated from a macroscopically healthy looking area in the joint, which may have limited matrix production capacity and the expansion process further reduces this matrix production potential. Therefore, to enable effective cartilage repair, efficient redifferentiation before or after implantation into the damaged area is a prerequisite.</p><p id="Par26">BMP7 and TGF-&#x003b2; are important for the maintenance of cartilage homeostasis, and the loss of their expression could contribute to the development of OA. In this research, we mainly focus on the function of BMP7 and TGF-&#x003b2; in chondrocyte redifferentiation in 3D pellet cultures after expanding in monolayer. To do this, we cultured the pellets in serum free chondrogenic differentiation medium supplemented with TGF-&#x003b2;3 or BMP7 or both. <italic>In vivo</italic>, cartilage is exposed to a low oxygen tension. Despite this, chondrocytes are still cultured in normoxia in most labs. To study the effect of oxygen tension on the chondrocyte&#x02019;s response to these growth factors, we compared the effects of growth factors on chondrocyte redifferentiation in both hypoxia (2.5% O<sub>2</sub>) and normoxia (21% O<sub>2</sub>). Our results indicated that TGF-&#x003b2;3 or BMP7 alone were not as efficient in redifferentiating chondrocytes as compared to the combined treatment with TGF-&#x003b2;3 and BMP7 both in normoxia and hypoxia. Alcian blue and Safranin O staining, GAG assay, type II collagen staining and gene expression analysis showed the same trend that the combined treatment with TGF-&#x003b2;3 and BMP7 positively influenced redifferentiation of OA chondrocytes. Previously, it was reported that BMP7 inhibited hMSC growth in expansion cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. We observed that the combination of BMP7 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 significantly promoted cell proliferation. However, the observed enlarged pellet size was mainly due to increased extracellular matrix production, with less tightly packed cells in the pellets.</p><p id="Par27">In hypoxia, in the first week, MMP1 expression was relatively higher in the pellets treated with BMP7 alone or combined with TGF-&#x003b2;3, and lower in the TGF-&#x003b2;3 only treatment as compared to normoxia. This indicates that chondrocytes are more sensitive to the BMP7 stimulation in hypoxia in the early stages of redifferentiation. In this study, higher SMAD 1/5/8 expression was observed in hypoxia than in normoxia in all treatment conditions. While the expression of SMAD 1/5/8 was higher when BMP7 was present, the highest expression was observed in the combined treatment of BMP7 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 in hypoxia. Lafont and his colleagues reported that hypoxia inhibited BMP2 induced SMAD signaling in monolayer cultures of human articular chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. These observations indicate that hypoxia modulates the sensitivity of the chondrocytes for BMP signaling.</p><p id="Par28">The mechanism of the additive effects of BMP7 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 on chondrocyte redifferentiation and the influence of oxygen tension on this mechanism is still not clear. It might be that TGF-&#x003b2;3 upregulates the expression of BMP receptors in chondrocytes, which in turn promotes the cellular response to BMP7. It has been reported that TGF-&#x003b2;3 mediates the upregulation of the type I BMP receptor, ALK6, through which BMP7 and other BMPs are recruited to stimulate signal transduction in human MSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it has been reported that the TGF-&#x003b2;3 receptor can also function as a BMP receptor by binding multiple members of the BMP subfamily including BMP7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The mutual regulation or receptor activation may amplify and enhance the effects of TGF-&#x003b2;3 and BMP7.</p><p id="Par29">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using human OA chondrocyte to study the potential application of BMP7 and TGF-&#x003b2; in cartilage tissue regeneration in 3D-cultured pellets under hypoxia. As Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows, the combination of TGF-&#x003b2;3 and BMP7 might readjust the balance between catabolism and anabolism by upregulating anabolic activities and downregulating catabolic activities in the treatment of osteoarthritic cartilage. Taken together, the combined treatment of BMP7 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 was superior in chondrocyte redifferentiation compared to single treatments both in normoxia and hypoxia. This study also indicate that a balanced combination of cytokines or growth factors in combination with an appropriate oxygen tension is required for efficient chondrocyte redifferentiation in pellet cultures.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>The schematic diagram of OA treatment by TGF-&#x003b2;3 and BMP7.
