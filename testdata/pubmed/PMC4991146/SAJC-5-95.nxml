It is also the foremost contributor to cancer-related mortality, resulting in 1.38 million cancer deaths per year worldwide.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Lung cancer accounts for more deaths than any other type of cancer. Several epidemiological observations performed across varied demographic cohorts in India confirm the significant burden of lung cancer in India, contributing significantly toward the cancer morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>According to the GLOBOCAN 2012 report, the estimated incidence of lung cancer in India was 70,275 in all ages and both sexes; the crude incidence rate per 100,000 was 5.6, the age-standardized rate per 100,000 (world), i.e. ASR (W) was 6.9, and the cumulative risk was 0.85. In terms of incidence rates, lung cancer ranked fourth overall among the various types of cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) after breast, cervical, and oral cavity cancer; in males, it ranked second while in females it was sixth in terms of cancer incidence. There were 53,728 new lung cancer cases among Indian males (crude incidence rate - 8.3, ASR (W) &#x02013; 11, and cumulative risk - 1.36) and 16,547 new lung cancer cases among Indian females (crude incidence rate - 2.7, ASR (W) - 3.1, and cumulative risk - 0.37). The overall estimated lung cancer mortality in India in 2012 was 63,759, making it the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality in India after breast and cervical cancer. Among Indian males, lung cancer was the most common cause of cancer mortality at 48,697; the estimated lung cancer mortality among Indian females was 15,062 (ranking seventh in terms of cancer-related mortality in Indian women behind breast, cervix, colorectal, ovary, stomach, and lip/oral cavity cancer).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The quality of the data acquired from Indian hospital-based registries and regional cancer registries may be hindered by incomplete penetrance of disease registration across the different states of India, resulting in an underestimation of the overall burden. As per the GLOBOCAN 2008 report, males predominate with a male:female ratio of 4.5:1, and this ratio varies with age and smoking status. The ratio increased progressively till 51&#x02013;60 years and then remained steady. Various reports have noted that the smoker:nonsmoker ratio is high at 20:1. After the age of 40 years, the squamous cell type was the most common in smokers and adenocarcinoma was common in the nonsmokers. The current demographic pattern of lung cancer in India appears to be similar to that seen in the Western countries approximately 40 years ago. There appears to be a marginal increase in the mean age of diagnosis of lung cancers in India over the years from 52.16 years during 1958&#x02013;1985 to 54.6 years during 1985&#x02013;2001.</p><p>The history of published data on lung cancer epidemiology in India reflects the impact of industrialization and smoking trends on cancer in the community. After the initial erroneous impression of the rarity of lung cancer likely resulting from paucity in lung cancer reporting, Viswanathan <italic>et al</italic>. in their seminal paper in 1962 made the observation of the increasing burden of lung cancer across different centers in the country. They collected data from different hospitals in India for the years 1950&#x02013;1959. They drew parallels with Western data with regard to increasing lung cancer incidence among male smokers and the most common primary histology of squamous cell carcinoma in the period under observation (1950&#x02013;1959). They noted that there was a significant rise in the number of cases of lung cancer during the 10 years from 1950 to 1959, and although the incidence had increased in both sexes, the increase in males was greater than that in females. They found that of a total of 95 necropsies on lung cancer patients, 78 were males and 17 were females; 64 (67.6%) were smokers and 31 (32.4%) were nonsmokers. The histopathologic distribution included 20 (21.05%) adenocarcinomas, 48 squamous (50.53%), 23 (24.21%) anaplastic, and 4 (4.21%) alveolar carcinoma. Regarding age distribution, the majority of the lung cancer patients, i.e. 38 (40%) were in the 50&#x02013;59 years age group, 19 (20%) each were in the age groups of 40&#x02013;49 years, and 60&#x02013;69 years, while there were smaller numbers in the extreme age groups, i.e., 3 (3.16%) in the &#x0003c;30 years age group, 11 (11.6%) in the 30&#x02013;39 years group, 3 (3.16%) in the 70&#x02013;79 years age group, and 2 (2.1%) in the 80 + years group.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The incidence of lung cancer has paralleled the trends of tobacco smoking. Smoking tobacco remains the single most important risk factor (80&#x02013;90%); a smaller proportion (10&#x02013;20%) is attributed to occupational exposure to various carcinogenic agents. The smoker:nonsmoker ratios have been lower in most of the Indian studies compared to those in the West.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The percentage of tobacco-related products smoked in India are beedis (28.4&#x02013;79%), cigarettes (9.0&#x02013;53.7), hookah (3.4&#x02013;77.3), and mixed (7.5&#x02013;13.6).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The relative risk of developing lung cancer is 2.64 for beedi smokers and 2.23 for cigarette smokers, with 2.45 as the overall risk for smoking tobacco.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Passive smoking and environmental tobacco smoke are known lung carcinogens. A meta-analysis of 41 studies showed that environmental tobacco exposure carries a relative risk of developing lung cancer of 1.48 (1.13&#x02013;1.92) in males and 1.2 in females (1.12&#x02013;1.29).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The risk increases with an increase in exposure. Exposure at the workplace results in a relative risk of 1.16. There is an increasing risk with an increase in the number of smokers in the house and in the duration of exposure. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure during childhood is strongly associated with the risk of developing lung cancer (odds ratio 3.9, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.9&#x02013;8.2).[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In the Western countries and most of the Asian countries, adenocarcinoma has surpassed squamous cell carcinoma as the most common histologic variant of lung cancer. This shift seems to be attributable partly to the changed smoking pattern and increasing incidence of lung cancer in women and nonsmokers. However, most of the older and some recent Indian series still report that squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histology. Single-center-based reporting from the established tertiary cancer centers points toward adenocarcinoma being the most common nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtype. Krishnamurthy <italic>et al</italic>. in their retrospective analysis of data extracted from a total of 258 consecutive hospital in-patients with lung cancer at Adyar in Chennai between January 2003 and December 2007 reported that the most common histology was adenocarcinoma (42.6%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (15.6%), large cell carcinoma (2.3%), and others (7%). Subclassification was not possible in 49 patients (19%) primarily because the diagnosis was made cytologically. There was a very significant correlation found with adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers compared to smokers, and with squamous cell carcinoma among the smokers compared to nonsmokers (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0002).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Similarly, Malik <italic>et al</italic>. analyzed 434 pathologically confirmed lung cancer cases registered at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, over a period of 3 years between July 2008 and June 2011. Among the biopsy slides which were subjected to independent review, squamous cell carcinoma was the most common histological subtype (33.33%) as per the initial report, but after expert pathological review, adenocarcinoma was found to be the most common histology (37.3%). This emphasizes the critical role of pathology review in lung cancer in the present era of personalized treatment. This changing paradigm in epidemiological and pathological trend was also supported by the data published by our group at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. We reported that of 489 patients, 52% were nonsmokers and the most common histology was adenocarcinoma at 43.8% followed by squamous cell carcinoma at 26.2%.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The epidemiological description of lung cancer is not uniform throughout India, which is reflected in data collected from different cancer registries across the country. The population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) consolidated report from 1990 to 1996 reported that cancer of the lung is the number one cause of cancer in males and is the leading cancer site in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bhopal, wherein it accounts for 10% of all cancers. In Bengaluru and Chennai, lung cancer is the second and the third leading cancer site, respectively. In women, lung cancer is one of the 10 leading sites in 4 of the 6 cancer registries, i.e., in Bhopal, Chennai, Delhi, and Mumbai.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The national cancer registry program under the Indian council of medical research, after studying the lung cancer incidence rate over 24 years (1982&#x02013;2005), has found that lung cancer is the second leading cause of cancer in women and has increased by an annual percentage change of 2.7 in Bengaluru, 4.6 in Chennai, and 2 in Delhi.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In a retrospective comparison study of the clinicoradiological profile from the first PBCR in Kolkata in the Eastern part of India, the most predominant histopathological subtypes of primary bronchogenic carcinoma were squamous cell carcinoma at 35.1% and adenocarcinoma at 30.8%, followed by small cell lung cancer at 16.5%, undifferentiated carcinoma 11.7%, and large cell carcinoma 5.9%. Of the total of 607 patients, 67.2% were current smokers, 26.8% were nonsmokers, and the rest were ex-smokers. The smoking status was found to have a strong correlation with primary lung cancer. Among all the smokers with lung cancer, 93.9% were male; the females with lung cancer were more commonly nonsmokers at 77.12%.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Similarly, Singh <italic>et al</italic>. published their results based on patient information from single tertiary care center-based in North India. In their retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 250 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients, they found no significant differences in the demographical, histological, or smoking profiles of lung cancer patients compared to those seen three decades earlier. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 57.9 (&#x000b1;11.3) years whereas previously it was 54.3 years. The male:female ratio was 4.43:1 (previously 4.48:1; <italic>P</italic> = 0.952) while the smoker:nonsmoker ratio was 2.67:1 (previously 2.68:1; <italic>P</italic> = 0.980). The most common histological types were squamous cell (34.8%), adenocarcinoma (26.0%), and small cell (18.4%) while previously these were 34.3%, 25.9%, and 20.3%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.916. However, significant differences were observed between smokers and nonsmokers in relation to distribution of gender, histology, and disease stage. They concluded that the absence of change in the smoking pattern of the population could be a possible reason.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Molecular Pathology of Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer</title><p>There has been a tremendous increase in interest in unraveling the molecular mechanisms resulting in the malignant phenotype of different cancer types in the past two decades. We now have a better understanding of the different interconnecting networks of signaling pathways involved in the cancer cells&#x02019; ability to proliferate evading various cell cycle checks, to inhibit apoptosis, to invade and to generate distant metastases. This has led to intense pharmacological and clinical research in several cancer types including NSCLC. The newer agents for therapy target mostly the transmembrane receptors, which often have tyrosine kinase activity, inhibiting the successive cascade of kinases&#x02019; activation preventing the subsequent transcriptional changes necessary or responsible for the malignant phenotype. These molecular alterations (gene amplification or mutations), which have the driver/transforming capability or property, represent potentially an early event in carcinogenesis that fuels further sufficient genetic alterations that lead to malignant characteristics of cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Molecular Data from the Indian Population in Lung Cancer</title><p>The relative extent to which the ethnic and genetic background contribute to the disparity in prevalence in different receptor mutations remains unclear. Apart from the genetic background, various environmental influences such as cigarette smoking and tobacco chewing may modulate the relative frequencies of different activating mutations.</p><p>There have been multiple reports on molecular testing in lung cancer in the Indian population. Several tertiary care centers have significantly contributed the results of the molecular testing done in their patients to form impressions regarding various mutation frequencies and variations in comparison to the Western population.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors</title><p>Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (gefitinib and erlotinib) which target a mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as first-line agents in the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients, who tested positive for the activating driver mutation. These driver mutations occur in exons 18&#x02013;21 of the EGFR, modifying the active site of the kinase domain in favor of increased activity (ligand-driven or constitutive activity). The earlier reporting from most Indian populations suggested an EGFR mutation rate varying between 22% and 51.8%, which possibly was an overestimation resulting from selection bias and small sample size. An initial report from 2011 published by Sahoo <italic>et al</italic>. from Triesta laboratories in Bengaluru, India, reported an EGFR mutation rate of 55% in 220 patient samples tested between January 2008 and July 2010. However, these patients were possibly selected for EGFR mutation testing based on their clinicodemographic profile, and hence was likely to be an enriched population.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Studies from tertiary care centers that catered to a much larger patient pool with a referral base from across the country and which reported EGFR testing in all NSCLC patients subsequently gave us a much more accurate estimation of mutation rates.</p><p>Chougule <italic>et al</italic>. in their retrospective analysis of 907 patients diagnosed with lung cancer in Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, between August 2011 and December 2012, revealed an overall mutation rate of 23.2% with a higher mutation rate in females as compared to males (29.8% vs. 20%) with <italic>P</italic> = 0.002. Of all the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutations, 50% were in-frame deletions in exon 19, 42% were missense mutations in exon 21, 7% of the mutations were in exon 18, and 3% in exon 20. Two patients harbored a mutation in exon 20 along with exon 21. The overall frequency of EGFR mutations in the adenocarcinoma population was 26% as compared to 3.8% in squamous cell carcinomas (<italic>n</italic> = 103). This EGFR mutation rate was less than that of East Asian patients (26&#x02013;30%) and more than Western patients (10&#x02013;15%).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Another retrospective analysis involving 500 patients treated at six different centers revealed a slightly higher EGFR mutation rate of 33%.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Regional differences have also been reported, with a higher incidence of 65% in the Southern Indian population as compared to 33% in Northern Indian population.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These variations may be related to difference in smoking rates in the community.</p><p>The PIONEER study was a prospective, multinational, epidemiological study of EGFR mutations which enrolled patients from Asia with newly diagnosed advanced lung adenocarcinoma. This study included a proportion of patients from a single center from South India. PIONEER reported a lower EGFR mutation frequency in patients from India (22.2%) compared with other areas (47.2&#x02013;64.2%).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>The clinical correlation and outcome to EGFR targeted therapy was reported in a retrospective study by Noronha <italic>et al</italic>. from Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our analysis of patients who were managed with oral TKIs, the overall response to oral TKI therapy was 30%. Patients with an activating mutation of EGFR had a response rate of 74% while the response rate in patients with wild-type EGFR was 5% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 10 months and 19 months, respectively, in patients with EGFR mutations compared to 2 months and 13 months, respectively, for EGFR mutation-negative patients.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The correlation between various clinicopathological factors and the EGFR mutation status was also studied and reported by Bhatt <italic>et al</italic>. The authors retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 104 histologically confirmed NSCLC patients between January 2008 and December 2010 who also had formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues available for EGFR mutational analysis. The prevalence of EGFR mutation in this population was 39.6% with exon 19 mutation being the most common (80%); exon 21 mutation was seen in 17% and exon 18 in 3%. There were no significant associations between those who were positive for mutations in either exon 19 or 21 when compared to age, gender, or histology. The response rates were superior in the EGFR mutation-positive group compared to mutation-negative group (90.5% vs. 70.3%), with the best response noted in those treated upfront with oral TKI (93.3% vs. 88.8%). This retrospective series further demonstrated better PFS in the EGFR mutation-positive patients who received chemotherapy, followed by TKI, as compared with EGFR mutation-positive patients who received only TKIs, which could be contributory evidence in support of studies assessing the best way to sequence chemotherapy and oral TKI in EGFR mutation-positive lung cancer patients.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Our group at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India retrospectively analyzed the survival outcomes of 101 EGFR mutant patients with and without brain metastases. Fourteen (13.8%) patients had brain metastases. The overall response to therapy was 64% in the group of patients with extracranial metastases compared to 50% in the brain metastases group. Correspondingly, the median OS in the patients with extracranial metastases group was 18.7 months compared to 11.6 months in the brain metastases group, <italic>P</italic> = 0.029.

The genetic mechanism is an inversion of two closely located genes on chromosome 2p. The resulting constitutive oligomerization leads to persistent mitogenic signaling and malignant transformation. The presence of ALK mutation is reported in approximately 3&#x02013;7% of lung cancers, found more commonly in young patients with adenocarcinomas with a history of never or light smoking. Clinically the presence of ALK rearrangement is detected by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) with an ALK break-apart probe. In the majority of patients, ALK rearrangements are nonoverlapping with other oncogenic mutations. In 2011, crizotinib received accelerated approval from the US FDA because of its efficacy in ALK + NSCLC based on the results from the 2009 single-arm, global Phase II study of crizotinib (PROFILE 1005, NCT00932451).[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Based on the impressive response rates attained in initial Phase I and Phase II trials with the dual ALK/MET TKI, crizotinib in patients harboring the ALK mutation, an international Phase III trial randomized patients with advanced lung cancer harboring ALK fusions to crizotinib versus standard chemotherapy after disease progression on first line treatment. This trial revealed an improved radiographic response rate with crizotinib (65% vs. 25%) and the study met its primary end-point of improved PFS with crizotinib (median PFS 7.7 vs. 3 months, hazard ratio [HR] for progression - 0.49, 95% CI 0.37&#x02013;0.64).[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In treatment na&#x000ef;ve patients harboring ALK mutation, therapy with crizotinib resulted in an improved PFS, quality of life (QOL), and radiographic response rates.

They observed ALK gene rearrangement among 5 (2.7%) of the total cohort of 227 patients with adenocarcinoma in whom ALK testing was performed, excluding the patients in whom the results of the test were uninterpretable.

ALK mutation testing was performed on the 336 tissue blocks which tested negative for the EGFR mutation. ALK rearrangement was observed in 15 of 336 patients (4.5%).

Patients with Stages III and IV NSCLC, who were diagnosed between the years 2002 and 2006, who had radiological response evaluation after minimum of two cycles of palliative chemotherapy, were analyzed for response rates, survival outcomes, and factors related to prognosis. A total of 294 patients received palliative chemotherapy, of which 66% (194 patients) were eligible for the outcome analysis. The authors concluded that the outcomes with platinum doublet chemotherapy remain less than ideal with a median OS of 7&#x02013;9 months and a modest improvement to 12.5 months with the addition of monoclonal antibodies.

About 20.6% of the patients who were eligible for the outcome analysis were suitable for the second-line chemotherapy at progression.
