Department of Health and Human Services</p><p>Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity
(ORI) and the Assistant Secretary for Health have taken final
action in the following case:</p><p>Nagendra S. Ningaraj, PhD, Vanderbilt University School of
Medicine: Based on the reports of an investigation conducted by
Vanderbilt University School of Medicine (VUSM) and additional
analysis by the Division of Investigative Oversight (DIO), ORI, in
its oversight review, found that Nagendra S. Ningaraj, PhD, former
Associate Professor of Neurological Surgery and Cancer Biology,
VUSM, engaged in scientific misconduct by falsifying MALDI-MS
images and mass spectral tracings and associated text in Figure 21
reported in National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of
Health (NIH), grant application 1 U54 CA119421-01 and by falsifying
MALDI-MS images in a presentation during the American Association
for Cancer Research (AACR) meeting held on April 16-20, 2005, which
cited support from NCI, NIH, grants R25 CA92943 and P50
CA098131.</p><p>Specifically, ORI found that:</p><p>1. Respondent reversed the images for the control and
minoxidil-treated brains in Figure 21 of the 1 U54 CA119421-01
grant application, claiming that minoxidil increased delivery of
Gleevec to the tumor. Respondent also reversed the same images in a
presentation during the AACR meeting in April 2005.</p><p>2. In Figure 21 of the 1 U54 CA119421-01 grant application,
Respondent reported mass spectral tracings as having been obtained
from brain tumors in Gleevec-treated mice that had been pretreated
with minoxidil, while in fact they were pretreated with another
potassium channel opener, NS1619, and Respondent falsely stated the
minoxidil pretreatment caused an 8-fold increase in Gleevec
delivery to brain tumors (compared to non-minoxidil pretreated
tumors).</p><p>3. Respondent further falsified Figure 21 of the 1 U54
CA119421-01 grant application by juxtaposing the reversed MALDI-MS
images (obtained<bold><break/></bold>
with mioxidil) with the mass spectral tracings (obtained with
NS1619)<bold><break/></bold>
in the same figure and by failing to report that the images and
spectra<bold><break/></bold>
in the figure were actually obtained in totally different
experiments,<bold><break/></bold>
performed on different dates and with different K\+\ agonist<bold><break/></bold>
pretreatments.</p><p>Dr. Ningaraj has entered into a Voluntary Settlement Agreement
in which he has voluntarily agreed, for a period of three (3)
years, beginning on August 31, 2009:</p><p>(1) To be prohibited from serving in any advisory capacity to
PHS, including but not limited to service on any PHS advisory
committee, board, and/or peer review committee, or as a
consultant;</p><p>(2) That any institution that submits an application for PHS
support for a research project on which the Respondent's
participation is proposed or which uses him in any capacity on
PHS-supported research or that submits a report of PHS-funded
research on which he is involved must submit a plan for supervision
of his duties to the funding agency for approval no later than a
month before the scheduled funding; the supervisory plan must be
designed to ensure the scientific integrity of his research
contribution; a copy of the supervisory plan also must be submitted
to ORI by the institution; Respondent agrees that he will not
participate in any PHS-supported research until such a supervisory
plan is submitted to ORI; and</p><p>(3) Respondent will ensure that any institution employing him
submits, in conjunction with each application for PHS funds or any
report, manuscript, or abstract of PHS-funded research in which he
is involved, a certification that the data provided by him are
based on actual experiments or are otherwise legitimately derived
and that the data, procedures, and methodology are accurately
reported in the application or report. Respondent must ensure that
the institution send the certification to ORI. The certification
shall be submitted no later than one month before funding and
concurrently with any report, manuscript, or abstract.</p><p>Inquiries</p><p><bold>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</bold><bold><break/></bold>
