Interventricular conduction delay (IVCD) is a descriptor of interventricular electrical dyssynchrony between right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV). It is measured between pacing lead in RV and sensing lead in LV. There are studies which found direct proportional relationship between measure of IVCD and reverse remodeling [<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] or responsiveness to CRT (2).</p><p>Differences in conduction times from right ventricle to left ventricle and from left ventricle to right ventricle respectively were observed by our group during biventricular devices implantation. In this paper we show detailed description of this phenomenon and its relationship to various clinical factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The investigated group consisted of individuals who fulfilled indication criteria to CRT system implantation according to ESC Guidelines. All of them signed informed consents and agreed with CRT implantation and periprocedural pacing protocol.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Implantation procedure</title><p>As usually, right atrial (RA) bipolar lead was implanted into the appendage. Right ventricular (RV) bipolar lead was placed in RV apex or septum according to physician&#x02019;s decision. Left ventricular (LV) quadripolar (rarely bipolar) lead was implanted preferably in lateral or posterolateral position. The final decision of its placement resulted from several parameters evaluation&#x02014;acceptable R wave voltage, pacing threshold and good vein anchorage position with no phrenic nerve stimulation tested at maximum output (10 V).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Conduction measurement protocol</title><p>All measurements were done using Biotronik ICS 3000 Operation / Implant module (Biotronik GmbH &#x00026; Co.KG Berlin Germany). Conduction times were measured automatically using &#x0201c;Conduction times&#x0201d; tool integrated into the ICS 3000 Pacing System Module application.</p><p>Pacing vectors between RV and LV leads were tested and conduction times measured. We used bipolar mode only. In case of using quadripolar LV lead it meant to pace RV and to measure conduction times in LV lead&#x02014;bipolarly coupled proximal &#x00026; middle proximal, middle proximal &#x00026; middle distal and middle distal &#x00026; rings consecutively. Then LV lead was paced and conduction to RV lead measured. The following LV quadrupolar lead couples were paced consecutively: proximal &#x00026; middle proximal, middle proximal &#x00026; middle distal and middle distal &#x00026; distal ring. Thus, using a quadrupolar electrode it was possible to create 6 unique vectors compared to only two when using a bipolar electrode.</p><p><bold>Measurement protocol was divided into four parts</bold>:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To assess dependency of particular pacing rings location to interventricular conduction time all above mentioned vectors were tested.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To rule out voltage dependency of interventricular conduction times an incremental voltage test was performed. Pacing pulse width was set to 0.4 ms. Lowest pacing voltage was rounded to the closest upper whole number value over recently measured pacing threshold, then increased with 1 V steps up to 10 V. Pacing rate was set to 90 BPM to avoid intrinsic activation. Each pacing phase was long enough to reach stable interventricular conduction times.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the influence of pacing rate on interventricular conduction time duration an incremental pacing test was performed. Pacing was started at heart rate equivalent to the closest upper ten of the intrinsic heart rate and then increased in 10 BPM steps up to 140 BPM. Pacing voltage in the test was set to double value of pacing threshold. Each pacing phase was long enough to reach stable interventricular conduction times.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess interventricular conduction during natural ventricular activation the atrial lead was paced incrementally. Initial pacing rate was equal to intrinsic heart rate rounded up to the closest ten. Pacing rate was then increased by 10 BPM steps up to 140 BPM or reaching the Wenckebach point. Pacing voltage in the test was set to double value of pacing threshold. Each pacing phase was long enough to reach stable interventricular conduction times. Conduction times to both ventricular leads were measured during atrial pacing. Interventricular conduction time differences at particular pacing rates were computed.</p></list-item></list><p>An average value was computed from at least five consecutive conduction times.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Numerical data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used for categorical variables and Mann/Whitney test for continuous variables (alpha = 0.05). Statistical software used: IBM SPSS 25.0.0.1 (IBM Corporation, 2018).

Pronounced differences (often up to 35 ms) were observed in substantial part of patients with DCM, while this phenomenon was much less common in patients with CAD.</p><p>It is well known that pathologic delay between activation of RV and LV during sinus rhythm with spontaneous conduction exists in heart failure patients with interventricular conduction disturbances. It is a descriptor of interventricular electrical dyssynchrony between right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV). Several studies found direct proportional relationship between measure of IVCD and reverse remodeling [<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] or responsiveness to CRT [<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Interestingly, all these studies worked with right to left conduction times. According to our knowledge there are data neither on conduction times in the opposite direction, i.e. from LV to RV, nor on differences between both directions.</p><p>There was no notable difference in conduction time duration among any pacing vectors in concordant direction, at least at given distance between the proximal and distal rings of the LV lead. In other words, conduction times were similar throughout all the vectors in the same patient. Moreover, interventricular conduction times did not differ neither in relationship to pacing voltage nor to pacing rate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228731.g003">Fig 3</xref>). There are no existing trials to compare these results with.</p><fig id="pone.0228731.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0228731.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Examples of pacing protocol results in four selected patients.</title><p>Panel A shows interventricular conduction time differences at different pacing rates. Panel B shows interventricular conduction time differences at different pacing voltages. Particular individual values do not substantially change neither in relationship to pacing rate nor to pacing voltage.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0228731.g003"/></fig><p>As mentioned above differences in conduction times in both directions were present in 53% of DCM patients compared to only 17% of CAD patients. Moreover, the absolute values of the differences were much higher in the DCM group. The reason is unclear. We can hypothesize that the particular way of remodeling of myocardium in the particular disease play the main role in the conduction differences. Histopathologic examination of hearts from end stage of cardiomyopathy shows reactive (interstitial and perivascular) fibrosis prevailing among patients with idiopathic DCM [<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In contrast, a greater prevalence of replacement fibrosis is present in patients with CAD [<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This special distinct pattern of diffuse fibrosis in DCM suggests a more generalized dysfunction which leads to slower conduction through myocardium [<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Observation of less frequent hypertension in patients with interventricular conduction difference phenomenon is likely a collateral chance finding.</p><p>There are several approaches of interventricular conduction assessment. Several authors equal to several approaches. The main thing is that interventricular delay, in general, has been proven as it has its role in left ventricular remodeling [<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] or prediction of CRT clinical response many times [<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other studies worked with RV to LV measurements. Since the resynchronization therapy is based mainly on preexcitation of the left ventricle to obtain synchronous ventricular contraction, it can be assumed there will be a relation with LV&#x02014;RV conduction parameters or presence of some type of the difference with clinical outcome as well.</p><p>Knowledge of interventricular conduction differences might have important clinical impact. They are simple to measure with common implantation equipment during implantation procedure. In default settings a CRT device is programmed to pace LV and RV simultaneously [<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Studies of LV offset for CRT programming have been disappointing [<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this regard implication of LV-RV vs RV-LV conduction differences could lead to more consistent results. To verify this concept further investigation is needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Limitations</title><p>The group of patients is small, nevertheless this is a pilot study. The proportion of DCM and CAD was not equivalent similarly to other studies [<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0228731.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Due to small numbers it was not possible to perform any sex related comparisons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The occurrence of differences in right-to-left vs left-to-right conduction times in patients indicated to cardiac resynchronization therapy is not rare. It was observed more often in patients with DCM compared to CAD. Knowledge of this phenomenon could be useful in optimization of ventricular timing in CRT patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0228731.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sassone</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gabrieli</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sacc&#x000e0;</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Boggian</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fusco</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pratola</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>

The protocol is clear and precise while results appear hard to understand after a single reading and should be improved considering that they seem to be a long list of figures and tables description.</p><p>Moreover an important limitation of this study is the small number of enrolled patients.</p><p>At least, have you any data about response to resynchronization according to difference between inter-ventricular delay?</p><p>Regarding this topic I would like to suggest this paper regarding QRS index that can be considered a surrogate of reduced interventricular conduction delay: Magnitude of QRS duration reduction after biventricular pacing identifies responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy.</p><p>Coppola G, Ciaramitaro G, Stabile G, DOnofrio A, Palmisano P, Carit&#x000e0; P, Mascioli G, Pecora D, De Simone A, Marini M, Rapacciuolo A, Savarese G, Maglia G, Pepi P, Padeletti L, Pierantozzi A, Arena G, Giovannini T, Caico SI, Nugara C, Ajello L, Malacrida M, Corrado E.</p><p>Int J Cardiol. 2016 Oct 15;221:450-5.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The paper from Sepsi and coll. is quite interesting but it does present some methodological problems.</p><p>1. The position of the RV lead could have had an impact on results. It is not simply a matter of how many RV leads have been implanted in a group or in another, but that changing the RV lead position IN THAT patients could have lead to completely different results and this impacts negatively on the study itself</p><p>2. The definition itself of "septal RV lead" is quite generical: which part of the septum? Hissian, parahissiam, septal RVOT? Again, this could have changed everything</p><p>3. The conclusions on correction on RV-LV lead delay (or viceversa; page 17, lines 213 - 214) and results of CRT is too simplicistic. FREEDOM Trial on use of QuickOpt did not demonstrate any benefit from this approach (it is almost the same concept, because the algorhitm measure the RV-LV delay during RV pacing and LV-RV delay during LV pacing and adjusts the VV interval so that the activation front is simultaneous)</p><p>Furthermore, I do not understand (Abstract, page 8, line 30) what does that &#x0003c; 5 ms mean: could the Authors make it clearer or at least explain in the revision letter the meaning of this statement.</p><p>Finally, the whole manuscript needs a deep english language revision because some passages are unclear.</p><p>Reviewer #3: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment for patients with heart failure (HF), impaired left ventricular (LV) function, and wide QRS complex.</p><p>Pospisil et al. described the phenomenon of interventricular conduction time differences and assessed relationship to various clinical and electrophysiological parameters. In fact the differences in conduction times from right ventricle to left ventricle and from left ventricle to right ventricle respectively were observed during biventricular devices implantation when changing pacing vector direction. In this study a pronounced differences (often up to 35 ms) were observed in substantial part of patients with dilatative cardiomyopathy (DCM), while this phenomenon was much less common in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The study is very interesting, presented in an appropriate fashion and are supported by interesting data. A limitation is represented by the small sample number (62 patients) to draw conclusions although the idea from a pathophysiological point of view is acceptable. Moreover it would be interesting to point out that other studies have also previously evaluated importance of CRT (see: &#x0201c;Non-responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy: Insights from multimodality imaging and electrocardiography. A brief review&#x0201d;, Doi: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.09.037). This would certainly increase the the article's quality.</p><p>In conclusion, given the overall work, I accept manuscript with minor revision concerning a small implementation of bibliography, reporting the aforementioned work and other.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

Nevertheless, the text of the &#x0201c;Results&#x0201d; section is quite short, substantial part of information is present in figures and their captions (which are inserted in the text of the manuscript immediately following the paragraph in which the figure is first cited).</p><p>Moreover, an important limitation of this study is the small number of enrolled patients.</p><p>We agree that the number is small and we have commented it in the limitations. Nevertheless, as a pilot study it can be sufficient to draw conclusions from a pathophysiological point of view. It is clear it deserves a further study on larger set of patients.</p><p>At least, have you any data about response to resynchronization according to difference between inter-ventricular delay?</p><p>Unfortunately, not yet. We are preparing a study to evaluate the phenomenon according to QRS width and responsiveness to CRT rigorously. </p><p>Regarding this topic I would like to suggest this paper regarding QRS index that can be considered a surrogate of reduced interventricular conduction delay: Magnitude of QRS duration reduction after biventricular pacing identifies responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy.</p><p>Coppola G, Ciaramitaro G, Stabile G, DOnofrio A, Palmisano P, Carit&#x000e0; P, Mascioli G, Pecora D, De Simone A, Marini M, Rapacciuolo A, Savarese G, Maglia G, Pepi P, Padeletti L, Pierantozzi A, Arena G, Giovannini T, Caico SI, Nugara C, Ajello L, Malacrida M, Corrado E.</p><p>Int J Cardiol. 2016 Oct 15;221:450-5.</p><p>We find suggested paper very interesting regarding our topic and it has been added to the manuscript. </p><p>Response to Reviewer #2: </p><p>Dear Dr. Mascioli, </p><p>thank you for your valuable time and useful contribution.

The position of the RV lead could have had an impact on results. It is not simply a matter of how many RV leads have been implanted in a group or in another, but that changing the RV lead position IN THAT patients could have lead to completely different results and this impacts negatively on the study itself.</p><p>Of course, we considered that RV placement might have a significant impact to the interventricular conduction time and it obviously has. What we want to show is the fact that the differences of RV&#x02192;LV and LV&#x02192;RV conduction times are present regardless of RV lead placement in a given position.</p><p>2. The definition itself of "septal RV lead" is quite generical: which part of the septum? Hissian, parahissian, septal RVOT? Again, this could have changed everything. </p><p>The information on septal vs apical position is based on implanting physician&#x02019;s declaration. Unfortunately more detailed information on the lead position is not available. The aim of our manuscript is introduction of the phenomenon. Relationships to particular positions would require its study on larger group of patients.</p><p>3. The conclusions on correction on RV-LV lead delay (or viceversa; page 17, lines 213 - 214) and results of CRT is too simplicistic. FREEDOM Trial on use of QuickOpt did not demonstrate any benefit from this approach (it is almost the same concept, because the algorhitm measure the RV-LV delay during RV pacing and LV-RV delay during LV pacing and adjusts the VV interval so that the activation front is simultaneous)</p><p>The text was modified.</p><p>Furthermore, I do not understand (Abstract, page 8, line 30) what does that &#x0003c; 5 ms mean: could the Authors make it clearer or at least explain in the revision letter the meaning of this statement.</p><p>In original text, there was a mistake &#x02013; thank you: we considered interventricular conduction times difference lower than 5 milliseconds (ms) as a bidirectionally comparable conduction (because of measurement error), so. statement &#x0003c; 5 ms corrected to &#x0201c;&#x0003e;5 ms&#x0201d;.</p><p>Finally, the whole manuscript needs a deep English language revision because some passages are unclear.</p><p>A complete grammar, language and terminology check was done by scientific manuscript editing service to fit the US-English standards. We include PDF file with certification by Proof.Reading.Service.Com Ltd.</p><p>Response to Reviewer #3: </p><p>Dear reviewer,</p><p>thank you for your valuable time and useful contribution. We highly appreciate your inputs you given to improve the manuscript. We hope you will find our explanations and manuscript edits enough to your convenience.

Attached file &#x0201c;Revised Manuscript with Track Changes&#x0201d; contains marked revisions made in the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #3: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment for patients with heart failure (HF), impaired left ventricular (LV) function, and wide QRS complex.</p><p>Pospisil et al. described the phenomenon of interventricular conduction time differences and assessed relationship to various clinical and electrophysiological parameters. In fact the differences in conduction times from right ventricle to left ventricle and from left ventricle to right ventricle respectively were observed during biventricular devices implantation when changing pacing vector direction. In this study a pronounced differences (often up to 35 ms) were observed in substantial part of patients with dilatative cardiomyopathy (DCM), while this phenomenon was much less common in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The study is very interesting, presented in an appropriate fashion and are supported by interesting data. A limitation is represented by the small sample number (62 patients) to draw conclusions although the idea from a pathophysiological point of view is acceptable. </p><p>Moreover, it would be interesting to point out that other studies have also previously evaluated importance of CRT (see: &#x0201c;Non-responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy: Insights from multimodality imaging and electrocardiography. A brief review&#x0201d;, Doi: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.09.037). </p><p>This would certainly increase the article's quality. In conclusion, given the overall work, I accept manuscript with minor revision concerning a small implementation of bibliography, reporting the aforementioned work and other.</p><p>We find the suggested paper very interesting regarding our topic and it has been added to the manuscript.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0228731.s001"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0228731.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0228731.r003" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0228731.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Coppola</surname><given-names>Giuseppe</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Giuseppe Coppola</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Giuseppe Coppola</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0228731" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
