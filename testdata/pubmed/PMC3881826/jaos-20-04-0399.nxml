Periodontal Disease Classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup>. Previously, different clinical patterns of significant loss of alveolar bone and
attachment in young adults were known as early onset or juvenile periodontitis.
Aggressive periodontitis is characterized by non-contributory medical history, rapid
attachment loss and bone destruction and familial aggregation of cases. Localized
aggressive periodontitis usually present circumpubertal onset and localized first
molar/incisor presentation with interproximal attachment loss on at least two permanent
teeth, one of which is a first molar, and involving no more than two teeth other than
first molars and incisors. While generalized aggressive periodontitis presents
generalized interproximal attachment loss affecting at least three permanent teeth other
than first molars and incisors with pronounced episodic nature of the destruction of
attachment and alveolar bone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>The prevalence of localized aggressive periodontitis varies greatly; from 0.1-0.2%
reported in European populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref></sup> to 5% in Hispanic populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup>, up to 10% for African-Americans in the US. L&#x000f6;e and Brown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r09">9</xref></sup> (1991) estimated that African-American teenagers are 15 times more likely to
present aggressive periodontitis than Caucasians. However, a large variation still
exists in different African populations. Harley and Floyd<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5 </xref></sup>(1988) report a prevalence of 0.8% among Nigerian teenagers, and Arowojolu and
Nwokorie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref></sup>(1997) found a prevalence of 1.6% among 17-34 years olds in a Nigerian hospital
clinic. More recently, Albandar, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> (2002) report among 12-25-yearold who attended Ugandan schools 6.5% aggressive
periodontitis (either localized or generalized) and 22% incidental aggressive lesions.
Similarly, other ethnical groups show high prevalence of this disease; in a recent study
from Israel, aggressive periodontitis was found in 5.9% of the subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>Aggressive periodontitis (both localized and generalized) is usually diagnosed in a
young population. This is frequently the age that an orthodontic care is provided to
this population.</p><p>The first molar, usually involved in aggressive periodontitis, is also the tooth
frequently in use as an abutment for different active or passive orthodontic appliances.
Several orthodontic distalization appliances used in Class II malocclusions, such as
headgear, pendulum or distal jet, incorporated bilateral orthodontic molars bands on
upper first molars. Lip bumper, which is a lower distalization appliance, is also
anchored bilaterally to lower molar bands. Maxillary expanders, such as Haas or Hyrax
appliances, are soldered to maxillary molars bands. Uni/bilateral space maintainers,
frequently used in pediatric dentistry and orthodontics, include maxillary or mandibular
molar bands soldered to a thick orthodontic wire as can be presented by Nance appliance,
transpalatal arch and lingual arch appliances. Moreover, most of the regular orthodontic
treatment plans include a fixed orthodontic appliance attached to maxillary and
mandibular dental arch. In this appliance molar bands or tube are often attached to
first molars.</p><p>This way, it is of outmost importance to diagnose this disease as early as possible to
prevent nonreversible damage to the attachment apparatus. Furthermore, the intimate
contact of the orthodontic appliance including molar bands as well as retainers with the
gingival tissue has a detrimental effect on oral hygiene, and bacterial plaque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14 </xref></sup>thus contributing to greater gingival inflammation in these patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>a) A panoramic view of an 11-year-old boy performed prior to orthodontic

patients are commonly undergoing orthodontic treatment during this age with frequent
visits to the orthodontic clinic, it would only make sense to call upon the orthodontist
to screen for early signs of aggressive periodontitis and initiate interceptive
measures. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to draw guidelines for periodontal
evaluation and monitoring prior to and during active orthodontic treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>GUIDELINES</title><p>In order to intercept patients with aggressive periodontitis in the orthodontic clinic
as early as possible, it is recommended that periodontal examination be performed prior,
during and following orthodontic treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="f02">Figure

different periodontal conditions during the orthodontic treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="f03">Figure 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Guidelines for periodontal follow-up during orthodontic care in adolescents and

adequate oral hygiene measurements. In patients who do not comply with the required oral
hygiene, active orthodontic treatment should be postponed until satisfactory plaque
control is achieved. The patient should be informed that non-adherence to the oral
hygiene protocol will result in discontinuation of the orthodontic treatment.</p><p>As a routine, prior to commencement of the orthodontic treatment, clinical and
radiographic periodontal assessment should be performed. Clinical examination should
include full-mouth probing using a standard periodontal probe, tooth mobility assessment
and gingival recession. Radiographic evaluation should include vertical bitewing
radiographs for the molar and premolar area combined with parallel periapical
radiographs of the incisors (maxillary and mandibular). In subjects where pathologic
periodontal pockets are observed or bone loss is detected in the radiographs, the
patient should be referred for a periodontal consultation and interceptive/corrective
therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>DURING ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT</title><p>Oral hygiene instruction and motivation should be performed after placement of the
orthodontic appliances. During every visit, it is important to make sure that adequate
plaque control is performed by the patient. The orthodontic appliances usually have a
negative effect on oral hygiene performance thus, careful assessment and adjustment of
the oral hygiene tools are necessary. Non-adherence to the oral hygiene protocols
requires at least a temporary halt of the orthodontic treatment until significant
improvement is evident. Periodontal recall appointments once every 3 months are advised
for the period of active orthodontic treatment. This should be performed in a separate
dedicated visit.</p><p>During orthodontic treatment, clinical periodontal evaluation (including periodontal
probing) should be performed every 6 months. A finding of pathological pocket will
require further radiographic evaluation and referral to a periodontist. Removal of the
orthodontic appliance should be considered to improve periodontal outcome. After the
resolution of the periodontal disease the orthodontic treatment may resume. Nonetheless,
in the cases where periodontal flare-up had occurred, special care and follow-up is
warranted in order to avoid recurrent periodontal disease. Radiographic examination
should be performed at least once a year during the orthodontic treatment. It should
include vertical bitewing radiographs for the molar and premolar area combined with
parallel periapical radiographs of the incisors (maxillary and mandibular). Radiographic
evaluation could also serve for caries detection and root resorption evaluation during
treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>FOLLOWING ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT COMPLETION</title><p>The scheduled follow-up appointments after the completion of the orthodontic treatment
might also serve as an opportunity for early detection of aggressive periodontitis in
adolescence and young adults. Again, it is advised to perform quick clinical periodontal
evaluation as a part of the follow-up and to combine radiographic examination once a
year (vertical bitewing radiographs for the molar and premolar area combined with
parallel periapical radiographs of the incisors). It should be kept in mind that
orthodontic retainers, both removable and fixed, are potentially plaque retentive
devices and as such have potential risk for periodontal breakdown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref></sup>. </p></sec><sec><title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for successful long-term prognosis in
patients with aggressive periodontitis. The role of the orthodontist in diagnosis and
referral to periodontal treatment is crucial since most orthodontic patients are
adolescents in which aggressive periodontitis mostly affects.</p><p>Many patients undergoing orthodontic treatment believe that their regular and frequent
visits to the orthodontic office are sufficient to monitor their dental and periodontal
needs. Orthodontists should be aware of this notion, which makes the fulfillment to the
above guidelines of even greater importance.</p><p>Strict adherence of these guidelines as a routine protocol for periodontal examination
prior, during and following orthodontic treatment may dramatically decrease the severity
and improve the prognosis of aggressive periodontitis in orthodontic based clinic.</p><p>Finally, this protocol might aid the orthodontist avoiding ethical and even legal issues
regarding periodontal disease detection and treatment in their patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>No funding was received for this study, and the authors report no conflicts of
