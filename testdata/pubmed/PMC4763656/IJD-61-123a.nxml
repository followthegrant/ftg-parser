There was no history of photosensitivity, drug intake, or any topical application over the lips. She denied habits such as lip licking, picking of scales, and lip biting. Examination revealed multiple fissures and hemorrhagic crusts involving the lower lip [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Palpation of the lip did not reveal any nodular lesions. A diagnosis of actinic cheilitis was considered and was prescribed zinc cream and emollients. However, 1 week later, she presented with much pronounced hemorrhagic crusting [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. After a brief period of occlusion of the lip with liquid paraffin soaked gauze, the crusts were removed, leaving a bitten off appearance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. Examination of hair and mucous membranes were normal. Systemic examination did not reveal any abnormality.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Fissures and mild crusting involving the lower lip</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJD-61-123a-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Striking hemorrhagic crusting giving a &#x0201c;stuck on&#x0201d; appearance</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJD-61-123a-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Removed crusts and bitten off appearance of lower lip</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJD-61-123a-g003"/></fig><p>Routine hematological and biochemical investigations were within normal limits. Histopathological examination of the punch biopsy specimen revealed features suggestive of chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. There was no granuloma, dysplasia or mucous glandular distension. A diagnosis of factitious cheilitis (FC) was suspected, and psychiatry opinion was sought.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and inflammatory dermal infiltrate (H and E, &#x000d7;10)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJD-61-123a-g004"/></fig><p>In the psychiatric evaluation, she revealed that her parents were overprotective and giving more care and attention to her younger sister only. She encountered frequent relationship issues with her parents and sibling, which led to a frequent flare-up of lesions ranging from minor fissuring and erosion to frank bleeding and crusting; however, she consistently denied self-infliction. Despite her past proficient scholastic performance, she had dropped out from school for 7 months citing her illness. The psychological assessment revealed borderline personality traits, impulsivity, poor frustration tolerance, and above average intelligence scores.</p><p>A diagnosis of FC was entertained and managed with supportive psychotherapy, parental counseling, and manipulation of environment like rejoining of school. Fluoxetine was prescribed to reduce impulsivity alongside topical emollient and occlusion of the lip to prevent lip biting activity. In due course, the lesions regressed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>].</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Regressed lesions with impression of chronic lip biting</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJD-61-123a-g005"/></fig><p>FC has been described as dryness, scaling, and fissuring of the lips resulting from mannerisms like biting or frequent licking. FC should be considered in patients presenting with unusual hemorrhagic crusting of the lips in the absence of an appreciable cause and when deliberate manipulation of the lips is suspected.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The crusting in FC could be very thick, formed from layers of hemorrhagic exudates giving the appearance of coagulated blood or serum over the lips.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In this present case, initially, there was minimal serous and hemorrhagic crusting, however, later presented with striking hemorrhagic crusting giving a &#x0201c;stuck on&#x0201d; appearance.</p><p>The psychogenic cause for FC was proposed by Brocq in 1921.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In factitious dermatitis, patients deliberately self-inflict lesions on themselves to fulfill their unconscious motive to seek attention and emotional care from their family.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Schaffer <italic>et al</italic>. pointed out an underlying borderline personality disorder and a precipitating psychosocial stressor in such patients.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Borderline personality disorder is characterized by emotional instability, unstable interpersonal relationships, poor self-identity, and frequent deliberate self-harm.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In this case, the intention of the patient is to divert her parents attention toward her, competing with her sister.</p><p>Having a hunch regarding the chances of intentional self-harm is important because these patients refuse their involvement in the production of lesions.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Multiple diagnostic tests are often nonspecific. Diagnosis is generally confirmed by demonstrating the skin lesions to resolve under occlusion,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] so was the scenario in the present case.</p><p>The differential diagnoses of crusted lip lesions include candida cheilitis, actinic cheilitis, exfoliative cheilitis, cheilitis glandularis, granulomatous cheilitis, contact dermatitis, and photosensitivity.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The terms exfoliative cheilitis and FC are used synonymously at times. Aydin <italic>et al</italic>. alluded that exfoliative cheilitis is a disorder in which lesion are produced impulsively or compulsively without any attention seeking behavior, unlike FC and emphasized on distinguishing these two conditions, which bears significance in the context of treatment.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Treatment should be centered on supportive and empathetic approach. There is no standard treatment for the factitious disorder, other than targeting treatable comorbid psychiatric disorders. The presence of mood or anxiety bodes for a better prognosis, whereas an underlying personality disorder for a poorer prognosis.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Occlusive dressings and emollients will help in reducing the destructive self-inflicting acts on the skin. FC is an uncommon presentation among the factitious dermatoses. A high index of suspicion and awareness about the condition might aid in early diagnosis and appropriate management.</p><sec disp-level="2" id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Declaration of patient consent</title><p>The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.
