The same protein often participates in different complexes to exhibit diverse functionality. Current ensemble approaches of identifying cellular protein interactions cannot reveal physiological permutations of these interactions. Here, we describe a single molecule pull-down (SiMPull) assay that combines the principles of conventional pull-down assay with single molecule fluorescence microscopy and enables direct visualization of individual cellular protein complexes. SiMPull can reveal how many proteins and of which kinds are present in the in vivo complex, as we show using protein kinase A. We then demonstrate a wide applicability to various signaling proteins found in cytosol, membrane, and cellular organelles, and to endogenous protein complexes from animal tissue extracts. The pulled down proteins are functional and are used, without further processing, for single molecule biochemical studies. SiMPull should provide a rapid, sensitive and robust platform for analyzing protein assemblies in biological pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Dynamic interactions between proteins guide almost every aspect of cellular function<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.

Individual proteins are also part of diverse sets of protein networks, making it very challenging to tease apart various permutations of protein-protein interactions occurring in the cellular context<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Currently, the gold standard for determining interactions between proteins is the co-immunoprecipitation assay<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> which relies on affinity-based co-purification of interacting proteins, followed by identification via Western blot (WB) or mass spectrometry. It is however difficult to determine how many copies of which proteins are present in the physiological complex using the conventional immunoprecipitation. In addition, many hours and multiple steps that often exist between sample preparation and measurements present uncertainties over the extent to which in vivo interactions are preserved prior to analysis.</p><p id="P3">In situ imaging methods based on resonance energy transfer<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, two-hybrid methods<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> are other popular tools for studying pair-wise protein interactions. However, these methods cannot be applied to endogenous proteins and are, in general, blind to heterogeneous interactions between proteins and their stoichiometry.</p><p id="P4">Here we present a simple, direct and sensitive method to study cellular protein complexes with single complex resolution. We call this method single molecule pull-down or SiMPull because physiological macromolecular complexes are pulled down from cell or tissue extracts directly to the imaging surface of single molecule fluorescence microscopy.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Experimental strategy and YFP pull-down</title><p id="P5">The key requirement for pull-down assays is the selective capture of a protein of interest (bait), which will bring along its binding partners (prey). We constructed a flow chamber using a microscope slide and a cover slip, passivated with mPEG (methoxy polyethylene glycol)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> to prevent non-specific adsorption of cell extracts and antibodies, which should minimize false positives<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The imaging surface was also doped with biotinylated PEG and streptavidin, followed by biotinylated antibodies against the bait protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). When cell extracts are infused in the flow chamber, the surface tethered antibody captures the bait protein together with any interacting partners. After washing away the unbound cell extract, co-immunoprecipitated prey proteins are visualized either through immunofluorescence labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) or using genetically encoded fluorescent protein tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This approach is extendable to multi-protein complexes via multi-color labeling and has the potential to differentiate between multiple sub-complexes and configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). When proteins are fluorescently labeled with a fixed ratio, photobleaching events yield stoichiometric information<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We first validated the SiMPull assay for specific pull-down of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) from cell extracts. When the crude lysate from cells over-expressing (His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged YFP was infused into the flow chamber coated with anti-His antibody, we observed single YFP molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, f</xref>), similar to the analysis performed using purified protein<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Binding of YFP to the antibody was stable over two hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The blank slide surface showed ~30 fluorescent spots per imaging area, 2,500 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>, possibly due to surface impurities. The number of fluorescent spots per imaging area, <italic>N</italic><sub>f</sub>, due to specifically pulled down proteins was 10&#x02013;20 fold over the background; we could maintain &#x0003e; 10 fold signal to noise ratio by controlling the lysate dilution factor. Control experiments with YFP lysate on non-specific antibody and lysate without YFP expression showed the same <italic>N</italic><sub>f</sub> as blank.

PKA is a ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase that acts downstream of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. In the inactive state, PKA is a tetrameric complex consisting of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits. In the presence of cAMP, the complex dissociates, thereby activating the enzyme. We prepared C-HA-YFP and R-Flag-mCherry constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P9">When only C-HA-YFP was expressed in HEK293 cells, we could specifically pull-down the protein from the cell lysate using surface immobilized antibodies against HA- or YFP-epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). As expected, these samples did not show any detectable fluorescence above background in the mCherry detection channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P10">When the two subunits, R and C, were co-expressed, WB showed that R and C coimmunoprecipitate<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and they dissociate when cAMP is added to the lysate, confirming that the modified constructs retain the known properties of PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In a similar fashion, when we pulled down R-Flag-mCherry with anti-Flag antibody, we could detect both YFP and mCherry fluorescence spots. The number of fluorescent spots in mCherry and YFP channels was similar, indicating, on average, a one-to-one association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>). 57% of YFP spots colocalized with a corresponding mCherry, as shown by individual images and their overlay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Incomplete colocalization may arise from basal tonic activation of PKA, inactive chromophores<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> or unbalanced expression of two proteins in individual cells. Adding cAMP analog to the flow channel or pre-incubating the lysate with cAMP resulted in a greatly reduced number of C subunit (YFP spots) without a significant change in R subunit (mCherry spots) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, e</xref>). After the reaction, only 4% of remaining YFP molecules colocalized with a corresponding mCherry.</p><p id="P11">Intracellular levels of cAMP can be increased by stimulating GPCRs for activation of adenylyl cyclases. When the cells over-expressing the PKA complex were stimulated with forskolin, an agonist for adenylyl cyclase for cAMP production, the amount of active PKA in cells increased as seen via dissociation of PKA in WB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Similarly, in our SiMPull assay, the number of C subunit (YFP molecules) pulled down through R subunit decreased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We explored the stoichiometry of PKA via photobleaching analysis. When C-HA-YFP was expressed alone and pulled down using HA-antibody, 91% of YFP traces exhibited one-step photobleaching indicating a monomeric population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). When C-HA-YFP and R-Flag-mCherry were co-expressed and pulled down using anti-Flag antibody, 47% of YFP traces displayed two photobleaching steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>) while 51% molecules bleached in one step. Assuming a 75% active fraction of YFP<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, this is consistent with the known stoichiometry of two catalytic subunits in each PKA.

SiMPull should be able to detect individual complexes if membrane patches containing one complex can be isolated. As a test, we applied SiMPull on &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR), a prototypical GPCR. HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-YFP-&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR and membrane proteins were solubilized. We could specifically pull-down the receptor using antibodies against YFP or Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;c</xref>). 29% of the traces displayed two distinct bleaching steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>), indicating a ~51% dimer population, assuming 75% of active fluorophores. Less than 3% of the traces showed 3 or more photobleaching steps. Our observation of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR homo-dimerization is consistent with previous studies<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. To test if &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR may form heterooligomers with &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, we co-expressed mCherry-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR and YFP-&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR. Using antibody against mCherry-&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>AR, we could pull-down YFP-&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>AR and vice versa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9b&#x02013;e</xref>). The two fluorophores colocalized with ~42% overlap, consistent with heterooligomer formation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mitochondrial protein pull-down</title><p id="P15">MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein involved in innate immune response<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. When isolated mitochondrial fraction from cells over-expressing YFP-MAVS<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> was applied to a surface with anti-YFP, we observed bright fluorescent structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, left), indicating the presence of multiple YFP molecules. Upon pre-solubilizing the mitochondrial preparation using mild detergent, we observed isolated single YFP spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, center), 86% of which displayed single photobleaching steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), supporting monomeric state of solubilized MAVS. This observation suggests that the bright fluorescent structures observed in unsolubilized preparations are due to immunoprecipitated mitochondrial membrane patches or whole mitochondria. It may be possible to specifically immobilize cellular organelles or their components using antibodies against suitable marker proteins and perform single molecule measurements in a physiologically relevant context.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Immunofluorescence detection of single complexes</title><p id="P16">We extended the assay to detection via antibodies using mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as a model system. mTORC1 is a key signaling complex that regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrient availability to the cells<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.

We expressed Flag-mTOR and HA-Raptor in HEK293 cells. Flag-mTOR was pulled down using biotinylated Flag-antibody; Raptor was detected using HA-antibody followed by fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). When both Flag-mTOR and HA-Raptor were co-expressed, we observed the detection antibody binding as fluorescent spots whereas background level of fluorescence was detected when only one of the two proteins was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h, i</xref>), demonstrating antibody-based detection in SiMPull.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Pull-down of endogenous complexes in native tissues</title><p id="P17">Exogenous expression may lead to non-physiological associations between proteins. Pull-down of endogenously expressed proteins, though desirable, is challenging due to low abundance, high background interaction with other cellular proteins, and general lack of high affinity antibodies. We tested if SiMPull can be used to detect interactions between endogenous proteins. A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) bind to PKA and confine it to discrete locations in the cell<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k</xref> shows AKAP150 can be co-immunoprecipitated with PKA from mouse brain extract.</p><p id="P18">Primary antibodies against proteins are often expensive and difficult to label with biotin or fluorophores. Thus, to keep our approach general, we used biotin labeled secondary antibody to immobilize the antibody against the bait (PKA), and applied mouse brain extract.

SiMPull required a 20-fold lower sample volume as compared to the corresponding WB.

We tested if SiMPull can be used for functional analysis of pulled down proteins. PcrA, a superfamily 1 helicase, is an ATP driven motor protein that binds and translocates on single stranded DNA (ssDNA)<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. (His)<sub>6</sub>-tagged PcrA was pulled down from bacterial lysate using anti-His antibody and fluorescently labeled DNA molecules were added to the flow channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Fluorescent spots due to labeled DNA binding appeared in the flow channel with pulled down PcrA, while the control channel showed minimal DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b, c</xref>).</p><p id="P20">When PcrA binds to a partial duplex DNA with a 5&#x02019; overhang, it anchors itself to the junction and repetitively reels-in the ssDNA<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. By labeling the DNA with a donor at the tail end and an acceptor at the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), we could observe the reeling-in activity as a gradual increase in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Once PcrA reaches the end of ssDNA, it runs off the ssDNA track and repeats the process from the junction over and over, resulting in cyclic increases and decreases in FRET. 86% (161 of 188) of bound FRET-labeled DNA molecules exhibited repetitive cycling. On increasing the ATP concentration, translocation became faster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12a</xref>), and in the absence of ATP, DNA remained bound but no reeling-in activity was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12b</xref>). The mean translocation time matched well with the data obtained with purified protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e, f</xref>).

Prism type total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope was used to acquire the single molecule data<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Samples with fluorescent protein tag were serially diluted to obtain well-isolated spots on the surface upon 20 min of incubation over immobilized antibody surface. All dilutions were made immediately before addition to the flow chamber in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl buffer with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs), unless specified. Unbound antibodies and sample were removed from the channel by washing with buffer twice between successive additions. For immunofluorescence detection, immunoprecipitated complexes were incubated with a different antibody against prey protein (~10 nM) for 20 min and fluorescent-dye-labeled secondary antibody (2&#x02013;5 nM) for 5 min before imaging.

YFP was excited at 488 nm; mCherry was excited at 532 or 568 nm. Narrow band-pass filters were used to avoid cross-talk between channels (HQ 535/30 from Chroma Technology for YFP and BL 607/36 from Semrock Inc. for mCherry). All experiments were performed at room temperature (22 &#x02013; 25 &#x000b0;C) unless specified. Single molecule analysis was performed as described earlier<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Mean spot count per image (imaging area 2500 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>) and standard deviation were calculated from images taken from 20 or more different regions.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Photobleaching analysis</title><p id="P27">Single molecule fluorescence time traces of surface immobilized YFP-tagged proteins were manually scored for the number of bleaching steps<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. To avoid false colocalization, samples were immobilized at an optimal surface density (~300 molecules in 2500 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> imaging area). The number of photobleaching steps (single frame intensity drops of equal size) in each trace was manually determined, following published procedures<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Fluorescence trace of each molecule was classified as having 1&#x02013;4 bleaching steps or was discarded if no clean bleaching steps could be identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Some fluorescent protein molecules exhibited blinking but under most circumstances, distinct fluorescence intensity levels could still be readily determined in spite of blinking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a, b</xref>). Separate counts were maintained for each case. At least 500 molecules were analyzed for each sample. The probability of missed bleaching events, due to simultaneous bleaching of both FPs within the same imaging window is ~5%. The population distribution of observed bleaching events and discarded traces is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. For future extensions to complexes with many more copies of the same protein, automated algorithms for scoring photobleaching steps would be required<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Single molecule co-localization</title><p id="P28">Co-localization between YFP and mCherry was performed using a method similar to Ulbrich et al.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Briefly, we took two separate movies of the same region using YFP and mCherry excitation. The fluorescent spots in both images were fit with Gaussian profiles to determine the center positions of molecules to half-pixel accuracy. Next, for each molecule in YFP image, we determined the mCherry molecules with center within 2 pixel (~300 nm) distance. The number of molecules where this co-localization occurred divided by the total number of YFP molecules was presented as overlap %.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>YFP constructs and pull-down</title><p id="P29">As YFP has been shown to dimerize, monomeric YFP was generated through site directed mutagenesis of alanine 207 to lysine using pEYFP-C1 as DNA template (Clontech).
