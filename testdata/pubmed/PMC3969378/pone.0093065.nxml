Following this paradigm, we present a novel methodology for indirectly investigating possible quantum effects in biological systems by applied static and alternating magnetic fields that induce changes in magnetically sensitive free radical pairs in biochemical reactions.

This work aims to elucidate biological responses that are sensitive to radio frequency (RF) magnetic fields involving the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), of which are born presumably from spin-correlated free radical pairs.</p><p>In many biological processes, the reactivity of molecular oxygen and the formation of oxygen radical intermediates are a consequence of oxidative respiration <xref rid="pone.0093065-Massey1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093065-Buetler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Most organisms have developed protective enzyme systems that mediate ROS products. One of the first steps in ROS production is the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) that results in the formation of superoxide (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>). Superoxide is often a precursor for other ROS species such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), lipid and hydroxyl radicals (<sup>&#x02022;</sup>OH) <xref rid="pone.0093065-Dikalov1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, where over-production of O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> often leads to oxidative stress. However, under normal physiological conditions, the role of O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> is beginning to emerge as an important signaling molecule that controls specific biochemical reactions and metabolic pathways <xref rid="pone.0093065-Buetler1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The central tenet of this paradigm is that many cellular processes are capable of producing O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>, whereas most H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation is formed exclusively from a O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> precursor. The link between O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> consumption and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production can involve a reduced flavin enzyme that transfers an electron to activate molecular oxygen into O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>, which is then either released or enzymatically converted into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0093065-Massey1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093065-Chaiyen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In principle, this reaction could include a magnetically sensitive spin-correlated radical pair between a flavin semiquinone (FADH<sup>&#x02022;</sup>) and O<sub>2</sub>

The spin-correlated radical-pair mechanism (SCRPM) offers the most plausible explanation on how magnetic fields might influence biochemical reactions <xref rid="pone.0093065-Okano1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093065-Engstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093065-Grissom1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

More recently, SCRPM is speculated to play a role in magnetoreception, which includes bird <xref rid="pone.0093065-Ritz2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and fruit fly navigation <xref rid="pone.0093065-Gegear1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzymes <xref rid="pone.0093065-Grissom1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and ATP production <xref rid="pone.0093065-Buchachenko1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In one form or another, magnetoreceptors are thought to be present in organisms ranging from magnetotactic and photosynthetic bacteria to insects, birds, and mammals, albeit the detailed activated biochemical pathways have yet to be proven experimentally and remain to be fully understood <xref rid="pone.0093065-Johnsen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>With the exception of the cryptochrome photo-induced radical pair as a possible magnetoreceptor in bird sensing, the prevalence of magnetic field effects under physiological conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> has been questioned <xref rid="pone.0093065-Hore1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Moreover, attempted reproducibility experiments dispute published results for the magnetic field effects in ATP production and B<sub>12</sub> enzymes <xref rid="pone.0093065-Crotty1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093065-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. With this caveat in mind, we propose that the widespread presence of free-radical production in cellular metabolism may be influenced to some extent by magnetic fields <italic>via</italic> the SCRPM. In particular, the formation of spin-correlated radical pair states between enzyme FADH<sup>&#x02022;</sup> and O<sub>2</sub>

We hypothesize that RF magnetic fields can influence the spin dynamics in free-radical pairs during cellular metabolism, and thereby determine O<sub>2</sub>

More specifically, the cells were exposed to a controlled 45 &#x003bc;T static magnetic field (SMF) (similar to naturally occurring environmental fields) or a SMF combined with perpendicularly-applied weak RF magnetic fields of 10 &#x003bc;T<sub>RMS</sub> at 7 MHz. Hereinafter, we will refer to the control group as SMF and the exposed 7 MHz group as RF. To elucidate the link between O<sub>2</sub>

Based on theoretical grounds, the Oxford Group summarized the various proposed reaction schemes and they expressed doubt about the applicability of different variants of this model in the context of cryptochrome signaling. For the oxidation of FADH<sub>2</sub> by O<sub>2</sub> reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093065-g001">fig. 1B</xref> in Ref. <xref rid="pone.0093065-Hogben1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>), the authors claim that the reaction is magnetically sensitive in principle, but remain skeptical about the formation of sufficient spin correlation. As a point of departure, we thought that it would be insightful to use this spin biochemistry to develop a better understanding of the general effects of magnetic fields in experimental physical biology. The plan, therefore, was to use cellular assays to demonstrate that metabolic pathways involved in the production of O<sub>2</sub>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093065-g001">Figure 1</xref> proposes a general reaction scheme that includes the spin biochemistry of an enzyme-bound reduced flavin (FADH<sub>2</sub>) and O<sub>2</sub>. A single electron is transferred from FADH<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>2</sub> and produces a FADH<sup>&#x02022;</sup> and O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> spin-correlated free radical geminate pair in the triplet state. The 7 MHz (10 &#x003bc;T<sub>rms</sub>) RF magnetic field decouples the flavin hyperfine interactions during spin coherence and thus mediates the interconversion between singlet and triplet states. Electron nuclear double resonance was recently performed on a series of flavin enzymes, and the flavin couplings were found to have anisotropic hyperfine couplings with a bandwidth range of 7&#x02013;35 MHz <xref rid="pone.0093065-Schleicher1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Here, we suggest that spin pairs with the hyperfine resonance frequency of 7 MHz shift the equilibrium of spin pairs into a singlet state, conserving probability and resulting in an increase of singlet products (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) at the expense of triplet products (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>). In the triplet state, O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> is released from the enzyme &#x0201c;caged&#x0201d; radical pair and can then react with cyclic hydroxylamine spin probes, which is measured by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The singlet state forms a chemical bond that leads to the formation of flavin C(4a)-hydroperoxide. The addition of a proton forms neutral hydroperoxide and results in the release of hydrogen peroxide, where it is measured by Amplex Red Ultra fluorescence.</p><p>The sufficiency for the use of a single oscillating frequency of 7 MHz at the low end of the flavin broadband hyperfine coupling range (7&#x02013;35 MHz) relies on the premise that one of the spin pairs (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>) is devoid of hyperfine interactions, and thus, the overall hyperfine interaction should be decreased <xref rid="pone.0093065-Solovyov1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093065-Cintolesi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The putative reduction in hyperfine coupling is greatly dependent on the local environment or range of environments adopted by the spin radical pair, as expected in complex cellular systems. In the context of an applied system, Ritz <italic>et al.</italic> used broadband RF and a single 7 MHz frequency to demonstrate Zeeman (1.3 MHz at 45 &#x003bc;T) and presumably hyperfine (7 MHz) resonance effects, respectively, for an avian magnetic compass <xref rid="pone.0093065-Ritz1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093065-Ritz3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In our work, the goal was to separate Zeeman (1.3 MHz at 45 &#x003bc;T SMF) from hyperfine coupling (7&#x02013;35 MHz) resonances and attempt to exclusively probe hyperfine coupling energies. Following previously reported literature values for the experimental parameters, the static magnetic field, oscillating frequency, and amplitude were specifically chosen to ensure the most probable success for eliciting a magnetic field response. Many biological molecules exhibit hyperfine splitting constants that range from 0.1&#x02013;35 MHz <xref rid="pone.0093065-Schleicher1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093065-Ritz3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and therefore, we propose that 7 MHz frequency most likely influence cellular chemical reactions that involve biomolecules with hyperfine couplings of equal energies <xref rid="pone.0093065-Schleicher1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0093065-Cintolesi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. To fully separate the contributions from Zeeman and hyperfine couplings, the magnetic field, frequency, and intensity dependence needs to be evaluated, of which is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>To describe the disruption of ROS homeostasis that results in product distribution changes by RF magnetic fields, we employ novel methods that are innovative extensions and applications of product yield-detected magnetic resonance (PYDMR) <xref rid="pone.0093065-Okazaki1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. A reasonable explanation for the observed results is as follows: (1) the reduced flavin and molecular oxygen form an intermediate spin-correlated free radical pair FADH<sup>&#x02022;</sup>/O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>; (2) the hyperfine transitions of the radical pair modulate spin correlation between them; (3) the intersystem crossing rate between singlet and triplets states of the free radicals is influenced by the magnetic field modulation of the spin correlation; (4) the measured ROS product yields are relatively different because of changes in the singlet and triplet probabilities; hence ROS equilibrium in the cells is fundamentally altered by the experimental oscillating magnetic fields under appropriate conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0093065-g002">Figure 2</xref> illustrates a simple diagram of RF resonance transitions that can modify product yields for the associated triplet (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup>) and singlet (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) states. It is worth pointing out that the radical pair initial states can be determined by changes in the relative product yield of unperturbed samples (SMF case). If the initial state of the radical pair is in the triplet state, then the triplet products should decrease and the singlet products will increase, <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p><fig id="pone-0093065-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0093065.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>A schematic illustration demonstrates the singlet-triplet transitions that affect the kinetics of the effective intersystem crossing rate (k<sub>ISC</sub>) in the radical pair.</title><p>The sinusoid lines represent RF-induced transitions, which influence the effective intersystem crossing rate.

Potentially other spin biochemical process might be present in cellular metabolism because the SCRPM does not depend upon any specific chemical identity of the radicals <xref rid="pone.0093065-Mclauchlan1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> acts as a precursor for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, and the RF magnetic fields enhance superoxide consumption, which leads to the observed increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. However, difficulty arises in the interpretation of the effects of Paraquat and DPI on the NADPH oxidase ROS pathway in conjunction with applied RF magnetic fields. We observed a slight correlation with Paraquat reduction in O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>&#x02022;&#x02212;</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> trends; however, we expect a significant increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with RF and DPI. In other words, there are no statistically-significant changes in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production with the addition of Paraquat, DPI, and the applied RF magnetic fields that can be related to a spin-pair mechanism. In light of these observations, we cannot rule out RF effects on NADPH oxidase activity, but the results indicate that no spin-pair biochemistry effects in NADPH oxidases can be attributed to the inhibitors.</p><p>We speculate that the flavoenzymes, including oxidases and monooxidases, are the oxidative metabolic enzymes that are most likely influenced by spin biochemistry and RF exposure at the experimental static magnetic field, amplitude, and frequency.

Another interpretation of the overall results can be explained by RF effects from another ROS source, such as mitochondria, that serves as magnetoreceptors to produce ROS <italic>via</italic> SCPRM.

The results presented here demonstrate a link between superoxide consumption and hydrogen peroxide production that was mediated by RF magnetic fields, which was delineated in the context of the SCRPM. The ROS product distribution is thought to occur by decoupling hyperfine energies that modulate singlet-triplet states and thus determine reaction-product yields. A secondary effect of increased hydrogen peroxide production is believed to create oxidative stress on the cells that resulted in an increase in cell proliferation. Because of the indirect measurement of spin effects in metabolism, we cannot rule out other possible mechanisms for magnetic field effects in ROS production and cell proliferation.</p><p>With the near ubiquity of radiated non-ionizing magnetic energy present in the environment, understanding the non-thermal effects from broadband RF exposure on oxidative metabolism would be clearly beneficial and is important from a public-safety standpoint <xref rid="pone.0093065-Safety1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0093065-Greenebaum1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. In contrast to the spin-pair mechanism, specific absorbed radiation (SAR) measurements of macroscopic tissue heating represent a naive approach to bio-magnetic RF-interactions because it ignores nanoscale physics and spin chemistry, which can potentially have profound biological effects. In addition to safety concerns or potential benefits, new areas of technological development in medical and electronic interfacing with biological systems could be pursued by identifying, understanding, and monitoring metabolic processes that are influenced by RF magnetic fields. More generally, a deeper understanding of spin biochemical processes is possible by elucidating magnetic fields effects in biology and by implementing spin radical pair mechanism principles in broader areas of experimental design. The methodology presented here formulates one route that can address the connection between the atomic level and cellular level, where cellular magnetic field responses transcend the quantum/classical interface.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>RJU would like to thank Sandra and Gareth Eaton at the University of Denver for use of one of their X-band EPR spectrometers.
