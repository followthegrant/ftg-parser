Levels of engagement exist on spectrums, varying from patient partners being informed about decisions or patients providing feedback as advisers to collaboration or shared leadership with researchers.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref> In recent decades, this engagement has been widely supported as a means to enhance the relevance of research, with the ultimate aim of supporting translation of research into improved health outcomes and services.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6 10&#x02013;12</xref></p><p>Without building genuine, reciprocal relationships, engagement between patient partners and researchers is at risk of tokenism (ie, superficial efforts, in order to give a mere appearance of inclusion) and, ultimately, failure to realise potential.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Genuine, reciprocal relationships are characterised by the presence of a sense of trust, full disclosure, mutual benefit and respect, and understanding of each other&#x02019;s needs, capacities and goals.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3 13</xref> Several accounts indicate that patient partners experience benefits and risks in the process of relationship building with researchers.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3 4 14&#x02013;20</xref> In a qualitative study of 64 patient partners, Cotterell <italic>et al</italic> found that interactions with professionals (including researchers) could be distressing for patient partners in instances when scientific knowledge that had negative implications for the prognosis of their disease was shared.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Schipper <italic>et al</italic> also reported that while a patient partner experienced feelings of fear, tension and uncertainty in relationship&#x000a0;building with researchers, the patient partner also valued having an increased sense of equality in her relationships with researchers.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Little research, however, has systematically examined benefits and risks encountered in relationships between patient partners and researchers, from patients&#x02019; perspectives.</p><p>We apply a relational ethics lens in order to stress moral significance in the relationships that patient partners and researchers experience as they engage.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;25</xref>&#x000a0;From this particular relational ethics lens, an aspect of acting ethically demands attentiveness and responsiveness to benefits and risks that can be experienced in our relationships with each other. It requires careful consideration for the quality of our contact with each other, and asks for fitting responses to everyday ethical questions, such as &#x02018;Is that the way I should treat someone else? Is that the way someone else should treat me?&#x02019; Relational ethics stems from a dissatisfaction with traditional bioethics principles (ie, autonomy, beneficence, maleficence, justice) that appear distanced or disinterested in the ordinary, everyday ethical issues encountered in healthcare practice.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x000a0;While drawing on these traditional principles, the relational ethics lens broadly expands in scope to direct attention to the contextual details of personal experience or situations within which these ethical principles are exercised in real life. It has been used previously to bring attention to ethically important moments experienced within relational contexts involving researchers and patients in healthcare and health research practices.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> It also highlights key ethical aspects in relationships (eg, respect, embodiment and interdependency), which are of particular relevance in the context of patient partner&#x02013;researcher relationships.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref>&#x000a0;Respect can underscore issues of power and vulnerability. In the context of a patient partner&#x02013;researcher relationship, respect may involve safeguarding confidential information revealed to each other during meetings.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 16</xref>&#x000a0;Embodiment can highlight the role that emotions play in the process of relationship building. For example, embodiment may highlight expectations among members of a research team that only patient partners should share their personal history and subjective feelings in the research process, while researchers are expected to remain objective.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Interdependency can recognise that each individual is situated within a community, connected with other individuals and institutions that influence their choices. It may highlight, for example, patient partners&#x02019; concerns that having relationships with researchers who are also their clinicians may lead to other patients assuming they receive preferential care.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x000a0;Drawing on these aspects of the relational ethics lens, this study aimed to examine benefits and risks in patient partner&#x02013;researcher relationships, based on patient partners&#x02019; experiences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>The study was initiated, codesigned and coconducted by patient partners (SK, LG, AMH, WL), who are members of Arthritis Research Canada&#x02019;s Arthritis Patient Advisory Board, and researchers and trainees at the research centre (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Founded by Arthritis Research Canada in 2001, the Arthritis Patient Advisory Board has over a decade&#x000a0;long history of partnering with researchers at the research centre. The Advisory Board is a group of volunteers living with at least one form of arthritis, whose mandate is to engage with researchers at the research centre, and to serve as a bridge in disseminating research produced from the centre to the public. To date, the Board consists of 15 members and 23 past members (31 women; 7 men). The majority of members reside across the province of British Columbia, with the exception of one based in Ontario and five in Quebec. Members can be actively involved at any stage of research, including identifying research topics, preparing grant applications, shaping the research design, coauthoring scientific papers, writing plain language summaries and/or attending, and copresenting, at conferences. Two members currently serve as cochairs of the Board, with a paid staff member as a liaison between Board members and researchers at the centre.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Outline of partnership between patient and academic partners in research process.

We recruited a convenience sample of past and present members of the Advisory Board that was sufficiently relevant and varied to generate rich data to address our objective. Indeed, participants had engaged to varying degrees with coauthors in previous research studies at Arthritis Research Canada. Participants were recruited via an email invitation and word of mouth. Coauthors SK, WL and AMH were themselves participants in the interviews.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interviews</title><p>We developed a semistructured interview guide (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary appendix A</xref>) to elicit participants&#x02019; perspectives regardless of their degree of experience with building relationships with researchers. Patient partners were consulted to inform the development of an interview guide that was relevant to the research topic, easy to understand and able to prompt spontaneous description of experiences and feelings from participants. The interview guide was organised into separate but overlapping sections, including: (1) experiences/benefits/downsides of being a patient participating in making decisions with researchers in research; (2) interactions with researchers in research-related activities. Open-ended questions were asked, and probes and prompts used for elaboration. Doctoral students with training in qualitative research (JL and BCT) each conducted half of the interviews. Interviews took place at a time and place convenient for each participant or by phone. Subject to a participant&#x02019;s permission, JL and BCT also observed interviews conducted by each other to support their ongoing training in qualitative interviewing. Many participants were familiar with JL and BCT&#x02019;s research interests prior to the interview, given previous interaction at Arthritis Research Canada. The interviews were not the interviewers&#x02019; first encounter with the subject area of patient engagement in research. JL&#x000a0;had been engaging in research with patients as a research assistant at Arthritis Research Canada since 2010.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022154.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-022154supp001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>The interviews (lasting approximately 30&#x02013;90&#x02009;min) were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. We invited each participant to review and modify the transcript of their interview and provide permission for their transcript to be used for analysis. Only members of the research team who have been granted permission by a participant had access to their full de-identified transcript. We took this step to address any potential discomfort from our participants in sharing their interview data with anyone in the study team.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data analysis</title><p>We applied an inductive, thematic approach to the data.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> No preselected codes were identified prior to analysis. We used constant comparative methods throughout our analysis to find similarities and differences within each transcript and across different transcripts, which helped analysts to continuously interrogate a fuller range of perspectives in the data in order to bring fresh insight.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Three doctoral students (JL, BCT and GM) independently read and coded a selection of transcripts. They met to identify emerging issues for discussion and develop an initial coding scheme. Codes were then compared between the remaining transcripts, with similar and deviant cases being sought. This process was followed by clustering codes into thematic categories. Coding was carried out predominantly via paper-based methods, and NVivo V.10 was used for storage and management.</p><p>Thematic categories were verified, modified or refuted in discussions with co-authors and study participants until it was agreed that categories presented a sufficient range of varied and relevant perspectives to contribute new insight. Peer checking and member checking thus enhanced the rigour of our analysis.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Thematic categories were then considered in light of aspects&#x000a0;of the relational ethics lens, including respect, embodiment and interdependency.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24 29</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Between August and November 2015, a total of 22 from an eligible 33 (67%) current and past members of the Advisory Board consented to participate in the study (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).

In her experience, this had been to the detriment of the research quality. She highlighted that, if the value of patients&#x02019; contributions was not well balanced with that of researchers, there was a risk that the quality of research could be negatively affected. She expressed that questions remain about how to find the optimal balance in valuing the distinct contributions to research by patients and researchers (as different in kind, but not in degree of importance). Finding this balance was viewed to support building a relationship of reciprocity in which patients&#x02019; and researchers&#x02019; contributions are equally important for achieving quality in research.</p><disp-quote><p>I&#x02019;ve seen patients shape some projects&#x02026; what I saw these investigators had at the end was a much less generalizable project&#x02026; I don&#x02019;t think that you can discount years of research training for patient experience&#x02026; we need to figure out the best way to give them both critical weight and maximize each one&#x02026; The patient is just as important as the researcher, and the researcher is just as important as the patient (Olivia)</p></disp-quote></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Theme 2: cobuilding social relations</title><p>Some participants (particularly past members of the Advisory Board) reflected that, in the early days of development of the Advisory Board, the paid support of a researcher to cochair the board had provided &#x02018;the bridge&#x02019; needed to build social relations between patients and researchers.

Acknowledging this required researchers to show consideration for what was going on in participants&#x02019; lives beyond the research setting.

They often described showing consideration to involve researchers taking a flexible and accommodating approach in their interactions. Examples of this approach included working together to set deadlines, or providing food during a meeting.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x02026;you&#x02019;re already dealing with so much yourself, personally in your home life, your own health, your own work life&#x02026; if you&#x02019;re not able to contribute to the same degree because you&#x02019;re in a flare, there&#x02019;s a level of understanding and appreciation [from researchers] that you don&#x02019;t have to feel guilty&#x02026; there are a huge number of tasks from writing letters of support, to writing lay summaries&#x02026; nobody is going to make you feel bad at all when you can&#x02019;t do it (Mary)</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p>&#x02026;the research team send out a newsletter regularly to their study participants&#x02026; they draft the newsletter and then I provide feedback and suggestions for edits that I feel may be helpful in improving the language and interpretation of the key messages to the patients&#x02026; [I was] sent a draft of the newsletter [by a researcher].

As one of the few empirical studies to examine components of patient engagement in research from patients&#x02019; perspectives, findings help to fill a wider gap of research evidence on patient views, experiences and preferences.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This gap poses a barrier that hinders the development of best practice of engaging patient partners in research-related activities. A key strength is that findings are grounded in the perspectives of patients with varying levels of experience of building relationships with researchers in research-related activities, as well as a wide variation in age (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p><p>Drawing on key aspects of the relational ethics lens (ie, respect, embodiment, interdependency), our findings highlight benefits and risks encountered by patients in building relationships with researchers to optimise their engagement in the research process. Respect can be demonstrated by valuing patients&#x02019; and researchers&#x02019; distinct contributions as equally important in research. Based on participants&#x02019; experiences, embodiment highlights there is a risk of patient partners feeling negative emotions, such as insecurity, inadequacy, fear, guilt, stress, when interacting with researchers. Interdependency highlights how participants valued building social relations with researchers in which there was some informal acknowledgement of each other as individuals beyond the role of researcher or patient partner. The value of creating space for informal talks between patients and researchers has also been highlighted elsewhere in the literature.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 14</xref> For example, Schipper <italic>et al</italic> report that informal talks offered an opportunity for patient partners and researchers to exchange experiences and foster mutual understanding.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Rather than &#x02018;warm, fuzzy&#x02019; extras, our findings add&#x000a0;the insight that informal interactions are valued by patient partners as they help to mitigate the risk of experiencing negative physical and emotional impacts of adding engagement in research as &#x02018;another spinning plate&#x02019; to other priorities in their daily lives.</p><p>Our findings are situated within broader theoretical debates about the status of medical and scientific knowledge, and the value of subjective, experiential knowledge.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Indeed, there is growing acceptance of the value of subjective, experiential knowledge in health research as seen, for example, in the emergence of patient-reported outcome and patient-reported experience measures within the biomedical community.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Crediting subjective, experiential knowledge can question the conventions of positivism, which credit &#x02018;lay&#x02019; knowledge with less legitimacy than scientific knowledge traditionally contributed in research by researchers.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Participants valued researchers who challenged this traditional positivist outlook by actively demonstrating that subjective, experiential knowledge contributed by patient partners could be equally important to achieving quality in research. Participants described ways in which researchers actively demonstrated that patient partners&#x02019; contributions were valued as equally important. These findings present ways in which researchers can meaningfully recognise the contributions of patient partners, which has been identified in the literature as an important part of facilitating the inclusion of patient partners in research.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 4 5 16 32&#x02013;34</xref></p><p>Importantly, our findings also caution there is a risk of researchers&#x02019; contributions being discounted when engaging with patient partners, to the detriment of research quality. As one participant stated: &#x02018;I&#x02019;ve seen patients shape some projects&#x02026; what I saw these investigators had at the end was a much less generalizable project&#x02019;. Indeed, in a qualitative study by Lindenmeyer <italic>et al</italic>, in-depth interviews with researchers revealed that one had faced criticism from a funding body for &#x02018;giving too much power&#x02019; to patient partners.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This prompts further questions. For instance, do researchers feel their contributions in research are at risk of being discounted when engaging with patient partners? Are there other risks being experienced by researchers when engaging with patient partners and, if so, how could they be mitigated? Schipper <italic>et al</italic> reported, for example, that a researcher felt insecure when feeling she had to empower the patient partners she was engaging with, but did&#x000a0;not know how.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Researchers&#x02019; experiences in their relationships with patient partners are currently understudied, and further research is warranted to identify potential gaps where support may be helpful from researchers&#x02019; perspectives.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Limitations</title><p>As in all qualitative research, we recognise that there are limitations to the transferability of these findings. For example, given that the vast majority of participants were women, it seems possible that findings are more transferable in contexts involving female rather than male patient partners. We note also that 59% of participants had at least one university degree (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), which is markedly higher than Canada&#x02019;s general working-age population, with estimates of 24.7% having attained at least one university degree.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Other published studies have highlighted that issues of diversity in patient engagement in research warrant further examination.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;39</xref> We recognise there may be limitations in the degree to which our findings might be transferred in situations involving patient partners of different sociodemographic characteristics than in the context of our study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Drawing on a relational ethics lens, our findings illuminate some important benefits and risks that patient&#x000a0;partners can experience when fostering relationships with researchers, in order to optimise patient engagement in research. By gaining understanding of these benefits and risks, patient&#x000a0;partners and researchers are better positioned to act ethically towards each other in ways that maximise benefits and minimise risks.
