The majority of LHON patients are caused by one of the three primary mutations (m.3460G &#x0003e; A, m.11778G &#x0003e; A and m.14484T &#x0003e; C).

Three primary mutations (m.3460G &#x0003e; A in the <italic>MT-ND1 </italic>gene, m.11778G &#x0003e; A in the <italic>MT-ND4 </italic>gene, and m.14484T &#x0003e; C in the <italic>MT-ND6 </italic>gene) accounted for the etiology of more than 95% LHON patients, whereas the remaining 5% cases was caused by rare mutations and/or unclear factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Up to now, there is a considerable long list for rare mutations for LHON (cf. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mitomap.org">http://www.mitomap.org</ext-link>). Most recently, m.3635G &#x0003e; A in the <italic>MT-ND1 </italic>gene was confirmed to be a rare primary mutation and had a multiple occurrence in Han Chinese and Russian LHON families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Clinical expression of primary LHON mutation was affected by many factors including mtDNA background/haplogroups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], nuclear genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Similarly, Yang <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] reported one Chinese LHON family with both m.10680G &#x0003e; A and primary mutation m.14484T &#x0003e; C which expressed complete penetrance. These two studies suggested that m.10680G &#x0003e; A played an active role in LHON and might be a "suspected" pathogenic LHON mutation. In order to investigate the frequency of m.10680G &#x0003e; A in Chinese patients with clinical LHON features but without any known mutations, we screened this mutation in 774 suspected LHON patients by using the allele specific PCR (AS-PCR). Our analysis of the complete mtDNA genomes of the probands with mutation m.10680G &#x0003e; A suggested that this mutation should be regarded as a rare pathogenic mutation for LHON in Chinese.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The patients were physically evaluated and collected at the Pediatric and Genetic Clinic of the Eye Hospital, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center and/or other local clinical centers. All patients were subjected to acute or sub-acute vision loss and lacked the three known LHON primary mutations. We have sequenced the mtDNA control region sequence and classified these patients with suspected LHON into respective haplogroup and found no haplogroup was associated with suspected LHON [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Because we used up DNA samples for some patients during that study, only 774 out of 843 patients with suspected LHON [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] were analyzed here. All these 774 patients were confirmed to harbor none of the four LHON primary mutations (m.3460G &#x0003e; A, m.3635G &#x0003e; A, m.11778G &#x0003e; A, and m.14484T &#x0003e; C). Informed consents conforming to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki were obtained from each participant prior to the study.

The primer pair for AS-PCR (L10680A: 5'-AGTCTTTGCCGCCTGCGATA-3'/H10972: 5'-TCAGGTAGTTAGTATTAGGAG-3') was designed according to the strategy described in Bi <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Another primer pair L4887 (5'-TGACAAAAACTAGCCCCCATCT -3')/H5442 (5'-GCGATGAGTGTGGGGAGGAA-3') was used as the internal control for monitoring successful amplification during the AS-PCR. PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 &#x003bc;L containing 30 ng DNA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 units of TaKaRa rTaq, 175 &#x003bc;M of each dNTP, and 0.3 &#x003bc;M of each primer. The amplification condition for AS-PCR is composed of one denaturation cycle at 94&#x000b0;C for 3 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 20 s, annealing at 61&#x000b0;C for 20 s, and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and one final extension cycle at 72&#x000b0;C for 5 min. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the AS-PCR in detecting the minimum level of heteroplasmic mutation m.10680G &#x0003e; A, five different concentrations of genomic DNA of patient Le1263 with m.10680G &#x0003e; A (1 ng, 2.5 ng, 5 ng, 10 ng, and 15 ng) was used for amplification. In addition, DNA samples from patient Le1263 and a healthy donor without m.10680G &#x0003e; A were mixed to achieve final proportions of mutant DNA of 5%, 10%, and 20%, and a total of 30 ng of mixed DNA was amplified. The sensitivity is defined to be the smallest percentage of mutant DNA that can be detected by the AS-PCR method. PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel at 120 V for 30 min.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the entire mtDNA genome for patients with m.10680G &#x0003e; A</title><p>The entire mitochondrial genomes of probands with m.10680G &#x0003e; A were amplified and sequenced by using primers and methods described in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

We classified each patient into accurate haplogroup relative to the updated East Asian mtDNA tree and PhyloTree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The novelty of variants/mutations was defined according to the available guidelines described by Bandelt <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We presented mtDNA sequence variations in probands sequenced in this study, together with two reported LHON mtDNAs with m.10680G &#x0003e; A (family Le1107 reported by Zou <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and LHON family reported by Yang <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]) in a mtDNA tree.

Evolutionary conservation analysis of m.10680G &#x0003e; A was performed by using the MitoTool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mitotool.org">http://www.mitotool.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>To discern the frequency of m.10680G &#x0003e; A in reported mtDNAs across world, we collected 9277 complete (and/or incomplete) mtDNA sequences from PhyloTree (mtDNA Tree Build 12, 20 Jul 2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and the MitoTool data set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and excluded those data of Chinese LHON patients.

The spectra of the LHON primary mutations showed remarkable difference between European patients and Chinese patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], we speculated that there might be some more pathogenic mtDNA mutations that were unique to Chinese LHON patients.</p><p>In this study, we designed an AS-PCR to detect mutation m.10680G &#x0003e; A in 774 Chinese patients with suspected LHON and found two patients harboring this mutation. Our approach had a reasonably good sensitivity in detecting minimum level of mutant DNA of 10% of total DNA template &#x02265; 10 ng). Compared to other approaches, such as sequencing, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), the AS-PCR method is fast and cost-effective and can be of potential usage in the clinic for fast screening of mutation m.10680G &#x0003e; A in patients with suspected LHON. We did not identify any heteroplasmy of mutation m.10680G &#x0003e; A in the two patients with m.10680G &#x0003e; A in this study and patient Le1107 in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] based on the limitation of detection sensitivity of our AS-PCR and direct sequencing approach. Though we did not design an allele-specific PCR (or a PCR-RFLP method) to detect the minimum level of wild-type allele in these patients to double check for heteroplasmy, the overall pattern was consistent with our previous observation for a very low frequency of heteroplasmic m.11778G &#x0003e; A (1/479 = 0.21%; Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]) and m.14484T &#x0003e; C (3/52 = 5.8%; Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) in Han Chinese patients. As m.10680G &#x0003e; A creates a digestion site for enzyme <italic>Tse</italic>I, we could also use PCR-RFLP method to screen this mutation and measure the level of heteroplasmy. One limitation is that enzyme <italic>Tse</italic>I is quite expensive and this PCR-RFLP method is not cost-effective and time-consuming in clinic.</p><p>The frequency of m.10680G &#x0003e; A in Chinese LHON patients was slightly lower than that of primary mutation m.3635G &#x0003e; A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although the conservation index (0.84) of p.A71T (m.10680G &#x0003e; A) was not as high as one would expect for a pathogenic mutation, it would affect the secondary or tertiary structure of the ND4L subunit (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The alanine to threonine change at the 71<sup>st </sup>amino acid position is next to E70, one of the two highly conserved glutamates in transmembrane helices of the ND4L protein, and those glutamates have been shown to be essential for enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Moreover, the two glutamates within transmembrane helices of nuoK/ND4L have been recently considered to be linked to the proton pumping function of complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) in light of the recently revealed spatial structure of the membrane arm of complex I in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Therefore, there indeed seem to be reasons for the pathogenicity of mutation m.10680G &#x0003e; A.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Membrane-spanning region prediction plot produced by the TMpred program</bold>.

Mutation p.A71T (m.10680G &#x0003e; A) changed the structure of membrane-spanning region of the MT-ND4L protein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1479-5876-10-43-4"/></fig><p>A web-based and database search showed that mutation m.10680G &#x0003e; A has been independently reported to affect LHON in two Chinese families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These two reported patients belonged to haplogroups M13a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and B4d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Therefore, it seemed that mutation m.10680G &#x0003e; A occurred only in Chinese LHON patients and had a multiple occurrence in different mtDNA background. In the Chinese family reported by Yang <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], m.10680G &#x0003e; A coexisted with primary mutation m.14484T &#x0003e; C, and the presence of both mutations caused complete penetrance of LHON. In the two families with m.10680G &#x0003e; A reported in this study and our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we found that the penetrance of LHON (&#x0003e; 40%) was even higher than those families with m.11778G &#x0003e; A (33.3%; Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]), m.14484T &#x0003e; C (31.9%; Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]) or m.3460G &#x0003e; A (25.6%; Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). Patient Le1263 was self-reported as sporadic and his family was not considered to calculate the penetrance. Note that our estimation for disease penetrance for m.10680G &#x0003e; A was based on two families, which might lead to a bias.</p><p>Analysis for the entire mtDNA genomes of the two patients with m.10680G &#x0003e; A identified in this study showed that they harbored no novel or "confirmed" pathogenic mutation. However, variant m.3548T &#x0003e; C was found in patient Le1263, which is located in the mutational hotspot (<italic>MT-ND1 </italic>gene) for Chinese patients with LHON but lacking three known primary mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and was also reported in another LHON patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], whether m.3548T &#x0003e; C had a synergistic effect with m.10680G &#x0003e; A to influence disease expression in Le1263 was not clear, as we lacked necessary clinical information and this patient had no self-reported family history of disease. Similarly, two private variants were found in patient Le1330, which were located in the <italic>MT-ND1 </italic>and <italic>MT-ND5 </italic>genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), further supported our previous claim that the <italic>MT-ND1 </italic>and <italic>MT-ND5 </italic>genes are mutational hotspots for Chinese families with clinical features of LHON but lacking the three primary mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we designed an AS-PCR method for rapid screening of m.10680G &#x0003e; A in a large cohort of Chinese patients with suspected LHON and identified two Chinese subjects with m.10680G &#x0003e; A. Analysis of the complete mtDNA sequences of the two probands and combining with information of two reported cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], we proposed that m.10680G &#x0003e; A is a rare pathogenic mutation in Chinese LHON population. Further functional assays, e.g. respiration measurements and NADH:ubichinon oxidoreductase activity assays in patient fibroblasts and eventually in newly constructed cybrid cell lines harbouring the mutation, should be carried out and more families with m.10680G &#x0003e; A should be included to validate our conclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AMZ and YGY designed the experiments and analyzed the data.
