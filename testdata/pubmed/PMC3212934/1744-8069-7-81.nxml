A central factor implicated to be a key player in the process of tumorigenesis, osteoclastogenesis and nociception is p38 MAPK.

While it is not known whether the role of p38 MAPK signaling can be expanded to other cancers, the data suggest a need for understanding molecular mechanisms and cellular events that initiate and maintain cancer-induced bone pain for effective management for both ongoing pain as well as breakthrough pain.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chronic pain is experienced by 30-50% of all cancer patients irrespective of the stage and 70-90% of those with advanced metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Cancer pain is multifaceted with varying degrees of intensity, at multiple anatomical locations, and characterized by multiple pain descriptors including inflammatory, neuropathic and mechanical that likely have different underlying mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The most commonly diagnosed cancers such as those of lung, prostate, and breast often metastasize to the bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and are associated with bone remodeling and eventual bone fractures that contribute to incapacitating pain and limited or total loss of mobility and daily activity. Even though pain is the most frequent and disruptive symptom of the disease, mechanisms that initiate and maintain cancer-induced pain are not clearly understood. This ultimately results in poor pain management as the analgesic treatments (e.g. opiates, bisphosphonates) currently used to treat cancer-induced bone pain are given across prolonged periods of time and are associated with debilitating side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] Overall, pain management still remains inadequate in approximately 40% of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. As advances in cancer therapeutics have drastically increased life expectancy of patients, including those with bone metastases, these patients continue to experience pain that can be severe and unpredictable, greatly limiting daily activity resulting in poor quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This highlights the need for effective treatment that can be given over long periods of time without development of debilitating side effects associated with currently available treatments.</p><p>One potential mediator of tumor-induced bone pain is p38 MAPK, a serine/threonine mitogen activated protein kinase activated by its phosphorylation in various signaling cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The p38 MAPK signaling pathway has been implicated in mediating inflammatory and neuropathic pain, both of which are thought to contribute to cancer-induced bone pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, p38 MAPK has also been demonstrated to be important in maturation and synthesis of osteoclasts, cells responsible for osteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The p38 MAPK cascade is known to be activated by tumor-induced cellular stress such as inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, it is also established as a key player in the induction of cellular effects of cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) and Interleukin-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The growing tumor burden, acidic tumor microenvironment, an array of inflammatory mediators produced by the tumor and tumor associated cells in the bone microenvironment and tumor-induced bone degradation all contribute to bone pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. As p38 MAPK plays a key role in each of these variables, we hypothesized that blockade of p38-MAPK signaling might attenuate cancer-induced bone pain and bone loss. The present study determined the role of p38 MAPK in tumor growth, tumor-induced bone loss, and components of tumor-induced bone pain in a mouse model of cancer-induced bone pain in which mammary adenocarcinoma cells were injected and sealed into the intramedullary space of the femur of female mice to allow controlled progression of disease within the bone.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Implantation of breast cancer cells 66.1 into the intramedullary space of the femur induces pain-like behaviors in mice</title><p>Injection of the mouse breast cancer cells into the femur produced a time-dependent expression of both non-evoked pain-like behaviors (flinching and guarding) as well as changes in sensory thresholds to evoked stimuli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Cancer-treated mice demonstrated flinching behavior within 7 days post-surgery, with flinching behavior continuing to increase through the day 14 time-point. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Cancer-treated mice showed significant guarding behavior within 7 days post-surgery, which increased by day 13 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Cancer-treated mice showed robust tactile hypersensitivity by the day 7 time-point, with paw withdrawal thresholds remaining low throughout the testing period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Control mice showed slightly lowered withdrawal thresholds at day 7 post-surgery, with withdrawal thresholds returning to baseline by the day 9 time-point. Both cancer-treated and control mice showed impaired limb use on day 7 following the surgery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Cancer-treated mice showed greater impairment of limb use than control mice, demonstrating both limping and guarding behaviors whereas control mice only showed transient limping behaviors, likely due to surgery induced pain. Impaired limb use was not observed at later time points in control mice whereas cancer-treated mice continued to guard and/or limp through day 14 post-surgery (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Time course for emergence of pain behaviors showing spontaneous flinching (A), spontaneous guarding (B), tactile allodynia (C) and limb use score (D)</bold>. n = 8 mice/group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1744-8069-7-81-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Implantation of breast cancer cells 66.1 into the intramedullary space of femur induces bone remodeling and tumor growth</title><p>Femur radiographs showed a time-dependent change in bone remodeling on days 7, 10, and 13 after the cancer cells were injected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

In cancer- treated mice that received 15 mg/kg of the drug, tumor growth was confined to the shaft in the middle of the intramedullary space where the breast cancer cells were initially implanted. No tumor was evident around the epiphyseal plate indicating the failure of the cancer cells to migrate with SB203580 treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> panels c,d).

These data indicate that components of cancer-induced bone pain that may reflect ongoing pain and evoked hypersensitivity are likely driven by independent mechanisms. These findings suggest that tumor-induced ongoing pain is dependent on p38 MAPK signaling. However, inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling is insufficient to block hypersensitivity to evoked stimuli, which may be dependent on establishment of altered central processing (i.e., central sensitization). Importantly, we demonstrate that chronic inhibition of p38 MAPK failed to attenuate tactile hypersensitivity despite markedly diminished tumor within the bone and bone remodeling, suggesting potential distinction between anti-tumor activity and tactile hypersensitivity.</p><p>Previous studies in mice have demonstrated increased phosphorylated p38 MAPK in the DRG and spinal cord dorsal horn neurons ipsilateral to osteosarcoma treated femurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and in spinal microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], indicating potential peripheral and central actions of p38 MAPK in cancer-induced bone pain. Activation of p38 MAPK has been implicated in numerous translational and transcriptional responses implicated in peripheral and spinal sensitization initiated by inflammatory and neuropathic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that p38 MAPK mediates increased transcription of nociceptive peptides, such as SP and CGRP, within the DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Further, p38 MAPK mediates injury-induced increased production of TRPV1 and TRPA1 within the DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and trafficking of the TRPV1 channel to the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Notably, p38 MAPK drives post-translational changes implicated in pain such as phosphorylation of the TRPV1 channel, resulting in reduced activation threshold and potentiated capsaicin- or proton-evoked responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Phosphorylation of the Nav1.8 channel increases current density that can increase neuronal excitability under pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, the effects of acute administration of SB 203580 may be from inhibition of the direct activation/phosphorylation of pro-nociceptive channels. As tumor- and osteoclast- induced acidosis of the tumor microenvironment are implicated in tumor-induced bone pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], increases in acid sensing channels within the bone, decreased activation thresholds within the tumor microenvironment, and increased neuronal excitability, likely result in increased activation of sensory fibers by factors within the tumor microenvironment. Supporting this, blockade of the TRPV1 receptor attenuated osteosarcoma-induced flinching and guarding behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus, prolonged administration of the p38 MAPK inhibitor may diminish cancer-induced ongoing pain behaviors by multiple mechanisms associated with up-regulation and trafficking of pronociceptive signaling channels (e.g., TRPV1) to the periphery.</p><p>Within the tumor microenvironment, multiple disease related factors sensitize and directly drive nociceptive afferent fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In addition to tumor and osteoclast induced acidosis, mechanical factors, such as compression and damage to sensory fibers innervating the bone by tumor growth, or mechanical stress from destabilization of the bone structure due to tumor induced bone remodeling may drive afferent activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Such signal may be amplified due to the phosphorylation of sodium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Moreover, pronociceptive inflammatory mediators including endothelins, ATP, prostaglandins, growth factors and pronociceptive cytokines are released from the tumor, tumor-induced bone resorption, and infiltrating immune cells such as tumor associated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. These factors are implicated in sensitization and direct activation of sensory fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Moreover, p38MAPK has been implicated in release of many of these factors including release of ATP from tumor associated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and release of cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. More recently, systemic administration of a selective p38&#x003b1; MAPK inhibitor has been shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced elevation of blood levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Thus, the blockade of tumor-induced flinching and guarding behaviors may be due to diminished release of factors within the tumor microenvironment that sensitize primary afferent fibers, thereby lowering thresholds for direct activation by factors within the bone microenvironment (e.g. acid, ATP), and directly reducing factors (e.g. ATP) that may directly drive afferent input from the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>In addition to directly inhibiting release of pronociceptive factors from the tumor and associated immune cells, administration of the p38 MAPK inhibitor across 7 days also demonstrated disease modifying effects. Painful bone metastases in humans, such as prostate and breast cancer, often have osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Our model shows tumor-induced osteolytic lesions by day 10 followed by osteoblastic activity. Prolonged SB203580 treatment completely eliminated the abnormal osteoblastic structures observed in the vehicle-treated bones by day 13 post-tumor implantation. In addition, radiographic analyses of bones showed reduced incidences of spontaneous bone fractures in drug treated bones as compared to those treated with the vehicle. Thus, blockade of tumor-induced bone remodeling likely contributed to the blockade of pain behaviors in cancer bearing mice treated with prolonged administration of the p38 MAPK inhibitor. In addition, histology of bones collected at the end our study show significant tumor reduction with prolonged drug treatment. Moreover, administration of the p38 MAPK inhibitor to cultured 66.1 cells diminished viability, indicating a role of p38 MAPK in tumor growth. This is consistent with multiple reports implicating p38 MAPK in proliferation, invasion and migration of a variety of malignancies including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. These tumorigenic effects of p38 MAPK may be mediated by modulation of transcription factors (e.g. NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]) and regulation of anti-apoptotic inflammatory signals (e.g. interleukin-6 (IL-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]). SB203580 has been demonstrated to inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. This is notable as COX-2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to diminish tumor growth within bone, bone loss and bone pain in a mouse model of sarcoma-induced bone pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. We demonstrate that treatment with 15 mg/kg of SB203580 restricted tumor growth to the shaft of the bone, with absence of tumor growth into the epiphyseal plate region. At a higher dose, 30 mg/kg, only small pockets of tumor were seen. We note that this is in contrast with previous reports that administration of a p38 MAPK inhibitor across 9-11 days failed to inhibit growth of osteosarcoma cells within the mouse femur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These discrepant results may be due to numerous factors including route of administration (food chow as opposed to twice daily i.p. injections), and cell lines used (osteosarcoma vs. murine cell line 66.1 mammary adenocarcinoma cells). Our data suggest that diminished tumor burden and tumor-induced bone remodeling may be key factors contributing to blockade of tumor-induced flinching and guarding pain behaviors.</p><p>Consistent with previous findings in the osteosarcoma pain model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], p38 MAPK inhibition failed to block tactile hypersensitivity. One potential explanation for the divergent effects of p38 MAPK inhibition on flinching and guarding as opposed to tactile hypersensitivity is the site of action. We propose that activation of afferent fibers innervating the tumor microenvironment drives cancer-induced ongoing pain whereas central mechanisms mediate tactile hypersensitivity. Tactile hypersensitivity is a measure of referred pain, which likely reflects hypersensitivity to touch stimuli, which is mediated by central sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the spinal cord across several injury states such as inflammation-induced pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], spinal injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] incision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], and osteosarcoma induced bone pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated that spinal administration of the p38 MAPK inhibitor starting before or at the time of injury blocks evoked pain (tactile and thermal hypersensitivity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. In contrast, others have demonstrated that spinal administration of p38 MAPK inhibitors after the pain state is established failed to reverse thermal or tactile hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Thus, although p38 MAPK is implicated in initiation of spinal sensitization, it does not appear to be a factor in maintaining central sensitization and the associated thermal or tactile hypersensitivity. We propose that growth of the tumor within the bone and the associated afferent drive may have established central sensitization required to maintain tactile hypersensitivity prior to drug delivery, as mice demonstrated flinching, guarding, impaired limb use, and tactile allodynia within 7 days, prior to drug administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Therefore, prolonged and acute administration of the p38 MAPK inhibitor blocked apparent spontaneous pain, but was not sufficient to block the tumor-induced tactile hypersensitivity. Notably, our findings are consistent with a recent clinical report in which systemic administration of a p38 MAPK inhibitor (dilmapimod) to humans with neuropathic pain diminished pain intensity compared to placebo, but failed to alter measures of evoked pain, including tactile allodynia and altered thermal thresholds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings indicate important differences in mechanisms mediating components of bone cancer pain. The observation that the p38 MAPK diminished tumor within the bone indicates that apparent spontaneous pain, as measured by flinching and guarding behaviors, may be dependent on continuing peripheral drive from the tumor whereas central mechanisms established prior to diminished tumor burden maintain evoked pain behaviors. Importantly, this may indicate different mechanisms might drive ongoing pain as opposed to evoked pain. A better understanding of how mechanisms driving multiple components of bone cancer pain may lead to a more complete therapeutic treatment strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Murine cell line: 66.1</title><p>Murine cell line 66.1 derived from spontaneously occurring mammary adenocarcinoma was maintained in advanced Minimum Essesntial Medium, Eagle (&#x003b1;MEM) (Cellgro Mediatech) containing 10% Fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 units/mL streptomycin at 37&#x000b0;C and in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere.

Acute effects of SB203580 were tested on day 13 post surgery. Pre-drug analysis of spontaneous pain and tactile allodynia were obtained for all groups, followed by drug administration. Behaviors were again assessed at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min following drug administration. All behaviors were assessed within the same animal. Each animal was first tested for flinching and guarding followed by tactile allodynia. To avoid repeated handling and transferring of animals from testing chambers to the walking pan at each time point separated by 30 min for the acute drug studies, limb use scoring was only carried out for the chronic administration of SB203580. To study the chronic effects of SB203580 administration, animals were tested for movement-evoked pain (limb use), spontaneous pain behaviors (flinching and guarding), and tactile allodynia prior to surgery (pre-surgery baselines) following the surgery on days 7 (pre-drug), 9, 11 and 13. The behavioral tests were carried out at time points later than observed peak effect of acute administration of the drug.
