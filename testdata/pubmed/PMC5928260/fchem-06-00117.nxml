The first step (pre-treatment) decrystallizes cellulose while the second step (post-hydrolysis) converts the amorphous cellulose to glucose. The two-step process developed by the Industrial Research Chair on Cellulosic Ethanol and Biocommodities and its industrial partner CRB Innovations Inc., includes an intermediate partial neutralization step, whose purpose is to decrease the amount of dilution water to be added for post-hydrolysis thus minimizing handling costs. In this work, the effect of several operating parameters on the glucose yield of this process was investigated using triticale cellulose and the best conditions yielding fermentable glucose (close to 100%) were determined. These conditions involve pre-treating cellulose at 30&#x000b0;C using 72 wt% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with a H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/dry cellulose mass ratio of 36 over 2 h, followed by a partial neutralization using 20 wt% NaOH at an H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratio of 2.3&#x02013;2.5 and a post-hydrolysis at 121&#x000b0;C for 10 min.</p><p><bold>HIGHLIGHTS</bold>

The major drop in oil barrel price from US$ 107.26 in 2014 to US$ 29.64 in 2016 has negatively impacted the biofuel industry with two major companies in the field filing for bankruptcy (Lavoie, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, the interest toward increasing the production of biofuels is still very strong. Since renewable fuels have a carbon balance close to neutrality (Lee and Lavoie, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), they are essential to mitigate the adverse climate change and global warming effects caused by greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum-derived liquid fuels.</p><p>First generation liquid biofuels, produced primarily from food crops such as sugar crops, oil seeds, and cereals, represent a mature commercial technology and market, but face controversies in terms of their sustainability and potential to meet governmental targets. To some extent, these biofuels compete for land and water used for food and fiber production. Moreover, their production and processing costs are often high as compared to fossil fuels and hence they require governmental subsidies to be able to compete with petroleum products. In addition, their greenhouse gas reductions may be impacted from considering land-use change (Sims et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Ethanol from corn starch is an example of first generation liquid biofuel and similarly to starch, cellulose is a glucose-based polymer that can be hydrolyzed to liberate monosaccharides, which can then be fermented to ethanol. Cellulose is an attractive raw material since it is readily available from relatively cheap feedstock such as agricultural and forest residues priced between US$ 60 and US$ 80 per ton (Lee and Lavoie, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, the biggest challenge with cellulose is its recalcitrant structure, making it challenging to be efficiently converted using chemical or biological approaches.</p><p>Cellulose is a linear polymer of D-anhydroglucopyranose monomers connected by &#x003b2;-1,4-glycosidic bonds (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and its degree of polymerization varies typically between 2,000 to 27,000 glucan units, depending on the type of plant (Taherdazeh and Karimi, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). It is found as stacks of linear chains with D-cellobiose repeating units and these chains are closely packed, with intramolecular hydrogen bonding within each single glucan chain and intermolecular hydrogen bonding between adjacent chains. The resulting fibrous structure and high degree of crystallinity of cellulose accounts for cellulose recalcitrance (Xiang et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Pulidindi et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). As a first step to overcome this recalcitrance, pre-treatment of biomass is usually performed. When the main aim is to produce ethanol from the cellulosic part, the pre-treatment step also serves the purpose of removing lignin and hemicelluloses, decreasing cellulose crystallinity while increasing the material porosity and freeing cellulose from the tightly-woven lignocellulosic biomass structure (Sun and Cheng, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; El-Zawawy et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Acid hydrolysis of cellulose is a classic way to break down cellulose into glucose and can be done using either dilute acid or concentrated acid. The main advantage of cellulose hydrolysis using dilute acid is that the acid does not need to be recovered (Ni et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) but its several disadvantages include the need of high temperature (at least 180&#x000b0;C) and pressure (around 10 atm) which still provides low glucose yields (Iranmahboob et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). For example, cellulose hydrolyzed with 0.4 wt% acid at 215&#x000b0;C for 3 min after pre-treatment (hemicelluloses hydrolysis) with 0.7 wt% sulfuric acid at 190&#x000b0;C for 3 min gave a glucose yield of only 50% (Hamelinck et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). On the other hand, cellulose hydrolysis using concentrated acid takes place at moderate temperature and pressure and results in higher glucose yields (around 90%; Hamelinck et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), but usually involves a longer reaction time (2&#x02013;6 h) and it is difficult to economically separate the glucose while recovering the acid.</p><p>The concentrated acid hydrolysis of cellulose historically started in 1883 when the method of dissolving and hydrolyzing cotton cellulose with concentrated sulfuric acid was invented. From 1937 to 1948, three processes for concentrated acid hydrolysis of cellulose, namely the Bergius-Rheinau process (Kent, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Amarasekara, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the Peoria process, and the Hokkaido process (Wenzl, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>; Clausen and Gaddy, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) were deployed at large scale. However, they were only successful at times of national crisis, when oil from the Middle East was not readily accessible, and fell out of use after World War II due to poor yields, significant waste streams and large quantities of unmarketable by-products (Arkenol, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Complicated process units, high energy consumption and difficulties to recycle acid were also mentioned as obstacles toward the commercialization of these technologies (Fan et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). In the mid-1970s, the Peoria process was improved at Purdue University and at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) by recycling dilute acid, and became known as the TVA process. In 1989, Arkenol, an American company, developed a two-stage concentrated acid hydrolysis process using a chromatographic method to separate sugar and acid (Amarasekara, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). BlueFire Renewables Inc., established in 2010 to deploy the Arkenol technology (BlueFire Renewables, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), was awarded funding from the US Department of Energy and a letter of intent from the Export Import Bank of China was renewed in February 2015 to provide up to 270 million US$ in debt financing for its intended commercial plant in Fulton, Mississippi. Once the financing was completed, the plant would be constructed (BlueFire Renewables, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>CRB Innovations Inc., one of the industrial sponsors of this work, has been working on residual biomass valorization since its creation in 2006. Based on widely published work carried out since the 90's at the University of Sherbrooke, lignocellulosic biomass is first separated into four fractions, namely hemicelluloses, cellulose, lignin, and extractives (if desired) (Lavoie et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The cellulosic fraction is then subjected to swelling and decrystallization using concentrated sulfuric acid; the cellulose is &#x0201c;liquefied&#x0201d; in the highly ionic medium. From there on, the oligosaccharides, obtained as a result of the &#x0201c;ionic liquefaction,&#x0201d; are converted into monomeric sugars by a post-hydrolysis step using dilute acid. Variations of this method have the potential of being economically attractive if a minimum acid/cellulose ratio is used for the ionic liquefaction step and a high glucose yield is obtained after post-hydrolysis. Additional requirements include recovering and recycling the used ions, and conditioning the final glucose solution for subsequent fermentation using established microbial systems.</p><p>The specific process considered in this study (see <bold>Figure 2</bold>) involves partially neutralizing the acid and decrystallized cellulose mixture by adding aqueous ammonia or sodium hydroxide solution prior to the post-hydrolysis step. Partial neutralization is done in order to reduce the amount of water required to dilute the sulfuric acid for post-hydrolysis (Chornet et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). After the post-hydrolysis step, different recovery techniques could be used to separate and regenerate acid from the glucose solution obtained. Membrane electrolysis enables the simultaneous separation and regeneration of sulfuric acid and the base from their salt through reactions at the electrodes. Using electrodialysis, sulfuric acid and sodium sulfate or ammonium sulfate can be separated from the glucose solution but an additional technique is needed to separate the sulfuric acid from the salt and regenerate the base. Chromatographic methods could also be used for the separation of ions and glucose and have been extensively reported in literature (Neuman et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Foody and Tolan, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Wahnon, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Heinonen and Sainio, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Mahnon, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Heinonen et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). After separating the ammonium sulfate from the glucose solution, the salt can be subjected to pyrolysis to produce sulfuric acid and ammonium hydroxide (Hansen, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Each of these recovery techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the ultimate best choice depends on many factors, such as the recovery (separation) efficiency and the energy cost associated (Berberi, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>The objectives of this work are to investigate the influence of key parameters of the two-step hydrolysis process with partial neutralization on the glucose yield, and to identify the conditions resulting in the highest glucose yield.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Feedstock</title><p>The cellulose used as feedstock was obtained from pronghorn spring triticale. The biomass was planted on May 19, 2009 by C&#x000c9;ROM (<italic>Centre de recherche sur les grains</italic>) and CRSAD (<italic>Centre de recherche en sciences animales de Deschambault</italic>), and treated with the Buctril M herbicide on June 14, 2009. The triticale was harvested at maturity on September 16, 2009 and the biomass production yield was 175 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Given the fibrous texture of the straw (non-edible part of the plant), the latter was mechanically cut to approximately 3 cm-long pieces in order to facilitate the downstream treatment. The triticale straws were fractionated using the FIRSST (Feedstock Impregnation Rapid and Sequential Steam Treatment) method, consisting of two steam treatments (as depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The first treatment solubilizes the hemicelluloses fraction whereas the second treatment, carried out using an alkaline catalyst, allowed the solubilization of lignin (Lavoie et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The remaining solid fraction consisted mainly of cellulose.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the FIRSST method used to separate the constitutive fractions of lignocellulosic biomass (adapted from Lavoie et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fchem-06-00117-g0001"/></fig><p>Prior to the first steam treatment, biomass was impregnated with water for 24 h at room temperature. Once the secondary metabolites were dissolved in the water, biomass was filtered and washed five times with water by successive impregnations and pressings. The extracted feedstock was then subjected to a first steam treatment carried out at 200&#x000b0;C for 2 min. The resulting mixture was filtered to recover the hemicelluloses in the solution and the biomass was then washed five times with water. Afterwards, the biomass was impregnated with an 8 wt% sodium hydroxide solution and subjected to a second steam treatment at 180&#x000b0;C for 2 min. The mixture from this second steam treatment was filtered and the solid fraction obtained was used as cellulose feed in this research work.</p><p>All reagents used in this work were of ACS grade. These include the 95&#x02013;98 wt% sulfuric acid used for pre-treatment and the bases (29 wt% aqueous ammonia and 20 wt% sodium hydroxide) used for partial neutralization. Moreover, an aqueous 32.8 wt% sodium hydroxide solution was instead used as catalyst (basic) in the experiments aiming at determining the effect of time, acid concentration and temperature of post-hydrolysis on glucose yield.</p></sec><sec><title>Standard cellulose hydrolysis test (ASTM E1758-01)</title><p>The standard procedure for the quantitative determination of carbohydrate in cellulose was carried out following the ASTM International method (E1758-01) where: 4.92 g of 72 wt% sulfuric acid was added to 0.3 g of cellulose for 1 h at 30&#x000b0;C with agitation every 15 min. The solution was then diluted to 4 wt% sulfuric acid by adding 84 mL of water, before being placed in an autoclave at 121&#x000b0;C for 1 h. After 20 min of cooling and neutralization to pH 5&#x02013;6, the mixture was filtered (0.2 &#x003bc;m) and the glucose concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (ASTM International, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cellulose humidity</title><p>Prior to hydrolysis, cellulose humidity was determined first by manually pulling the cellulose apart into small pieces and placing approximately 5 g in an aluminum weighing dish previously dried at 105&#x000b0;C.

The Erlenmeyer flask was placed in a temperature-regulated bath at 30&#x000b0;C for the desired time (<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>) and its contents stirred using a glass rod at 15 min intervals. At the end of this cellulose pre-treatment process, the Erlenmeyer flask was rapidly cooled by dipping it in a 1 L beaker containing ice-cold water and the appropriate amount of basic solution [NaOH or NH<sub>3(aq)</sub>] added dropwise with agitation, until the desired acid/base molar ratio (<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>) was achieved.

Again in this situation, increasing the mass percentage of acid to more than 72 wt% did not improve the glucose yield. At a still higher mass ratio of sulfuric acid/dry cellulose of 36 and combined with a H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> mass percentage of 72 wt%, a glucose yield of 98% was obtained, with a much smaller standard deviation among the triplicates than at lower mass ratios of sulfuric acid/dry cellulose. Seventy-two percentage by weight was therefore found to be the best mass percentage of sulfuric acid, regardless of the mass ratio of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/dry cellulose. Moreover, 5-HMF was detected in the hydrolysates but its concentration was below the lower limit of quantification of the HPLC.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Effect of the mass percentage and quantity of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> used during pre-treatment on the glucose yield with mass ratio of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/dry cellulose = 12(&#x02666;), 24(&#x025a0;), 36(<bold>&#x02013;</bold>), pre-treatment of 2 h at 30&#x000b0;C, molar ratio of H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> = 2.3 for partial neutralization, and 10 min and 121&#x000b0;C for post-hydrolysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fchem-06-00117-g0003"/></fig><p>Xiang et al.

Thus, an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid at 72 wt% has some similarities with an ionic liquid since it is a liquid composed exclusively of anions and cations. Ionic liquids have reportedly been used to disrupt the crystalline structure of cellulose before hydrolysis or to simultaneously dissolve and hydrolyze cellulose (Vo et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), although the mechanism of cellulose dissolution by ionic liquids (and 72 wt% sulfuric acid) is currently not well understood. Feng and Chen (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) proposed a mechanism for the dissolution of cellulose in an ionic liquid and the latter could readily be applied to the dissolution of cellulose in a 72 wt% sulfuric acid aqueous solution. The sulfate ions and hydronium ions form electron donor-acceptor complexes with the &#x02013;OH groups in cellulose. As a result of the interactions between cellulose and sulfuric acid, the intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups in cellulose are broken down, leading to the separation of the molecular chains of cellulose (perceived as swelling) and ultimately cellulose dissolution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Dissolution mechanism of cellulose in 72 wt% sulfuric acid (based on Feng and Chen, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fchem-06-00117-g0004"/></fig><p>Therefore, the breakdown of the crystalline structure of cellulose is probably one of the most important aspects of the concentrated sulfuric acid pre-treatment.

After only 15 min of pre-treatment in 72 wt% sulfuric acid, the glucose yield rapidly increased to 72% and then continued to increase at a slower rate to reach approximately 100% after 2 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This long pre-treatment time could be explained by the fact that sufficient time is necessary to convert almost all the crystalline parts into amorphous cellulose, which can then easily be hydrolyzed to glucose during the post-hydrolysis step. Except for the hydrolysate produced after a pre-treatment of 2 h, in which 5-HMF was detected at a concentration below the lower limit of quantification of the HPLC, no 5-HMF peak was observed in the chromatograms obtained from the other pre-treatment times. It was thus deduced that these pre-treatment conditions are not severe enough to cause considerable degradation of glucose, making this process suitable for subsequent fermentation of glucose to ethanol.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Effect of pre-treatment time on glucose yield with mass ratio of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/dry cellulose ratio = 36, 72 wt% sulfuric acid and H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratio = 2.5, combined with a 121&#x000b0;C post-hydrolysis for 10 min.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fchem-06-00117-g0005"/></fig><p>According to these results, the most efficient pre-treatment time was 2 h in order to achieve a glucose yield of 100%. Although the influence of pre-treatment time on glucose yield was not investigated for mass ratio of sulfuric acid/dry cellulose of 12 and 24, the best pre-treatment time of 2 h was verified for the most desirable (lowest) ratio of 12 during the other trials determining the influence of concentration of base, post-hydrolysis time and temperature on the glucose yield.</p><p>Camacho et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) studied the formation of glucose by pre-treating microcrystalline cellulose with 70% (w/v) sulfuric acid at a mass ratio of acid/dry cellulose ranging from 1.8 to 9.1, without any post-hydrolysis step. They obtained glucose yields not higher than 35% even if the pre-treatment time was as long as 30 h. Thus, pre-treatment in 72 wt% sulfuric acid is clearly not sufficient to achieve high glucose yields and a post-hydrolysis at reduced acid concentration is necessary to convert amorphous cellulose into glucose. However, adding water to dilute the sulfuric acid from 72 to 4&#x02013;10 wt% results in a large volume of mixture, which implies higher handling costs. This is why partial neutralization of the sulfuric acid by adding a base was considered as an efficient method to minimize the amount of water to be added for dilution.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Partial neutralization</title><sec><title>Influence of acid/base molar ratio</title><p>H<sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> or H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratios were directly used to compare between NH<sub>3(aq)</sub> and NaOH since both cases involve the neutralization of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

This observation was particularly important at low H<sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> molar ratios where the relative amount of NH<sub>3</sub> compared that of acid is larger than at high H<sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> molar ratios. The glucose yield was 30% when using an H<sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> molar ratio of 1 (low) and a mass ratio of sulfuric acid/dry cellulose of 12. A low H<sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> molar ratio implies that sulfuric acid concentration during post-hydrolysis was low and thus not sufficient to perform an efficient hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose. With higher H<sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> molar ratios, the sulfuric acid concentration during post-hydrolysis was higher and the lower glucose yields observed could be due to glucose degradation, although the concentration of 5-HMF in the hydrolysate was below the lower limit of quantification of the HPLC at these H<sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> molar ratios. Under the conditions tested in this work, the most efficient H<sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> molar ratios were found to range between 1.6 and 1.8.</p><p>With regards to using sodium hydroxide to partially neutralize the cellulose and acid mixture before post-hydrolysis, the trials were first conducted with a mass ratio of sulfuric acid/dry cellulose of 12 and, after observing that the highest glucose yield was obtained at a range of H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratio of 2.3&#x02013;2.5, only this range was investigated for mass ratios of sulfuric acid/dry cellulose of 24 and 36. The most efficient H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratios (2.3&#x02013;2.5) were subsequently found to be higher than the most efficient H<sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> ratios (1.6&#x02013;1.8). This observation could be explained by the fact that ammonia is a weak base and thus, more ammonia was needed to produce the required number of moles of hydroxide ions to get the same partial neutralization effect as with sodium hydroxide.</p><p>Nevertheless, in both cases, when an H<sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> molar ratio of 1.7 or an H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratio of 2.4 was used, the final mass percentage of sulfuric acid during the post-hydrolysis step was close to 19 wt% although the concentration of the base solutions used for partial neutralization was 29 wt% for ammonia and 20 wt% for sodium hydroxide. Thus, the H<sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> or H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratio providing the highest glucose yield was found to be greatly dependent on the final mass percentage of sulfuric acid used during post-hydrolysis and not related to the type of base used.

Solutions of 20 wt% NaOH and 40 wt% NaOH were compared by subjecting the cellulose to a 2 h pre-treatment at 30&#x000b0;C and 72 wt% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for a mass ratio of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/dry cellulose of 12, followed by a post-hydrolysis at 121&#x000b0;C for 10 min.

Results showed that glucose yield increased with the increasing H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratio until it reached a maximum at the most efficient H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ratio, before gradually decreasing beyond this point. However, the curve obtained with the 20 wt% NaOH solution reached a higher maximum glucose yield at higher H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratios. The most efficient H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ratios with 40 wt% NaOH and 20 wt% NaOH were between 1.9&#x02013;2.1 and 2.3&#x02013;2.5, respectively, and the highest glucose yield obtained with the 20 wt% NaOH solution was around 88%, which is about 1.1 times higher than that obtained with 40 wt% NaOH.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Effect of H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ratio on glucose yield with NaOH concentration of 20 wt% (&#x02666;) and 40 wt% (&#x025a0;) with a pre-treatment at 30&#x000b0;C, 72 wt% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for 2 h, mass ratio of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/dry cellulose of 12, and post-hydrolysis for 10 min at 121&#x000b0;C.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fchem-06-00117-g0007"/></fig><p>With an H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratio of 2 for 40 wt% NaOH and 2.5 for 20 wt% NaOH, the resulting solution after partial neutralization had a mass percentage of sulfuric acid close to 20 wt% in both cases. Thus, the difference in glucose yield observed between the 20 and 40 wt% NaOH solutions used for partial neutralization was most probably due to the quantity of water added with the base during the post-hydrolysis step. This difference in terms of water added together with the base also explains the observations reported in section Influence of Acid/Base Molar Ratio, namely glucose yield under most efficient conditions being higher with 20 wt% NaOH than with 29 wt% NH<sub>3</sub>. Thus, to get a high yield of glucose during post-hydrolysis, it is important to take into account not only the mass percentage of acid but also the quantity of water added during the partial neutralization step since the latter was shown to have a strong effect on the efficiency of post-hydrolysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Post-hydrolysis</title><sec><title>Effect of time and acid concentration</title><p>The impact of the post-hydrolysis time on the glucose yield using different H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratios is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. First, it can be observed that the standard deviation among the triplicates at the most efficient conditions (giving highest glucose yields) is very small, such that the associated error bars are hardly distinguishable in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. With an H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratio of 1.7, increasing the cooking period increased the yield of glucose, whereas with an H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratio of 2.3, increasing the post-hydrolysis time generally led to the opposite scenario. At a low H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratio, the acid concentration in the post-hydrolysis solution was also low such that increasing the cooking time led to the hydrolysis of the remaining amorphous cellulose. However, increasing the post-hydrolysis time at a higher H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ratio probably resulted in the degradation of glucose, although the concentration of 5-HMF in the hydrolysates remained below the lower quantification limit of the HPLC. The most efficient post-hydrolysis time giving the highest glucose yield was found to decrease as sulfuric acid concentration was increased for post-hydrolysis, namely by increasing the H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> molar ratio (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This can be of interest in an industrial process since less base would be required for a shorter post-hydrolysis time, producing a glucose-rich hydrolysate.
