To date, various measures have been developed to fulfill those needs. For example, the Perceived Health Competence Scale (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>) examines perceived self-efficacy associated with health perception and health behaviors of the individual. In another example, the Short Form Health Literacy Survey examines the degree to which an individual is capable of comprehending and applying health-related information (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Duong et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Yet, both measures fall short in their domain specificity in that they only assess a narrow aspect of health management. Additionally, they lack the ability to isolate target areas for future improvements.</p><p id="p0015">While each measure may have their respective strengths and focuses, few measures can comprehensively explore the extent to which individuals are able to effectively identify areas of concern, create a personalized plan of action for their health and target these areas for improvement. To date, few areas of research converge to highlight various areas of health management. Indeed, existing measures fail to capture several important skills that may be integral to health management.</p><p id="p0020">Review of the literature has identified seven important skills that relate to managing one's health. First, the ability for an individual to adapt to change has been shown to correlate with positive health outcomes throughout the lifespan (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Grzywacz et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, the level of commitment an individual exhibits to a specific task has been hypothesized to influence well-being (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Kelly, 2008</xref>). Third, the level of perceived control over one's own health correlates with better health outcomes assessed at midlife (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Lachman and Firth, 2004</xref>). In addition, a systematic review has identified that the access and availability of health information contribute to positive health outcomes in patients (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Giardina et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). In those previously diagnosed with a condition, the ability to adhere to prescribed health behaviors or regimes are key in experiencing positive changes or maintaining well-being in the face of chronic illness (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Osterberg and Blaschke, 2005</xref>). Additionally, the maintenance of positive outlook is key in fostering resilience and well-being despite adversities, such as impending surgery or chronic illness (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Duggal et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Finally, the availability of social support has been linked to lower rates of morbidity and mortality, and thus has been suggested to buffer against detrimental health outcomes throughout the lifespan (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Uchino, 2006</xref>). Taken together, these skills collectively help shape an individual's ability to manage health and medical concerns. To our knowledge, no existing measure successfully captures all of the above-stated skills in a single measure.</p><p id="p0025">Furthermore, there is a rapidly growing need for higher quality, integrated data in a format that can be used in combination with retrospective data such as insurance claim history or medical record data. There is an unmet need to provide a tool that delivers higher quality data on health status and health-related behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><label>1.2</label><title>What is the HSP?</title><p id="p0030">The Health Skills Profile (HSP&#x000a9;) is a digital assessment tool developed by MediResource Inc. (2012) that measures skills associated with improved health outcomes. The HSP focuses on these seven skills of health behaviors, including: adaptability, commitment, control, investigation, medical management, positivity, and social building. The intended goal of the HSP is to allow organizations and individuals to identify where they may stand, their strengths and/or weaknesses, and where to focus efforts, and resources, in order to maximize health behaviors. At its core, it is a communication tool for health behavior changes. The HSP measures seven health skills associated with effective health management by communicating tailored recommendations for skills to target according to responses.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><label>1.3</label><title>Aims and study objectives</title><p id="p0035">The aim of the current project is threefold: (a) to validate the HSP as a measure for assessing health-related skills, (b) to examine the overall acceptability of the HSP as a measure for evaluating specific skills, and (c) to explore the relationship between the HSP skills with existing validated measures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="p0040">Three hundred individuals participated in this study.

Criteria for the EFA were based on an un-rotated structure of correlations, and a minimum eigenvalue of one as a cut-off for the scree-plot. Results of the EFA indicate the presence of a uni-factor solution within the sampled items, where all 21-items loaded onto a single factor, which explained 39% of the variance with factor loadings ranging from .31 to .78.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0120">The current study reported evidence in support for both the feasibility and efficacy of the HSP in assessing health-related skills in a sample of full-time employees. The HSP had acceptable levels of internal consistency, as measured by Cronbach's alpha. Further, we found a positive relationship between HSP skills with their corresponding validated measures, and their corresponding VAS. Critically, we found that the correlations between the HSP skills and validated measures were stronger than the correlations between the VAS and validated measures. This finding indicates that to some extent, we were successful in capturing the skills of interest. Finally, an exploratory factor analysis confirmed a single factor solution, indicating that these skills cohesively represent a single construct of health management.</p><p id="p0125">We present the development and validation of the HSP in a sample of full-time employees in the United States and Canada. Results suggest that the HSP is successful in identifying unique skills related to health management, and can provide a comprehensive profile of health in both individuals and organizations. Further, these skills relate to existing validated measures, and thus suggest that the HSP is a promising scale for the general workforce. Future studies should examine the efficacy of HSP in identifying health-related skills in different populations, such as those with chronic illnesses, younger and/or older adults, and part-time employees. Further, we observed stronger correlations between the HSP and validated measures compared with the correlations between the VAS and validated measures. These findings suggest that HSP is a better instrument for assessing health skills relative to the VAS measures. Therefore, the HSP measure is a useful tool for the assessment of health-related skills in identifying both strengths and areas for target interventions.</p><p id="p0130">The HSP can be implemented as an online, mobile or paper-based survey. It was designed to be modular. Additional skills can be added to the existing 7 we measured here (adaptability, commitment, control, investigation, medical management, positivity, and social building). The HSP also includes a participant insight report, outlining the value of each skill and how an individual can improve each. Future enhancements for a workplace setting may include adding other skills to measure employee performance and productivity. Examples may be financial stress management or coping with stressful managers and co-workers. Further, managing employee related health plan costs is at an inflection point with the increasing social acceptance of mental health disorders. Costly short- and long-term disability claims for mental health will continue to rise with this increased social acceptance.</p><p id="p0135">There continues to be a large unmet need from employers and health insurance providers for scalable digital tools that identify specific areas of employee strength and weakness. Current tools identify whether an individual is &#x0201c;at risk&#x0201d;, however we are not aware of an assessment that provides a similar detailed behavior profile with an employee insight report. In this way, the HSP offers employers a new and practical tool that fits within today's workplace environment.</p><p id="p0140">Findings from the current study should be considered in lieu of some limitations. The Cronbach alphas for the Control skill domain on the HSP and the Commitment to Health Scale were low (&#x003b1; = .55; &#x003b1; = .58, respectively). Although these values suggest low internal consistency for these measures, test-retest consistency may be a more accurate indicator of the scale's reliability, which was not assessed in the current study but could be examined in future research. Sampling of the current study is conducted through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online human intelligence interface. Despite the heterogeneities in sampling, as well as the wide-geographical span of populations sampled across North America, it is possible that self-selection into completing this online study may bias the results. Another limitation is the single population in which we conducted our validation of the HSP. It may be that future studies sampled may find variations in associations and relationships not otherwise uncovered in the current study. Despite these limitations, the current study provides a comprehensive overview of health skills in a single measure of health management.</p><p id="p0145">Ultimately, findings from the HSP can be combined with other assessment data to develop more complete personalized profiles of individual and organizational health and health behaviors. While health insurance claims and clinical data are retrospective and have limitations in developing predictive and comprehensive profiles of individuals and organizations, the HSP provides behavioral data, that when combined with claims or clinical data, can develop more accurate and powerful predictive models for both the individual and the organization.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Declaration</title><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0150">Amy Shi, Michelle Rajpal: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0155">Paul Kostoff: Conceived and designed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0160">This work was supported by <funding-source id="gs1">MediResource Inc</funding-source>.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.3"><title>Competing interest statement</title><p id="p0165">The authors declare the following conflict of interests: All authors were employed by the organization that funded the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.4"><title>Additional information</title><p id="p0170">No additional information is available for this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Duggal</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sacks-Zimmerman</surname><given-names>Z.</given-names></name><name><surname>Liberta</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The impact of hope and resilience on multiple factors in neurosurgical patients</article-title><source>Cureus</source><volume>8</volume><year>2016</year><fpage>e849</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27909637</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Duong</surname><given-names>T.V.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>P.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>S.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>M.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chao</surname><given-names>W.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A&#x000a0;new comprehensive short-from Health Literacy Survey Tool for patients in general</article-title><source>Asian Nurs.
