Despite an increased effort toward basic research and drug discovery, many cardiovascular diseases still have no curative treatments. As a type of terminally differentiated cells, the application of cardiomyocytes (CMs) is hindered by the difficulties in obtaining human cardiac tissue and the inability to propagate heart samples in culture. Therefore, most existing research has utilized animal models to mimic human heart disease. However, critical physiological and biochemical differences exist between the animal and human heart, especially for CMs. Fortunately, human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology plays a vital role in the advancement of cardiovascular research and medicine and includes refined protocols for hiPSC reprogramming and cardiac differentiation that enable the derivation of human CMs with patient-specific phenotypes. This technology shows great potential in regenerative therapy and mechanistic investigations of cardiac diseases [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Previously, several hereditary cardiomyopathies were modeled <italic>in vitro</italic> using hiPSC technology, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), long QT syndrome (LQT) [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and LEOPARD syndrome . However, these <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived hiPSC-CMs are generally immature, with features resembling fetal CMs rather than adult myocardial tissue [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Unlike adult CMs, cultured hiPSC-CMs exhibit less organized sarcomeres and fewer mitochondria [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They also express much lower levels of genes that encode contractile proteins, comparable to fetal CMs, according to transcriptional profiling. Regarding the electrophysiological properties, hiPSC-CMs present immature action potentials [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], poorly developed SR and altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling properties [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] at early stages of differentiation [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as well as the absence of transverse tubules, automaticity, and a preference for glucose metabolism over fatty acid metabolism [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which are consistent with immature phenotypes. hiPSC-CMs are also limited in their ability to detect the mechanism of cardiac diseases. Lan et al. [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] generated disease-specific iPSC-CMs from patients carrying a hereditary HCM missense mutation in the <italic>MYH7</italic> gene, but the diseased iPSC-CMs displayed the HCM phenotype after prolonged culture (40 days). Hinson et al. [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] used engineered biomimetic culture systems to assess the mechanism of DCM caused by <italic>TTN</italic> mutation. Although various pro-maturation methods (prolonged culture time [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], mechanical stretch [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], electrical stimulation [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], modulation of substrate stiffness [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], cell aggregation patterning [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], chemical stimulation [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and the incorporation of CMs into 3D tissue constructs [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) have all been attempted with varying degrees of success, researchers have not clearly determined whether the physical formation of the multicellular structure affects the maturation of hiPSC-CMs.</p><p>Therefore, the elucidation of the maturation status, which has a fundamental effect on the physical and biochemical properties of hiPSC-CMs, is crucial. In this study, we hypothesized that different forms of CM aggregates would have different maturation statuses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>The starting density of stem cells produces different CM clusters with multiple forms</title><p>To generate CMs from pluripotent stem cells, we applied a small molecule-based differentiation method. Upon differentiation, we observed three typical forms of CM clusters: 1) isolated beating clusters at a lower efficiency and 2) net-shaped and 3) sheet-shaped CMs at higher efficiencies. When the efficiency/purity was greater than 90%, the derived CMs predominantly exhibited the latter forms. Spontaneous contraction could be observed from 7 days after induction, and the different shapes of CM clusters became distinguishable. The net-shaped cardiac cells beat vigorously, with a beating rate of up to 122 beats per min, and the sheet-shaped cardiac cells beat mildly at a lower rate of 80 beats per min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Movie S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Movie S2</xref>).</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The hiPSC seeding density is a determining factor in differentiating the two forms of cardiomyocyte clusters.</bold> (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) The beating rates of two forms of hiPSC-CMs; left panel: sheet-shaped CMs; right panel: net-shaped CMs. The movies are shown in the supplemental movies.

A higher density led to a less than 10% efficient net-shaped CM production. Under the defined condition of cardiac differentiation, these results are very well reproducible with a success rate of greater than 80% in more than 50 repeats. We performed flow cytometry using the cardiomyocyte marker TNNT2 to validate the efficiency of differentiating CMs with different shapes. The results showed a similar yield of TNNT2+ cells in the two shapes of CMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Net-shaped CMs are more mature than sheet-shaped CMs</title><p>During development, CMs undergo physiological hypertrophy characterized by increased cell size followed by changes in sarcomere structure, mitochondria content and organization and increased protein synthesis [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

The net-d15 CMs expressed higher levels of genes encoding contractile proteins, ion channels, junction proteins and metabolism-related proteins than the sheet-d15 CMs. Moreover, the fold change in cardiac maturation-related gene expression decreased in net-d15/sheet-d30 compared with the net-d15/sheet-d15, indicating that the net-shaped CMs were more similar to long-term cultured CMs (30 days) than to sheet-d15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Specifically, the net-shaped CMs were more mature than the sheet-shaped cells, suggesting that the physical formation of the multicellular structure could significantly affect the maturation of hiPSC-CMs. Even within the same culture, CMs exhibit various developmental or maturation statuses due to the different types of aggregates formed, which may lead to variations in gene expression profiles and contractile and ultrastructure properties. The generation of multicellular formation patterns of hiPSC-CMs is a common phenomenon, but no previous reports have described the differences among these patterns. Our study is the first to analyze the movement of net-shaped CMs and sheet-shaped CMs, and this morphological arrangement of hiPSC-CMs exerted a profound impact on their maturation status. Three typical forms of CM clusters are readily obtained using the small molecule-based differentiation method: isolated beating clusters, net-shaped CMs and sheet-shaped CMs. The isolated beating clusters were derived from a lower efficiency differentiation process. We then focused on the more reproducible net-shaped and sheet-shaped CMs, which were derived from differentiation proceeding at much higher efficiencies (80-95% TNNT2+). The percentages of ventricular and atrial cells were not significantly different in cells with the two distinct morphologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Interestingly, a lower seeding density (3.0&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> and 1.2&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) of hPSCs resulted in highly efficient net-shaped CM production. Different seeding densities could lead to the growth patterns of mesoderm specification and the following cardiogenesis, which eventually lead to the variation of 3D structure. This simple and effective method was used to obtain hPSC-CMs with the preferred morphologies.</p><p>The maturation of hiPSC-CMs is critical for their application in modeling of cardiac disease and in investigations of pathogenesis and regenerative medicine. Currently, several distinct approaches have been employed to promote the maturation of hiPSC-CMs, such as 3D culture methodology and the use of electrical stimulation in conjunction with stretching to mimic cardiac load, concurrently or sequentially. Other strategies include culturing in the presence of T3 thyroid hormone or insulin-like growth factor-1, the addition of laminin or native decellularized heart ECM into the hydrogel mixture and the use of stiffer substrates. Intra-, inter- and extracellular mechanical forces play vital roles in the differentiation and maturation of CMs, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We recognize that mechanical stretch and electrical stimulation are widely used in 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional culture systems to improve CM maturation and function <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, inappropriate external stimuli may contribute to CM damage and pathological consequences [<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our results offer a new strategy to improve the maturity of hiPSC-CMs. Researchers may find that they are using CMs from different batches or even pluripotent cell lines to assess phenotypes, which are significantly affected by maturity. In the present study, the net-shaped CMs contracted so vigorously that most of them detached, with only a few cells remaining attached. The maximum motion amplitude of their wave-like movements was up to 120 &#x003bc;m, which was even visible to the naked eye.</p><p>We observed improved cellular myofilament structure in net-shaped CMs, with physiological hypertrophy characterized by increased cell size, a developed sarcomeric structure, sensitivity to low concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonists and up-regulation of &#x003b1;-MHC and ANP expression, consistent with previous reports of mechanical stimulation-induced CM maturation [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, the beating rate of the net-shaped CMs remained at 2~3 Hz, which may be another reason for enhanced CM maturation. Our real-time PCR data revealed the significant up-regulation of late cardiac-specific genes such as <italic>CACNA1C</italic>, <italic>RYR2</italic> and <italic>KCNQ1</italic>, <italic>SERCA2a</italic>, <italic>SCN5A</italic>, <italic>KCNH2</italic>, and <italic>KCNJ2</italic>. This finding is consistent with other studies and resembles the pacing with electrical stimulation in 3D cultures or engineered heart tissue constructs [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The net-shaped cardiac cells contracted so vigorously that much more mechanical and electrical stimulation were generated, mimicking the &#x0201c;exercise&#x0201d; effects. Moreover, the CMs feedback with building up a more mature machinery with elevated capacity.</p><p>Intercellular mechanical coupling is necessary to ensure appropriate cardiac contraction, and this is facilitated by adherens junctions and desmosomes. Adherens junctions are the anchor-point of myofibrils that enable the transmission of the contractile force from one cell to another [<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the present study, we observed that the adherens junction and the desmosomes markers in cardiac N-cadherin and plakoglobin (GUP) are up-regulated at the transcriptional level. In addition to mechanical coupling, gap junctions mediate the intercellular electrical and metabolic coupling through direct communication between neighboring cells. The up-regulation of <italic>CX43</italic> in net-shaped CMs also suggested enhanced hiPSC-CMs maturation.</p><p>In summary, efficiently differentiated (greater than 85%) hiPSC-CMs exhibited two distinct morphologies: sheet-like and net-like patterns of multicellular formation. The latter showed accelerated maturation, based on the sarcomeric structure and cardiac gene expression. Based on these results, the physical formation of the multicellular structures significantly affects the maturation of hiPSC-CMs. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe that variations in hiPSC-CM morphology directly result from differentiation conditions and have a profound impact on their maturation status. Using appropriate induction conditions, particularly the seeding density, the net-shaped pattern of CMs was consistently generated, providing a new strategy for improving the maturation status of hiPSC-CMs</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Human pluripotent stem cell culture and cardiac differentiation</title><p>AC-hiPSCs (derived from skin fibroblasts, Cellapy, Beijing, China) and NKX2.5eGFP/W-hESCs (provided by Dr. Stanley from Monash University, Australia [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]) were employed in this study.
