By 2012, it is estimated that 528,000 cases of CC had been diagnosed, of which 266,000 died from CC worldwide.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Currently, the treatment methods for CC mainly include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, among which radiotherapy is the commonly used treatment for patients with the middle and advanced stages.<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, in clinical practices, a few patients often develop resistance to radiotherapy, resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes and even tumor recurrence and metastasis.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In addition to the clinicopathological features, the molecular biological characteristics of cancer cells might be the potential influencing factors for efficacy. Therefore, it is of great significance to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying radioresistance in CC patients.</p><p>Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is a crucial regulator of mRNA translation and protein synthesis and functions as a proto-oncogene that participates in cancer-related events such as malignant transformation, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis.<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The aberrant expression of eIF4E was reported to be associated with the occurrence and development of several tumors, such as retinoblastoma,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> esophageal cancer,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and prostate cancer (PCa).<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> With regards to the role of miR-499a-5p in CC, Wang et al found that the restoration of eIF4E promoted CC cell proliferation and migration.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In recent years, abundant studies provided strong evidence that downregulation of eIF4E significantly sensitizes CC cells to chemotherapy.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Although the role of eIF4E in CC progression has been characterized, little is known about its underlying mechanism.</p><p>MicroRNA (miRNA), a class of endogenous non-coding single-strand small molecule RNA of 18&#x02013;25 nucleotides in length, which is post-transcriptionally regulating eukaryotic gene expression through binding to 3&#x002b9;-untranslated regions (UTR) of target gene.<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In this way, several miRNAs participate in diverse biological processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration, and tumorigenesis. Among these miRNAs, miRNA-499a-5p has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in a series of cancers. For instance, Liu et al found that the overexpression of miR-499a-5p repressed proliferation and differentiation of osteosarcoma cells by negatively regulating its target gene protein phosphatase 1D (PPM1D) through modulation of Akt/synthase kinase 3&#x003b2; (GSK-3&#x003b2;) signaling.<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Additionally, it has been reported that miR-499a-5p promoted lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and enhanced tumor growth in vivo.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, the expression of miR-499a-5p in CC tissues remains unclear, and whether it modulated the radiosensitivity of CC cells is still unknown. Additionally, the interrelation of miR-499a-5p and eIF4E in CC development was also not completely elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to explore the role and mechanism of miR-499a-5p on proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration, EMT, and radiosensitivity of CC.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Patients and Sample Collection</title><p>Between January 2016 and January 2018, we recruited 50 patients with cervical cancer from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University.

In addition, upregulation of eIF4E also could partially reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-499a-5p overexpression on the migration of Hela and CaSki cells (<xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).<fig id="F0005" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>eIF4E overexpression reversed the effect of miR-499a-5p on CC cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration.

It was demonstrated that miR-499a-5p overexpression inhibited colony formation in both Hela and CaSki cells after X-ray irradiation, whereas eIF4E upregulation markedly overturned this effect, suggesting that miR-499a-5p targeting eIF4E enhanced the radiosensitivity of CC cells by reducing colony formation (<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="F0007" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Overexpression of miR-499a-5p enhanced the radiosensitivity of CC cells via targeting eIF4E.

Our results showed that miR-499a-5p expression was declined in CC which inhibited tumor cell proliferation, invasion, EMT, and migration, and facilitated cell apoptosis. Additionally, eIF4E was confirmed as a direct target gene of miR-499a-5p. It was further observed in the current study that overexpression of miR-499a-5p sensitizes CC cells to radiotherapy.</p><p>Increasing evidence has revealed that miRNAs are widely involved in the occurrence and development of various tumors, including CC. For example, Shi and Zhang suggested that miR-362 overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CC cells through targeting sineoculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1).<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Liang et al indicated that miR-187 inhibited the proliferation and promoted apoptosis of CC cells, at least partly through repression of the fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) expression.<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Moreover, Hua et al demonstrated that miR-338-3p suppressed CC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis via downregulating target gene metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1) through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> MiR-499a-5p has gained increasing attention in cancer research because of its anti-tumor action. The aberrant downregulation of miR-499a-5p expression has been identified in oral squamous cell carcinoma,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> osteosarcoma,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and lung adenocarcinoma;<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> however, little is known regarding its expression in CC. Here, in this study, we firstly determined the expression level of miR-499a-5p in CC tissues and cell lines by qRT-PCR and found that miR-499a-5p was significantly downregulated in CC tissues and cells. MTT and flow cytometry analysis showed that miR-499a-5p reduced proliferation and facilitated apoptosis in CC cells. Transwell assay and Western blotting showed that overexpression of miR-499a-5p dramatically suppressed the invasion of CC cells by increasing E-cadherin expression and inhibiting N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail-1 expression. Wound healing assay showed that overexpression of miR-499a-5p dramatically suppressed the migration capabilities of CC cells. Then, we further investigated the molecular mechanism by which miR-499a-5p exerted its regulatory effects on CC cells.</p><p>eIF4E, a rate-limiting protein, is critical for translational regulation. The highly expressed eIF4E has been demonstrated in various types of cancers, including CC.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> eIF4E could be negatively regulated by upstream miRNAs and contribute to the progression of cancers. For example, miR-34c-3p suppressed non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by targeting eIF4E.<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> MiR-15a downregulated eIF4E to decrease cell proliferation and invasion, and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in renal cell carcinoma.<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> MiR-455-3p inhibited the cap-dependent translation and proliferation of prostate cancer cells partly by downregulation of eIF4E expression.<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These findings tempted us to speculate that miR-499a-5p exerted anti-cancer effect via negatively regulating eIF4E expression since upregulated eIF4E was observed in CC tissues and cells. Functional analysis further confirmed that similar to miR-499a-5p overexpression, siRNA-mediated suppression of eIF4E expression repressed proliferation, invasion, migration, EMT, and improved apoptosis of CC cells. Luciferase assay verified that miR-499a-5p directly targeted eIF4E. Additionally, our results showed that eIF4E was negatively regulated by miR-499a-5p and partially reversed miR-499a-5p-induced changes in proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, EMT, and migration.</p><p>Recently, accumulating evidence has strongly implied that miRNAs are associated with radiosensitivity of multiple cancers, including CC. For example, Liu et al found that miR-132 was downregulated in radiotherapy-sensitive CC patients and cells, and inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis and radiosensitivity of CC cells by targeting Bmi-1.<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Wu et al exhibited that miR-15a-3p was increased in radiation-exposed CC cells and overexpression of miR-15a-3p sensitized CC to irradiation by inhibiting tumor protein D52.<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Our data demonstrated that eIF4E overexpression abolished radiosensitization induced by transfection of miR-499a-5p mimic in CC cells.</p><p>In summary, our study for the first time suggested that miR-499a-5p functioned as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT and enhancing apoptosis and radiosensitivity of CC cells in vitro by downregulating eIF4E. Our research might provide a novel preventive and a therapeutic option for CC.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0005"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>MiR-499a-5p was down-regulated in CC tissues and cell lines.</p></list-item><list-item><p>MiR-499a-5p overexpression or eIF4E knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT, and enhanced apoptosis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>eIF4E was predicted and verified as a target gene of miR-499a-5p.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The influence of miR-499a-5p upregulation was abrogated by eIF4E overexpression.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="S0006"><title>Data Sharing Statement</title><p>All data in this study can be obtained by proper request from the authors.</p></sec><sec id="S0007"><title>Ethics and Consent Statement</title><p>The present study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University.
