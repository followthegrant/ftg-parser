A suspicion of malignant sarcoma often arises at a later stage (i.e. during surgery). The prognosis is poor, with a mean survival between 3&#x02009;months and 1&#x02009;year. Since the disease is rare, there is no consensus on optimal treatment.

</p></sec><sec><title>Case presentation</title><p>In August 2015, a routine follow-up echocardiography showed recurrence, and the patient was referred to the cardiology department at our hospital. She did not experience any (cardiac) complaints. On physical examination, she had normal heart sounds without heart murmurs. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) showed two mobile masses in the posterior of the left atrium. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of multiple mobile masses at the site of the septum, coumadin-ridge, right upper pulmonary vein, and left lower pulmonary vein and were interpreted as mural thrombotic masses (<italic>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ytz005-F1">1</xref></italic>). Radiological CMR imaging features best fitted the diagnosis of mural thrombotic masses and were interpreted by both a cardiologist and a cardiac radiologist (<italic>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ytz005-F2">2</xref></italic>)<italic>.</italic> Furthermore, removal of endothelium during initial surgery increases the possibility of the formation of thrombotic masses. Nevertheless, myxoma could not yet be excluded (<italic>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ytz005-F2">2</xref>D</italic>). Anticoagulation treatment in order to decrease the thrombotic masses was started. Despite adequate anticoagulation levels for 2 months, the left atrial masses did not decrease in size and surgical removal was indicated.

The large tumour seen on TOE was resected, together with a large part of the wall of the left atrium (<italic>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ytz005-F3">3</xref></italic>). A margin near the mitral valve was kept to place sutures for reconstruction. Another small tumour-like structure was removed from the atrial septum at the location of the oval foramen and the atrial septum was repaired with a pericardial patch (3 &#x000d7; 6 cm). Peroperative pathological frozen section analysis suggested malignancy. After inspecting the remaining left atrium, it was concluded that no more tissue could be resected. A total reconstruction of the left atrium through an autologous pericardial patch (10 &#x000d7; 15 cm) was performed. The surgery proceeded uncomplicated and the patient recovered well, aside from developing atrial fibrillation. Post-operatively, an echocardiography was performed and showed no masses in the left atrium.

There were no areas of necrosis. Extensive immunohistochemical workup was performed, showing strong and uniform expression of CD56 and sparse and heterogeneous positivity for pan-keratin, smooth muscle actin, and CD99. Other smooth muscle, lipomatous, vascular, melanocytic, and epithelial markers were negative. The resection margins were positive.

Based on immunophenotypical and molecular (MDM2-FISH, SS18-FISH) characteristics, other classes of sarcoma, including synovial sarcoma and (dedifferentiated) liposarcoma were excluded. However, expression of CD56 leaves a differential diagnostic possibility of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, although morphological features argue against this classification. Unfortunately it was not possible to re-evaluate the first tumour resected in January 2015, since this was performed in another country.</p><p>A PET-CT was performed to evaluate possible metastasis. High FDG uptake, suggestive of metastasis, was found in the right femur. This was histologically confirmed with a CT-guided biopsy.</p><p>The patient was treated with five sessions of radiotherapy to the right femur. Due to the risk of tumour embolism as side effect of radiation, radiation therapy was not performed at the site of the cardiac mass, despite the positive resection margins after surgery. After treatment, patient returned to her country of origin. Several months later she returned for follow-up. Clinical condition of the patient had deteriorated over these months and she reported increasing fatigue and weight loss. An echocardiography was performed and showed a recurrence as a 6.5 &#x000d7; 2.2&#x02009;cm large mass in the left atrium, passing through the mitral valve. Best supportive care was started, and the patient passed away in January 2017.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this case report, we describe a very rare malignant tumour in the left atrium, with the initial suspected diagnosis of a cardiac myxoma with thrombus but which after subsequent resection was diagnosed as a primary cardiac intimal spindle cell sarcoma. The rarity of this tumour and its radiological similarities to benign cardiac myxoma and thrombi on both CMR imaging and echocardiography present a diagnostic challenge when evaluating patients pre-operatively. Pathological examination of the tumour tissue is essential in correctly identifying this unique tumour. Therefore, a malignant spindle cell sarcoma may only be diagnosed after surgical resection. Performing the PET-CT before the surgery would not have changed the decision to perform surgery, since there still would be doubts about the mass in the left atrium. In retrospect, the first suspicion and confirmation of a malignant origin of the mass was made during surgery. Unfortunately the tumour could not be radically resected and recurrence presented 5&#x02009;months after surgery with a fatal outcome 11&#x02009;months after surgery.</p><p>
