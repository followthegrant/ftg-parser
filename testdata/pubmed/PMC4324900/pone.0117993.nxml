While over 200 MS susceptibility loci have been identified in GWAS, the underlying mechanisms whereby they contribute to disease susceptibility remains ill-defined. Forward genetics approaches using conventional laboratory mouse strains are useful in identifying and functionally dissecting genes controlling disease-relevant phenotypes, but are hindered by the limited genetic diversity represented in such strains. To address this, we have combined the powerful chromosome substitution (consomic) strain approach with the genetic diversity of a wild-derived inbred mouse strain. Using experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS, we evaluated genetic control of disease course among a panel of 26 consomic strains of mice inheriting chromosomes from the wild-derived PWD strain on the C57BL/6J background, which models the genetic diversity seen in human populations. Nineteen linkages on 18 chromosomes were found to harbor loci controlling EAE. Of these 19 linkages, six were male-specific, four were female-specific, and nine were non-sex-specific, consistent with a differential genetic control of disease course between males and females. An MS-GWAS candidate-driven bioinformatic analysis using orthologous genes linked to EAE course identified sex-specific and non-sex-specific gene networks underlying disease pathogenesis. An analysis of sex hormone regulation of genes within these networks identified several key molecules, prominently including the MAP kinase family, known hormone-dependent regulators of sex differences in EAE course. Importantly, our results provide the framework by which consomic mouse strains with overall genome-wide genetic diversity, approximating that seen in humans, can be used as a rapid and powerful tool for modeling the genetic architecture of MS. Moreover, our data represent the first step towards mechanistic dissection of genetic control of sexual dimorphism in CNS autoimmunity.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This investigation was supported by National Multiple Sclerosis Society grant #RG 4471A6/2 (E.P.B. and C.T.)

MS prevalence is ~3 fold higher in females, although the disease course in men typically presents as a more rapid severe progressive disease [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The etiopathogenesis of MS is largely unknown; however, it is clear that it involves both genetic and environmental factors [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The heritability of MS is estimated to be ~30%, largely associated with the inheritance of susceptible HLA haplotypes that are present in up to 70% of MS cases [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, polymorphisms in multiple other genes have also been associated with disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and together contribute to 20% of the genetic variance underlying disease risk [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], suggesting that an HLA-dependent polygenic model with multiple minor interacting loci underlies the genetic component of MS susceptibility. In the GWAS analyses, the contribution of each of these genes is small (often &#x0003c;1%), thus both the importance of their roles in pathogenesis and the mechanisms by which different alleles act are difficult to test. Consequently, mouse models of MS are required for discerning the identities and effects of MS-GWAS gene candidates, and understanding the genetic architecture of autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) from an evolutionary perspective.</p><p>Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal autoimmune model of MS, is elicited by sensitization of genetically susceptible animals with myelin antigens in conjunction with adjuvants [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In mice, the strain, immunogen, and adjuvants used determine whether the clinical signs follow an acute, chronic or remitting-relapsing disease course [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example, immunization of SJL mice with the proteolipid protein peptide 139&#x02013;151 elicits primarily a remitting-relapsing disease course, whereas immunization of C57BL/6 (B6) mice with the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide 35&#x02013;55 results in chronic-progressive EAE. Although CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are the primary effectors in both models, differences do exist with respect to the role of anti-myelin autoantibodies and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the pathogenesis of MOG-induced EAE [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Remarkably, given that B6 mice are the &#x02018;genome&#x02019; strain, and are widely used for both EAE and reverse genetics, there are no known genetic studies mapping either quantitative or binary trait loci (QTL/BTL) controlling MOG-induced EAE in B6 mice.</p><p>QTL underlying natural variation require map-based cloning for their sequence identification and delineation of the causative quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This approach is lengthy, and involves the identification of parental strains that differ in the trait of interest, establishment of a segregating population, phenotyping and genotyping of progeny, and QTL-based linkage analysis. Subsequently, physical mapping by marker-assisted selection on a pure genetic background is required to confirm the existence of a QTL and to begin the process of high resolution interative congenic mapping, where the physical location of the QTL is restricted and the number of candidate genes and potential QTNs are significantly reduced. Consomic lines, also known as chromosome (Chr) substitution strains, are unique in that they allow for accelerated detection of QTL/BTLs by direct genome-wide physical mapping [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, the existence of consomic strains with different wild-derived diploid Chrs and conplastic strains with mitochondrial DNA on a pure genetic background, such as B6, overcomes the relative lack of genetic diversity inherent in classical laboratory inbred strains [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and more accurately reflects the greater evolutionarily selected genetic diversity seen in humans.</p><p>PWD/PhJ mice are an inbred strain descended from a pair of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>m</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> wild mice trapped in 1974.

The genetic diversity between B6 and PWD mice is ~55% compared to ~12% among classical laboratory inbred strains (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phenome.jax.org/">http://phenome.jax.org/</ext-link>). Moreover, compared to classical laboratory inbred strains, wild-derived strains are, in general, more resistant to a variety of pathogens, most notably viral infections [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In comparison to B6, PWD mice have proportionally more neutrophils and total CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but decreased B cells and NK cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phenome.jax.org/">http://phenome.jax.org/</ext-link> and [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Consomic B6 mice bearing single Chrs from the PWD strain typically display a continuous distribution of these phenotypes [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Lastly, these two strain share the same H2<sup>b</sup> haplotype allowing analysis of genetic variation on disease independent of effects from MHC differences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jaxmice.jax.org/literature/catalog/mhc_h2_haplotypes.pdf">http://jaxmice.jax.org/literature/catalog/mhc_h2_haplotypes.pdf</ext-link>).</p><p>In this report, we studied a panel of 26 C57BL/6J-Chr#<sup>PWD/PhJ</sup>/ForeJ (B6-Chr#<sup>PWD/PhJ</sup>) consomic and sub-consomic strains of mice to identify QTL/BTL controlling MOG-induced EAE in B6 mice. Nineteen linkages on 18 chromosomes exhibited evidence of harboring QTL/BTL controlling MOG-EAE. Of these 19 linkages, six were male-specific, four were female-specific, and nine were non-sex-specific, consistent with a differential genetic control of disease course between males and females. An MS-GWAS candidate-driven bioinformatic analysis using orthologous genes linked to EAE susceptibility identified sex-specific and non-sex-specific gene networks underlying disease pathogenesis.

Given the EAE sexual dimorphism in B6 mice (<bold><xref rid="pone.0117993.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref></bold>), the EAE data for female and males were analyzed separately. Like B6 mice, disease course for the entire B6-Chr#<sup>PWD/PhJ</sup> consomic panel was sexually dimorphic, with greater disease seen in males (<xref rid="pone.0117993.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

When a significant effect on overall disease course of a Chr or Chr-interval was detected in one sex but not the other, it was designated as a sex-specific-QTL/BTL controlling disease course.

In contrast, all the male-specific linkages were associated with increased disease severity, with the exception of Chr 6. Non-sex-specific EAE-QTL/BTL residing on Chrs 12, 16, and X.2 were associated with increased disease severity while Chrs 2, 4, 8, 10.2, 10.3, 15 decreased severity. Thus, a total of 9/19 linkages showed increased disease course associated with PWD alleles. More striking is the finding that the genetic load underlying MOG-EAE in female and male B6 mice is sexually dimorphic, with the female genetic load being less than that of males (4 female-specific linkages vs. 6 male-specific linkages). Moreover, the distribution of alleles contributing to increased disease severity is sexually dimorphic in that 1/4 female-specific QTL/BTL have PWD alleles, whereas 5/6 male-specific linkages contributing to increased disease are from PWD.</p><p>Importantly, with respect to modeling the genetic architecture of MS, we compared the genetic diversity between the B6 and PWD alleles of the orthologues of the current best list of non-MHC MS susceptibility variants [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It should be noted that this list of MS-GWAS candidates is not final since linkage disequilibrium has hindered identification of the particular variant and gene responsible in many regions of interest. The analysis revealed a remarkable degree of genetic diversity among the orthologous alleles (<bold><xref rid="pone.0117993.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>)</bold>.

The two parent strains are highly dissimilar, and thus, a significant portion of the genome is polymorphic and can be interrogated for the presence of EAE-modifying loci. Second, QTL or BTL congenic strains are usually constructed after expensive linkage mapping in backcrosses or F2 intercrosses; but too often, the effect of any single QTL interval is too small for positional cloning to be successful without requiring very large cohorts of congenic and control mice with the susceptible or resistant haplotypes at the QTL. In addition, necessary epistatic interactions with other donor-derived genes are unpredictable and their absence after selecting mono-interval congenic lines generally reduces the action of the selected QTL. In our previous genetic analysis of EAE QTL/BTL in congenic mice, many of these difficulties were encountered [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, by testing consomic strains, one may choose mice that have a uniform B6 background, have the desired EAE phenotype, and nevertheless bear only a single Chr or portion of a Chr from the donor strain, in this case, PWD. This completely reduces all but syntenic sources of epistasis from confounding EAE QTL/BTL identification when such consomic intervals have been reduced by selective breeding.</p><p>The most useful consomics are those that carry a robust EAE QTL/BTL on the smallest PWD-derived interval. Such strains include B6-Chr10.2<sup>PWD/PhJ</sup>, B6-Chr10.3<sup>PWD/PhJ</sup>, B6-Chr11.1<sup>PWD/PhJ</sup>, and ChrX.2<sup>PWD/PhJ</sup> mice [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

<italic>In Silico</italic> Analysis Reveals the Influence of Sex Hormone-Dependent Signaling Pathways on Genetic Control of the EAE Sexual Dimorphism</title><p>Sex hormones contribute to the sexual dimorphism in MS and EAE [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To tease apart the signaling pathways whereby androgens and estrogens contribute to the sexual dimorphism in our model, we utilized a network based bioinformatic approach. First, we generated gene lists of the polymorphic MS-GWAS orthologues residing within EAE-QTL/BTL that were male, female, or non-sex-specific. These lists were used to identify the top associated functional gene networks (<bold><xref rid="pone.0117993.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0117993.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). Next, within these networks, we identified genes that were predicted to be regulated by estrogens and/or androgens. These genes included <italic>Rac</italic>, <italic>Erk</italic>, <italic>Pkc</italic>, <italic>Il-1</italic>, <italic>Akt</italic>, <italic>Pi3k</italic>, and members of the MAPK family, including p38 MAPK. The MAPK family is the largest group of interactors, and this is especially striking for p38 MAPK, a kinase shown by us and others to be central to many aspects of EAE pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Most strikingly, our recent results indicate that p38 MAPK signaling can control EAE pathogenesis in a hormone-dependent, sexually dimorphic fashion [<xref rid="pone.0117993.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Importantly, the MAPK family interacts extensively with the male- and female-specific gene networks (<bold><xref rid="pone.0117993.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). Taken together, these findings support our model whereby p38 and other MAPKs function as a central node integrating hormonal signals to regulate the genetic control of the sexual dimorphism in CNS autoimmunity.</p><fig id="pone.0117993.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0117993.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Influence of sex hormone-dependent signaling pathways on genetic control of the EAE sexual dimorphism.</title><p>Gene lists were generated using the polymorphic MS-GWAS orthologues residing within EAE-QTL/BTL that were either male-specific, female-specific, or non-sex-specific.

We have employed MOG-induced EAE, a mouse model of MS, in consomic B6-Chr#<sup>PWD/PhJ</sup> mice to map disease-specific QTL/BTL, and to evaluate the sex differences inherent to each. Use of consomic strains between B6 and the wild-derived inbred PWD strain allowed us to overcome the lack of genetic diversity in classical inbred laboratory strains to better reflect the greater evolutionarily selected genetic diversity of humans, to model MS genetics. The vast majority of the orthologous MS-GWAS candidates are polymorphic between B6 and PWD mice (<bold><xref rid="pone.0117993.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref></bold>). We find (1) sexual dimorphism in the consomic mice, where males are more susceptible to MOG-EAE (<bold><xref rid="pone.0117993.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0117993.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>) and (2) utilization of the MAPK family, as a central regulatory hub for hormonal control of the sexual dimorphism in B6 mice (<bold><xref rid="pone.0117993.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). Importantly, our results provide a framework in which the increased genetic diversity of wild-derived inbred consomic strains can provide a better understanding of polygenic human diseases. Such studies may identify critical pathways and networks that can be targeted for sex-specific therapeutic intervention and/or prevention in MS. Our studies suggest that readily druggable kinase and hormonal signaling pathways are plausible targets for such therapeutic intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Mice</title><p>Male and female C57BL/6J (B6), C57BL/6J-Chr 1<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 2<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 3<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 4<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 5<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 6<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 8<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 9<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 10.1<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 10.2<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 10.3<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 11.1<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 11.2<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 11.3<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 12<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 14<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 15<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 16<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 17<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 18<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, C57BL/6J-Chr 19<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ, and C57BL/6J-Chr Y<sup>PWD/Ph</sup>/ForeJ (abbreviated throughout the text as either B6-Chr, Chr#, or simple #) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and allowed 2 weeks to acclimate to the UVM animal facility before any experimental procedures were carried out.
