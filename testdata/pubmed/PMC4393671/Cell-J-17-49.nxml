may be painful. Nowadays, we can&#x02019;t be sure about effectiveness of procedure for hypertrophic scar management. The application of stem cells with natural scaffold has been the
best option for treatment of burn wounds and skin defect, in recent decades. Fibrin glue
(FG) was among the first of the natural biomaterials applied to enhance skin deformity in
burn patients. This study aimed to identify an efficient, minimally invasive and economical
transplantation procedure using novel FG from human cord blood for treatment of hypertrophic scar and regulation collagen synthesis.
</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p> In this case series study, eight patients were selected with hypertrophic scar due to full-thickness burns. Human keratinocytes and fibroblasts derived
from adult skin donors were isolated and cultured. They were tested for the expression of
cytokeratin 14 and vimentin using immunocytochemistry. FG was prepared from pooled
cord blood. Hypertrophic scars were extensively excised then grafted by simply placing
the sheet of FG containing autologous fibroblast and keratinocytes. Histological analyses
were performed using Hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) and Masson&#x02019;s Trichrome (MT) staining of the biopsies after 8 weeks.
</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> Cultured keratinocytes showed a high level of cytokeratin 14 expression and

These scars are unsightly, deforming and may reduce, but never totally disappear. Tissue engineering is the principal therapeutic strategy for treatment of post-burn hypertrophic scars. Deformed skin is replaced by scaffolds and/or cells (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In tissue engineering the healing valence of the patient is enhanced and guided, enabling damaged skin to be reformed and its natural functions repaired (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In tissue engineering, one of the fundamental purposes of cell biologists is to stimulate cell proliferation by tailored culturing conditions (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The ideal scaffold should have tissue mechanical traits, show immunologic integrity, support cell adhesion, proliferation and migration. One of the natural biodegradable and biocompatible scaffold is fibrin glue, which provides an excellent bed for cell attachment, migration, proliferation and wound healing (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Fibrin glue ( FG ) made up of two components fibrinogen and thrombin that are utilized to glue them together. Thrombin is the same of enzyme changes fibrinogen three-dimensional gel. FG plays a main role in homeostasis, inflammation, wound healing and angiogenesis regulation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Degradation of FG scaffold induces acute phase response in wound healing. Collagen synthesis organization and fibril adjustment of different cell types is increased in fibrin scaffolds. In contact with FG, cells will slowly replace the FG scaffold by tissue-specific extracellular matrix. Combining different skin cell types cause selforganization within the scaffold, mimicking the natural dermis. Migration and proliferation of fibroblasts in the fibrin scaffold in 2-3 days has been seen in co-cultures of keratinocytes with dermal fibroblasts (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Fibroblasts were stimulated to generate collagen in response to transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-&#x003b2; ) in a fibrin scaffold (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) so; these properties are the main reasons of FG application in skin tissue engineering. The commercial FG made-up of lyophilized pooled human fibrinogen and thrombin. These structures may increase a risk of an immunological reaction and disease transfer. The more difficult to cost of autologous fibrin glues are often incorporated into a preexisting blood bank. Therefore, low cost, short preparation time, and eschew the potential risk of foreign body reactions all play a role of application cord blood fibrin for skin tissue engineering (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In this study, we transplanted a composite of autologous fibroblasts and keratinocytes into excised burn hypertrophic scars in 8 patients using cord blood FG and monitored clinical outcomes for 8 weeks. We tested whether the effect of fibrin gel enriched with human autologous fibroblasts and keratinocytes has beneficial effects on the final treatment outcome in 2 patients with excised burn hypertrophic scars. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Patient selection and method of hypertrophic excision</title><p>In this case series study, 8 patients selected with hypertrophic scar due to full-thickness burns. The size of scars was 10 cm<sup>2</sup>. Five cases were female ( 20-45 years ) and 3 were male ( 25-30 years ). The average distribution age was 29 years. The punch 3 cm<sup>2</sup>of hypertrophic scar were punched and completely removed by scalpel and then grafted by FG sheet that follow up 8 weeks. </p></sec><sec><title>Primary human keratinocyte and fibroblast cell culture</title><p>This study was approved by Ethical Commitee of Royan Institute. After obtaining informed consent, normal human keratinocyte and fibroblast cells were derived from 8 patients with hypertrophic scar. Skin biopsies were obtained from the buttock for keratinocytes and the ear for fibroblasts. All donors had serologically negative human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis virus type B, hepatitis virus type C and syphilis. Each biopsy was washed in Hank&#x02019;s buffered salt solution ( HBSS, Gibco, USA ) containing 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin ( Gibco, USA ) and was incubated in dispase ( Gibco, USA, 1.2 U/ml ) solution at 4&#x002da;C overnight. After separaC tion of the epidermis from the dermis, the epidermis and dermis were cut into small pieces and then keratinocyte and fibroblasts were isolated from the epidermis and dermis by incubation in 0.25% Trypsin/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) ( Gibco, USA ) for 10 minutes at 37&#x002da;C and 0.1% collagenase I ( Sigma, USA ) enzyme for 4 hours at 37&#x002da;C. Trypsin/EDTA and collagenase I enzymes were neutralized with culture medium containing 10% serum and a cell suspension obtained by pipetting. The supernatant was discarded and the cell suspension was filtered using a 70 &#x003bc;m nylon mesh filter ( BD, USA ). Each cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm and the cell pellet re-suspended in normal saline to be counted using a hemocytometer ( Bright-Line&#x02122;, USA ). Finally, isolated keratinocyte was cultured by seeding 6-well cell culture plate in fibroblast basal medium ( FBM, Gibco, USA ) + keratinocyte growth medium ( KGM, Gibco, USA ) at 37&#x002da;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>at 95% humidity. Isolated dermis fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 ( Gibco, USA ) containing fetal bovine serum ( FBS, 10%, Hyclone, USA ), L-glutamine ( Gibco, USA ), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin at 37&#x002da;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>at 95% humidity. The culture medium was changed every two days. A final density of 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>cells/ml dermis fibroblasts and 5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>cells/ml epidermis keratinocytes were used at third passage and first passage for culture on FG, respectively. The result of microbial endotoxin and mycoplasma tests in cultivated keratinocytes and fibroblasts should be negative if they are to be used for transplantation. </p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of a composite of fibrin with fibroblast and keratinocyte cells</title><p>Human FG derived from pooled cord blood was obtained from the Royan Regenerative Medicine Center for medical application and was used in this study.

The mixed "cell thrombin part" was added to 3 ml fibrinogen ( 40 mg/ml ) on the floor of 60 mm cell culture dishes. After clot formation of FG ( 5 minutes ), 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>autologous fibroblasts were seeded on solidification of the FG. This scaffold was incubated at 37&#x002da;C in 90% humidity and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-concentration for 3 hours in FBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A,B</xref>). FG containing autologous fibroblast and keratinocyte cells were removed from the 60 mm cell culture dishes with the aid of two forceps and transplanted upside down on the excised hypertrophic scars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C,D,E</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for characterization of cultured cells</title><p>Human keratinocytes and fibroblasts were fixed for IHC staining using 4% paraformadehyde ( Sigma, USA ) for 5 minutes, then washed 2 times.

Targeted primer was designed with primer 3. Total RNA was extracted from fibroblast cells with trayzol ( Sigma, USA ). Extracted RNA was treated with 1 U/ml of RNase-free DNase I ( EN0521, Fermentas, Germany ) per 1 mg of RNA in order to eliminate residual DNA in the presence of 40 U/mL of ribonuclease inhibitor ( E00311, Fermentas, Germany ) and 1X reaction buffer with MgCl<sub>2</sub>( Sigma, USA ) for 30 minutes at 37&#x002da;C.

Some researchers have focused on the immune regulation of collagen generation and deposition. Different kinds of cytokines have been shown to adjust collagen deposition, including, platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and TGF-&#x003b2;. Unusual expression of these factors or genes may cause excessive deposition of the dermal matrix in hypertrophic scars (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). There is no ideal therapy for hypertrophic scars (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Therapeutic methods include different combinations of triamcinolone, surgical excision, pressure therapy, silicone, radiotherapy. Surgical excision for keloids and hypertrophic scars has a relapse rate ranging from 45-100%. Utilizing an autograft for covering the excision site decreases the risk of forming hypertrophic scars at the donor site. There have been some experiments using an artificial neodermis. Integra was applied to enhance accelerate wound after excision of a large hypertrophic scar in addition to 5% imiquimod cream. There was no recurrence mentioned after 8 month follow-up (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In our study we used cord blood FG containing fibroblast and keratinocyte cells for coverage of the hypertrophic scar excision site. One of the hypotheses in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic scar is that enhanced mechanical pressure located on the healing wound misaligns the orientation of the collagen formation and caused hypertrophic scar formation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In fact, during the healing of a skin wound, the defect is provisionally closed with fibrin clot. This clot is afterward permeated by inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, keratinocyte and granulation tissue (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We think that FG scaffold is an acutely useful method in surgery, graft adherence and cellular migration. Also, it is an effective carrier system for cultivated keratinocytes, fibroblasts and growth factors. Currie et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) has evaluated the positive and negative role of FG in skin tissue engineering. One of the major advantages of our new culture system is the use of widely available cord blood samples for the fabrication of fibrin gels. Our source of FG differs from a commercially available fibrin gel. The cord blood is a safe and available source for FG. Cultivation of keratinocytes on FG and fibroblasts is easy to handle. In hypertrophic scars, dermal fibroblasts represent production of collagen and matrix metalloproteinase leading to distinguished dermal collagen proliferation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Therefore, even after excision of the hypertrophic scar it will produce dermal collagen proliferation. However, it is our hypothesis that FG will discontinue the uncommon process of dermal collagen proliferation at the hypertrophic scar excision site (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Our results from this small pilot study display that with the use of FG containing autologous fibroblasts and keratinocytes after hypertrophic scar excision, recurrence is not lower compared with historic data from other studies using commercial FG. Also in this study we are able to differentiate between relapse and treatment of except based on clinical appearance of the wound. In future studies, it may be beneficial to evaluate clinical appearance and histology of the scar tissue for long follow-up ( 12-24 months ). </p><p>Additional future research is necessary to further evaluate this treatment option and to determine the effectiveness of using fibrin scaffold with anti scar drug and cell therapy after hypertrophic scar excision. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides evidence that cord blood FG containing fibroblast and keratinocyte can be produced within a short time period. Implantation of the fibroblasts and keratinocytes into hypertrophic scar excisional wounds, led to prolonged dermal remodeling, and increased dermal degree of maturation. FG re-epithelization was characterized by the presence of ridge-like structures, and by a higher degree of epidermal maturation. Our further findings suggest that the transplanted FG, containing fibroblast and keratinocyte might be acting through paracrine effects of autologous cells. Thereby, they influence the different aspects of skin regeneration. The simplicity of the used methodology indicates short time period for FG production. There was not any notable difference between efficacy of cord blood FG and commercial FG. But the cord blood is a safe, cheap and available source for fabrication of FG. </p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the Royan Institute for financially supporting this project.
