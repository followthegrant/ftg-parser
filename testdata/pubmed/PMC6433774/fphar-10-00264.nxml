Moreover, its mechanism of action remains elusive, and thus novel treatment options are required. Lipid metabolism disorder are closely related to CCI. In this study, a CCI-rats model was established by the permanent occlusion of rat bilateral common carotid arteries, and then the rats were treated with a Xiao-Xu-Ming decoction (XXMD). Lipidomic profiling was conducted in both plasma and brain o determine the effects of the injury and therapy on lipid metabolism. Sphingolipid (particularly long acyl chain and total ceramides), glyceryl phosphatide, and glyceride profiles significantly changed in the brain after model induction and again after dosing. A total of 35 potential biomarkers were found in the brain and four were found in the plasma, representing both CCI injury and XXMD action. Correlations between endogenous lipids and exogenous XXMD compounds were analyzed using linear regression. Two exogenous compounds (cimifugin and 5-<italic>O</italic>-methylvisamminol) in the brain and 17 exogenous compounds in the plasma, which may represent the active constituents in XXMD, were significantly associated with lipid metabolism. This study provides a new perspective on the potential mechanism of CCI and its treatment with XXMD, as well as on discovering effective components in traditional Chinese medicines.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chronic cerebral ischemia</kwd><kwd>lipidomics</kwd><kwd>lipid metabolic network</kwd><kwd>potential biomarkers</kwd><kwd>Xiao-Xu-Ming decoction</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="30"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cerebral ischemia is one of the top three human physical and mental health risks and is associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. The incidence of cerebral ischemia has been rising annually, affecting younger patients as well because of dietary changes and an accelerated pace of life (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Meulman et al., 2015</xref>). Chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) is a type of nervous system damage caused by the prolonged restriction of the blood supply to the brain tissue below a certain threshold. CCI is the pathological basis for acute and chronic ischemic cerebrovascular diseases (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Farkas and Luiten, 2001</xref>). Insufficient blood supply associated with CCI is the first step in the progression of vascular dementia (VD) and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) (de la <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Torre, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Lipid metabolism disorder injures the central nervous system (CNS) and are associated with cerebral ischemia, VD, and AD (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ramesh et al., 2012</xref>). CNS is lipid-rich, and lipids are known to form cellular structures such as phospholipids and store energy, e.g., in the form of triglycerides (TGs). Certain lipids are precursors of various secondary messengers, including arachidonic acid (ArAc), docosahexaenoic acid, ceramides (Cers), and diacylglycerol (DG) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Wenk, 2005</xref>). Cerebral ischemia leads to an insufficient energy supply and causes the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and glutamic acid (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adibhatla and Hatcher, 2004</xref>). When the glutamic acid receptor is overexcited, it increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and activates phospholipases A2, C and D, and sphingomyelinase. These enzymes hydrolyze membrane phospholipids and release secondary messengers (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adibhatla and Hatcher, 2004</xref>) including DG, phosphatidic acid (PA), lyso-PA, and ArAc. Accumulation of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1, also increases phospholipase activity (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Shuaib, 2002</xref>). Cers are generated by sphingomyelinase after ArAc stimulation and induce apoptosis and tissue damage by inhibiting mitochondrial electron transport and via release of cytochrome c (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Wenk, 2005</xref>). In stroke patients, total serum cholesterol and TG levels are associated with cerebral ischemia. Medicinal therapy is significantly correlated with the regulation of lipid metabolism regulation (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Fuentes et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, recent studies have shown that the sphingolipid and phospholipid profiles in the white matter and ectocinerea are markedly altered in VD patients. Therefore, lipidomic studies are important (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism underlying the cerebral ischemia-caused injury remains unclear. Establishing preclinical CCI animal models helps determine the pathogenesis and pathological characteristics of CCI. The two-vessel occlusion (2VO) rat model was developed by de la Terre in 1992 and is now widely used as a CCI animal model for the evaluation of the efficacy of therapeutic agents. Briefly, the bilateral common carotid arteries of the rats are exposed and carefully separated from their carotid sheaths, avoiding injury to the vagus nerve, and then ligated with surgical silk. Behavioral experiments are carried out in rats for validation.</p><p>Xiao-Xu-Ming decoction (XXMD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), first recorded in <italic>Bei Ji Qian Jin Yao Fang</italic> written by Simiao Sun at the time of the Tang Dynasty (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Wang Y. et al., 2012</xref>). XXMD has been selected to be included in the first batch of classical prescriptions (#32) by the Chinese government. This formulation consists of 12 crude herbs, and its clinical efficacy has been reported for stroke patients (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2013</xref>). Besides, modern pharmacological studies have demonstrated that XXMD shows neuroprotective effects (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). The active fractions in Chinese medicines contains pharmacologically active ingredients used in clinical applications. Previous studies have shown that the active fraction of XXMD is eluted from a macroporous resin with 40% ethanol elution (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2013</xref>). The composition of the active XXMD fraction and its metabolic characteristics have been investigated in our previous study (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Wang Y. et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A CCI rat model was established using the 2VO method in the present study to elucidate the effects of cerebral ischemia and its treatment on lipid profiles. A sham operation, an untreated model, and a model treated with the active XXMD fraction were used. A Morris water maze test was performed, and biochemical parameters, and staining characteristics were evaluated to test model effectiveness. A targeted comprehensive lipidomic platform was used to characterize the lipid profiles of the brain and plasma in all three groups. The lipid profiles significantly changed after the 2VO model was induced and again after oral administration of the active XXMD fraction. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers associated with the injury in the CCI model as well as with its improvement following administration of the active XXMD fraction. The components and metabolites of the active XXMD fraction in rat brain and plasma were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS/MS) and statistically correlated with potential lipid biomarkers by linear regression analysis. In the present study, the mechanisms of CCI injury, its treatment with XXMD, and the identity of its active compounds were investigated from a lipidomics perspective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male Wistar rats weighing 350 &#x000b1; 25 g were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China) and maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle prior to the experiment.

The cylindrical water tank in the Morris water maze was 120 cm in diameter and 50 cm in height. It was filled with water at 22&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C to a depth of 30 cm, which and covered a black platform of 10 cm in diameter. The tank was divided into four equal quadrants labeled 1&#x02013;4.

The maximum trial duration was 60 s. The rats were then guided to the platform by hand and kept there for 20 s for reinforcement. Those capable of finding the platform on their own were also kept there for 20 s before the end of the training session.

CCI was induced in rats using 2VO according to the method of <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Wakita et al. (1995)</xref>. Wistar rats were fasted for 12 h and deprived of water for 4 h before surgery. They were then anesthetized with chloral hydrate [400 mg&#x022c5;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, intraperitoneally (i.p.)], placed in a supine position on a heating pad to maintain their body temperature at 37.5 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C, and disinfected with an alcohol prep pad. The skin in the middle of the right side of the neck was cut, and the muscle tissue was bluntly separated to avoid injury to the vagus nerve and weasand. The bilateral common carotid arteries of the rats were exposed and carefully separated from the carotid sheaths. The arteries were then ligated with 5-0-type surgical silk in ischemic rats but not in sham operation rats. The incisions were sutured with 0-type surgical silk.</p><p>The navigation training trial took place on days 22&#x02013;26 after surgery (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Wang Y.H. et al., 2012</xref>) to verify the successful development of the 2VO model. The screening criteria were as follows: (average time - reference time)/average time &#x0003e;0.2, where the reference time was the average arrival time of the rats from the sham operation group, and the average time was the average arrival time of the rats from the model group. Animals meeting these criteria were considered to be successfully modeled.</p><p>The successfully modeled rats were randomly divided into a model group (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and a dosed model group (<italic>n</italic> = 9). The sham operation group (<italic>n</italic> = 10) served as a control, and all three groups were subjected to lipidomic profiling.

A T-prediction of OPLS-DA was used to illustrate the recovery trend of the dosed model group relative to the model group. To this end, SIMCA-P+ 12.0.1 was used. For brain tissue, the dosed model group located on the right side of the vertical axis was near the sham operation group but far from the model group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>).

The dosed model group diverged from the model group and approached the sham operation group. However, the recovery trend was not as clear as that in the brain tissue.

Therefore, phospholipids may be indicative of cell damage and brain tissue lesions (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2011</xref>).

Especially noteworthy is the C18:1 acyl chain sphingolipid pathway in the brain tissue. Sphingosine and its downstream product sphingosine-1P both increased in the model group. XXMD upregulated the core compound Cer C18:1 and decreased its downstream products, namely, SM C18:1, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1P. These abnormal changes in brain tissue may contribute to the changes in oxidative stress parameters related to apoptosis (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Wenk, 2005</xref>). The C24:1 acyl chain lipid pathway in brain tissue exhibited a trend similar to that of the C18:1 acyl chain lipid pathway. However, PE C24:1 decreased in the model group and increased after XXMD dosing. These results support the idea that both the 2VO model and the XXMD treatment had far greater effects on the target organ (brain) than they did on the plasma.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation Analysis Between Potential Lipid Biomarkers and Base XXMD Material</title><p>Components of XXMD and its metabolites, found in rats after oral administration, which correlated with XXMD effects, were analyzed in the dosed model. A total of 28 compounds were identified in the plasma (six parent compounds from the active XXMD fraction and 22 metabolites) and two compounds were identified in the brain (one parent compound from the active XXMD fraction and one metabolite) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S4</xref> for structural information) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Attempts were made to correlate the peak areas of the active exogenous XXMD compounds with the concentrations of endogenous lipid biomarkers regulated by XXMD. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the associations between these compounds and the lipid biomarkers at three different time points. The highly correlated compounds and lipid biomarkers were termed compound pairs. The absolute values of the relative correlation coefficients for these pairs were &#x0003e;0.997. There were nine compound pairs in the brain tissue (corresponding to two exogenous compounds) and 95 compound pairs in the plasma (corresponding to 17 exogenous compounds). Compound pairs showing a linear correlation in the plasma included 47 lipids (two sphingolipids, one DG, two PCs, one PE, one PI, six LPCs, two LPEs, two SMs, and 30 TGs). M20 and M22 were positively correlated with most of the lipid biomarkers except LPE 16:0, LPE 18:1, PC 38:2, PE 40:6, PI 34:P3, SM 26:1, SM 26:d1, TG 50:4, and TG 58:0. LPE, PE, PI, and SM 26:d1 were positively correlated with most of the exogenous compounds except M20 and M22. Meanwhile most of the correlations of the pairs not mentioned above were negative. TGs were present in most of these lipids. Therefore, the curative effect of XXMD, then, may be influenced or induced by decreases in TGs. However, only two exogenous compounds, cimifugin (H1, PubChem CID: 441960) and 5-<italic>O</italic>-methylvisamminol (M20, PubChem CID: 441970), were detected in the brain tissue (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).

However, metabolites such as cimifugin (H1) and 5-<italic>O</italic>-methylvisamminol (M20), which can cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB), may play important roles in regulating lipid metabolism and deserve further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A previous study has demonstrated that lipid metabolism disorders are closely associated with cerebral ischemia but has mainly focused on the class of lipids or several single species (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we performed a more detailed and deeper analysis in CCI rats via an established lipidomic platform. Both brain and plasma lipidomic profiles were characterized in CCI modeled rats and those dosed with the XXMD, revealing potential biomarkers and allowing building a lipid metabolism network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The regulation of lipid subclasses (such as TGs, PCs, PEs, PSs, and Cers) showed the same trends as those described in the literatures (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Wenk, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, it is worth noting that the C18:1 and C24:1 acyl chain lipid metabolic pathways were also examined and the data were reflective of the entire network (especially in phospholipids and sphingolipids, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), which is reported for the first time. Moreover, we analyzed each species of lipids and discovered four potentially crucial biomarkers with a return tendency in the plasma (LPE 18:1, PE 22:0, PE 40:6, and PE 41:5), which deserve further investigation from the point of view of mechanism of CCI and treatment of XXMD. The present study used a novel lipidomics approach to analyze the therapeutic effects of the active XXMD fraction on CCI. Besides, an exploratory correlation analysis was conducted between the effective constituents of the active XXMD fraction and the potential lipid biomarkers, making a bridge between the exogenous treatment and endogenous metabolism. Thus, two active compounds, cimifugin (H1) and 5-<italic>O</italic>-methylvisamminol, which can cross BBB, should be a special focus in future studies. We also built a network with a combination of the base material and lipid metabolites, which showed that the therapeutic effects of XXMD were closely correlated with its ability to regulate lipid metabolism. These results provide new evidence of the efficacy and mechanisms of the action of the constituents in XXMD. XXMD, a traditional Chinese medicine, exerted its pharmacological effects through a multi-component, multi-target mechanism. This methodology can be used in the research and development of novel active compounds and their metabolites of TCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>JZ designed the research.
