In a randomized controlled trial, partnership-based self-management intervention for patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in its initial stages, and their families, a theoretical framework developed for patients with an advanced COPD and their families was modified and implemented in a primary care context. In contrast to recruitment to the original study where 4% decline participation, in this study 25% of the potential patients declined participation. Although participants were encouraged to bring a family member, only 25% of them did so. The main reason for not being accompanied by a family member was that patients did not want anybody accompany them. Those who had quit smoking were more often accompanied by a family member compared to those who smoked. Reviewing the literature, the most compelling explanations for non-participation are shame and self-blame due to smoking, and that potential participants may not have envisioned any benefits from participating since they might not have realized that they had COPD. An alternative recruitment process needs to embrace the situation that potential participants find themselves in and which takes account of the issues at stake.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>families</kwd><kwd>recruitment</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>self-management</kwd><kwd>shame</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1479972317743758"><title>Introduction</title><p>The effectiveness of healthcare intervention research is a major issue in health sciences.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> To test the effectiveness of such studies, a sufficient number of participants is essential. Recruitment, the process of accessing, screening and selecting participants for a study, as well as retaining participants through the research, is a challenge. Recruitment in family intervention studies is an even greater task.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Family-focused interventions in the context of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are scarce,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> despite evidence of the effectiveness of family-based interventions for individuals with various chronic diseases and the complexity of COPD and the impact it has on families.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
</p><p>COPD is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide and its prevalence is on the rise. COPD is primarily related to tobacco smoking.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The disease develops incrementally over many years without people necessarily becoming aware of it. As such, the disease may progress to an advanced stage with irreversible health damage before the person finally seeks healthcare.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Most effort in healthcare and research has been put into developing care for patients with advanced stages of COPD. The proportion of participants who do not accept invitations to self-management trials for people with COPD is around 40&#x02013;50%.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
</p><p>In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), partnership to enhance self-management for patients who have COPD in its initial stages, and their families, a theoretical framework was implemented for a partnership-based nursing practice which had been developed for the patients&#x02019; families and the patients who have an advanced lung disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The patients were in principle recruited into the study but were asked to have a family member accompany them. One-quarter of potential patients declined to participate and one-third were excluded, giving a 41% recruitment rate. Moreover, only 25% of those participating in the study were accompanied by a family member. That changed the nature of this originally family-based RCT into a more patient-focused trial.</p><p>In this article, we attempt to understand why a considerable proportion of people with COPD in its early stages did not accept the invitation to participate in a partnership-based self-management programme for patients and family members.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The characteristics of that study are contrasted with its predecessor, which was developed for patients with an advanced stage of COPD and their families.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>

Creating the meaning of the health circumstances is regarded as a core issue to address in conjunction with other more conventional topics, for instance, those related to the physical and social conditions of patients. When holistically focusing on health problems related to the patients, predetermined goals or achievements are not laid out beforehand other than to understand and foster possibilities for enhancing the health experience. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) clinical guidelines are the foundation for the disease treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>A <italic>dialogue</italic> with participants is central in the partnership&#x02019;s theoretical framework. The dialogue is a process characterized by an unconditional positive regard, trust and respect for each individual&#x02019;s and family&#x02019;s values and ways of being. The dialogue is open, caring, mutually responsive and non-directive. Events and issues are comprehended in a context which gives them significance &#x02013; meaning. The meaning <italic>emerges</italic> or <italic>evolves</italic> in a collaborative effort of all participants.

Patients were invited to join the study when their health situation had become serious. They started attending the outpatient clinic, and receiving home visits and phone calls at the same time that they were invited to participate in the study. The patients continued receiving care after the study ended. The study of people with COPD in its initial stages was conducted in a university research institute. The programme had a fixed schedule and a definite ending. Patients and families in the control group were offered a shortened version of the self-management programme at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1479972317743758"><title>Seriousness of COPD</title><p>The different stages of the COPD as well as higher age of the patients with an advanced disease required different emphases in the treatment sessions. For instance, the way and the extent to which living with symptoms were addressed varied with regard to their severity, the individual recognition of their existence and their ramifications in daily life. For people with COPD in its early stages, the notion of bringing the progression of COPD to a halt might have prevailed, while for the person with an advanced disease the predominant emphasis could have been to optimize medical treatment and the possibilities for living a meaningful life.</p><p>The component <italic>access to healthcare</italic> was addressed differently between the studies.

In this study, the participants were also expected to understand new information and to consider an invitation to give up smoking, if they were still smoking. There was also an implied expectation that participants might change their approach to and expectations of important aspects of their daily life. An opportunity to consider influences on the progression of COPD was offered which was expected to motivate potential participants. However, plausible benefits might have looked quite different to those invited to join the study since they might not have been aware of any significant or potential health problems.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The partnership-based approach which was meant to non-judgmentally embrace the health situation of each participant/family may, therefore, not have come through in the invitation to the study.</p><p>Inconvenient timing, travel costs, location and being treated in a group are concerns that have been documented regarding non-participation in self-management research programmes,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> none of which seemed to matter to the potential participants in this research. In the few cases where participants indicated that travel costs would be a hindrance, they were offered reimbursement. The timing of appointments was made convenient to the participants and meetings were rescheduled as needed to adjust to individual needs and preferences. Mobility problems and ill health have been reported as barriers in some research programmes.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Ill health was in fact an explanation which a few invited persons gave for non-participation.

However, the non-readiness may have been a consequence of the nature of the tobacco addiction to preserve &#x0201c;a <italic>need</italic> of the body [to continue to smoke], and <italic>an automatic action</italic> of the body, rather than merely an intellectual choice&#x0201d; (p. 9, italics in original).<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> It is likely that several people with COPD in its initial stages do not realize how serious the disease is and what may be ahead for those having it. Consequently, we as healthcare professionals are obliged to continue to make efforts to reach out to them and invite them into research.</p><p>The most promising alternative recruitment process is to have face-to-face contact with potential participants where a respectful, trusting and welcoming approach is taken in person-centred conversations, instead of using a posted invitation letter.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> There are, however, limited options to gain face-to-face access to individuals and families with a member who has COPD in its early stages. The primary reason is that the patients may not yet be regular clients of the healthcare system since the disease has not developed to a stage that requires stringent medical management. Still, recruiting participants face-to-face in regular appointments with physicians/other healthcare professionals either in primary care centres or lung physician offices is crucial. Under such circumstances, the potential participants would be seeking healthcare for an active health problem. The situation would be related to respiratory issues or connected to likely co-morbidities of COPD<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1479972317743758" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> for which a disease diagnosis with spirometry needs to be made. In cases where the person has a confirmed COPD diagnosis, the clinician would refer the patient to a research team that would simultaneously on-site, face-to-face, or in a telephone conversation present the study in more detail. Including the family in research would need to be raised in these conversations, preferably right at the beginning. An option might be to have one more step in the recruitment process, that is, to invite the family member later when the patient has become more capable and has a deeper understanding of his/her health circumstances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section17-1479972317743758"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A concerted effort needs to be made to develop an effective recruitment process of patients in self-management studies for people with COPD in its initial stages and their families. Recruitment efforts need to embrace the situation that potential participants find themselves in; to recognize the nature and consequences of nicotine addiction and its companions shame and self-blame. The fact that a considerable number of potential patients may not realize that they have COPD also needs to be acknowledged. The conflict that might exist between family members that may make patients unwilling to be accompanied by a family member needs to be accounted for in the recruitment process. Therefore, a stepwise recruitment process might be necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for collaboration with Krist&#x000ed;n R&#x000f3;sa &#x000c1;rmannsd&#x000f3;ttir, Gu&#x000f0;r&#x000fa;n Hl&#x000ed;n Bragad&#x000f3;ttir, Alda Gunnarsd&#x000f3;ttir, Elfa &#x000de;&#x000f6;ll Gr&#x000e9;tarsd&#x000f3;ttir, Brynd&#x000ed;s S.
