However, an effective anticancer therapy that directly targets the EMT program has not yet been discovered. Recent studies have indicated that mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), the reverse phenomenon of EMT, is observed in fibroblasts during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. In the present study, we investigated the effects of reprogramming factors (RFs) on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. RFs-introduced cancer cells (RICs) demonstrated the enhanced epithelial characteristics in morphology with altered expression of mRNA and microRNAs. The motility and invasive activities of RICs <italic>in vitro</italic> were significantly reduced. Furthermore, xenografts of RICs exhibited no lymph node metastasis, whereas metastasis was detected in parental SCC-inoculated mice. Thus, we concluded that RICs regained epithelial properties through MET and showed reduced cancer malignancy <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, the understanding of the MET process in cancer cells by introduction of RFs may lead to the designing of a novel anticancer strategy.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>The Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture</institution></funding-source><award-id>25461698</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takaishi</surname><given-names>Mikiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>M.

Although the mechanisms of cancer metastasis are not yet fully understood, it is known that the acquisition of invasive properties is driven by epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cancer under EMT is characterized by a loss of intercellular adhesions, a gain of cell motility, and increased invasive activity. A major characteristic of EMT is the functional loss of the adherence junction protein, E-cadherin (CDH1), through multiple mechanisms, including gene mutation, hypermethylation, and repression of its promoter [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Repressive transcription factors for CDH1 include the (a) Snail family (SNAI1 and SNAI2) [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], (b) Twist family (TWIST1 and TWIST2) [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and (c) ZEB family (ZEB1/dEF1 and ZEB2/SIP1) [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Those transcription factors can interact with the E-box element of the <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter, leading to the down-regulation of its expression. The over-expression of those EMT-inducing genes is frequently observed in the metastatic cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. On the contrary, the down-regulation of EMT-inducing gene expression restores <italic>CDH1</italic> expression and leads to the attenuation of cancer malignancy through a mechanism referred to as mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), the reverse program of EMT [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate their target genes expression at the post-transcriptional level and are known to play essential roles in different types of cancer. It has been reported that the EMT-inducing transcription factors, which suppress the <italic>CDH1</italic> expression, are negatively regulated by the miRNAs (miR-200 family, miR-203, and miR-205, etc.) [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>During the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from murine fibroblasts by the introduction of four reprogramming factor genes, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc, the cells went through MET [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While iPSCs have been generated from the primary cells, recent studies have explored the possibilities of reprogramming the malignant cells, including leukemia, sarcoma, melanoma and other types of cancer cells to exhibit an iPSC-like state <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The reprogrammed malignant cells showed a pluripotent-like state with an altered differentiation program that led to the loss of tumorigenicity. However, it was uncertain whether cancer malignancy was attenuated through the MET-mediated mechanism with reprogramming factors.</p><p>Thus, the aim of the present study is to demonstrate that the SCC cells decrease malignant potential <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> through MET by the introduction of reprogramming factors without the pluripotent-like state. These findings are highly relevant for developing new and effective therapeutic strategies for cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Generation of iPS cells using piggyBac transposon system</title><p>Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) isolated from foreskins were obtained from Kurabo (Osaka, Japan) and were grown in Epilife II (Invitrogen) supplemented with Humedia-KG (Kurabo). pCMVmPBase and plasmids containing the piggyBac transposon carrying the reprogramming factors (POU5F1 (OCT3/4), SOX2, KLF4, cMYC, and LIN28) [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] were transfected into the NHEKs with NEON transfection system (Invitrogen).

Evaluation of cell length/width ratio between parental SCCs and RICs revealed specific reduction in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156904.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), suggesting that MET was also induced in SCCs as shown in fibroblast during induction of iPCs by RF [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It should be noted that RICs from both cancer lines did not express TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81, the surface markers for pluripotent cells, whereas a teratoma line NCCIT expressed them by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156904.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) and flowcytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156904.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>).

Therefore, the induction of the MET program in cancer cells would be relevant in designing a novel anticancer strategy by the restoration of malignant nature of the cancer cells. In the present study, the reprogramming factors were used to induce MET into the cancer cells, which is in line with previous reports that demonstrated MET to occur during the development of iPSCs from fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that reprogrammed malignant cells exhibit an iPSC-like pluripotency to differentiate the cell types into three layers during teratoma formation [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have reported that the reprogrammed sarcoma cells had pluripotency to differentiate not only osteocytes and adipocytes but also erythrocytes, which was accompanied with the loss of both proliferation and tumorigenicity. In the study, the authors have showed that the sarcoma cells were dedifferentiated to pre-mesenchymal stem cell state through reprogramming. The RFs via the transposon vector successfully induced iPSC from normal keratinocytes in this study. However, the RICs did not exhibit any iPSC-like characteristics in the current experimental setting and had more differentiated features of epithelial cell lineage as indicated by the alteration of molecular markers and morphology of the tumor cells in vivo, which were distinct from teratomas. Moreover, no previous study had reported a reduced tumorigenicity of partially reprogrammed cancer cells in conjunction with MET induction. As mentioned in previous reports, MET is the crucial and first step of reprogramming caused by combinational action of the RFs, although further appropriate conditions are essential to overcome roadblocks toward pluripotency [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0156904.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We have not applied the culture condition specific for iPS cells when generating the RICs. This might be the reason why they did not demonstrate the pluripotency while MET was induced.</p><p>CDH1 is regarded as a gatekeeper of the epithelial state. In the RICs from HOC313 that showed a more drastic change in morphology, the increased expression of <italic>CDH1</italic> and decreased expression of <italic>SNAI1/2</italic> and <italic>ZEB2</italic> were observed. In accordance with this observation, significant up-regulation of miR-200 family, (miR-200a, -200b, -200c, -141, and -429), miR-203, and miR205 was detected in the RICs from HOC313 cells. This result is consistent with the previous study showing that OCT3/4 and SOX2 induce the miR-200 family during iPS generation [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Induction of CDH1 was also observed in OSC19 RICs, although the parental OSC-19 cells expressed relatively high level of CDH1 as compared with HOC313 parental cells. Upregulation of CDH1 in OSC-19 RICs may be directly caused by KLF4 [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], since they did not show downregulation of SNAI, ZEB families or up-regulation of miR-200 family. Thus, the sensitivity to RFs of EMT-regulating transcription factors and associated miRNAs varies between SCCs. It has been reported that the down-regulation of miR-203 was observed in some malignant tumor including SCC in head and neck [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

With regard to miR-205, the roles were identified as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting proliferation and invasion, or as an oncogene by facilitating tumor initiation and proliferation in various kinds of tumors [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It was reported the miR-205 expression was abundantly found in cutaneous SCC [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], although other studies showed no significant correlation between miR-205 and metastasis in oral SCC [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In our study, elevated expression of miR-203 and miR-205 was detected in the two lines of RICs, suggesting that they might act as tumor suppressors in addition to MET inducers by repressing EMT-associated genes.</p><p>In the orthotopic xenograft model, the tumor cells derived from human oral SCC OSC-19 cells were inoculated into the tongue. The incidence of lymph node metastasis highlighted the difference between the parental cells and RICs. Although RICs never metastasized even when the primary tumor size was as large as the metastasized parental cells, the tumor growth of the parental cells correlated with the probability of lymph node metastasis. In addition to this, the tumor growth of RICs in the tongues was delayed as compared to the parental cells. In the distant organ metastasis model, the tumor cells were transplanted intravenously. We could detect the expression of human cytokeratin 18 in the lung when inoculated with parental OSC-19 cells but not with RICs. This result clearly indicated attenuated metastatic activity of SCC by introduction of reprogramming factors.</p><p>Conversely, some recent studies showed that metastatic breast cancer cells retain the expression of epithelial marker genes such as CDH1, KRT14 and JUP, which could contributed to generation of cancer cell clusters at distant organs of metastatic foci [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Also, it is known that the process of MET is most relevant for secondary metastases to distal sites. These are quite contradictory to our data, since OSC-19 RICs expressed higher levels of CDH1, JUP, and KRT14. It may be that cancer cells at the primary sites favor the EMT status to invade into the vessels, but once localized at the distant organ they resume the epithelial nature to form cell cluster through MET. Therefore, the RICs failed to metastasize likely because they could not invade into the vessels at the primary lesions. In addition, it may be unlikely that MET promotes secondary metastasis in this experimental setting, since no lung metastasis was formed by intravenous injection of the OSC-19 RICs, in contrast to parental cells forming micrometastases. Alternatively, OSC-19 RICs, even if they reached the lung, might not provide a sufficient condition for the metastatic microenvironment. We could not detect tumor generation from HOC313 cells macroscopically or microscopically, regardless of parental cells and RICs, by inoculation into the subcutaneous or the tongue (data not shown), in contrast to OSC-19, which was derived from oral SCC and has been frequently used in the metastasis model [<xref rid="pone.0156904.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Other SCC lines than OSC-19 will be required for further investigation to elucidate the association of MET with cancer metastasis, which largely remains to be clarified.</p><p>In this study we showed that the MET was induced in SCC cells by the introduction of the reprogramming factors and resulted in the attenuation of cancer malignancy not only <italic>in vitro</italic> but also <italic>in vivo</italic>. The understanding of the process of MET induced by the reprogramming factors in cancer cells will have a considerable impact upon the anticancer strategies in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156904.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Primers used for the study.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156904.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0156904.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Antibodies used for the study.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0156904.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Drs.
