HeV was first isolated during two outbreaks of respiratory illness in horses in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Highly lethal in horses, these initial HeV outbreaks also resulted in two human fatalities, including one person initially presenting with a flu-like illness followed by apparent recovery who subsequently died one year later due to meningoencephalitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. HeV has continued to re-emerge in eastern Australia with more than twelve separate outbreaks being documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] resulting in over 30 equine deaths and an additional human fatality in each of August 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and August 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The initial NiV outbreak occurred in peninsular Malaysia in 1998 and by June 1999, more than 265 cases of encephalitis, including 105 deaths, had been reported in Malaysia and 11 cases of disease with one death in Singapore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition to the human health impact, the economic impact of this disease was dramatic. Containment procedures resulted in the slaughter of almost 1.2 million pigs and the virtual closure of the pig farming industry in Malaysia. Electron microscopy, serologic, and genetic studies indicated that this virus was a paramyxovirus, subsequently named NiV after the village in Malaysia from which one of the first isolates was obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid of a fatal human case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Serological surveillance and virus isolation studies indicated that NiV resides naturally in flying foxes in the genus Pteropus (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). NiV has continued to re-emerge in Bangladesh causing fatal encephalitis in humans and for the first time, person-to-person transmission appeared to have been a primary mode of spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, there appeared to be direct transmission of the virus from it's natural host, the flying fox, to humans, and the case mortality rate was ~70%; significantly higher than any other NiV outbreak to date.</p><p>A number of recent reports of potential vaccine approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and experimental therapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] have been described, however, there is still no vaccine or antiviral treatment specifically indicated for either HeV or NiV infections (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). An open-label trial of ribavirin in 140 patients during the initial NiV outbreak in Malaysia showed ribavirin therapy was able to reduce mortality of acute NiV encephalitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. While this study reported no serious side effects, ribavirin has been associated with a range of side effects primarily related to haemolytic anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The antiviral efficacy of ribavirin has also been demonstrated against HeV and NiV <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, a recent study showed that the interferon inducer poly(I)-poly(C<sub>12</sub>U), but not ribavirin, was able to prevent mortality in five of six animals in a hamster model of NiV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Recently, we described the antiviral properties of chloroquine against Henipaviruses <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], although a recent study reported no anti Henipavirus effects in a ferret model <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>There have also been a number of recent reports describing the development of surrogate assays to screen and evaluate HeV and NiV antivirals or perform serological surveys at biosafety level 2 (BSL2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. These pseudotyped assays provide excellent surrogate BSL2 assays for the evaluation of virus entry and fusion mechanisms, enabling wider access for potential antiviral evaluation. Significantly, our recent description of chloroquine as an effective henipavirus antiviral was identified using a modified, multicycle pseudotype screening assay with efficacy subsequently confirmed against live virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This study demonstrates that surrogate assays can provide legitimate antiviral leads, however, these will ultimately require live virus confirmation. Mini-genome assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] may provide an effective complimentary approach to pseudotyped assays but ultimately, inhibitors identified using these approaches must also be validated against live virus at biosafety level 4 (BSL4). In an effort to expedite the process of antiviral development, we have recently described an immunoassay format amenable to high throughput screening (HTS) of antiviral compounds, directly against live HeV and NiV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Using this live virus HTS approach, we have identified a number of potential antiviral compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], three of which are commercially available, public access molecules. While these compounds may only have limited potential therapeutic uses, they provide an excellent group of positive controls with which to evaluate and standardise subsequent screening assays. To this end, in an effort to further validate surrogate assays for antiviral screening approaches, we have compared the efficacy of these compounds using our recently described multicycle replication pseudotype assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Utilising a simple monolayer based assay amenable to HTS of antivirals directly against live virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], we performed a preliminary single blind screen of a library of 8,040 low molecular weight molecules. This assay incorporates immunological detection of the viral nucleoprotein (N) following infection and fixation of cell monolayers. We have previously demonstrated a linear relationship between N protein expression and viral inoculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and for clarity, we have also directly compared the titer of infectious virus recovered from Vero cells with the level of N protein expression detected using this immunoassay approach (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). While the immunoassay is largely insensitive to changes in viral inoculum below 100 TCID<sub>50</sub>, there is a linear relationship between viral inoculum and protein expression for both HeV and NiV above 100 TCID<sub>50 </sub>comparable to that observed for viral RNA and infectious virus titers recovered from the same wells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Our initial screen was conducted using 1,000 TCID<sub>50 </sub>of each virus ensuring N protein expression was well within the linear portion of this curve and would be proportional to the levels of infectious virus recovered. This initial screen resulted in a predictable distribution of inhibition values with the majority of compounds exhibiting between 25 and 75% inhibition of NiV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The primary screen of DMSO stocks revealed 54 compounds inhibiting NiV infection by greater than 90%. To confirm inhibitory activity 49 compounds were sourced from lyophilised stocks and redissolved in DMSO to be retested as fresh stocks. On retest, 28 of the compounds exhibited greater than 90% inhibition of NiV <italic>in vitro</italic>. Dose-response experiments were performed on each of these 28 compounds to determine the IC<sub>50 </sub>concentrations for each in addition to the CC<sub>50 </sub>determined in Vero cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Upon unblinding, three of these remaining 28 lead compounds were identified as brilliant green, gentian violet and gliotoxin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), commercially available compounds with a variety of historical applications. All three compounds were at the lower end of the range of IC<sub>50 </sub>values determined, but were also at the lower end of the CC<sub>50 </sub>range, indicating higher toxicity than many of the novel compounds identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of NiV (a) and HeV (b) via end-point titration, Taqman PCR and immunodetection</bold>. 1/2 log dilutions of virus (100 &#x003bc;l) were incubated with 20,000 Vero cells per well for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Virus released into the media was quantified by end-point titration and TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml (n = 3) determined using the Reed-Meunch method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>].

NiV IC<sub>50 </sub>values for brilliant green and gliotoxin were ten fold lower than ribavirin while gentian violet was four fold lower than ribavirin (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). HeV IC<sub>50 </sub>values for brilliant green and gliotoxin were three fold lower than ribavirin while gentian violet was slightly less effective than ribavirin (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Incubation of compounds in parallel with virus inhibition assays reveals all three compounds are cytotoxic at high concentrations using both ATP based and resorufin based measures of cytotoxicity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The concentration of compound exhibiting 50% cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub>) for all three compounds was similar in Vero cells but varied more than three-fold in 293T cells reflecting the lack of correlation often observed between measures of cytotoxicity. Of note, all three compounds were considerably more cytotoxic than ribavirin in Vero cells. The therapeutic index (TI) for each compound indicates all three compounds are more amenable to inhibition of NiV than HeV (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) but all have very narrow margins of safety. Confirmation of henipavirus inhibition was achieved with a recently described NiV-G-VSV-pseudotype assay which mimics multicycle replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and the related HeV-G-VSV assay (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Additionally, antiviral efficacy was evaluated against the parent pseudotyped virus (VSV), HPIV3 and an influenza H1N1 virus (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The similar levels of inhibition observed for most of these viruses would indicate the antiviral activity of these compounds occurs by a process not specific to henipavirus entry. Of note however, only gliotoxin exhibited a dose-dependant inhibition of influenza virus (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) suggesting brilliant green and gentian violet efficacy is not simply a product of viral envelope disruption. Both brilliant green and gliotoxin exhibited similar IC<sub>50</sub>s for each of the pseudotyped viruses, suggesting their action may be related to the VSV backbone, rather than the specific glycoproteins for each virus. Curiously, gentian violet displayed a striking selectivity for pseudotyped HeV inhibition, and to a lesser extent, pseudotyped NiV (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This unexpected result may potentially signal a more specific antiviral action attributable to gentian violet, or alternatively, an enhanced sensitivity of pseudotyped assay formats when compared to live virus assays. This may have considerable implications for the use of surrogate assay screens as the primary tools for antiviral discovery. A more detailed follow-up of this observation is currently underway.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>IC<sub>50</sub>, CC<sub>50 </sub>and therapeutic index (TI) values calculated for each compound against live Nipah and Hendra viruses.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td/><td align="right"><bold>Brilliant Green</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>Gentian Violet</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>Gliotoxin</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>Ribavirin</bold></td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">NiV IC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)</td><td align="right">218</td><td align="right">525</td><td align="right">149</td><td align="right">3,897</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">HeV IC<sub>50</sub>(nM)</td><td align="right">778</td><td align="right">2,679</td><td align="right">579</td><td align="right">2,241</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">CellTiter-Glo<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>CC<sub>50</sub>(nM)</td><td align="right">4,672</td><td align="right">5,865</td><td align="right">4,896</td><td align="right">149,745</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">alamarBlue<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>CC<sub>50</sub>(nM)</td><td align="right">861</td><td align="right">2,828</td><td align="right">1,609</td><td align="right">ND<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">NiV TI (CellTiter-Glo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)</td><td align="right">21.39</td><td align="right">11.16</td><td align="right">32.81</td><td align="right">38.42</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">NiV TI (alamarBlue<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)</td><td align="right">3.95</td><td align="right">5.39</td><td align="right">10.80</td><td align="right">ND<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">HeV TI (CellTiter-Glo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)</td><td align="right">6.00</td><td align="right">2.19</td><td align="right">8.44</td><td align="right">66.82</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">HeV TI (alamarBlue<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)</td><td align="right">1.11</td><td align="right">1.06</td><td align="right">2.78</td><td align="right">ND<sup>a</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a </sup>ND = not determined, values are averages of at least 3 independent experiments.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>IC<sub>50 </sub>values calculated for pseudotyped Nipah (pNiV), Hendra (pHeV), VSV (pVSV), HPIV3 and Influenza viruses.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td/><td align="right"><bold>Brilliant Green</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>Gentian Violet</bold></td><td align="right"><bold>Gliotoxin</bold></td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">pNiV IC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)</td><td align="right">42</td><td align="right">61</td><td align="right">100</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">pHeV IC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)</td><td align="right">34</td><td align="right">0.3</td><td align="right">366</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">pVSV IC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)</td><td align="right">15</td><td align="right">268</td><td align="right">232</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">HPIV3 IC<sub>50</sub>(nM)</td><td align="right">248</td><td align="right">860</td><td align="right">527</td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="3"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="right">Influenza IC<sub>50</sub>(nM)</td><td align="right">DNC<sup>a</sup></td><td align="right">DNC<sup>a</sup></td><td align="right">13,786</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a </sup>DNC = non-linear regression curve did not converge, values are averages of at least 3 independent experiments.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Time of addition experiments indicated that preincubation of cells with either brilliant green or gentian violet prior to NiV infection resulted in more effective inhibition of viral protein expression than when compounds were added during or after virus infection (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). This may be due in part to increased cytotoxicity associated with longer times of compound exposure to the cell monolayer, however, gliotoxin which exhibits similar levels of cytotoxicity, did not induce enhanced antiviral activity under the same conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>).

Utilising this approach, we have screened over 8,000 low molecular weight compounds from a drug discovery collection for their antiviral activity against NiV infection. This method facilitated the rapid identification of twenty-eight potential NiV antivirals including three commercially available compounds with IC<sub>50 </sub>values in the nanomolar range. To further validate surrogate assay approaches, we have also confirmed efficacy using a recently described NiV-G-VSV-pseudotype assay which mimics multicycle replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Gentian violet (a.k.a. crystal violet) was introduced as an antiseptic by Sterling in 1890 and is used at a concentration of 1-2% in aqueous solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Gentian violet is a cationic triphenylmethane dye which has been used in medicine for its antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic activities (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]) and has also been used as a mycostatic agent in poultry feed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Gentian violet inhibits DNA replication in a number of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and several hypotheses have been provided to explain the selective toxicity of gentian violet in bacteria and trypanosomes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]) including alteration of the redox potential by the dye, inhibition of protein synthesis, disruption of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>homeostasis and a photodynamic action of gentian violet has been described in both bacteria and Trypanosoma cruzi. Gentian violet has been shown to depress protein synthesis in fibroblasts <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and Hoffmann and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] found that gentian violet is a potent inhibitor of amino acid transport and that this inhibition is apparently responsible for its inhibitory effect on T. cruzi protein synthesis.</p><p>Recently, Nagayama [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] examined the antiviral activity of gentian violet and gentian violet-dyed cloth against the influenza A (H1N1) virus. When 10<sup>6 </sup>TCID<sub>50 </sub>virus was exposed to 0.0063% (~160 &#x003bc;M) gentian violet, the residual viable count decreased to below three logs within 30 min and below five logs at 60 min. This indicates that the interaction of gentian violet with the influenza virus is very rapid and gentian violet completely destroys the infectivity of the influenza virus within 60 min. Electron microscopy of gentian violet treated viral envelopes confirmed destruction by gentian violet. While we did not observe clear inhibition of an H1N1 virus in the current study, cellular toxicity prevented effective testing of concentrations greater than 100 &#x003bc;M. The interaction of cationic dyes with cellular membranes has been established for many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and for this reason they have been applied in the study of membrane function in mitochondria or intact plasma membranes. Antiviral efficacy may be due to cationic dyes binding directly to the membranes causing perturbation of the membrane structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] as lipid bilayers are solvents for apolar and amphipathic compounds such as gentian violet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies suggest the potentiation of the antiviral effects of gentian violet (and the related brilliant green) when applied following NiV infection could be attributable to either a direct interaction with viral and/or cellular membranes or via a general decrease in protein synthesis. Gentian violet did induce an immediate increase in intracellular calcium concentrations and a large decrease in sodium levels suggesting the integrity of cellular membranes may have been compromised (data not shown) but did not induce significant changes in either IL-8 or TNF-&#x003b1; expression. Preincubation of cells with gentian violet prior to virus infection does reduce the expression of viral protein (and by inference, a proportional decrease in viral replication) but does not appear to differentially effect viral replication when preincubated with virus, or when applied during or immediately after virus infection. It is likely that any effect due to direct interaction with cellular membranes should be comparable both during and post-infection with the caveat that post-infection provides a greater time span for this interaction to occur.</p><p>Brilliant green (a.k.a. malachite green) has also been used as an antiseptic, similar to gentian violet. The value of certain triphenylmethane dyes such as brilliant green and gentian violet as selective agents for isolation of typhoid bacteria was first reported by Drigalski and Conradi (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]). These dyes have since been used extensively as aids in the isolation of bacteria of the typhoid and paratyphoid groups (Salmonella). Brilliant green inhibits the growth of bacteria at lower concentrations than most other dyes and is by far the most widely used dye in selective media (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]). Bakker and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] demonstrated inhibitory activity against streptococcus, proteus and staphylococcus spp. in addition to candida albicans. Brilliant green has been used widely as an anti-fungal agent in fish hatcheries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]) but in recent years the use of brilliant green in aquaculture has been banned in several countries due to accumulating evidence of genotoxic and carcinogenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. However, a recent study by Bahna and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] evaluated a combination of low concentrations of both brilliant green and chlorhexidine <italic>in vitro </italic>as an alternative to alcohol based mouthwashes for preventing oral cavity infections in immunocompromised and cancer patients suggesting opportunities may still exist for brilliant green based therapeutics.</p><p>The enhanced efficacy of brilliant green when preincubated with cells and/or virus would suggest potential intercalation into, and disruption of both cellular and viral membranes as potential modes of action. We observed a rapid and sustained increase in intracellular calcium and sodium concentrations with an associated decrease in pH (data not shown) also supporting this possibility. Additionally, brilliant green induced a 15-20 fold increase in TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-8 expression, respectively, suggesting the stimulation of a considerable inflammatory response. The similar efficacy seen with a NiV-G pseudotyped virus, the parent VSV, and HPIV3 indicates brilliant green's antiviral activity is likely not specific to henipavirus entry although we did not observe antiviral efficacy against an influenza virus.</p><p>Gliotoxin activity against various bacteria and fungi has been known for some time (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]) and the first report of antiviral activity was made by Rightsel and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] describing activity against poliovirus type 2, herpes simplex virus and against influenza A virus, the latter confirmed in the current study. Further studies reported the antiviral activity of gliotoxin against numerous viruses including poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, rhinovirus strain HGP, ECHO virus types 12 and 28, measles virus, coxsackie virus, Sendai virus, influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Subsequent studies identified the antiviral action against poliovirus as being due to the inhibition of viral RNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], specifically via actions on the poliovirus polymerase 3D<sup>pol </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. The observation in the current study that gliotoxin exerts its effects independently of addition prior to or immediately following virus infection, suggests an action subsequent to viral binding and entry, such as replication, confirmed by our pseudotype data. Consistent with the reported immunosuppressive actions of gliotoxin, we observed a decrease in TNF-&#x003b1; expression in Vero cells following gliotoxin treatment. Pre-incubation of compound with cells prior to virus infection may enable efficacious levels of gliotoxin to enter and remain inside the cell, reducing any potential differences expected between pre-infection and post-infection treatment. Efficacy seen with pre-treatment of virus prior to infection of cell monolayers may indicate a direct interaction with one or more viral proteins such as the viral polymerase. Traditionally, the usefulness of gliotoxin and related fungal metabolites has been limited by their toxicity. However, studies highlighting the potential of gliotoxin as an anticancer agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] may provide important research into the development and evaluation of less toxic analogues of gliotoxin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the current study we have screened over 8,000 small molecules for antiviral activity and demonstrated potent antiviral activity of three commercially available compounds against NiV and HeV, recently emerged BSL4 pathogens for which no vaccine or therapeutic indications exist. Despite the known toxicity associated with these compounds, gentian violet has been, and still is, used extensively for a range of topical applications. In our quest to discover novel antiviral agents that may be amenable to oral or parenteral administration in the event of acute viral exposure, the three compounds described here may prove excessively toxic for systemic use. However, their use in topical applications for inactivation of viruses in field situations or in hospital settings may warrant further investigation. Additionally, gliotoxin, given its identified actions as a viral polymerase inhibitor, may also provide an important parent molecule with which to develop second generation, non-toxic polymerase inhibitors. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the utility of a live virus HTS approach for identifying potential antiviral compounds. While all novel drug development is a costly and time-consuming process, eliminating additional live virus confirmation steps required to validate leads identified by surrogate assay screening programs will clearly reduce both the development time and the number of false positives generated. However, the considerable cost and biosecurity advantages of surrogate screening approaches will ensure they have a place in antiviral discovery efforts. As evidence of the comparable results obtained through pseudotyped virus screening, our collaborative group recently identified chloroquine as an effective inhibitor of HeV and NiV in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] in a primary pseudotype screen, followed by live virus confirmation. In the current study, to further validate this approach, we have confirmed compound efficacy against live virus infection with that observed using a novel VSV pseudotype assay mimicking multicycle replication. While the three compounds reported in this study may only be useful for topical administration, or as disinfectants, this screening approach has also identified a number of promising novel candidate antivirals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] to be evaluated as potential therapeutics for these currently untreatable, lethal pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Virus and cells</title><p>African Green Monkey Kidney (Vero) cells were grown in Minimal Essential Medium containing Earle's salts (EMEM), antibiotics (100 U Penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml Streptomycin and 500 &#x003bc;g/ml Fungizone) and 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), designated EMEM-10. 293T (human kidney epithelial) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Mediatech-Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Primers for TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-8 were obtained from SABiosciences.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p>BG: brilliant green; BSL: biosafety level; CC<sub>50</sub>: concentration resulting in 50% cytotoxicity; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GV: gentian violet; glio: gliotoxin; HeV: Hendra virus; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; HTS: high throughput screening; IC<sub>50</sub>: concentration resulting in 50% inhibition; moi: multiplicity of infection; NiV: Nipah virus; PBS-T: phosphate buffered saline containing tween; TCID<sub>50</sub>: 50% tissue culture infectious dose; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MA performed much of the live Nipah and Hendra virus antiviral assays and drafted the manuscript, MLS performed many of the pseudotype assays, MKL performed all the cytokine analysis, CLR performed the influenza antiviral assays, MP assisted with pseudotype assays and manuscript preparation, AGM and SS provided compound library support and contributed to the study design, AM provided laboratory and funding support for the pseudotype assays and contributed to manuscript preparation, BAM provided the study design, assisted with live virus and pseudotyped assays, provided funding support and coordinated manuscript preparation.
