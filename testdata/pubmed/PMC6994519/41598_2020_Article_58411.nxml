Here we investigated how long-term IF1-overexpression impacts pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell bioenergetics and insulin secretion. We generated INS-1E cell line stably overexpressing native IF1. We revealed that IF1 overexpression leads to a substantial decrease in ATP levels and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. A decrease in total cellular ATP content was also reflected in decreased free ATP cytosolic and mitochondrial levels, as monitored with ATeam biosensor. Consistently, cellular respiration of IF1-overexpressing cells was decreased. 3D structured illumination microscopy (SIM) revealed a higher amount of insulin granules with higher volume in IF1-overexpressing cells. Similar effects occurred when cells were incubated at low glucose concentrations. Noteworthy, activation of PKA by dibutyryl cAMP entirely abolished the inhibitory effect of IF1 overexpression on ATP production and insulin secretion. Mitochondrial network morphology and cristae ultrastructure in INS-1E overexpressing IF1 remained mostly unchanged. Finally, we show that INS-1E cells decrease their IF1 protein levels relative to ATP synthase &#x003b1;-subunit in response to increased glucose. In conclusion, IF1 actively downregulates INS-1E cellular metabolism and reduces their ability to secrete insulin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Energy metabolism</kwd><kwd>Energy metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grantov&#x000e1; Agentura &#x0010c;esk&#x000e9; Republiky (Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-08565S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dlaskov&#x000e1;</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Adequate secretion of insulin by pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells in response to glucose and other secretagogues is necessary to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. The ATP/ADP ratio is recognized as one of the key factors in promoting insulin secretion by pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells after glucose stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Increase in the ATP/ADP ratio leads to a closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<sub>ATP</sub>) and the subsequent depolarization of the plasma membrane leads to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels. The increase of intracellular calcium is then the triggering signal for exocytosis of insulin secretory granules. Besides the role in the inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel, ATP provides energy for the maturation of insulin granules, their transport along the cytoskeletal network and also regulates protein kinase A (PKA) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. Both of the latter mentioned signalling pathways are involved in the regulation of insulin secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In the majority of cell types, the ATP/ADP ratio is dictated by the energy demand of the cell. On the contrary, pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells are thought to have a specific regulation of metabolic pathways which ensures that the ATP/ADP ratio is governed by the substrate availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. When glucose levels are increased in the bloodstream, glucose is transported (by GLUT2 in rodents, by GLUT1&#x02212;GLUT3 in humans) to the cytosol of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells and further metabolized by glycolysis, citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. The conversion of glucose to glucose-6-P by hexokinase-4 (glucokinase) is recognized as the rate-limiting step of these catabolic reactions. Glucokinase is thus thought to be responsible for the specific metabolism of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Nonetheless, it is conceivable that other regulatory check-points must be present in catabolic pathways of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, which enable the cell to adjust metabolic flux and ATP production. In this work, we focused on ATPase inhibitory factor IF1 and its impact on the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. In general, the activity of ATP synthase has to be precisely controlled to maintain the balance between ATP levels and proton motive force &#x00394;<italic>p</italic> (specifically the membrane potential &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub> component), established by the respiratory chain pumps. Both the lack of ATP and a sudden decrease in &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub> could be detrimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The ATPase inhibitory factor 1, an endogenous regulator of the ATP synthase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, is consensually accepted as a factor involved in the control of this balance, under specific conditions when the ATP synthase consumes ATP to generate &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m</sub>. Such a situation occurs under conditions of severe hypoxia or starvation. IF1 inhibits this reverse mode of ATP synthase to prevent total ATP depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Several previous studies proposed that IF1 can also inhibit ATP synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Noteworthy, the recent work, which resolved a structure of ATP synthase tetramers from the pig (<italic>Sus scrofa domesticus</italic>) by cryo-EM, revealed that the two distinct dimers are joined together by IF1 homodimers in an antiparallel orientation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. These ATP synthase tetramers are in a putatively inactive conformation. This discovery stresses the importance of further research to unveil the relation between ATP synthase oligomerization, the functional role of IF1 and the regulation of the ATP synthase activity.</p><p id="Par6">We have previously shown that IF1 knock-down by siRNA leads to an increase in ATP levels and consequently upregulated insulin secretion in model pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells (INS-1E)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Cells with downregulated IF1 levels had disturbed but apparently enhanced sensing of glucose, when even non-stimulatory glucose levels led to substantial ATP production and subsequent insulin secretion. Consistently with our previous work, we now demonstrate that overexpression of native IF1 levels critically downregulates ATP levels and inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in INS-1E cells. This effect is prevented when cells are incubated with dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP), i.e.when protein kinase A (PKA) signalling is activated. Moreover, we also show that IF1 protein levels relative to ATP synthase &#x003b1;-subunit in INS-1E cells are reciprocally dictated by the glucose availability, thus decreasing at increasing glucose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>IF1 overexpression impairs INS-1E cells growth and protects against cell death</title><p id="Par7">To observe the effect of IF1 on cellular metabolism in model pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells (INS-1E), a stable cell line overexpressing native IF1 was generated. 2.5 fold increase in IF1 protein compared to controls was estimated by western blot (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). We first characterized this cell line regarding its growth rate and viability. IF1-overexpressing cells showed a 33% decrease in cell growth rate compared to controls (assessed between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> day) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Viability of IF1-overexpressing cells was not significantly affected under normal conditions when cultured in standard medium with 11&#x02009;mM glucose (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Two-hour incubation in the presence antimycin A (inhibitor of Complex III), oligomycin (inhibitor of ATP synthase), or uncoupler of the respiratory chain, FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), reduced the viability in both groups nonetheless IF1-overexpressing cells remained more viable than the corresponding controls. Incubation with Complex I inhibitor, rotenone, substantially reduced the viability of both studied group and no difference between them was observable. Lowering glucose to 5&#x02009;mM for 16&#x02009;hours caused a decline in viability in both groups, but again IF1 overexpressing cells were more resistant. A more dramatic decrease in glucose concentration (3 and 1&#x02009;mM) led to a further decline in cell viability in both groups and gradually eliminated the differences between IF1 overexpressing and control cells. Thus apparently, under the majority of stressful situations, IF1-overexpressing cells are less vulnerable and better adapted to functional damage of respiratory chain or reduced ATP levels. Similar effects were previously described in neurons and hepatocytes overexpressing IF1, where induction of signalling cascades preventing cell death was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Growth curve of INS-1E overexpressing IF1 (IF1-OE) and control INS-1E cells (CTRL).

The overexpression of native IF1, therefore, caused the opposite effect than previously reported for IF1 silencing in INS-1E cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin further decreased these rates even in IF1-overexpressing cells, demonstrating that IF1 overexpression was not sufficient to fully inhibit ATP synthesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The maximum respiration capacity was examined by the successive additions of the artificial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). Interestingly, these maximum rates of respiration were also slightly decreased in IF1-overexpressing cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). This might be explained by previously reported tight coupling of ATP synthesis and the rate of oxidative metabolism in INS-1E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. It seems that inhibition/stimulation of ATP synthesis also adjusts the rate of upstream catabolic reactions. In support, we observed that the rate of NADH increase, after inhibition of the respiratory chain, is lower in IF1-overexpressing cells compared to controls (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cellular respiration of IF1-overexpressing and control INS-1E cells preincubated for 2&#x02009;hours in a KRH buffer with indicated glucose concentrations: (<bold>a</bold>) Basal respiration, (<bold>b</bold>) Oligomycin-sensitive respiration, (<bold>c</bold>) Uncoupled respiration.

However, the regulation and the functional role of IF1 in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells are entirely understudied, although ATP synthesis and its regulation are critical for GSIS. Our work is the first to demonstrate that overexpression of native IF1 reduces insulin secretion in model pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells INS-1E by decreasing ATP levels and overall cellular metabolism. We show that native IF1 overexpressed in INS-1E cells is active and capable of downregulating ATP levels. The effect of oligomycin, an artificial inhibitor of ATP synthesis, was nevertheless still observable, thus indicating that ATP synthesis was not entirely inhibited by IF1-overexpression. The prominent effect of IF1 on ATP levels in INS-1E cells can be attributed to the fact that ATP in INS-1E is nearly completely derived from the oxidative phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The present data strongly support the possibility that IF1 can also inhibit ATP synthesis besides the well-established inhibition of ATP hydrolysis. In agreement, the recently published study by Gu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> reported that the tetramers of ATP synthase internally linked by the dimers of IF1 (between the two F1 sectors of neighbour dimers) appear to be in the inhibited state as judged based on the presence of tightly bound MgADP to all the &#x003b2;<sub>DP</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>TP</sub> subunits.</p><p id="Par24">Several previous studies followed the effect of IF1 overexpression in primary mouse cells or cancer cell lines.

We employed the FRET-based biosensor ATeam to show that also free ATP levels are suppressed by the IF1 overexpression.</p><p id="Par26">As expected, a profound decrease in ATP levels led to suppressed insulin secretion in IF1-overexpressing cells in the range of 5 to 20&#x02009;mM glucose.

We observed that PKA activation by dibutyryl cAMP treatment completely abolished the inhibitory effect of IF1 on ATP synthesis and insulin secretion.

This might represent an adaptive response enhancing the available pool at simultaneously reduced GSIS. Similar changes were induced by incubation of cells at low (3&#x02009;mM) glucose, again indicating that the reduced secretion of insulin leads to its higher accumulation within pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell.</p><p id="Par30">Remarkably, we also found out that IF1 protein levels in INS-1E are adjusted based on the glucose concentration in the incubation media, which further supports the regulatory role of IF1 in GSIS. Under low glucose levels, IF1 protein is endogenously upregulated.</p><p id="Par31">To sum up, one can predict that misregulated IF1 expression may affect insulin secretion in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells. Too low levels of IF1 can lead to excessive GSIS even at low non-stimulatory glucose levels. In contrast, upregulated IF1 levels and maybe also downregulated PKA signalling would suppress or delay insulin secretion.
