the superior mesenteric artery and to 2h of reperfusion to establish the
model of I/R. Twenty four rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham,
intestinal I/R (II/R), propofol (P), wortmannin (W). In groups P, W,
propofol was injected intravenously and continuously at the onset of
reperfusion via infusion pump. PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin) was administered
intravenously in group W 25 min before ischemia. Intestinal tissues and lung
tissues were obtained for determination of histologic injury, wet/dry weight
ratio, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities. Meanwhile, the expressions of caspase-3

injury among all the internal organs. Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (II/R) is a
grave clinical event that usually occurs in acute mesenteric ischemia, shock, severe
burns, resuscitation, or some surgical operations including intestinal
transplantation and abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. The damages of intestinal mucosal barrier and immune functions of intestine
are key factors contributing to injurious consequences which were induced by II/R,
and even develop to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Intestine not only injured itself but also destroyed the remote organs, The
lung was the first remote organ affected by II/R<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

respiratory distress syndrome which was the main cause of death in severe
patients<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. </p><p> Propofol (2,6-di-isopropyl phenol) is a fast, short acting intravenous
anesthetic.</p><p> It has the characteristics of rapid recovery, no accumulation after continuous
infusion, and is widely used in anesthesia induction, anesthesia maintenance, and
sedation of postoperative and ICU patients<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. Previous studies have indicated that propofol has protective effects on
intestinal injury induced by II/R. Moreover, the protection mechanisms were revealed
by researchers such as attenuation of intestinal epithelial apoptosis<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>, Inhibiting NADPH Oxidase, effects of antioxidant and in decreasing ET-1
levels<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>, and so on. Recent researches also have shown propofol reduced lung injury
induced by II/R, through suppressing oxidative stress and mast cell degranulation,
inhibition of lipid oxidation<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>, restraining inflammatory response<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. However, the exact mechanisms of propofol still have not been sufficiently
elucidated in intestinal and lung protections.</p><p> The Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is an important signaling
pathway and widely involved in regulating cell growth and survival, proliferation
and apoptosis, glucose metabolism, gene transcription, angiogenesis, inflammation,
cell migration and cell cycle . Abundant researchers have reported that PI3K/Akt
pathway plays a key role in II/R injury. Sodium/glucose transporter 1 glucose uptake
alleviated II/R-induced mucosa barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation via
activation of PI3K/Akt pathway<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. The PI3K/Akt pathway also plays an important role in enhancing restitution
by HB-EGF against II/R injury<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>.</p><p> Previous studies have indicated that PI3K signaling pathway was involved in the
protective effects of propofol on I/R injury. Propofol induced the neuroprotective
effect against focal cerebral I/R injury partly due to the activation of PI3K/Akt
pathway<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>.</p><p> Thus, the aim of the this study was to investigate whether PI3K/Akt pathway is
involved in the protective effects of propofol on intestinal and lung injury induced
by II/R; and the role of PI3K/Akt singaling pathway in the mechanism of protective
effects afforded by propofol. </p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p> The investigation was performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH
Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of Wuhan University.</p><p> Twenty four healthy Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 225 to 275g were purchased
from the Department of Laboratory Animal Center of Wuhan University and placed in
the standardized environment and free access to food and water under a 12-h
light-dark cycles. They were allowed to acclimate to new conditions for a week. All
animals were fasted overnight before experiments but allowed free access to water.
Twenty four rats were randomly allocated into four groups (n=6 each) which included:
Sham, intestinal I/R (II/R), propofol (P), wortmannin (W).</p><sec><title> Surgical procedure and experimental protocols </title><p> The model of II/R injury was created as described in previous research<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. All animals were anesthetized intraperitoneally with an injection of
sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). The rats were placed in a supine position and
kept the body temperature at 37 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C by application of a warming blanket set.
The left iliac vein was cannulated to administer normal saline as the
maintenance fluid. After abdominal shaving and disinfection, the small intestine
was exteriorized from abdominal cavity through abdominal midline incision and
the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was exposed carefully. The intestinal
ischemia was produced by using atraumatic microvascular clamp to occlude the SMA
for 45 min, which was confirmed when the mesenteric artery pulsation ceased and
the intestines became blanch immediately. Then the following 2h reperfusion was
affirmed by return of intestinal color and mesenteric artery pulsation after
clamp removal. Group Sham only performed a midline laparotomy but without
suffering I/R injury. Group II/R was subjected to ischemia for 45 min, followed
by 2h of reperfusion period. Group P underwent the same surgical procedures as
II/R group and administered propofol (20mg/kg/h, Diprivan, propofol 1%,
AstraZeneca, Italy) intravenously and continuously at the onset of reperfusion
via infusion pumps<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">

Institute of Biotechnology, China). Equal amounts of lysate separated on 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and the
proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore,
Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk at ambient temperature
for 1 h, and then incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies against
phospho-Akt, caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA) overnight at

anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody which was labeled by HRP (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, PA) at room temperature for 1h, and washed again
for three times. The Protein bands were visualized by using an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce, Rockford, Ill). The densities of the
bands were quantified by densitometry through the Quantity One software
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).</p></sec><sec><title> Statistical analysis </title><p> All data are expressed as the mean&#x000b1;standard deviation. Statistical analysis was

SMA followed by 2h of reperfusion. II/R caused remarkable intestinal and lung injury
which were presented with pathological morphological changes, significant increases
in Chiu&#x02019;s scores and lung injury scores, and noticeably increased wet/dry weight
ratios in intestinal and lung tissues, respectively. Above results are in accordance
with previous reports<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. In comparison, when propofol was treated in rats, the intestinal and lung
injuries were significantly attenuated, which is in line with others researches<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Conversely, the protective effects of propofol were reversed by PI3K
inhibitor wortmannin.</p><p> Previous researches uncovered that inflammatory response was inevitably involved in
the process of organ injury during IR. In our study, inflammation also happened in
intestinal and lung tissues, as evidenced by inflammatory cells infiltration under
microscope and the increased MPO activities. It is well known that MPO activity is
an indicator of neutrophil migration<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>. Accumulated researches suggest that PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a
critical role in anti-inflammatory response in diverse models and organs (including
intestine and lung), and suppression of inflammatory cells accumulation is an
important factor<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>. In recent study, propofol has been reported to have anti-inflammatory
effects in various ways. One research reveals that propofol leads to a decrease in
plasma TNF-&#x003b1;and IL-6 levels in the model of gut I/R<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. And another previous study has demonstrated that propofol protects against
II/R-induced ALI by suppression of mast cell degranulation<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. Furthermore, propofol exerts neuroprotection against ischemic brain damage
in cerebral ischemia in rats, which relate to attenuation of neutrophil in&#x0fb01;ltration
and suppression of in&#x0fb02;ammatory genes<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. Our study found that the activities of intestinal and lung MPO were
significantly increased after II/R, but reduced by treatment with propofol, however,
PI3K inhibitor wortmannin reversed this effect and accompanied with the aggravation
of tissues damage. Therefore, we speculate that propofol protects intestine and lung
from II/R injury due to activation of PI3K/Akt pathway.</p><p> In order to further illuminate whether the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway is
involved in the protective effects of propofol on intestinal and lung injury induced
by II/R. We tested the MDA levels and SOD activities in intestinal and lung tissues.
Oxidative stress is a main factor contributing to II/R injury, and it is also
involve in the pathogenesis of ALI induced by IR injury<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. Recently, the PI3K/Akt pathway was reported that it&#x02019;s involved in oxidative
stress which induced intestinal and lung tissues damage. Chen <italic>et
al</italic>.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref> indicated that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids alleviate the degree of oxidative
stress induced by lung IR injury and this effect is mediated by activation of the
PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, it has been reported that morphogenic protein epimorphin
alleviates oxidative stress injury of intestinal epithelial cells via activation of
PI3K/Akt pathway<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>. Intravenous anesthetic propofol and vitamin E are similar in structure, as
well as with similar antioxidant capacity. Thus, several studies indicated that
propofol has antioxidant property to against oxidative stress of intestinal and lung
tissues induced by II/R injury<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Consistent with previous researches<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. In current study, intestinal and lung injury were associated with the
remarkable decrease of SOD activities which is a major endogenous antioxidant
enzyme, and significant increase of the lipid peroxidation product MDA in the II/R
group. But treatment with propofol increased SOD activities and decreased MDA levels
that was associated with the reduced Chiu&#x02019;s scores and lung injury scores.
Interestingly, pretreatment with wortmannin significantly decreased the SOD
activities of intestinal and lung tissues and increased their MDA levels, indicating
that propofol exerts protection against oxidative stress via activation of the
PI3K/Akt pathway.</p><p> Accumulated studies have reported that apoptosis is an important mode of cell death
and plays a critical role in the pathophysiologic process of I/R injury<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>. Apoptosis involves a series of complex cellular events, and caspases, one
of proteolytic enzymes, initiate cellular damage finally. As far as we know,
pro-apoptotic factor caspase-3 is the one that most relates to apoptosis among the
various caspases<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>. So we choose to detect caspase-3 in tissues in current study. It is well
known that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a pivotal role in promoting cell survival by
inhibition of apoptotic pathways; moreover, this signaling pathway regulates
apoptosis in many ways, such as targeting of Bcl-2 family proteins, GSK-3 (glycogen
synthase kinase 3), forkhead transcription factors and regulation of protein
synthesis, p53, NF-&#x003ba;B<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>.</p><p> Recent reports indicated that PI3K/Akt pathway has the ability to reduce IR injury
through the antiapoptotic property. We give some examples as follows. A
sodium/glucose transporter 1 uptake reduces epithelial cell apoptosis and barrier
damage by activation of PI3K/Akt pathway<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. Additionally, cytochrome P450 epoxygenase 2J2 markedly attenuated cell
apoptosis in lung tissues induced by IR via activation of PI3K/Akt pathway<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>.Many lines of evidence have shown that propofol has antiapoptotic effect in
various tissues. Recent research reported that propofol exerts neuroprotective
effect through inhibiting neuronal apoptosis via activating the PI3K/Akt pathway
after focal cerebral IR injury<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. Propofol can also attenuate intestinal damage by inhibition of intestinal
epithelial apoptosis after both IR injury and burn injury<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. Our present results showed that II/R significantly increased the expression
of caspase-3. However, treatment with anesthetic propofol remarkably activated Akt
and decreased expression of caspase-3. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin inhibited the
phosphorylation of Akt and increased expression of caspase-3 and reversed protection
induced by treatment with anesthetic propofol. All together, these results indicate
that the PI3K/Akt pathway was involved in the protection of propofol against
intestinal and lung injury induced by II/R through inhibiting cell apoptosis.</p><p> In addition, Ng <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref> suggest that oxidative stress induced by pulmonary IR injury activates the
mitochondrial pathway which is known as the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, and then
results in lung apoptosis. Recently, a study indicated that reactive oxygen species
(ROS) promote cell apoptosis processes mediated by the sphingomyelinase-ceramide
pathway in various tissues<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. Moreover, Baregamian <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref> revealed that mitochondria are the main source of intestinal apoptotic
signaling during oxidative stress.The reason is that excessive ROS damaged
mitochondria, triggering apoptotic process via overexpression of pro-apoptotic
proteins and release of cytochrome c<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref>. A research reported that propofol attenuates intestinal epithelial
apoptosis following II/R, which may be owed to its antioxidant property<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. Another research indicated that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids inhibit ROS
production via activation of PI3K/Akt pathway after lung IR, which mitigates
mitochondria dysfunction, at the end, cell apoptosis processes is blocked<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>. Unfortunately, we haven&#x02019;t studied the relationship between antioxidant and
antiapoptotic properties of propofol. Meanwhile, it remains unclear whether the
antiapoptotic effect of propofol on lung cells is related to antioxidant property of
propofol in current study, which need to be further investigated.</p><p> We noticed that wortmannin reversed only partly the protective effects of propofol.
Besides PI3K/Akt pathway, other protective mechanisms may exist. Recent study
suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
1/2 (MEK/ERK1/2) and PI3K/Akt are both activated by heparin-binding epidermal growth
factor-like growth factor and enhance restitution during intestinal IR<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. In addition, The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of
transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is participate in I/R-induced intestinal injury;
and ischemic postconditioning relieves the II/R injury through inhibiting JAK/STAT
pathway<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref>.</p><p> There are several limitations in our study. First, we used only the inhibitor
wortmannin to investigate the role of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in current study.
Accordingly, the PI3K or Akt genes knockout models or the RNA interference
technology should be used in further research, which will be in favor of proving
their specific roles in our study. Second, we tested only MPO activity, but did not
detected the expression of inflammatory factors. This may not be fully reflected the
extent of the inflammatory response. Third, besides caspase-3, we should detect
apoptosis-related genes and other indicators to provide stronger evidences and
determine the existence and degree of apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p> Propofol protects intestine and lung from II/R injury through inhibiting cell
apoptosis, oxidative stress and neutrophil accumulation. We demonstrated that the
protective effectives of propofol were mediated partly by PI3K/Akt pathway. It may
be provided a theoretical basis for the molecular mechanisms of the protective
effects produced by propofol; and the molecular mechanisms need to be explored
