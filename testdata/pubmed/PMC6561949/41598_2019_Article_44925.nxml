A field experiment was undertaken to assess the benefit of oyster breakwater reefs to mitigate shoreline erosion in a monsoon-dominated subtropical system. Three breakwater reefs with recruited oysters were deployed on an eroding intertidal mudflat at Kutubdia Island, the southeast Bangladesh coast. Data were collected on wave dissipation by the reef structures, changes in shoreline profile, erosion-accretion patterns, and lateral saltmarsh movement and related growth. This was done over four seasons, including the rainy monsoon period. The observed wave heights in the study area ranged 0.1&#x02013;0.5&#x02009;m. The reefs were able to dissipate wave energy and act as breakwaters for tidal water levels between 0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x02009;m. Waves were totally blocked by the vertical relief of the reefs at water levels &#x0003c;0.5&#x02009;m. On the lee side of the reefs, there was accretion of 29&#x02009;cm clayey sediments with erosion reduction of 54% as compared to control sites. The changes caused by the deployed reefs also facilitated seaward expansion of the salt marsh. This study showed that breakwater oyster reefs can reduce erosion, trap suspended sediment, and support seaward saltmarsh expansion demonstrating the potential as a nature-based solution for protecting the subtropical coastlines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Physical oceanography</kwd><kwd>Marine biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100008635</institution-id><institution>EP-Nuffic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NFP-PhD.14/151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chowdhury</surname><given-names>Mohammed Shah Nawaz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Coastal habitats play a critical role in coastal adaptation strategies as they can reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to natural hazards like flooding, eroding shorelines and sea level rise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

Dissipation of wave energy depended on tidal height (water level) and wave height (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Wave heights varied per season, and small waves (&#x0003c;20&#x02009;cm) were recorded in post-monsoon (Oct-Nov) and winter (Dec-Feb) seasons.

Seasonal transect measurements at the control and reef sites indicated that during the pre-monsoon period (March-May) erosion occurs at both the vegetated (i.e. mangrove and salt marsh) areas and seaward mudflat areas. Whereas significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) higher sedimentation occured at the landward mudflat&#x000a0;of reef sites than the control sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Possibly sediment eroded from the supralittoral zone was captured in the upper mudflat area of the reef sites. Southwest monsoon winds became active from May causing maximum rainfall (2,162&#x02009;mm) during the monsoon period (June-September) in 2016. The rain showers, coupled with higher waves generated by southwest monsoon winds triggered greater erosion along the transect at the control sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). At the reef sites, erosion was observed also in the seaward and landward mudflat area during monsoon (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), but was significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) less as compared to control mudflats areas (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). For both control and reef sites, the highest erosion rates occurred in the lower portion (seaward) of mudflat during the monsoon, though the erosion was still significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) lower at reef sites. Sediment deposition occurred during the post-monsoon (i.e. November) predominantly in the vegetated areas at both control and reef sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Sediment deposition was significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) higher at the saltmarsh areas of reef sites than at the salt marsh areas of the control sites during this period. In the mudflat area (i.e. seaward and landward mudflat) no distinct changes were observed in the post-monsoon season and elevation remained identical at the end of the monsoon period (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). By the end of the winter (i.e. February 2017) sediment accumulation reached maximum levels along the transects both&#x000a0;at the reef and control sites with elevation level&#x000a0;as higher as compared to March 2016. Sedimentation was maximum in the lower (seaward) portion of the mudflat for both the control and reef sites. Despite the presence of the reef structures, elevation along the transects for both control and reef sites appeared to be similar in February 2017.

Sediment deposition was common during winter (December - February) period due to low energy incoming waves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. A dry (&#x0003c;60% humidity) and hot (~4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C above the average) air from the north western India moves into the northern Bay of Bengal during the pre-monsoon (March-May) season causing a pre-monsoonal depression in the region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. At that time the coast receives strong longshore currents and waves. As a result, deposited sediments begin to erode from intertidal flats. Sediment erosion reaches a maximum rate during the monsoon (June-September) season, when southwest monsoonal winds result in huge rains and much more turbulent waves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Subsequently, new sediments deposited in the late post-monsoon season (November), that continues throughout the dry winter season. The tidal flat seems unchanged at the end of the winter as compared to the previous winter period (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, see transect line March 2016 and February 2017), indicating that the sediments lost in the previous seasons were regained. As more sediment eroded at the control sites, sedimentation rates were maximum during the winter as more sediment was needed to compensate for the higher losses caused by the monsoon. With only a single year of data, it is difficult to say whether the tidal flat investigated is in a dynamic sediment equilibrium.</p><p id="Par15">If we focus on the effect of the monsoon season alone, sites reach their highest erosion state, oyster breakwater reefs appear to be effective locally at reducing tidal flat erosion (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The deployed structures enhanced sediment deposition at the leeward (landward) side of the reefs, increasing the bed level up to 29&#x02009;cm. Interestingly, the control sites also showed some deposition (&#x0003c;12&#x02009;cm) in landward mudflat portion (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and the mechanism is unknown, but it could be a common topographic cycle at the site. Still the sedimentation rate is significantly higher in all reef sites than controls, confirming the morphological effect of the breakwater reefs. Furthermore, sediment composition changed post-deployment of the breakwater reefs. Notably, mean sediment grain sizes were more stable, even in monsoon months, with finer sediment (i.e., clay and less sand) as compared to the control sites (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Changes in deposition and sediment grain characteristics are a result of probably the interaction between hydrodynamics (i.e., waves action), and the relative height of the breakwater reefs. Wave dissipation was noted when the water level is less than a meter above the reefs. If the wave height was smaller than the relative water depth above the breakwater reefs, wave dissipation was minimal. Despite the importance of reef structures to attenuate wave energy, almost no data on wave dissipation can be found in literature. Our study shows for the same relative water level that larger waves are dissipated more by the reef than smaller waves. La Peyre <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> observed that reefs were more effective in reducing shoreline erosion in an exposed area compared to a sheltered area. The interaction of a reef with larger waves could explain for this difference. Waves and wave dissipation are the primary reasons for the observed local morphological changes. Our study clearly indicates that breakwater reefs can successfully reduce the wave heights (i.e. wave energy). It provided better stability in sediment movement from intertidal bed and reduces erosion, which was not the case for control site without reefs. A 50&#x02009;cm vertical relief of breakwater reefs resulted in long-periods of reduced wave height, resulting in an area of influence over 30&#x02009;m behind the reef favoring sediment accumulation. Moreover, this accumulated sediment, which normally erodes during the monsoon months, was successfully trapped behind (lees) the reefs, thus reducing erosion and stabilizing the tidal flat locally. However, these effects might vary, depending on the intensity of monsoon. The net sediment budget at the end of monsoon (i.e. October) after 2016, but before 2015 also indicated that the oyster breakwater reef could reduce erosion rate by ~50% (i.e. 0.014 m<sup>3</sup> sediment/m<sup>2</sup> area) along the entire reef cross-sectional tidal flat area than the adjacent control areas (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Though winter deposits resets the whole area, with no reef effect visible during winter, this situation only lasts for three months (December-February), while the rest of the year tidal flat showed positive effect on sediment state. Morphological changes in the intertidal mudflat due to reef placement might also depend on other factors. For example, in the Oosterschelde (SW Netherlands), Walles <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> found that the leeward side of constructed oyster reefs was elevated due to sediment accumulation and the effect was correlated with the reef dimension (length). They suggested that longer extended reefs were more likely to generate larger impacts on tidal flat morphology. The experimental reef units used in this study were only 20&#x02009;m in overall length resulting in an impact on the mudflat morphology up to 30&#x02009;m area at the landward side. Beyond this distance, erosion was unchanged for reef and control sites. This entire zone was severely affected continuously by wave actions particularly during the monsoon period. The effect of the reef could be enhanced by extending the length and height of the reefs depending on immersion time in the investigated site. Moreover, the extent of the impact also depends on tidal range, wave condition, bed slope and flow directions at the reef construction site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> along US coast have indicated that the effect of reefs in controlling shoreline erosion is quite variable over time, with their efficacy only viewed as significant during storm induced erosion. However, this study showed that oyster breakwater reefs were equally effective in trapping sediment for all seasons including stormy periods (for instance, a tropical cyclone with wind speeds of 70&#x02013;110&#x02009;km&#x000a0;h<sup>-1</sup>, named &#x02018;Roanu&#x02019; that hit the study site on May 21, 2016).</p><p id="Par16">Not only the waves, regular flow and current dynamics around oyster reefs have also been shown to be crucial in driving local sedimentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. As particulate-laden water moves over an oyster reef, eddies slow water flow to the point where deposition may occur, and the amount of deposition dependent upon suspended sediment concentration in ambient water and their particle size and flow speed. Suspended sediment concentration were higher in ebb than the flood tidal phase, but the tidal current was relatively stronger in ebb tide compared to flood tide, suggesting that sediment deposition rate varies with the tidal phase. Longshore flow and current velocity showed some variation in and around the reef areas. Depth-averaged mean current velocity was less strong in the landward side of the reef than the seaward side<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Whitman and Reidenbach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> conducted a study of flows along mudflats and found that flow velocity was reduced by a factor of 2 compared with flows over an adjacent oyster reefs. In this study, high sediment deposition behind the reefs suggest these low flow areas tended to trap fine sediments. However, drag exerted on current flow by an object like oyster reefs and its influence on sediment deposition and particle flux are a function of the length and orientation of that object in the direction of the flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Perpendicular reefs were found more effective than parallel or circular reefs at producing hydrodynamic conditions that maintain higher deposition rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. In this study, the reefs were placed parallel to coast as breakwater for attenuating wave energy that also effective in trapping sediment. We did not see any possibility that the placement of the parallel breakwater reefs accelerates erosion in adjacent areas including the control sites.</p><p id="Par17">In monsoon season, water flows were strong and erosion of other intertidal ecosystem like salt marshes occur. Short-distance interactions between the reef structures and adjacent salt&#x000a0;marshes could accelerate the process toward more local tidal flat stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. As indicated above, reefs can influence the tidal flat morphology during the monsoon period, impacting nearby salt marsh vegetation in terms of increased plant survival and lateral marsh expansion (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). At both the control and reef sites, seasonal dynamics in terms of the lateral salt&#x000a0;marsh movement showed retreat during the monsoon followed by seaward expansion. Overall landward salt&#x000a0;marsh retreat was significantly lower at the reef sites as compared to the control site during the monsoon season. By reducing the overall erosion rates at landward (=&#x000a0;behind the reefs) area, the reefs have created a window of opportunity for salt marshes to withstand pressure of erosion during the monsoon season, facilitating its seawards expansion, 1.37&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.13&#x02009;m&#x02009;yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> vs. &#x02212;0.20&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01&#x02009;m&#x02009;yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (i.e. retreat) in control site. Alteration of the physical conditions by the deployed reef structures protected the salt marsh during the monsoon season, resulting in the seaward expansion and fast regeneration of the marsh after the monsoon season.

This is the first study from subtropical region showing seaward expansion of salt marshes after deployment of reef structures. Furthermore, a much larger area can be influenced and protected using longer reef structures and increasing the vertical relief that, in turn, can elevate the intertidal bed and create other important shallow habitats, like mangroves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Breakwater structures have often found to play a successful role to rehabilitating mangrove forests in subtropical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Therefore, oyster breakwater reefs not only have the potential for stabilizing the tidal flats but also useful for restoring or enhancing other ecologically important habitats such as salt marsh, offering favorable conditions for many organisms to dwell and grow (so-called Window of Opportunity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Apart from the investigated Kutubdia Island, breakwater reefs can also be implemented in other coastal areas of Bangladesh where natural habitat of oysters is present.

Therefore, estuaries dominated by freshwater plume and coastal areas with high suspended sediments are less suitable for oysters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. For example, the central and southwestern coasts of Bangladesh may not be ideal for deploying artificial oyster reefs as these areas are prone to large amount of sediment-laden freshwater discharge through the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river system.

The results of this study demonstrated that oyster breakwater reefs are particularly useful in reducing erosion at lower intertidal areas as the reefs successfully stabilized sediments in both high (monsoon) and low energy periods. Additionally, they enhanced the growth of adjacent salt marsh vegetation, which expanded their seaward edge thereby further stabilizing the adjacent unconsolidated sediments. This effect can be improved by widening the reef length and height. Moreover, the reef structures provide space for new oysters to grow and develop as biogenic habitat overtime leading to a self-sustained oyster reefs. Therefore, along the coast of Bangladesh, where larval supply of oysters are abundant, the eco-engineered breakwater structures hold promise for a more sustainable shoreline protection against erosion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study area</title><p id="Par20">A manipulative field experiment was carried out at Kutubdia island (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), located in the southeast coast of Bangladesh.

In this regard, a 1&#x02009;m wide grid pattern was used to calculate sediment accretion/erosion in terms of volume (m<sup>3</sup>) by multiplying the sediment height increase/decrease (in meters) and the area of corresponding grid (1&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>) in each cross section. Cross sections for RS and CS were averaged for each year, with changes in sediment accretion/erosion (m<sup>3</sup> sediment m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> area) along the cross-sections measured by comparing the year 2016 with 2015.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sediment grain size</title><p id="Par26">To investigate sediment granulometry changes, monthly sediment samples were taken 5&#x02009;m seaward and 10&#x02009;m landward of each reef and at the same height at the control sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Measurements were done before (September 2015 to February 2016), and after reef construction (Mar 2016 to Mar 2017) using a core sampler (10&#x02009;cm diameter). A total of 190 samples (2 samples &#x000d7;5 sites &#x000d7;19 months) were taken from the top 10&#x02009;cm of sediment. Collected sediment samples were air dried and grounded to fine particles using a mortar and pestle. The materials were oven dried at 110&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until constant weight.

The soil was classified by plotting the particle-size fraction (sand: 0.05&#x02013;2.0&#x02009;mm, silt: 0.002&#x02013;0.05&#x02009;mm, and clay: &#x0003c;0.002&#x02009;mm) in the USDA textural triangle system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Lateral saltmarsh movement</title><p id="Par27">Reference points were set at the lee side of the reefs and at the same height at the control sites by placing benchmark sticks in the middle of the reef to measure lateral (i.e. seaward expansion or landward retreat) salt marsh movement (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). To determine the salt marsh edge movement rate, the distance between the benchmark sticks and the actual saltmarsh edge was measured every month after the reefs were set in place (i.e. March 2016) and then compared with the two control sites. Salt marsh stem density (number of stems m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) was counted monthly in a fixed quadrat (1&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>) 15&#x02009;m from the leeside of the reefs, which was initially 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;m inside the salt marsh edge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par28">The statistical difference in net sediment accumulation or loss (m<sup>3</sup>), mean clay percentages, salt marsh stem density at reefs and at the control sites were verified, using a simple t-Test.
