Plastids have maintained a small remnant genome with a species-specific number of genes mostly involved in photosynthesis and gene expression. The full function and development of all the plastid types, however, requires thousands of nuclear encoded gene products.</p><p>Maize is an agriculturally important monocot grass that has served as a genetic model system for decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], is the focus of a major genome project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and is especially valuable for the study of chloroplast biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Other members of the grass family (<italic>Poaceae</italic>) also offer unique opportunities to study differential plastid gene expression. The presence of closely related species with either C3 or C4 photosynthetic capabilities enables comparison of dimorphic C4 chloroplast development to monomorphic C3 species. In addition, grasses such as switchgrass (<italic>Panicum virgatum</italic>) and miscanthus (<italic>Miscanthus sinensis</italic>) are the subjects of an increased focus on cellulosic ethanol production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>To date, most <italic>Poaceae </italic>chloroplast gene expression studies have concentrated on proteomic or physiologic assays or focused on post-transcriptional modification and regulation of transcripts, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. While these approaches elucidate end point development of transcribed genes, they rarely illuminate the transcription activity of a particular gene. q2(RT)PCR is a maturing tool sensitive enough to detect the existence of small amounts of nucleic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This allows for in-depth, comprehensive investigations into transcript abundance and offers a useful tool to help elucidate the relationship between transcription, translation, and expression.</p><p>q2(RT)PCR is dependent upon the amplification and quantification of a single amplicon that makes primer design and amplification conditions key to the success of an experiment. Substantial time and resources may be spent in the design, testing, and subsequent reworking of primers for optimal efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In this paper we describe the development and empirical optimization of primer pairs to amplify each rRNA and mRNA from maize plastids. Primer sequences, optimal annealing temperatures, and extension times are reported. In addition, each primer set was tested, <italic>in silico</italic>, against published plastome sequences and <italic>in vitro </italic>against switchgrass and miscanthus transcripts. Using the conditions optimized for maize, all primer pairs successfully produced a single amplicon for these two grass species.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>One of the challenging and time consuming aspects of q2(RT)-PCR is the design and optimization of primer pairs which yield single amplicons. The aim of this study was to design and optimize a comprehensive set of plastid specific primers for q2(RT)PCR specific enough to yield robust steady state transcript data from maize yet flexible enough to recognize transcripts from multiple members of the family <italic>Poaceae</italic>. To accomplish this, primers were designed against highly homologous protein coding regions from the maize plastome, as well as rRNA genes. Primers were designed to produce amplicons 75&#x02013;150 bp in length, have similar annealing temperatures, and were carefully evaluated for favorable melting temperatures to insure a lack of intra-molecular folding. Each primer set was qualitatively examined and optimized with endpoint RT-PCR as seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1(A&#x02013;E)</xref>. These optimal conditions were then utilized in q2(RT)-PCR for each primer pair to verify the amplification of single amplicons via melt curves and their ability to produce quantitative data as seen in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1(F)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1(G)</xref>. The complete set of primer pairs yielding single amplicons and their optimized conditions is listed in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Primer optimization and visual verification of a single amplicon for maize chloroplast genes utilizing endpoint RT-PCR.

For example, primer pairs that produced a single amplicon over a relatively large range of annealing temperatures and elongation times as shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> were designated category 1 primers. Category 2 primer pairs produced multiple products at non-optimal annealing temperatures or elongation times and are shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,1C,1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>; category 3 primer pairs produced multiple amplicons due to the presence of multiple organellar genomes or primers having a high affinity to unknown additional nucleotide sequences. Category 1 primer pairs consistently were the most forgiving of strict protocol adherence. Elongation and annealing temperatures could be adjusted with no visible endpoint differences. Category 2 primer pairs required stricter elongation times and annealing temperatures for optimal single product results. Subcategory 2a includes primer pairs where an elongation time greater than 30 seconds resulted in multiple erroneous amplicons. Subcategory 2b includes primer pairs requiring specific annealing temperatures either to generate the most product as seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> or to produce only one product as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>. One lesson learned is that some primer pairs initially in the 2b subcategory could be moved to category one if the primers were re-designed such that their individual melting temperatures were more similar. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> illustrates inconsistent and nonspecific product bands from the first pair of primers designed for <italic>psaB </italic>that had individual primer melting point temperatures that differed by 4&#x000b0;C. The subsequent set of primers designed for <italic>psaB </italic>have more similar melting temperatures and optimized end point results can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>. The third category of primer pairs consist of gene sequences where a highly similar homolog exists either in the nucleus or mitochondria (<italic>4.5S</italic>, <italic>16S</italic>, <italic>atpE</italic>, <italic>rpl2</italic>, and <italic>23S</italic>) and\or genes where multiple attempts to design primer pairs produced unacceptable products (<italic>rps12 </italic>and <italic>rps7</italic>). Two category 3 examples, <italic>4.5S </italic>and <italic>16S</italic>, are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. For <italic>4.5S</italic>, an end-point reaction utilizing suboptimal primers appeared to produce a single band but a melt peak curve clearly showed three very similar but distinct products. A subsequent redesign of the 3' primer for 4.5S and 23S resulted in single amplicons verified by their respective melt curve signatures and are reported as the 3' primers in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. <italic>16S</italic>, on the other hand, should also produce multiple bands according to screens of the maize genomes but neither end-point nor q2(RT)PCR can distinguish separate products. We could not successfully design some category 3 primer pairs. They either repeatedly produced multiple amplicons or could not be verified as amplified from the chloroplast genome. These primer pairs have been excluded from Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> or do not have annealing temperatures associated with them.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Sensitivity difference between endpoint RT-PCR and q2(RT)PCR for genes found in multiple organelles.

This primer set for <italic>23S </italic>was not analyzed by q2(RT)PCR due to the presence of multiple endpoint products. A redesign of the <italic>23S </italic>3' primer was accomplished and is reported in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1746-4811-4-14-2"/></fig><p>Some plastid genes with intra-cellular homologs could be specifically amplified when primers were designed to take advantage of small non-similar regions within the genes. This was achieved by comparing the homology between the genes and designing primers to recognize unique regions within chloroplast genes. Primers were then compared to other competing homologs, if the primer homology was less than 50% and there were no 3' matching nucleotides, then the design process was completed and the primers synthesized. The similarity estimation was based on the BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] percent identity score and not the E value which can be inflated when sequence sizes are small. One exception to this design strategy was the <italic>atpA </italic>gene primers which have &#x0003e;50% homology and should anneal to mitochondrial homologous regions. The possible mitochondrial amplicon however was predicted to be 125,630 base pairs long. An experimental end-point check of the <italic>atpA </italic>primers amplified the desired 77 base pair chloroplast amplicon and the single product was verified by a q2(RT)PCR melt curve. Multi-genomic genes exhibiting high homology but whose primer annealing sites and subsequent amplicons are plastid specific when analyzed in this manner are reported in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> as category 1 or category 2 genes. Multi-genomic genes with homologies below 50% and whose primer pairs were determined to amplify only chloroplast genomic material are also reported in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> as category 1 or category 2 genes.</p><p>The homology between plastomes from closely related plant species is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This homology has been previously utilized to design PCR primer pairs that would produce amplicons across genera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Based on this, we hypothesized that our primer pairs should amplify similar regions of the same genes from other members of the grass family (<italic>Poaceae</italic>). To test this, an <italic>in silico </italic>comparison of the primers to grasses with completed plastomes was conducted. The possibility of a successful reaction was judged based on overall percent homology and the presence of mismatched bases at the 3' end of the primers. This comparison suggested that primer homology and subsequent amplification success would closely follow established taxonomic designations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Members of the PACCAD clade (<italic>S. officinarum </italic>and <italic>S. bicolor</italic>), to which maize belongs, have the greatest possibility of successful amplifications for all primer pairs while there is a noticeable drop in predicted success among members of the BEP clade (<italic>H. vulgare</italic>, <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, <italic>L. perrene</italic>). Arabidopsis was included as an outgroup, with only 22% of the primers predicted to successfully anneal to the intended target gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><italic>In silico </italic>comparisons of <italic>Zea mays </italic>plastome primers to other species.

Although equal amounts of total RNA were added for each round there was no attempt to normalize the data to account for any differences that may exist between species. It also must be stressed that the primer pairs have been optimized for the maize plastome and although all were checked and verified to produce single amplicons for both switchgrass and miscanthus, the reported annealing temperatures were not optimized to ensure the greatest signal was detected for these two species.

Primer pairs were designed from the NCBI published <italic>Zea mays </italic>complete chloroplast genome sequence accession numbers [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="X86563">X86563</ext-link> and GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_001666">NC_001666</ext-link>], NAPD-Malic enzyme accession number [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="J05130">J05130</ext-link>], and NAPD-Malate dehydrogenase accession number [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY105634">AY105634</ext-link>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Gene sequences were obtained from each coding sequence (CDS) listing, rRNA listing, or accession number sequence. The coding sequence was then analyzed using the BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] program for homology to mitochondrial and known nuclear maize genomes. Primers were designed with an attempt to utilize dissimilar sequences between the genomes using the online software primer3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Suggested primers were checked for inhibitory secondary structures using mFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and edited until the recommended primer produced a positive delta G at 45&#x000b0;C. This ensured selected primer pairs would possess a null or positive delta G energy signature at reverse transcriptase annealing temperatures and amplify chloroplast specific gene sequences. Primer pairs were then optimized to produce a single amplicon of predicted length by end-point temperature gradient PCR with maize whole leaf tissue RNA template and visualized on a 3% TAE agarose gel run alongside a 2-Log ladder from New England Biolabs (Ipswitch, MA). Optimization of primer pairs consisted of running eight temperature gradient dependent reactions and visualizing them on a 3% agarose gel. The gradient spanned a 10&#x000b0;C range, &#x000b1; 5&#x000b0; from the average melting temperatures (Tm) of the primer pairs as reported by the supply company. Reaction elongation times were set at two minutes in the initial primer set testing phase. Several of the initial primer pairs produced amplicons of greater length than the predicted length. Elongation times for these and subsequent primer pairs were reduced to 30 seconds to better match calculated elongation time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] for amplicons of the desired size. Amplicons from switchgrass and miscanthus were then verified as the only product via end point RT-PCR visualized on 3% TAE agarose gel and then subsequently verified by the q2(RT)PCR melt curve for a single amplicon with BioRad's IQ&#x02122;5 Optical System software, Hercules, CA,.
