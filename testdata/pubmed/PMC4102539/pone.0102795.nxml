Difficulty studying reservoirs in patients underscores the need for animal models that mimics HIV infected humans on cART. We studied SIV-infected Chinese-origin rhesus macaques (Ch-RM) treated with intensive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and 3 weeks of treatment with the histone deacetyalse inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>SIVmac251 infected Ch-RM received reverse transcriptase inhibitors PMPA and FTC and integrase inhibitor L-870812 beginning 7 weeks post infection. Integrase inhibitor L-900564 and boosted protease inhibitor treatment with Darunavir and Ritonavir were added later. cART was continued for 45 weeks, with daily SAHA administered for the last 3 weeks, followed by euthanasia/necropsy. Plasma viral RNA and cell/tissue-associated SIV gag RNA and DNA were quantified by qRT-PCR/qPCR, with flow cytometry monitoring changes in immune cell populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Upon cART initiation, plasma viremia declined, remaining &#x0003c;30 SIV RNA copy Eq/ml during cART, with occasional blips.

Multiple factors may contribute to this, but prominent among them is the ability of the virus to persist in anatomical or cellular compartments, including latently infected &#x0201c;resting&#x0201d; CD4+ T lymphocytes, which are not susceptible to the activity of currently available antiretroviral drugs that work by blocking new rounds of infection but do not impact already infected cells <xref rid="pone.0102795-Eisele1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Residual virus can be found in a variety of tissues in individuals on cART, including the central nervous system (CNS) <xref rid="pone.0102795-Heaton1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102795-Zink1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Viral levels in the GALT are still measurable in HIV-1 patients on long-term successful ART <xref rid="pone.0102795-Poles1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and we have shown that the large intestine (where most GALT resides) can harbor much virus, even in SIV-infected animals with low or undetectable viremia <xref rid="pone.0102795-Ling1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. An advantage of animal models is the ability to sample tissues more extensively than is typically feasible in a clinical setting, allowing assessment of residual virus, and the effects of combination treatment strategies in compartments other than blood. Another advantage is that experimental therapies with multiple drug combinations can be employed in more radical attempts to eradicate virus from infected hosts, and conduct proof of concept testing of experimental &#x0201c;cure&#x0201d; strategies for which risk/benefit assessments may preclude long-term use in humans.</p><p>Indian-origin rhesus macaques (In-RM) support SIVmac239 and SIVmac251 replication to higher levels than seen in Chinese-origin rhesus macaques (Ch-RM) or levels of HIV seen in infected humans <xref rid="pone.0102795-Marthas1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102795-Ling2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. As the ease of suppression of viral replication with cART is affected by pretreatment viral replication levels <xref rid="pone.0102795-DelPrete1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, it can be challenging to achieve full suppression of SIV viral replication with cART in In-RM. Thus, we hypothesized that Ch-RM infected with SIV, in which plasma viremia levels more closely approximate those of HIV-1 infected patients <xref rid="pone.0102795-Ling2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, would be a better model to mimic the sustained viral suppression in patients on cART. In a previous study of Ch-RM infected with SIV, we showed that a different cART regimen was able to suppress viral replication to less than 50 copy Eq/ml after 2&#x02013;3 weeks of therapy, and this level of suppression was maintained for months. These observations suggested that this model may be particularly useful for studying residual virus in the setting of cART suppression <xref rid="pone.0102795-Ling3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Histone acetylation has been identified as one of the epigenetic mechanisms contributing to maintenance of HIV-1 latency, and treatment with HDACi has been shown to induce expression of latent HIV proviruses in various <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> assays <xref rid="pone.0102795-Lehrman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0102795-Wightman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Although there are toxicities associated with use of HDACi, the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, Vorinostat) is approved for treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma and has been shown in some studies to induce expression of HIV in various <italic>in vitro</italic> assay systems or <italic>ex vivo</italic> in cells from individuals on suppressive cART. SAHA has also been reported to induce at least transient increases in cell associated HIV-1 RNA after single dose administration in HIV-1 infected patients <xref rid="pone.0102795-Archin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, while another study did not find the effect of SAHA on HIV reactivation <xref rid="pone.0102795-Blazkova1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Additionally, different modes of administration may impact in vivo activity. When we initiated this study, the overall effect of repeated dosing with SAHA on residual virus in infected individuals receiving cART had not been assessed.</p><p>Here, we longitudinally monitored changes in residual virus, immune activation and immune reconstitution in peripheral blood and in tissues, including GALT, to assess the effects of intensive cART administered over nearly a year, with daily treatment with the HDACi SAHA during the final three weeks of cART administration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Experimental procedures described for this study were approved by the Tulane Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Each animal also received the integrase inhibitor L-870812 (10 mg/kg), given orally twice a day in FlavoRx syrups. A second integrase inhibitor L-900564, was added to the regimen at week 22 post infection (10 mg/kg, orally, b.i.d). The protease inhibitor Darunavir (400 mg, orally, b.i.d.) and the protease inhibitor/boosting agent Ritonavir (100 mg, orally, b.i.d.) were added at week 30 post infection. The HDACi Vorinostat (SAHA) was administered orally mixed with food (50 mg/kg once daily) for the last 3 weeks of the study. cART was continued through the end of the study.

Tissues were then digested with 60 U/ml collagenase (type II, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 40 min. To enrich and purify lymphocytes, isolated cells were layered on a discontinuous 40%/60% Percoll gradient (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) or 95% Ficoll-paque plus and centrifuged for 30 min at 1000 g, washed, and re-suspended in complete RPMI media containing 5% FCS.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Quantification of plasma RNA and cellular SIV Gag DNA, RNA</title><p>Virion associated SIV RNA plasma viral loads (pVL) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR analysis using an assay with a sensitivity of 30 copy equivalents/ml (copy Eq/ml), as previously described <xref rid="pone.0102795-Cline1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. When available, plasma volumes greater than 0.5 mL were used for analysis, resulting in correspondingly lower threshold sensitivities (15 copy Eq/ml for 1 mL aliquots or 4 copy Eq/ml for 4 ml samples at necropsy). At necropsy, 4 mL of plasma were analyzed to yield a threshold sensitivity of 4 copy Eq/ml. Determination of cell-associated SIV DNA and RNA viral loads for samples collected up to the time of necropsy followed previously described methods for assay and analysis <xref rid="pone.0102795-Venneti1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These standard methods have a 95% reliable threshold sensitivity of 30 total copies of SIV DNA or RNA per sample; determined SIV copies were normalized to diploid genome cell equivalents co-determined by qPCR as described. For cell samples prepared from necropsy tissues, ultrasensitive, nested, qPCR/RT-PCR methods of analysis with reaction conditions and primer/probe sequences as detailed in Hansen et. al <xref rid="pone.0102795-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and reflecting a combination of real-time and digital PCR analyses were applied. DNA and RNA were prepared as above from multiple aliquots of frozen cell pellets to provide a greater amount of test material and a correspondingly lower limit of detection. The respective DNA and RNA samples were dissolved in minimal volumes of 130 ul for subsequent assay. Twelve replicate aliquots of DNA or RNA (no control spikes) were tested in modified reaction conditions of reduced volumes for PCR and RT-PCR to take advantage of 384-well plate formats in LifeTechnologies ViiA7 real-time instrumentation (LifeTechnologies, Inc.). For DNA PCR, 10 ul sample was added to 10 ul cocktail for preamplification with nesting primers SIVnestF01 and SIVnestR01 and 2 ul of this preamplification reaction were transferred to 20 ul real-time PCR reaction cocktail. For RNA RT-PCR 10 ul sample was added to 5 ul of concentrated reverse transcription cocktail with cDNA synthesis primers by SIVnestR01 followed by addition of 10 ul PCR cocktail containing SIVnestF01 for preamplification; 2.5 ul of this preamplification reaction were added to 20 ul of real-time PCR cocktail as above.

Tandem LC-MS analysis was performed on a Thermo Transcend LC system with HTS PAL CTC autosampler interfaced to an API-5000 mass spectrometer utilizing the turbo ionspray interface (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Separation of SAHA was achieved on an Aquity UPLC HSS T3 column (50&#x000d7;2.1 mm, 1.8 mm) using a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) at a flow rate of 0.75 mL/min. The chromatography was run using a step gradient as follows: the column was equilibrated at 95% A, after sample injection, solvent A was maintained at 95% for 0.25 min before it was increased linearly to 95% of solvent B over a 1.5 minute period. The fraction of solvent B was maintained for 0.42 minutes, before, the fraction of solvent B was returned to the initial conditions and kept for additional 0.83 minutes. The total run time was 3 minutes. Quantification was done by monitoring the transition of m/z 265.3 to m/z 232.0 for SAHA and m/z 281.3 to m/z 193.1 for imipramine.

Three weeks of daily SAHA treatment were initiated at week 49, along with continued cART, resulting in maintenance of plasma viremia under 30 copy Eq/ml as measured by the standard qRT-PCR assay. Blood volume limitations precluded use of the ultrasensitive qRT-PCR assay for quantification at these timepoints. However, at week 52, after three weeks of daily dosing with SAHA, animals were euthanized and necropsied, and testing of larger plasma volumes obtained at necropsy showed no measurable viral plasma RNA in all 3 animals, using an assay format with a sensitivity of &#x0003c;4 copy Eq/ml in blood.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Cell-associated SIV Gag DNA and RNA levels in blood and tissues during continuous cART and SAHA treatment</title><p>To investigate the effect of SAHA on viral expression during continuous cART, we monitored total cell-associated SIV Gag DNA and RNA levels in CD4+ T cells purified from PBMCs before SAHA administration, at 2, 6, 24 hrs after the first dose, and then weekly (168, 336 and 504 hrs after the first dose of SAHA) over the 3-week period of SAHA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0102795-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

Although cellular SIV RNA levels for many samples were below assay quantification levels, cellular SIV RNA levels went from below quantification limits before SAHA treatment to quantifiable levels at week 3 or by the end of SAHA therapy in multiple tissues, potentially consistent with a SAHA effect. However, a clear effect of SAHA treatment on cell associated viral nucleic assay levels could not be assessed by the fold change of RNA/DNA ratio compared to pre-SAHA baseline levels, because many of LN and duodenum samples did not yield measurable levels of viral DNA or RNA before SAHA therapy. However, this may also have been a consequence of sampling, as necropsy samples provided many more cells and tissue than biopsy samples.</p><fig id="pone-0102795-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0102795.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>PBMC cell-associated levels of SIV gag DNA (A), RNA (B), and ratio of RNA/DNA (C) before and during SAHA, with cART throughout.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0102795.g002"/></fig><table-wrap id="pone-0102795-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0102795.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Cell-associated SIV Gag DNA and RNA levels in LN and gut tissues during cART and SAHA therapy<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">*</xref>.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0102795-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0102795.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sample</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SIV DNA per10<sup>8</sup> cell eq.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SIV RNA per10<sup>8</sup> cell eq.</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNA:DNAratio</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fold Difference from Pre-SAHA Baseline Normalized RNA:DNA ratio</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

However, when In-RM are infected with the highly replicating, highly pathogenic virus SIVmac239 or SIVmac251, it can be challenging to achieve and maintain clinically relevant levels of viral suppression. We therefore are exploring the potential of SIVmac251 infected Ch-RM, which replicate SIVmac251 to lower levels than In-RM, as a model for studies of suppressive cART and evaluation of strategies for targeting residual virus in suppressed individuals. In the present study, we administered an intensive, suppressive cART regimen followed by the HDACi SAHA, with monitoring of immunologic and virologic parameters to evaluate the ability of this approach to virus target persistent tissue reservoirs.</p><p>Despite dramatic impacts on survival and quality of life for HIV infected individuals, cART does not represent definitive treatment of HIV infection. The drugs must be taken for life, and if they are discontinued, residual virus, which persists even in the face of long term, seemingly effectively suppressive cART, provides a source for seeding of recrudescent progressive infection. To address this situation, strategies are being explored to target and reduce or eliminate this residual virus, under cover of continuous cART. Among the approaches being explored is the use of HDACi, including SAHA, to induce expression from latently infected cells, to &#x0201c;purge&#x0201d; residual virus, contributing to either a &#x0201c;functional cure&#x0201d;, or ideally, outright viral eradication. As some of the strategies under consideration to achieve these goals involve considerable potential risk, especially relative to continued standard of care cART, the development of suitable animal models for the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of these approaches will be an important component of the overall research program in this area.</p><p>Sustained treatment with an intensive cART regimen, with concomitant SAHA administration during the final 3 weeks, was safe and well tolerated. Viral replication was suppressed to very low levels in the blood, lymph nodes and the GALT, and this response parallels HIV-1 patients on effective cART <xref rid="pone.0102795-DelPrete1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, we still observed at least intermittently detectable residual virus and associated immune activation, findings also consistent with clinical results. Incomplete penetration of ART drugs to certain cells or tissues may contribute to incomplete suppression in vivo <xref rid="pone.0102795-Cory1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>When SAHA treatment was administered in the setting of ongoing cART, with the dosing, sampling and analyses performed in this pilot study, we did not observe convincing evidence of an impact of SAHA treatment on levels of plasma or cell associated SIV nucleic acids. We believe that this result, which differs from findings recently reported from clinical studies of single dose SAHA treatment in HIV infected patients receiving cART <xref rid="pone.0102795-Archin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102795-Lewin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> showing transient increases in PBMC cell associated SIV RNA levels, likely reflects limitations based on the small number of animals examined, the suboptimal dosing of SAHA employed (as reflected by low measured plasma levels of SAHA and the limited increase in histone acetylation), and the sampling and analyses performed, rather than any inherent divergence of the model from HIV-infected patients or other experimental NHP model systems. Indeed another study in In-RM on suppressive cART suggests that treatment with higher doses of SAHA may be associated with increases in histone acetylation and in the ratio of SIV RNA to SIV DNA in PBMC (Lifson et al, in preparation). Induction of SIV RNA expression from latently SIV infected CD4+ T cells obtained from rhesus macaques on suppressive cART has been observed in <italic>ex vivo</italic> assays using 500 nM SAHA (Lifson, et al, in preparation), a level approached only in IV37 in the current experiments. Furthermore, emerging data from clinical trials suggest that repeated daily dosing with SAHA may limit observable virologic effects compared to single doses <xref rid="pone.0102795-Archin2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we used an intensified three class cART regimen incorporating reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, and to assess the impact of early cART intervention, starting cART much earlier (7 weeks post infection) compared with our previous studies <xref rid="pone.0102795-Ling3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This cART regimen effectively and durably suppressed viral replication in blood. Compared to recent experience with cART treatment of SIVmac239 infected In-RM using similar regimens, it appears to be somewhat easier to consistently achieve and maintain clinically relevant levels of viral suppression with cART in Ch-RM, starting from the lower levels of pretreatment plasma viremia typical of this model (Lifson, et al, in preparation). This efficacy of suppression, combined with excellent tolerance over the period of the study suggests that SIV-infected Ch-RM may be an attractive model for studies of residual virus and evaluation of strategies targeting viral reservoirs in the setting of cART suppression of viral replication. Virtually all subjects on suppressive cART show residual low level viremia when sufficiently sensitive research assays are employed, although such individuals are typically considered to have &#x0201c;undetectable&#x0201d; viremia based on less sensitive assays used clinically. However, the source of this residual viremia remains controversial, with competing arguments supporting its origin from incompletely suppressed viral replication (especially in tissues), vs. suggestions that it arises from stochastic reactivation of latently infected cells, or from persistently infected cells not susceptible to inhibition by cART, and/or resistant to immune clearance. Numerous cART intensification studies have attempted to address this question, with most showing no impact, although a couple of studies have demonstrated apparent effects of treatment intensification, particularly when adding integrase inhibitors to base regimens including protease inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0102795-Buzon1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0102795-Hatano1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0102795-Yukl1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>After showing characteristic decreases in viremia upon implementation of cART, animals showed variable but substantial reconstitution of CD4+ T cells and CD4+ T cell subsets in peripheral blood, lymph nodes and GALT. Levels of CD4+ T<sub>CM</sub> were relatively stable in all the compartments, whereas T<sub>N</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> fluctuated in different compartments and also varied individually.</p><p>Persistent immune activation and inflammation are associated with viral persistence in HIV-1 infected patients, even in those on long-term antiretroviral therapy. However, the mechanisms and cause-effect relationship is yet unclear <xref rid="pone.0102795-Plaeger1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. As with treated HIV-infected patients, cART substantially reduced measures of immune activation in the treated macaques compared to pretreatment levels, but did not fully normalize them to levels seen in uninfected macaques.</p><p>In summary, SIVmac251-infected Ch-RM have lower viremia than infected In-RM, facilitating sustained suppression of viral replication with cART. However, despite treatment with an intensive cART regimen including six drugs, persistent virus was present in both GALT and lymph nodes at necropsy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0102795-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, the cART regimen employed was well tolerated, potently suppressed viral nucleic acid levels in blood and tissues to very low levels (&#x0003c;4 copy Eq/ml of plasma at necropsy), resulted in reduced immune activation, and substantial reconstituted of CD4+ T cells in multiple tissue compartments. While SAHA treatment added to the cART regimen was well tolerated, within the limited animals and samples examined, we were not able to demonstrate a convincing effect of SAHA on perturbing levels of viral nucleic acids, including PBMC cell associated viral RNA. Lack of demonstration of such changes, at odds with a recently reported clinical trial data, likely reflects limitations of dosing, sampling and analyses performed in this study, and may reflect differences between effects of single vs. repeated daily doses of SAHA <xref rid="pone.0102795-Archin2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> rather than limitations of the SIV infected Ch-RM model. Indeed, pulsatile dosing of SAHA or other HDACi may be more effective for induction of latent AIDS viruses than the daily dosing used here, which was patterned on the paradigm in which the drug is used for treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma <xref rid="pone.0102795-Duvic1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Although gender differences in immune activation in response to HIV infection have been described <xref rid="pone.0102795-Plaeger1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the role of gender differences on efficacy of HIV treatment, and response to SAHA treatment is not well defined, so it is worth noting that the 3 animals studied here were all females.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data suggest that cART suppressed, SIV-infected Ch-RM may represent a useful model for mimicking HIV infected patients on therapy for studies of viral reservoirs and for evaluation of viral eradication strategies. Despite intensive cART over one year, viral nucleic acid remained in lymphoid and gut tissues. Three weeks of daily SAHA treatment was well tolerated but did not demonstrably impact viral RNA levels in plasma or tissues; perhaps reflecting dosing, sampling and assay limitations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank C.
