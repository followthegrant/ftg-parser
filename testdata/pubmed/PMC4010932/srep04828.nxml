Although bacteremias from dental plaque and/or elevated circulating inflammatory cytokines emanating from the inflamed gingiva are suspected mechanisms linking periodontitis and these diseases, direct evidence is lacking. We hypothesize that disturbances of the gut microbiota by swallowed bacteria induce a metabolic endotoxemia leading metabolic disorders. To investigate this hypothesis, changes in the gut microbiota, insulin and glucose intolerance, and levels of tissue inflammation were analysed in mice after oral administration of <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, a representative periodontopathogens. Pyrosequencing revealed that the population belonging to Bacteroidales was significantly elevated in <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-administered mice which coincided with increases in insulin resistance and systemic inflammation. In <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-administered mice blood endotoxin levels tended to be higher, whereas gene expression of tight junction proteins in the ileum was significantly decreased. These results provide a new paradigm for the interrelationship between periodontitis and systemic diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Periodontal diseases are mainly chronic infectious diseases result from response to a complex dental plaque microbiome containing various periodontopathic bacteria species. Periodontal diseases destroys the tooth-supporting tissues and leads to tooth loss if not adequately treated. Advanced form of the diseases affects ~10% to 15% of adults worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p><p>Epidemiological evidence suggests that periodontal infection is associated with an increased risk of a variety of diseases such as atherosclerotic vascular diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, type 2 diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Among the various periodontopathic bacteria, considerable research has focused on the role of <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> in possible mechanisms linking periodontal diseases and other human diseases, due to its unique pathogenicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and its association with these various diseases.</p><p>Once an inflammatory lesion in the periodontium is established, bacteria from the dental plaque can invade into the gingival tissue through the ulcerated sulcular epithelial lining of periodontal pockets and then disseminate into the systemic circulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In addition, various proinflammatory cytokines are produced in the inflamed periodontal tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> which can also enter the systemic circulation. Although the precise mechanisms have not been clarified, the resulting bacteremia and increase in circulating inflammatory mediators may potentiate an inflammatory reaction in other tissues or organs. In fact, a number of studies have demonstrated elevated levels of serum hs-CRP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and IL-6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> in periodontitis patients when compared with periodontally healthy subjects. By contrast, there is little evidence for an increased detection and/or numbers of oral bacteria in the blood of periodontitis patients when compared with periodontally healthy subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In addition, we have shown that repeated oral inoculation of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> induced elevation of serum inflammatory markers (serum amyloid A and IL-6) in mice. However, no <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> was detected in the blood at any time point of these experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Moreover, in this mouse model, a limited inflammatory cell infiltrate was seen in the gingival tissue.</p><p>It is well-known that obesity, a chronic disease characterized by an excessive growth of adipose tissue, increases the risk of insulin resistance, diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Interestingly, many of these diseases are also associated with inflammatory periodontal diseases. Insulin resistance, a key feature of obesity, is a state in which the sensitivity of target cells to respond to ordinary levels of insulin is reduced. This insulin sensitivity is modulated in part by adipokines. In obesity, adipokine production is either up-regulated or down-regulated. Specifically, insulin resistance-associated adipokines are usually up-regulated whereas insulin-sensitivity-associated adipokines are down-regulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>Obesity is reported to be associated with periodontal diseases. Saito <italic>et al</italic>. first reported that obese Japanese subjects were more likely to have periodontal disease than thin subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Although later studies supported the positive association between obesity and periodontitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, there are also studies showing no association between these two conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. While there are several epidemiological studies demonstrating this association, there are few reports on the mechanism linking obesity and periodontal diseases. One proposed mechanism involves the adipocyte hypertrophy found in obesity. This adipocyte hypertrophy leads to infiltration of macrophages and other inflammatory cells. This phenomenon results in low-grade chronic inflammation and enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Among the many adipokines, TNF-&#x003b1; is considered a key player in inflammatory cell activation and recruitment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. TNF-&#x003b1; produced by the adipocytes together with TNF-&#x003b1; produced in the periodontal tissue may induce further periodontal tissue destruction. However, several reports have shown that serum TNF-&#x003b1; levels of periodontitis patients are either not elevated or lower in periodontitis patients compared with non-periodontitis subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Thus, the pathogenic mechanisms for the effects of periodontal disease affecting systemic disease and the specific effects of the infection with periodontopathic bacteria on the pathology of various tissues remain to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we propose that endotoxemia is responsible for inflammation of various organs and tissues in this mouse model through <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> oral administration. However, this endotoxemia may not be induced directly by bacteria from the oral cavity, but rather through changes in gut microbiota induced by inoculation of bacteria from the oral cavity into the gut through swallowing. Subsequent activation of proinflammatory genes within blood vessels, adipose tissue and liver could increase the risk of atherosclerosis, insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), respectively.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Local and systemic inflammation in <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-administered mice</title><p>Our previous study and others demonstrated that repeated oral gavage administration of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> induced alveolar bone resorption.

We defined the extent to which oral administration of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> altered the composition of the microbiota by pyrosequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA genes in the ileum contents. In total, 41,557 (mean 6,926&#x02005;reads/sample) and 32,108 (mean 5,351&#x02005;reads/sample) sequencing reads for the <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-administered samples and the sham-administered samples, respectively, were obtained by two sequencing runs.

However, no <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-specific DNA was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>P. gingivalis</italic> administration increases serum endotoxin level</title><p>As it has been reported that changes in the gut microbiota influence metabolic endotoxemia, we compared the serum endotoxin levels between <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-administered mice and sham-administered mice.

However, the endotoxin levels dramatically increased if the mice were fed ad libitum irrespective of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> administration. The endotoxin level tended to be higher in <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-administered mice compared to sham-administered mice. However, this difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). In order to further examine the effect of oral administration of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> on endotoxemia, the serum endotoxin levels were monitored at 1, 3, 12&#x02005;hrs. after a single administration of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. Serum endotoxin levels increased as early as 1&#x02005;hr. after administration, peaked at 3&#x02005;hrs., and maintained these higher levels until 12&#x02005;hrs.

A number of epidemiological studies have suggested that periodontal disease is a risk factor for various systemic diseases and conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, NAFLD, and rheumatoid arthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Interestingly, obesity increases the risk of these diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In addition, obesity is also associated with an increased risk of periodontal disease. Therefore, it is possible that periodontal disease and obesity have similar effects on these systemic conditions.</p><p>The common systemic effect of obesity and periodontal disease is considered to be low-grade inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. It is well-known that diet-induced obesity is implicated in systemic low grade inflammation. Nutritional fatty acids activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling in adipocytes and macrophages. In addition, the capacity of fatty acids to induce inflammatory signalling in adipocytes or macrophages is blunted in the absence of TLR4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Furthermore, adipose tissue lipolysis from hypertrophied adipocytes, could serve as a naturally occurring ligand for TLR4 to induce inflammation. It is apparent that gut microbial ecology could be an important factor in the development of obesity by affecting energy homeostasis. For example, Cani <italic>et al</italic>. elegantly demonstrated that the composition of the gut microbiota is influenced by a high-fat diet- and genetically obese ob/ob-induced metabolic endotoxemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Components originating from the gut microbiota, such as lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, flagellin, and bacterial DNA can cause immune system activation and subsequent inflammation.</p><p>Proposed mechanisms for periodontal diseases inducing systemic inflammation have included: (i) the direct effect of infectious agents or their products, and (ii) increased expression of cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules produced in periodontitis lesions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Additional mechanisms may include, (iii) translocation of swallowed <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> from the gut to the circulationg system, and (iv) alteration of gut microbial composition-induced increases in gut epithelial permeability by swallowed <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. The first hypothesis is based on the lesion size of periodontal disease (periodontitis). It is reported that the mean dentogingival epithelial surface area of periodontitis patients where subgingival biofilm is contacting a thinning and/or ulcerated gingival sulcular epithelium is approximately 20&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. This area is considered to act as an entrance of periodontopathic bacteria into the systemic circulation. This mechanism is supported by a number of studies that have demonstrated an association between periodontal disease and endotoxemia. However, periodontal treatment-induced endotoxemia is detectable as early as 5&#x02005;min after instrumentation and disappears at 30&#x02005;min<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In our study, increases in the serum endotoxin level was observed 1&#x02005;hr after a single administration of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and peaked at 3&#x02005;hrs. For the second hypothesis, there is no direct evidence that increased inflammatory markers in periodontitis patients are in fact derived from inflamed periodontal tissues. For the third possibility, although <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> was detected in the jejunal and ileal contents, and colonic contents up to 3&#x02005;hrs and 16&#x02005;hrs after a single administration, respectively, it was not detected in the blood of <italic>P. ginigivalis</italic>-administered mice whereas other bacterial DNA was detected in the blood. Therefore, it is highly likely that detected endotoxins are not derived from <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>.</p><p>Given that recent findings have implicated an altered gut microbiota as a contributor of not only metabolic diseases such as atherosclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, type 2 diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, and NAFLD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> but also immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> that are also associated with periodontitis, it is reasonable to assume that the systemic inflammatory changes seen in <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-administered mice could be attributable to this altered gut microbiota. Furthermore, periodontal diseases themselves could be modulated by alteration of gut microbiota-induced systemic inflammation. In support of this hypothesis, it has been reported that high-fat diet-induced obesity increased alveolar bone resorption, a characteristic feature of periodontitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.</p><p>The swallowed saliva of periodontitis patients is reported to contain up to 10<sup>9</sup>&#x02005;bacteria/ml, in 1.0&#x02013;1.5&#x02005;L/day<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, making a total of greater than 10<sup>12</sup>&#x02005;bacteria/day. Since the bacterial flora of the oral cavity is distinct from that of the gut<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, it is possible that swallowed bacteria could affect the composition of the gut microflora. In fact, it has been reported that oral probiotic intervention alters gut bacterial composition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Thus, it is unlikely that oral bacteria alone could be causative agents of endotoxemia in periodontitis patients.</p><p>In the present study, oral administration of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> induced a change of bacterial composition in the ileal microflora. Although several studies have shown the beneficial effect of Bacteroidetes phylum on the gut<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, we observed an increased proportion of the order Bacteroidales belonging Bacteroidetes phylum, accompanied by insulin resistance and the alteration of gene expression in adipose tissue and liver. The expression of several proinflammatory genes and anti-inflammatory or insulin sensitivity-improving genes were upregulated or downregulated, respectively, in the adipose tissue and the liver of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-administered mice. In addition, expression of <italic>Sirt1</italic> which is reported to induce an increase in glucose uptake and insulin signalling was also downregulated. It has also been reported that SIRT1 expression is inversely related to inflammatory gene expression, particularly TNF-&#x003b1;. These changes in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene expression may contribute to increases in serum glucose levels and in insulin intolerance. Although the effect of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> is not robust, continuous deterioration of glucose metabolism could have significant effect.</p><p>One of the possible reasons for the discrepancy of inflammation-associated change of microbiota between previous studies and our study could be the difference of the site from where the samples were obtained. Previous studies analyzed faecal or caecal samples, whereas we analysed ileal contents. The ileum is considered to be an important organ because chylomicron is formed into small vesicles in the epithelial cells of the ileum, and lipid is mainly absorbed from the ileum. In addition, Peyer's Patches are located in the ileal wall. Therefore, as previously demonstrated with caecal bacterial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, the bacterial composition in the ileum may have significant impact on systemic inflammation. It is also noteworthy that in humans, Bacteroidetes may promote type 2 diabetes through an endotoxin-induced inflammatory response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.</p><p>Henao-Mejia <italic>et al</italic>., demonstrated that a significant expansion of Porphyrmonadaceae was found following HFD or with methionine-choline-deficient diet administration in the faecal microbiota in the inflammasome-deficient setting and was associated with progression of NAFLD and obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. We propose that administered <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> is not directly responsible for the increase of the &#x0201c;family&#x0201d; Porphyromonadaceae in the gut, as we did not detect <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> in the gut by using specific primers. However, bacteria belonging to this &#x0201c;family&#x0201d; of bacteria may play a role in the induction of endotoxemia and subsequent inflammatory responses. Alternatively, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> may suppress inflammasome activation by other bacteria. For example, it has been reported that <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> suppresses inflammasome activity through inhibition of endocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>.</p><p>Another interesting finding from this study was that mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase was downregulated in the ileum of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-administered mice. Kalannen <italic>et al</italic>. previously demonstrated that a defect in intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), was associated with high-fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome, and endogenous and orally supplemented IAP inhibited endotoxin absorption, as well as reversed metabolic syndrome in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Therefore, IAP is considered to play an important role in the suppression of endotoxemia. Although the underlying mechanisms by which oral administration of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and/or alteration of gut microbiota downregulate the mRNA of alkaline phosphatase has not been clarified, downregulation of the <italic>Akp3</italic> gene may be a factor for elevated systemic inflammation. Moreover, gene expression analysis of the small intestine demonstrated downregulated mRNA expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-administered mice. In previous studies on mouse models, the endotoxemia following high-fat diet administration was associated with reduced expression of genes encoding for ZO-1 and occludin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. These results suggest that administered <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> alters the gut microbiota, and alters the gut epithelial cell barrier function, resulting in increased gut permeability. However, the mechanism for how this change in the gut microbiota impairs gut barrier function has not been elucidated. <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> administration-induced alterations of the gut microbiota also induced upregulated mRNA expression of various proinflammatory cytokines. It is not known whether these inflammatory changes of the large intestine affect systemic inflammatory responses.</p><p>In conclusion, in the present study, we demonstrated that oral administration of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> induced alteration of gut microbiota as well as inflammatory changes in various tissues and organs. These changes are considered to be attributable to increases in levels of endotoxin in the blood. However, as with previous observations on the influence of high-fat diet-induced metabolic endotoxemia induced changes of the gut microbiota, it remains to be elucidated whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists between oral administration of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>-induced systemic inflammation and changes in the gut microbiota. Also, further investigations are needed to examine whether other oral bacteria have similar effects on the systemic metabolism. Because the composition of the oral microflora and gut microflora are quite distinct, the considerable flow of large quantities of oral bacteria into gut during the frequent act of swallowing could disturb the balance of the gut microflora. Furthermore, bacterial components responsible for the alteration of gut bacterial composition have also not been elucidated. Therefore, further studies are needed to clarify the exact mechanisms of how <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> induces shifts in the gut microbiota towards the production of metabolic products and shifts in the composition of bacterial species responsible for the induction of metabolic syndrome.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the Regulations and Guidelines on Scientific and Ethical Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Science Council of Japan, enforced on June 1, 2006, and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Niigata University (permit number 39).
