Diapause causes a dramatic reduction in the metabolic rate and drastically extends lifespan. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the metabolic changes involved. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we compared the changes in the metabolite levels in the brain and hemolymph of nondiapause- and diapause-destined cotton bollworm, <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>, during the initiation, maintenance, and termination of pupal diapause. A total of 55 metabolites in the hemolymph and 52 metabolites in the brain were detected. Of these metabolites, 21 and 12 metabolite levels were altered in the diapause pupal hemolymph and brain, respectively. During diapause initiation and maintenance, the number of metabolites with increased levels in the hemolymph of the diapausing pupae is far greater than the number in the nondiapause pupae. These increased metabolites function as an energy source, metabolic intermediates, and cryoprotectants. The number of metabolites with decreased levels in the brain of diapausing pupae is far greater than the number in the nondiapause pupae. Low metabolite levels are likely to directly or indirectly repress the brain metabolic activity. During diapause termination, most of the metabolite levels in the hemolymph of the diapausing pupae rapidly decrease because they function as energy and metabolic sources that promote pupa-adult development. In conclusion, the metabolites with altered levels in the hemolymph and brain serve as energy and metabolic resources and help to maintain a low brain metabolic activity during diapause.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid from the Natural Scientific Foundation of China (31230066) and the National Basic Research Program of China, Ministry of Science and Technology (2012CB114101).

Diapause is typically characterized by reduced metabolic activity and enhanced stress tolerance and is induced by environmental signals (day length, temperature, etc.). The neuroendocrine system translates the physical signals into hormonal factors that induce the individual to enter diapause. For example, in the cotton bollworm, <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> that is an important agricultural noctuid moth in the world, its pupal diapause is induced by incubating larvae under short day-light and low-temperature conditions that down-regulate the expression of neuropeptide prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) in the pupal brain. The low PTTH expression level inhibits the prothoracic glands from synthesizing steroid hormone ecdysteroids (or ecdysone), which are needed to promote continuous development <xref rid="pone.0099948-Denlinger2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. As a result, the pupa enters overwintering diapause. In the laboratory condition, <italic>H. armigera</italic> pupal diapause is initiated by exposing 5th&#x02013;6th instar larvae under short day (10 h light: 14 h dark) and 20 &#x000b0;C conditions, and the lifespan is over three times than in their nondiapause counterparts reared under long day (14 h light: 10 h dark) and 25 &#x000b0;C without diapause.</p><p>The insect gradually reduce its metabolic activity during diapause initiation, and maintain the low metabolic activity during diapause maintenance for overwintering; when the environment is suitable, the insect physiological state will be reached in which direct development may activate <xref rid="pone.0099948-Denlinger2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099948-Kostal1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Until recently, a few metabolite (e.g. glycogen, glycerol, sorbitol, and trehalose) changes that occur in diapause individuals compared with nondiapause individuals have been widely investigated, sorbitol and trehalose have been demonstrated predominant in diapausing pupae for energy resources and cryoprotectants in <italic>H. armigera</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0099948-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In the egg diapause species <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, glycogen is converted to sorbitol and glycerol during diapause <xref rid="pone.0099948-Chino1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099948-Yaginuma1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, and oxygen consumption and sorbitol utilization increase when diapause is terminated <xref rid="pone.0099948-Yaginuma2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, lipid and glycerol levels are higher at the onset of pupal diapause and the glycogen level is lower during diapause in the flesh fly <italic>Sarcophaga crassipalpis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0099948-Hayward1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Similarly, a reduction in glycogen and an increase in glycerol have also been observed in overwintering rice stem borer, <italic>Chilo suppressalis</italic>, larvae <xref rid="pone.0099948-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These metabolites, such as glycerol, sorbitol and trehalose, can act as antifreezes and may increase an insect's survival rate during winter <xref rid="pone.0099948-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099948-Colinet1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Moreover, sorbitol and trehalose not only act as antifreezes but also act as arresters during <italic>B. mori</italic> embryonic diapause <xref rid="pone.0099948-Horie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus, metabolites are involved in many biological processes during insect diapause.</p><p>Previous studies have primarily focused on a few metabolites, and little is known about the other metabolites that are involved in diapause. Metabolomics is an emerging field that it allows a more global picture of metabolic changes underpinning the phenotype of interest in biological systems and offers a broad and bias-free view of the biological processes involved <xref rid="pone.0099948-Hollywood1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Moreover, metabolomics is the downstream result of gene and protein expression and links the genotypes and phenotypes in the organism <xref rid="pone.0099948-Hirai1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Therefore, a metabolomic approach has been used to study insect diapause in <italic>S. crassipalpis</italic>, and many metabolite levels were observed to be altered in the diapause individuals using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) <xref rid="pone.0099948-Michaud1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Insects have an open body cavity, and all of the organs and tissues are submerged in hemolymph, including the brain. Hemolymph transports substrates for development and diapause. Thus, the metabolic activity of the brain (brain activity) depends on the metabolites in the hemolymph. To provide clues about diapause mechanisms why there is low metabolic brain activity in diapausing individuals, we performed a GC-MS analysis to compare the metabolomic changes in the pupal hemolymph and brains of nondiapause and diapause <italic>H. armigera</italic> individuals during the initiation, maintenance, and termination of pupal diapause. A total of 55 metabolites in the hemolymph and 52 metabolites in the brain were detected, and these metabolites play various roles in insect diapause. The accumulation of proline and serine in hemolymph may serve as energy source during diapauses, the phosphoric acid levels affect phosphorylated protein levels in the brain, and a lot of metabolite levels decrease in hemolymph for resuming development during diapause termination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Insect rearing</title><p>
<italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae were kindly provided by Dr. Jian-Ya Su, Nanjing Agricultural University (Nanjing, China). When the larvae were reared on an artificial diet and under long day conditions at 20 &#x000b0;C (L14: D10), all of the pupae developed without entering diapause. When the larvae were reared at 20 &#x000b0;C and under short day conditions (L10: D14), more than 90% of the individuals entered pupal diapause. The pupal samples collected on day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 after pupation represent diapause initiation, and the samples collected on day 21 after pupation represent diapause maintenance. To investigate diapause termination, 1 &#x000b5;g 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) was injected into diapausing pupae (day 21 after pupation), and the samples were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h after injection. Pupal brains were dissected in 0.75% NaCl medium and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. A sample consisted of 30 brains, and 4 replicates of these samples were prepared. The hemolymph (100 &#x000b5;L) was collected from 10 pupae and combined as a single sample, and 4 replicates of these samples were prepared.

Other peaks were identified by matching the mass spectra against the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). RSI value over 700 was considered a good match. The overlapping peaks were deconvoluted using traces for single ions. The individual integrated peak areas were converted to a relative response ratio relative to the internal standard (sucrose) peak area. One-way ANOVA analysis was used to analyze all of the metabolites, and Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to correct the p-value. A p-value&#x0003c;0.05 was considered a significant difference. For the principal component analysis (PCA), the relative response ratios for all of the metabolites were analyzed using MetaGeneAlyse 1.7 (Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, Germany) and separated by their principal components.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>General metabolomic profiles</title><p>A GC-MS analysis was performed to detect metabolites in the brains and hemolymph of <italic>H. armigera</italic> diapause- and nondiapause-destined pupae during diapause initiation, maintenance, and termination.

Polyol and fatty acid metabolism</title><p>An accumulation of cryoprotectants affects the supercooling point and enhances the resistance against low temperatures, which may influence an insect's survival rate.

Furthermore, these cryoprotectants are synthesized during glycolysis, and an accumulation of these cryoprotectants implies that energy metabolism is reduced and affects the brain metabolic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4a4"><title>4.

CoA is a vital metabolic intermediate that plays important roles in glucose metabolism and the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. The level of pantothenic acid is reduced in the diapause-destined pupal brain, which suggests that CoA synthesis is reduced, and a low level of CoA may relate to lower TCA cycle activity and lower metabolic activity.</p><p>In a previous study, we found that the phosphorylated protein level in the brain is reduced during diapause initiation <xref rid="pone.0099948-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

This result is consistent with a previous study <xref rid="pone.0099948-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and suggests that phosphoric acid may be involved in the change in the phosphorylated protein level observed in the brain, which would result in a decrease in enzyme activity and regulate specific signaling pathway.

An increase in metabolites in the hemolymph may serve as a resource for the long diapause phase and for pupal-adult development after diapause termination. The down-regulation of metabolites in the brain may serve to reduce brain activity, as previous studies have shown that there is low brain activity in diapause-destined <italic>H. armigera</italic> individuals <xref rid="pone.0099948-Xu2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099948-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Changes in metabolite levels during diapause maintenance</title><p>Except for sugar and TCA-related metabolites, the levels of six metabolites decreased and the levels of 15 metabolites increased in the hemolymph of diapausing pupae.

Amino acid metabolism</title><p>In the diapausing pupal hemolymph, two amino acid levels (methionine and tyrosine) decreased, and nine amino acid levels (glutamate, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-alanine, proline, serine, threonine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine) increased. As previously mentioned, the reduced levels of methionine and tyrosine in the hemolymph may be used as limiting factors to repress protein synthesis. The increased amino acid levels in the diapause pupal hemolymph may serve as a resource for pupal-adult development after diapause termination.</p><p>In the diapausing pupal brain, five amino acid levels (alanine, leucine, tyrosine, valine, and isoleucine) decreased, and only the aspartate level increased. The five amino acids with reduced levels are closely correlated with pyruvate, CoA, and succinate, which serve as TCA intermediates and suggest that low levels of these amino acids may be the limiting factor that reduces brain activity. Interestingly, a high level of aspartate was detected in the brain. Aspartate is the amino acid most closely associated with carbohydrate metabolism because aspartate can be converted to oxalate, which can be used to synthesize citric acid for the TCA cycle. In addition, other amino acids can be synthesized from aspartate, including four essential amino acids: methionine, threonine, lysine, and isoleucine. Therefore, aspartate can be considered an energy source and an amino acid resource for brain metabolism during a long diapause phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4b3"><title>2. Polyol and fatty acid metabolism</title><p>The cryoprotectant myo-inositol level was higher in the brain during diapause, and as previously mentioned, myo-inositol may protect the brain from harsh environments. Fatty acids are the primary energy source, and we observed reduced levels of two fatty acids, linoleic acid and octadecenoic acid, in the diapause pupal hemolymph. Trehalose is the predominant sugar found in insect blood. The reduced fatty acid levels may be caused by trehalose synthesis, which can be easily used during the diapause phase. However, this method used does not allow detailed analysis of changes in fatty acids composition associated with diapause. Therefore, the function of these fatty acids with altered levels in diapause insects should be investigated in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4b4"><title>3. Other metabolites</title><p>Both the pantothenic acid and phosphoric acid levels increased in the diapausing pupal hemolymph and decreased in the pupal brain. This finding suggests that pantothenic acid and phosphoric acid serve are source function and accumulate in the hemolymph and that the low pantothenic acid and phosphoric acid levels in the brain imply a reduced metabolic activity. It has also been shown that the pantothenic acid level increases in ground squirrel plasma during the hibernating period <xref rid="pone.0099948-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

This result suggests that the energy reserves are heavily used and the brain metabolic activity increases to promote pupal-adult development.</p><p>When 20E was injected into the diapausing pupae to terminate diapause, 14 metabolite levels in the hemolymph were altered. The levels of 13 metabolites (glutamate, leucine, phenylalanine, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-alanine, proline, valine, cholesterol, octadecenoic acid, tyrosine, myo-inositol, pantothenic acid, linoleic acid, and phosphoric acid) were lower at 24 h after injection. Only the butanoic acid level was slightly increased. The glutamate, alanine, and proline levels decreased significantly, and these results suggest that there is an increase in the pyruvate level for TCA cycle activity, which would promote pupal-adult development <xref rid="pone.0099948-Xu2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Threonine and valine can be used to synthesize succinate for the TCA cycle. All of the metabolite levels decreased during diapause termination, except for the butanoic acid level, which suggests that these metabolites may be involved in the metabolic activity of the tissues and organs for resuming development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The GC-MS analyses of diapause <italic>H. armigera</italic> pupal hemolymph and brain successfully identified a cluster of metabolites that are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, as well as polyol and fatty acid metabolism during the initiation, maintenance, and termination of pupal diapause. 1) At diapause initiation, the metabolite levels gradually increase in the pupal hemolymph and serve as a resource for pupa-adult development after diapause termination; the metabolite levels in the brain are reduced and correlated with low metabolic activity in the brain during diapause entry. 2) During diapause maintenance, the number of metabolites with increased levels in the pupal hemolymph is greater than the number of metabolites with decreased levels. These increased metabolites will serve as an energy source and as metabolic intermediates for maintaining the activity of the brain and other organs during a long diapause period and for pupal-adult development after diapause termination. The reduced metabolites in the diapause pupal hemolymph may contribute in the down-regulation of brain activity that helps to maintain the diapause state. In the diapause pupal brain, the number of reduced metabolites is far greater than the number of increased metabolites, which suggests that the low metabolite levels are crucial for low brain activity. 3) During diapause termination, most metabolite levels rapidly decrease in the hemolymph in response to the 20E signal and serve as energy and metabolic sources that promote pupa-adult development.
