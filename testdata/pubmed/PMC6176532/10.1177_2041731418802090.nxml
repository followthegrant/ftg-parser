biomaterials, cells, and biomolecules. The current additive manufacturing
techniques, inkjet-, extrusion-, and laser-based, create hydrogel structures for
cellular encapsulation and support. The requirements for each technique, as well
as the technical challenges of printing living cells, are discussed and
compared. This review encompasses the current research of bioprinting for tissue
engineering and its potential for creating tissue-mimicking structures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Additive manufacturing</kwd><kwd>inkjet</kwd><kwd>extrusion</kwd><kwd>laser-based</kwd><kwd>tissue engineering</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2041731418802090"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue engineering is a subcategory of regenerative medicine aimed at repairing or
replacing damaged and impaired tissues. Conventional methods used for manufacturing
tissue engineered scaffolds lack the ability to produce highly repeatable designs
with precise, well-defined micro- and nanoscale structures.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Three-dimensional (3D) printing (or additive manufacturing (AM)) is capable of
producing scaffolds fabricated to patient-specific requirements. Bioprinting uses AM
techniques to produce 3D structures consisting of living cells, biomaterials, and
active biomolecules. One of the main advantages of bioprinting is the homogeneous
distribution of cells,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> which can otherwise be an issue when seeding cells onto large tissue
scaffolds. First patented attempts of bioprinting started with filling cartridges of
table-top inkjet printers with bioinks, which mainly consisted of cell-laden hydrogels.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Although research using inkjet technology was an early adapter for
bioprinting, many other AM techniques have also been utilized. Currently used
bioprinting techniques are based on inkjet, extrusion, or laser AM technology.</p><p>Each bioprinting technique primarily uses hydrogels as a basis for printing in the
form of a bioink. Hydrogels are materials with 3D molecular networks that have a
high water intake. Their high water content allows for cell entrapment and
encapsulation without inflicting damage to the cells. Therefore, hydrogels are most
commonly used as the base material for bioinks.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The main parameters for developing a bioink are as follows: the choice of
material, its concentration, and chemical properties. The main considerations for
bioinks have been explored in a review by Prendergast et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This review will cover the main concepts behind each bioprinting technique,
as well as current research into the development of bioprinted tissue scaffolds. An
overview of the most significant research comparing different tissues and each
bioprinting technique is shown in <xref rid="table1-2041731418802090" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="table1-2041731418802090" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Overview of the most significant research comparing different tissues and

dilute solutions are dispensed, driven by thermal, piezoelectric, or microvalve
processes. Inkjet bioprinting technology is based on the conventional inkjet
process used by desktop inkjet printers, whereby individual droplets are used to
pattern a substrate. The concept of inkjet printing was first developed in the
early 1950s by Epson, Hewlett-Packard (HP), and Canon; however, it was not until
2003 before the first patent for a modified inkjet printer for bioprinting of
viable cells was awarded.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr45-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="bibr46-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> A structure is formed by continuously depositing droplets

applications, Xu et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> inkjet-printed rabbit articular chondrocytes suspended in a
fibrin&#x02013;collagen hydrogel onto an electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) matrix.
The scaffolds were fabricated by alternatively printing a layer of
electrospun PCL fibers followed by a layer of
chondrocytes/fibrinogen/collagen suspension. The inclusion of the PCL
(M<sub>n</sub> ~42,500, 10% wt/vol.) fibers within the natural polymer
gel improved the mechanical properties. The PCL composite scaffold had a
Young&#x02019;s modulus of 1.76&#x02009;MPa and an ultimate tensile strength of 1.11&#x02009;MPa
compared to the natural polymer gel alone, which had a Young&#x02019;s modulus of
0.41&#x02009;MPa and an ultimate tensile strength of 0.26&#x02009;MPa. Cell viability of the
printed cells, calculated by a comparison of living cells to total number of
cells, was 81.58%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.46% 1 week after printing. Scaffolds implanted
subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice over an 8-week period developed a
dense, well-organized collagen, not present in the control group (unseeded
scaffolds). The cartilage tissue formation within the bioprinted scaffolds
appeared histologically similar to normal elastic cartilage.</p><p>Scaffolds were fabricated by Cui et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> using human chondrocytes suspended in a poly(ethylene glycol)
dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) solution. The PEGDMA solution was polymerized using
ultraviolet (UV) light during the printing process. Viability of the human
chondrocytes after printing was 84.9%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.2%. Scaffolds were cultured in
cell culture medium, supplemented with either fibroblast growth factor-2
(FGF-2) or transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1). TGF-&#x003b2;1 is used to
maintain chondrocyte phenotype, while FGF-2 is used for chondrocyte
monolayer expansion. The compressive moduli of the hydrogels reduced with
the inclusion of cells and were dependent on cell density; however,
compressive moduli increased with time spent in cell culture. Culturing with
FGF-2/TGF-&#x003b2;1 supplemented medium was shown to be the most beneficial for
cartilage development.</p><p>Cui et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> also investigated the possibility for printing in situ. Using the
same printing method as before, scaffolds were printed either separately or
directly into osteochondral plugs that had been harvested from bovine
femoral condyles. The printed scaffolds had a compressive modulus of
395.73&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;80.40&#x02009;kPa, similar to natural human collagen. By polymerizing the
scaffold as each layer was printed, cellular exposure to UV radiation was
reduced by more than 80% compared to manual hydrogel scaffold polymerization
that normally requires&#x02009;&#x0003e;10&#x02009;min UV exposure. Compared to the control of a
cast scaffold, cell viability of the printed cells was 26% higher. The
inclusion of cells into the polymer matrix made the scaffolds ~20% more
flexible, possibly due to the cells absorbing some of the compressive
forces. Scaffolds that were printed directly into the bovine femoral
condyles defects had enhanced tissue integration compared to non-printed
cell-laden hydrogels. The improved tissue integration for scaffolds printed
directly into the defect, along with a fabrication timing of 108&#x02009;s, makes
the bioprinting process a viable option for in-situ applications; however,
the achieved compressive modulus of the scaffolds is significantly lower
than that of human articular cartilage of the lower limbs, which range
between 4.5 and 11.8&#x02009;MPa.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Therefore, further structural development of the scaffold would need
to be considered before human implantation.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2041731418802090"><title>Neural tissue</title><p>To establish the ability of thermal inkjet printing for depositing mammalian
cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and rat embryonic motoneuron cells were
printed, suspended in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> After printing, the cells maintained a healthy morphology. The CHO
cells proliferated into a confluent layer, while the rat embryonic
motoneuron cells proliferated and exhibited a polarized morphology. CHO cell
lysis was evaluated immediately after printing and indicated that ~8% of the
cells were damaged due to the printing process. Overall, the study
demonstrated the potential for inkjet printing to deposit cells into tissue
scaffolds.</p><p>Further experiments were conducted with rat primary embryonic hippocampal and
cortical neurons.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Viability of the cells was 74.2%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.3%, which maintained their basic
function, phenotype, and electrophysiological properties. The printed
cortical cells developed into mature neurons, while both types of cells
could produce action potentials.</p><p>Lorber et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> were the first group to print cells from the mature adult nervous
system. Printing with adult cells is more challenging, as adult neural cells
are more prone to damage and are less able to regenerate. Using a
high-speed, image-capture setup, it was observed that during droplet
ejection, the cells did not undergo major distortion and hence destruction
caused by shear forces. There was no difference in cell survival rate and
neurite growth between printed and non-printed cells. The glia cells
retained their ability to support the growth of the retinal ganglion
cells.</p><p>Tse et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr50-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> were the first to print a combination of both neuronal and supportive
glial cells. Not only did the printed cells maintain high
viabilities,&#x02009;&#x0003e;86% for neuronal cells and&#x02009;&#x0003e;89% for Schwann cells, but
more importantly, the printed neuronal cells exhibited earlier and longer
neurite growth in comparison with the non-printed cells. By demonstrating
the successful printing of both the neuronal and glial cells, the potential
for producing a large tissue scaffold with a complete neural network becomes
a greater possibility and could have massive potential for the repair of
large-area, full-thickness skin burns.</p></sec><sec id="section6-2041731418802090"><title>Cardiac and vascular tissue</title><p>Initial work into printing cardiac tissue was performed using alginate
hydrogel and primary feline adult and human H1 cardiomyocytes.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Xu et al. printed a half heart shape that had a 1-cm inner diameter
and two connected ventricles. In cell culture, the cells remained viable in
the large structure due to printed porosities of the scaffold. Using
electrical stimulation, the cardiac cells were observed to contract
rhythmically which in turn caused the whole structure to beat periodically.
Further development of the model should consider structural integrity of the
scaffold to prevent the seepage of fluid from within the structure, as well
as the capability to withstand physiological fluid pressures.</p><p>Endothelial cells have also been successfully printed with a high degree of
accuracy and a precise number of cells per drop.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Different methods have been explored for the bioprinting of a 3D
vascular network. One method is to print a crosslinking agent (calcium
chloride) into an alginate/gelatin solution. The calcium chloride crosslinks
the alginate/gelatin solution to form a gelled structure. Boland et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> used this method to produce different structures such as tubes,
branched tubes, hollow cones, and capillaries. Using a scanning electron
microscope (SEM), the internal structure of the scaffolds was evaluated. It
was shown that the calcium chloride crosslinked the alginate/gelatin gel on
the surface of the droplet to produce hollow shells. This provided a
scaffold with a microscopic porosity. Mouse endothelial cells attached to
the surface inside the shells, with filopodia leading into the shells and
lamellipodia trailing out, suggesting cell migration into pores.</p><p>Another method used for inkjet bioprinting vasculature depended on the
reaction between thrombin and fibrinogen to form fibrin. This reaction was
used by Cui et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> to encapsulate human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) in a
fibrin hydrogel. HMVECs were suspended in a thrombin calcium chloride
solution and printed onto a fibrinogen substrate that reacted to fibrin,
thus encapsulating the cells. Using this method, scaffolds were fabricated
with micron-sized fibrin channels. The printed hollow fibroin channels were
well aligned and had a straight microstructure. The average fiber diameter
was 93 &#x000b5;m, had an elastic modulus of 2.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.8&#x02009;MPa, an ultimate tensile
strength of 1.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5&#x02009;MPa, and a burst pressure estimated to be 2955&#x02009;mm Hg;
all properties were comparable to that of extruded tissue-engineered blood
vessels. After 21&#x02009;days in cell culture, the cells had aligned along the
printed structures to form confluent linings. A ring-shaped microvasculature
had formed that had sealed the fibroin channel with a high level of
integrity.</p><p>One of the issues associated with inkjet printing is the fabrication of
overhanging structures. The printing of overhanging structures is
challenging as each layer of printed droplets is supported by either the
substrate or previously printed layers. To overcome this issue, Christensen
et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> used calcium chloride solution for both crosslinking and as liquid
support material. Sodium alginate ink, with and without the inclusion of
NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts, was printed into a calcium chloride solution,
which gelled almost instantaneously upon impact. The calcium chloride
solution provided buoyancy to the overhanging structures and was easily
removed after fabrication, unlike solid support structures that can be
difficult to remove post fabrication. The print quality of the rounded
overhangs was negatively affected by gravitational forces and droplet impact
during printing. The low mechanical integrity of the alginate gel also meant
that the designed structure did not maintain its 3D shape during printing.
Although the positioning of the walls moved, printing could be compensated
to ensure that the structure was completed and the scaffolds exhibited a 90%
cell viability after 24 h. The current model would be insufficient for
implantation due to the potential for turbulent and vortex blood flows to
occur due to poor uniformity of the printed shape. This could induce the
development of a thrombosis and eventually block fluid flow.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Therefore, due to the poor structural integrity encountered during
fabrication related to the use of a liquid support structure, it is
suggested that a solid support structure may be preferable when printing a
tubular hydrogel scaffold.</p></sec><sec id="section7-2041731418802090"><title>Skin tissue</title><p>To produce a skin graft, Lee et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> printed a layered
structure with multiple cell types. Primary adult human dermal fibroblasts
(hFB) and primary adult human epidermal keratinocytes (hKC) were suspended
in cell media and printed in-between layers of a printed collagen (type I

for hFB. The inner layers of the scaffold were composed of fibroblasts and
the outer layers composed of keratinocytes. There were no morphological
differences between the bioprinted cells and manually seeded cells, and no
significant difference in cell viabilities. To demonstrate wound-specific
scaffold manufacture, scaffolds were printed into polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) molds with non-planar 3D surface contours. Scaffolds fabricated in
the non-planar molds suffered from an inhomogeneous printed layer depth;
however, this had no negative influence on the proliferation of the
cells.</p><p>Scaffolds fabricated in the same way but on a planar surface (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2041731418802090">Figure 1</xref>) were

maintained their shape and dimensions, as well as produced three densely
packed cell layers of hKCs on the surface of the scaffold. In contrast, the
conventionally produced skin scaffold continually shrunk and had lost shape
after 7&#x02009;days in culture. When exposed to an air&#x02013;liquid interface, the
printed scaffolds developed a dense epidermal layer, with the number of
epidermal layers increasing from 3 to 7 after 14&#x02009;days of cell culture. The
epidermal layers formed tight junctions between neighboring cells, an
important feature of the epidermis for providing an effective barrier.</p><fig id="fig1-2041731418802090" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of multilayered skin tissue with two layers of

bioink and primary human dermal fibroblasts were deposited to produce a
scaffold. Each layer of the PEG-based bioink was immediately polymerized
using UV light. The top layers of cells were encased within an additional
seven layers of the bioink. DNA damage was measured by the formation of
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), a product of UV damage to DNA. UV
exposure during printing was shown not to damage cell DNA when compared to
unprinted cells. Cell viability, proliferation, and morphology of the
printed cells were similar to that of the unprinted cells. After 2&#x02009;days in
cell culture, the fibroblasts were shown to adhere to the printed structure
with a typical morphology and spread within the printed matrix. Over a
3-week period, cells continued to proliferate and produce their own extra
cellular matrix. Primary human dermal keratinocytes seeded on top of the
printed scaffolds did not achieve a fully stratified epidermis when exposed
to the air&#x02013;liquid interface for 14&#x02009;days. By not printing the keratinocytes
onto the scaffold, cell distribution and positioning were affected.
Achieving a more uniform layer of keratinocytes during the seeding process
could have helped to achieve a stratified epidermis, as demonstrated by Lee

treating full-thickness skin wounds in mice. Human dermal microvascular
endothelial cells (HMVECs) were suspended in a PBS containing thrombin and
calcium chloride. The HMVECs were printed onto a gel consisting of neonatal
human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells and collagen. After printing and a
brief period of incubation, neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK)
mixed in collagen were applied to the top of the scaffold. Full-thickness
wounds were created on the backs of mice, which were then treated with the
bioprinted scaffolds, Apligraf&#x000ae;, or treated without a graft. After 14&#x02009;days,
the bioprinted scaffolds had adhered to the wound while the Apligraf had
dried out and detached from the implant site, although no infections were
recorded for any of the test groups. By Day 21, complete closure of the
wound had occurred for the bioprinted scaffold, followed by the
Apligraf-treated wounds after 28&#x02009;days. Wound contraction at all time points
was improved in the bioprinted group. By Week 6, the bioprinted group had a
wound contraction of 62.5%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9% compared to the Apligraf with 74%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5%, and
the negative control with 79%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2%. All groups developed epidermal and
dermal layers; however, the printed skin graft was shown to have the most
histologically similar appearance to native skin. The printed scaffold also
showed evidence of vascularization, as the printed cells had integrated with
the native tissue and helped to develop a microvessel network.</p><p>An in-situ printing method has been tested by Skardal et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Amniotic fluid&#x02013;derived stem (AFS) cells and bone marrow&#x02013;derived
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were separately suspended in
fibrinogen&#x02013;collagen solutions. The cell suspensions were printed onto
full-thickness skin wounds on the backs of mice and crosslinked by printing
a separate thrombin solution between layers of the cell suspensions. Only
one cell type was used for the treatment of each wound and was compared to
scaffolds produced in the same way without the inclusion of printed cells.
Printing produced a 100% coverage of the wound with a tight seal between the
skin and graft. Wound contraction and re-epithelialization were at all time
points significantly higher in the groups with printed cells. After 1&#x02009;week,
wound contraction was 83% for scaffolds with printed cells, compared to 73%
for the gel alone. Printed scaffolds exhibited re-epithelialization of up to
89% which had organized, well-defined layers, while the control only
exhibited a 51% re-epithelialization with a poor structural quality. Unlike
the study of Yanez et al., the printed cells did not integrate with the
tissue and had almost disappeared after 7&#x02009;days. Therefore, in the study
conducted by Skardal et al., the benefit of using printed cells was the
secretion of trophic factors. The concentration of secreted factors was
highest for the AFS cells, which coincided with better regeneration results.
Overall, it was determined that AFS cells bioprinted onto a wound site could
be beneficial for burn treatments. This study demonstrates an immediate and
practical application of bioprinting. Not only can the graft be printed in
situ, the AFS cells could come from a cell bank, enabling the possibility of
&#x0201c;off-the-shelf&#x0201d; treatments.</p></sec><sec id="section8-2041731418802090"><title>Stem cells</title><p>Printing of stem cells presents the potential issue of changing their

printing at high shear rates. However, after 7&#x02009;days in cell culture, no
significant difference between cells printed at low and high shear rates was
observed. Cell proliferation rate was stimulated by a moderate level of
shear stress, yet, above a certain threshold, there was an observed negative
effect. Cell phenotype was unaffected by shear forces during printing. The
study demonstrated that below a certain shear stress, hMSCs can be printed
without side effects.</p><p>The effect of printing on other stem cells has also been investigated.
Faulkner-Jones et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr56-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> investigated the influence of printing on human embryonic stem cells
(hESCs) and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The use of hiPSCs
for tissue engineering applications could be more beneficial than using
hESCs, as the hiPSCs could be harvested from the patient and therefore
immunosuppressive drugs would not be required for their implantation. The
printing process did not change the differentiation of the cells nor change
their lineage when compared to unprinted cells. The expression of
pluripotency markers was slightly lower than the non-printed cells, however
still within an acceptable range. When printing large circular structures,
cell viability dropped to 55.5% 1&#x02009;h after printing; however, the size of the
scaffold did not influence the differentiation and maturation process of the
cells. A low cell viability of the large scaffolds could be linked to a
structural design restricting the availability of nutrients. Another
possibility could be extended fabrication time, during which the cells are
subjected to non-physiological conditions.</p><p>By printing stem cells into a scaffold, it is possible to develop a complex
tissue. Gurkan et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr57-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> printed MSCs for the development of a multiphase tissue scaffold.
Multiphase tissue scaffolds could be useful for repairing soft&#x02013;hard tissue
interfaces such as between tendon and bone. Scaffolds were produced by
printing inks composed of methacrylated gelatin (Me-Gel) and hMSC cells,
supplemented with bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2), TGF-&#x003b2;1, or a
combination of both. Scaffolds were printed with one side containing only
BMP-2 and the other only TGF-&#x003b2;1, with a multiphase section in the middle. A
smooth transition was produced between each phase. Osteogenesis- and
chondrogenesis-related genes were upregulated within the respective BMP-2
and TGF-&#x003b2;1 regions, as well as in the multiphase section after 36&#x02009;days in
culture. Due to the complexity of tissue junctions and the difficulty of
producing the intricate organizational structure, there are yet to be any
translational studies to test current tissue-engineered scaffolds in a
clinical setting.<sup><xref rid="bibr58-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> Therefore, the success of bioprinting to differentiate stem cells

donor-slide, to support and propel the printing material; and (3) a
receiver-slide, to collect and support the printed material. The technique
depends on a laser-induced vaporization effect of a thin layer of gold/titanium
that coats the donor-slide. During vaporization, a bubble is created that
propels precursor material onto the receiver-slide. When applied to bioprinting,
this technique is able to achieve prints with excellent resolution (&#x0003e;20

NIH-3T3 cells was deposited onto receiving substrates, consisting of either
CaCl<sub>2</sub> (gelation) or Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM; no
gelation). The droplets of NIH-3T3-laden alginate interact with the calcium
chloride creating a gelation effect. It was observed that the increase in
gelation time and laser fluence resulted in decreased cell viability after 24 h.
A gelation time of 2 min created a cushioning effect on the cells, maintaining a
better cell viability in comparison with 10 min and no gelation on DMEM, where
the cells suffered from irreversible damage. Increased gelation time increased
the stiffness of the substrate, hindering nutrient and oxygen diffusion.

improved tissue engineering scaffolds and ultimately to replace the current gold
standard, autografts. Accurate cell placement has been demonstrated with inkjet
printing, as this technique has the capability of printing a singular cell per
droplet. Although cell viability is a concern due to the shear stress induced during
printing, in practice, it has not been an issue. Inkjet printing has shown great
potential for producing skin models that have even been fabricated in situ.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Inkjet-fabricated skin grafts have also outperformed a commercial graft
Apligraf&#x000ae; in vivo.<sup><xref rid="bibr52-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> The flexibility of inkjet printing to print multiple bioinks has been
demonstrated by successfully producing complex multiphase tissues.<sup><xref rid="bibr57-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> However, this technique is limited in the production of large-scale 3D
structures as well as in the printing of over-hanging structures. The problem with
printing overhanging structures was encountered when printing a vascular network
causing a distortion to the scaffold.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Extrusion-based bioprinting can produce large structures in both horizontal and
vertical orientations. It has the capability of printing highly viscous bioinks that
contain high cell densities. Extrusion-based techniques vary and have yielded in
different cell viabilities; pneumatic-based extrusion has shown to yield higher cell
viabilities than mechanical-based. This category of fabrication has shown great
potential for chondoral and osteochondoral in-situ applications. The development of
a biopen extruder enabled the reconstruction of osteochondral defects with 97% cell viability,<sup><xref rid="bibr43-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> demonstrating the great potential for bioprinting to be used directly in a
clinical setting.</p><p>Stereolithographic bioprinting fabricates scaffolds in a vat of bioink, rather than
dispensing the bioink through a nozzle. This exposes the cells to fewer external
stresses such as shear forces. Prints have high resolution and generally a smooth
surface, however problems can occur with non-polymerized precursor hydrogel becoming
trapped within printed 3D porous networks.<sup><xref rid="bibr97-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">97</xref></sup> The main concerns with SLA are the cytotoxicity of the photoinitiators used
and UV-induced DNA damaged. To address these issues, visible light-based SLA has
been developed and applied in the fabrication of scaffolds.<sup><xref rid="bibr76-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup> Many investigators have utilized this fabrication technique to obtain a 3D
structure that has a homogeneous distribution of one or more cell types. Oxygen
inhibition on the photocuring process, hence print fidelity, has not yet been
solved, however current solutions include increasing non-toxic photoinitiator
concentrations to improve the crosslinking process.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Although LAB systems are very expensive, they offer cell-size resolutios. The
effect of laser energy inflicted upon cells during printing remains a concern;
however, studies have shown that both stromal and stem cells remained viable
immediately after printing<sup><xref rid="bibr88-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="bibr96-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">96</xref></sup> and do not induce any differentiative effect. LAB bioprinting
techniques are limited by the scale of tissue scaffolds it can produce due to it
being a scaffold-free technique that propels the bioink onto a receiver-slide,
usually consisting of a biopaper. These can be natural, synthetic, or even
monolayers of self-assembled cells.</p><p>Overall, future development of bioprinted tissue scaffolds may require the
combination of different printing techniques. Inkjet printing and LAB can provide
the most accuracte cell placement, which could be crucuial for the production of
complex tissues with multiple cell types. Using inkjet printing, neuronal and glial
cells have produced preferential results to seeded cells,<sup><xref rid="bibr50-2041731418802090" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> indicating the great potential of incorporating a neural network inside a
bioprinted tissue scaffold. However, both inkjet printing and LAB are limited by the
volume of material that they can dispense and the final mechanical integrity of the
printed scaffolds. Therefore, these techniques are required to be combined with
other printing techniques to provide a structure with a greater mechanical
integrity, such as those produced via extrusion printing. Extrusion bioprinting is a
fast method for the production of scaffolds, however there are no guarantees as to
cell positioning and distribution within the printed scaffold.</p><p>There have been several demonstrations of in-situ application using inkjet and
extrusion printing. These have shown an ease of application and fast fabrication
times, ideal for translation into a clinical setting. However, some of the current
research has encountered problems with producing large, printed structures and the
survivability of the cells. This could be related to scaffold design, the extended
printing time causing longer exposure of the cells to non-pysiological conditions,
or the cell culture method, whereby the use of bioreactors may be necessary. These
are all important aspects that need to be explored before bioprinitng can be
developed for transferal to clinical applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section27-2041731418802090"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This review has focused on the developmental approaches of bioprinting techniques for
the fabrication of different tissues and organs. Bioprinting techniques are gaining
substantial interest in the field of tissue engineering due to their ability to
create complex structures. Bioprinting enables the production of scaffolds with the
precise placement of cells, biomaterials, and biomolecules into spatially predefined
locations. Various techniques have been utilized to develop tissues and organs for
implantation including blood vessels, cardiac tissues, cornea, and skin. Scaffold
vascularization is important for the survival of the implant in situ and has shown
great potential for all bioprinting techniques. However, fabricating complex
structures with multiple cell types remains a challenge.</p><p>Research investigating in situ printing into defect sites has shown promising
results, yet, this area of research is still in its infancy. Printing in situ will
eliminate any risks of contamination during post fabrication, as well as avoid
adverse effects induced by sterilization post fabrication, such as changes to
morphology and mechanical integrity of the scaffolds. Organ-on-a-chip is another
promising development of bioprinting. It provides the ability for testing multiple
cell types without requiring complex models or living systems.</p><p>Overall, the choice of fabrication technique depends on the application, type of
tissue, and the desired geometry of the print. However, all of the reported
techniques hold a great potential to generate fully functional organs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the
