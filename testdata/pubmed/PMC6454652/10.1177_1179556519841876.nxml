but disastrous complication, affecting significantly the function of the upper
extremity. The management of these injuries is still controversial in the
literature. This is a review of small case series and case reports, in which an
algorithm of treatment is proposed. A brief description of a relative case,
which was treated successfully in our department, is presented as well. This

Concurrent ulnar nerve
injury, however, is a rare complication. A small number of cases has been described
and published in the literature. There is not yet a clear consensus regarding the
correct timing of surgical exploration.</p><p>According to Chung and Spilson<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> in 1998, hand/forearm fractures accounted for 1.5% of all emergency
department cases. The largest proportion of the fractures consisted of radius and/or
ulna fractures (44%). The majority of the fractures (26%) occurred in the 5 to 14
age group and were caused mostly (47%) by accidental falls. Rasuli&#x00107; et al<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> reported that 15.38% of the patients with ulnar nerve injury in this series
had also suffered a forearm fracture.</p><p>Ulnar nerve injuries may be rare, but they can be quite severe. As hand plays a very
important role in everyday life, loss of its function is psychologically detrimental
for the patients, especially for the paediatric population. This review tends to
propose a guide of managing these injuries. A brief description of a relative case,
which was treated successfully in our department, is presented as well.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1179556519841876"><title>Mechanism of Injury</title><p>According to the literature, the following mechanisms of ulnar nerve injury post
forearm fractures are described: (1) nerve contusion, (2) nerve laceration, (3)
nerve entrapment between the edges of the fracture, and (4) nerve irritation by scar
tissue or callus.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Most common cause of injury is contusion and the nerve&#x02019;s function resolves

concerning the management of ulnar nerve injuries post forearm fractures. There is
significant controversy so far regarding the correct timing of exploration, as well
as whether a surgical intervention is needed.</p><p>Prosser and Hooper<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> reported a case of ulnar nerve entrapment after a forearm fracture. The
patient was a 13-year-old schoolboy, who suffered a fracture of the distal radius
and ulna. Neurological examination initially was normal. The patient underwent open
reduction and internal fixation of the radial fracture. The fracture of the ulna was
in an acceptable position and a plaster was applied. Exploration of the ulnar nerve
was not performed. Three days post operation, complete ulnar nerve palsy was
noticed. After 10 weeks of no recovery, the ulnar nerve was explored, and it was
found entrapped at the site of the fracture. The nerve was released and 3&#x02009;weeks
later, there was evidence of ulnar nerve recovery. Six months later, slight weakness
of the first dorsal interosseous muscle was the only clinical finding of
deficit.</p><p>Stahl et al<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> reported 3 cases of forearm fractures with a concomitant ulnar nerve injury.
In the first case, a 10-year-old boy sustained a closed forearm fracture and on
examination ulnar nerve palsy was detected, which was considered to be a
neuropraxia. X-ray revealed a midshaft fracture of the radius and ulna with anterior
displacement and angulation. The fracture was reduced under general anaesthesia, and
a cast was applied. After 10&#x02009;weeks, no nerve recovery had occurred. Examination
revealed motor and sensory deficits and Tinel sign was positive at the level of the
fracture. The patient underwent surgery, where the ulnar nerve was explored and
found to be trapped in a hypertrophic scar. Neurolysis was performed under the
microscope. Four weeks after surgery, signs of ulnar nerve function improvement
appeared. One year later, there was full recovery of the nerve, apart from a slight
weakness of the ulnar innervated intrinsic muscles.</p><p>In the second case, a 15-year-old boy sustained a closed midshaft fracture of the
right ulna and radius, with significant angulation and slight displacement of the
radius and ulna. Closed reduction was performed and a cast was applied. Twenty-four
hours later, a diagnosis of ulnar nerve palsy was made, which did not improve in the
next 4&#x02009;months. The patient complained of numbness and weakness, which had been
present since the accident. There was loss of function of the ulnar intrinsic
muscles and also complete absence of sensation in the ulnar nerve sensory area.
Surgery was performed, and the nerve was found to be trapped in scar tissue at the
healed fracture site. It was released and minimal internal neurolysis was performed
under the microscope. Improvement was noted 2&#x02009;weeks later with significant
improvement of the sensory loss. A month after surgery, full nerve function was
recovered.</p><p>In the third case, a 9-year-old boy suffered a fracture of the left radius and ulna.
X-ray showed midshaft anterior displacement and angulation of the ulna along with a
distal ulnar spike. The patient complained of numbness of the ulnar digits with
muscle weakness. After the failure of achieving anatomical alignment with closed
reduction, open reduction was performed. During the operation, the ulnar nerve was
found to be entrapped in the spike and partially lacerated. It was released, and the
fractures were reduced and fixed by intramedullary nails. The nerve was repaired.
Six months later, full clinical return of ulnar nerve function had occurred.</p><p>Hirasawa et al<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> in 2004 reported a case of ulnar nerve entrapment. The patient was a
13-year-old girl with numbness in the ring and little fingers, and limitation in
forearm rotation, 2&#x02009;months after a displaced diaphyseal fracture of the left radius
and ulna. Hypoesthesia was noticed in the little finger and the ulnar half of the
ring finger, and Tinel sign was positive at the ulnar fracture site. Three months
after the fracture, atrophy of the interosseous muscles and claw hand deformity of
the ring and little fingers developed. Neurolysis of the ulnar nerve was performed.
The nerve was found to be trapped between the fragments of the ulna. Corrective
osteotomy of the radius was also performed. Sensation and motor function recovered
4&#x02009;months later.</p><p>Suganuma et al<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> published a case in 2013 where a 12-year-old girl underwent a second
operation 9&#x02009;weeks after the initial one, because of gradually worsening ulnar nerve
palsy. She sustained a midshaft forearm fracture, which was reduced and fixed with
Kirschner wires as a primary operation. Nine weeks later, she underwent a second
operation because of ulnar nerve palsy. The nerve was released, as it was adhered to
the surrounding scar tissue. Six months later, she had no motor dysfunction.</p><p>Amit et al<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> in 2013 reported a case of a missed ulnar nerve injury from a closed forearm
fracture in a child. The patient presented with a history of a fall on the floor
while playing. There was swelling in distal forearm and inability to move the left
hand. There were some abrasions on left hand and forearm. The radiographs revealed
fractures of both bones of left forearm with significant displacement of distal
fragments dorsally. The fracture was reduced under general anaesthesia. After
3&#x02009;weeks, there were complaints of numbness in little and ring fingers of the child.
Ulnar clawing was clearly evident. The rest of neurological examination was normal.
Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) examination revealed ulnar nerve injury at the site
of fracture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan ruled out entrapment or
laceration of the ulnar nerve and delineated the normal course of the nerve. At
3-month follow-up, the numbness of the fingers was long gone, as well as marked
subsidence of the clawing was noticed. The limb was nearly fully functional with
fracture union of both bones.</p><p>Schwartsmann et al<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> reported a case of a 17-year-old male who suffered a forearm fracture after a
skateboard fall. The patient complained of &#x02018;tingling&#x02019; of the fifth finger. After a
satisfactory closed reduction, the &#x02018;tingling&#x02019; worsened. Exploration of the ulnar
nerve was performed, and it was trapped at the fracture site. The nerve was released
and the laceration was sutured.</p><p>In most cases, the ulnar nerve palsy required operation so that satisfactory recovery
could be achieved. However, Neiman et al<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> reported 2 cases where the ulnar nerve palsy was resolved without operation
after 20&#x02009;weeks. The nerve injury was identified at the time of fracture by
neurological examination. Thus, the possibility of a post reduction nerve injury was
eliminated. Neiman suggested that the ulnar nerve palsy is probably a result of
nerve contusion and it should resolve without operation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section5-1179556519841876"><title>Discussion</title><p>Forearm fractures are common in paediatric population. Concomitant nerve injuries,
however, are rare, but they are detrimental to the functional outcome of those fractures.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Ulnar nerve function particularly can be affected by forearm fractures,
especially if they are located in the middle and distal third of the diaphysis,
probably due to the close proximity between the nerve and the ulna.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Ulnar nerve injuries are frequently missed because most of the times, it is
difficult to evaluate the neurological status of the upper limb due to severe pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> It is crucial, however, to determine that before any reduction manoeuvre is
attempted, because any manipulation of the fracture can potentially harm the ulnar
nerve.</p><p>There are a few questions which need to be answered regarding ulnar nerve injuries
post forearm fractures, such as: what kind of nerve injury is it in each case? Is it
neurapraxia, neurotmesis, or axonotmesis? Is there any role of further imaging such
as MRI scan? Should the Orthopaedic Surgeon explore the nerve and if this is the
case, what is the correct timing to proceed? According to our knowledge, there is no
review in the literature regarding those injuries. We gathered the most important
relative articles published so far, and this is an effort to answer the previous
questions and recommend a way to manage these injuries properly. All the collected
data are from small case series of patients and case reports.</p><p>We were motivated by a case, which we managed, of a 13-year-old patient, who
sustained a left distal shaft forearm closed fracture, severely displaced, after a
fall from a small height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1179556519841876">Figure
1</xref>). The neurovascular status of the upper limb was thoroughly examined,
prior to any manipulation and an ulnar nerve injury was detected, as there was ring
and small finger clawing plus pins and needles around the same area. As the fracture
was severely displaced, a gentle closed manipulation was performed, without any
worsening of the neurological signs and the upper extremity was splinted. The
patient was operated the next day with open reduction and internal fixation of
radial and ulnar fractures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1179556519841876">Figure
2</xref>). No attempt of exploring the ulnar nerve was performed. Ulnar nerve
palsy persisted after operation, and 4&#x02009;weeks later, hypothenar atrophy as well as
ring and small finger numbness and clawing was noticed. Six weeks post operation,
the fracture was healed and signs of ulnar nerve recovery were detected, as Tinel
sign was positive plus some intrinsic muscles&#x02019; function was identified. Full ulnar
nerve recovery was noticed 17&#x02009;weeks post operation. This case is an example of full
ulnar nerve recovery, despite initial worsening during the first 4&#x02009;weeks. Surgeon&#x02019;s
decision was to wait and see, as the fracture was anatomically reduced, the nerve
palsy was also detected before any reduction manoeuvre, and some nerve function
improvement was evident 6&#x02009;weeks post operation.</p><fig id="fig1-1179556519841876" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Pre-operation left forearm fracture.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1179556519841876-fig1"/></fig><fig id="fig2-1179556519841876" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Post-operation image.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1179556519841876-fig2"/></fig><p>Peripheral nerve injuries are classified based on Seddon classification as
neurapraxia, axonotmesis, and neurotmesis, with the last type being the worse in
terms of prognosis. Sunderland added 3 more subtypes in the axonotmesis category:
type I, axonotmesis with intact connective tissue; type II, axonotmesis with damage
to the endoneurium; and type III, axonotmesis which includes damage to the
endoneurium and perineurium. The muscle, which is the target organ of the
reinnervation, should maintain its ability to accept neurological stimulation, in
order for the nerve recovery to achieve a good functional outcome. It is well known
that the structural architecture of the muscle and the end-plate integrity can be
maintained for up to 1&#x02009;year post denervation. After 2&#x02009;years, irreversible muscle
fibrosis has occurred along with muscle degeneration, leading to a permanent loss of
functional muscle tissue.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Thus, we question the suggestion of some authors to explore the nerve at most
10&#x02009;weeks post injury, supporting that after that time, recovery is unlikely to occur.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Ulnar nerve injuries usually concern the midshaft or the distal shaft of the
forearm. Considering the fact that reinnervation mechanism proceeds with a velocity
of 1 to 2&#x02009;mm/d and the end plate remains intact until at least 1&#x02009;year post injury,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> it is reasonable that the physician could wait for up to 20&#x02009;weeks post injury
for the nerve to recover spontaneously, provided that there is no progressive
worsening. In addition, there are cases published in the literature, which describe
spontaneous recovery of the ulnar nerve, even 20&#x02009;weeks post fracture.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Based on the few cases published in the literature and the pathophysiology of the
nerve injury, current authors propose an algorithm of management (<xref rid="table2-1179556519841876" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). First of all, it
is crucial to determine the neurovascular status of the limb before any attempt for
reduction, although it is difficult to evaluate that, due to severe pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> A peripheral nerve should be

bayonet apposition if older than 10&#x02009;years old, are indications for surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Current authors suggest that, if ulnar or other peripheral nerve injury
occurs as a result of forearm fracture, no displacement should be accepted and the
goal of treatment should be anatomical reduction, to avoid ulnar nerve entrapment in
the fracture site or late callus tethering, as bone healing proceeds. Anatomical
reduction could achieve primary bone healing, preventing callus formation, which
could potentially irritate the nerve. Some authors recommend also an MRI scan as a
further imaging, to detect nerve continuity disruption.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> NCV studies can demonstrate evidence of nerve damage approximately 2 to 3
weeks post injury.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1179556519841876" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> If there is pre reduction ulnar nerve damage and the fracture is anatomically
reduced either conservatively or surgically, then wait and see for up to 20&#x02009;weeks,
provided that there is no progressive worsening. Maybe wait less for fractures
located in the proximal shaft of the radius and ulna, as the distance of
reinnervation is longer than those of the mid or distal shaft. In case surgical
exploration of the nerve is necessary, it should be performed in a centre where the
appropriate equipment and expertise are available.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section6-1179556519841876"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current review article represents an attempt to propose a guide of treating ulnar
nerve palsy after closed forearm fractures in children. In summary, a nerve injury
which results from closed fracture manipulation needs surgical exploration.
Progressive neurological worsening and lack of improvement after a long period of
time also indicate surgical intervention. We think that, although some forearm
fracture displacement is acceptable in the paediatric population, in case of ulnar
nerve impairment, the surgeon should aim for anatomical reduction of the fracture.
Randomized controlled trial studies of large case series are required, in order for
safe conclusions and guidelines regarding treatment, to be produced.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the
