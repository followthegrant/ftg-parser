There is no current, recommended treatment for SCI; therefore, the effectiveness of a supplement approved by the Therapeutic Goods Association that has the potential to enhance cognitive function in an at-risk cohort should be tested. The primary aim of this proposed research is to determine the efficacy of 6&#x02009;months of treatment with BioCeuticals Cognition Support Formula&#x000ae; (containing <italic>Bacopa monniera</italic> (brahmi), <italic>Ginkgo biloba, Panax ginseng</italic> and alpha-lipoic acid) on cognition in older adults with SCI (utilising the CogState&#x000ae; one card learning and identification tests as co-primary outcome measures of visual short-term memory and attention; mean speed (ms), accuracy (%), and total number of hits, misses, and anticipations) compared with placebo. The secondary aims are to assess an improvement in other cognitive domains (executive functioning, processing speed, and working memory), evaluate safety, adverse effects, and determine efficacy on mood, fatigue, and neurocognition. It is expected that improvements across the study timepoints in the co-primary outcomes in the active treatment group (compared with placebo) will be evident.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p id="Par2">One-hundred and twenty participants will be recruited for the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups (active or placebo) at a 1:1 ratio, and will be required to complete a series of cognitive (using CogState&#x000ae;), mood (using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-42) and Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI)), and fatigue (using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F)) tasks at baseline (0&#x02009;months), the midpoint (3&#x02009;months), and the endpoint (6&#x02009;months). These tasks will be evaluated between timepoints (baseline vs. midpoint, midpoint vs. endpoint, and baseline vs. endpoint). Neurocognition will be measured by electroencephalography at baseline and at the endpoint in half of the participants. Adverse effects will be documented over the 6-month trial period.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This is the first study to test the efficacy of Cognition Support Formula&#x000ae; on cognition in older adults with SCI.

Although most subjective reports of cognitive decline are about memory, SCI can also relate to perceived changes in attention, executive functioning, and language. Furthermore, SCI is correlated with high scores of depression and anxiety and low future cognitive performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In contrast to normal ageing, SCI is evidenced by a future objective decline in cognition over a shorter period of time than what is expected for age-related cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Hence, SCI is related to a significant future decline in cognition, rather than aged-related deficits in current memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">SCI has been found to be associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD), the most common form of sporadic late-onset dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A longitudinal study of older adults found that 54% of older adults with SCI show a cognitive decline over a 7-year follow-up period compared with only 15% with no SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Approximately 79% of those people with SCI developed MCI, and 21% developed AD over 7&#x02009;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], representing a significantly increased risk of future decline for this population. It is important not to ignore reports of cognitive impairment by older adults, as the literature suggests these could be early signs for the future development of AD and MCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Due to an ageing population in Australia, cognitive impairment is becoming more prevalent. The estimated global prevalence of SCI ranges between 25 and 50% in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In terms of prevalence between sexes, older females more often report SCI than older males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This was evidenced in a study of older adults 64&#x02009;years of age and above, where 35.2% of females compared with 28% of males in the study reported SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, older adults with higher levels of education compared with older adults with lower levels of education are more likely to report cognitive impairment as they are thought to have more insight into the changes in their own cognitive functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Older adults reporting SCI are more likely to have heightened levels of anxiety and depression, which can further impact on cognitive performance and increase dementia risk, and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, evidence of heightened fatigue and low energy levels have been found to be associated with poor cognitive performance in older adults with SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Current treatments for SCI</title><p id="Par21">Current treatments for older adults with SCI are limited, with most published clinical trials utilising nutraceuticals including soybean-derived phosphatidylserine (SB-PS) and multivitamins containing extracts of <italic>Bacopa monniera</italic> (whole plant) and <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> leaf extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These studies have documented small effects in terms of improvements in cognitive tasks (working memory, recognition memory, and recall) where short trial periods were utilised (12&#x02009;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and 16&#x02009;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]). Unfortunately, there is no evidence to determine whether these effects were stable over the trial period (possibly a significant increase, then a tapering off), or whether the cognitive improvements occurred shortly after treatment, or towards the end of the trial period. A longer trial period of 6&#x02009;months that includes midpoint testing is required to clarify the stability and longevity of any changes. This would prove most fruitful in determining whether such a treatment could manage SCI in the long term.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cognition Support Formula&#x000ae;</title><p id="Par22">Cognition Support Formula&#x000ae; (BioCeuticals Pty Ltd) is a herbal and nutritional supplement commercially available over the counter in select pharmacies and via practitioners (e.g. naturopaths).

The active components of brahmi are identified as bacosides A and B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Brahmi may be neuroprotective and memory enhancing, and have antioxidant effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The active bacosides are thought to increase cerebral blood flow and neurotransmitter modulation (acetylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and dopamine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

The active component is ginsenosides from three different groups: protopanaxadiol, protopanaxatriol, and oleanolic acid. The mechanism of action of ginseng is thought to be within the central nervous system with the modulation of neurotransmitter systems involved in the mediation of memory and cognition, including GABA, glutamate, dopamine, and serotonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Additionally, ginseng has been found to upregulate key neurotrophins involved in neuroplasticity including brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

ALA is a powerful nutrient that is able to recycle redox-active antioxidant vitamins such as E and C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Mechanisms of action include an influence on neuronal energy production (reactivation of enzymes involved in glucose metabolism and glucose transport, i.e. a blood glucose lowering effect) and anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties (downregulation of chronic inflammatory processes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">In the literature, ALA has been found to stabilise cognitive functioning in older adults with AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

The most comparable study is by Lim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], who utilised a similar population (healthy older adults vs. people with MCI vs. AD) and a comparable measure to the current study as outlined in this protocol (CogState&#x000ae; battery).

In order to account for a typical 20% drop-out, a total of 120 participants will need to be recruited (60 participants in the treatment group, and 60 in the placebo group). If the participation rate drops below the estimated number at any point during the course of the study, attempts to recruit additional participants will be made. Sample size may be re-estimated mid-course into the study to ensure adequate power. In this case, data will be unblinded by an objective third party to evaluate the treatment-effect size and power to assist with any potential sample size re-estimation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Sample size for EEG sub-study</title><p id="Par68">Most EEG studies do not utilise effect size calculations to determine sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It is more important to determine signal-to-noise ratio in event-related potential (ERP) studies to ensure that the stimulus-evoked activity can be differentiated from the ongoing background EEG. Therefore, to obtain a meaningful EEG sub-study sample size (greater than 20 participants across both groups), the total sample size for EEG testing is 64 participants; 32 derived from the treatment group and 32 from the placebo group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Randomisation, allocation concealment, compliance and adverse effects</title><p id="Par69">Participants will be randomly allocated at a 1:1 ratio to either the treatment or placebo group using a permuted block allocation strategy. Computerised randomisation and allocation will be conducted using a unique random number generator in Microsoft Excel by a university staff member external to the research team. This external staff member sent the random sequence directly to the trial drug manufacturer, with participant IDs and unique batch codes to conceal the sequence. This is a double-blind trial, so both participants and the research team are blinded to treatment allocation until study completion. After eligibility is confirmed, participants will then be allocated to the next participant ID/numbered box of product by a member of the research team. Compliance will be assessed by advising participants to return any unused medication at the midpoint (3&#x02009;months) and endpoint (6&#x02009;months), and by completion of a diary by participants noting medication intake and adverse effects.</p><p id="Par70">To monitor safety, participants will be referred to a local commercial laboratory (Laverty) prior to baseline and the endpoint testing sessions. Standard blood safety tests (full blood count, fasting blood glucose, liver and renal function tests) will be carried out. If participants receive an abnormal blood safety test result at baseline, they will not be enrolled in the study and will be encouraged to follow up their results with their regular health professional. Adverse events will be closely monitored throughout the course of the study.</p><p id="Par71">In the case of a serious adverse event, and if the study drug is suspected as a potential cause and identifying treatment allocation is essential to the participant receiving appropriate medical care, unblinding of that participant only will occur. This will be done by the university staff member external to the research team who generated the computerised random sequence allocation.</p><p id="Par72">At the study midpoint, endpoint, and follow-up (7&#x02009;months; 4&#x02009;weeks after the endpoint) participants will be asked to which treatment condition they think that they have been allocated. Responses of Cognition Support Formula&#x000ae;, placebo, or unknown will be recorded. Responses will be checked against the condition allocated at the end of the trial after un-blinding.

Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> lists the cognitive, mood, and fatigue measures that will be utilised in this study. Further detail of these measures are given below.</p><p id="Par78">The CogState&#x000ae; pre-clinical Alzheimer&#x02019;s Battery of tests will be utilised to measure baseline, 3-month and 6-month changes in cognition. In addition to the battery, the Groton Maze learning test (CogState&#x000ae; test) will be completed by participants. CogState&#x000ae; is a computerised cognitive test battery that has excellent test-retest reliability ranging from .76&#x02013;.93 (intra-class correlation coefficient) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Participants will complete a practice trial prior to the main trial, in accordance with previous literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. There are no known practice effects associated with completing the practice. Practice trials will help to provide a &#x02018;true baseline&#x02019; measure as errors are generally made during the first instance of completing the task. Participants will become familiar with the tasks during the practice trials, and this will therefore ensure equity in the measurement of task outcomes between the testing timepoints. The CogState&#x000ae; battery will be administered at baseline (0&#x02009;months), the midpoint (3&#x02009;months), and the endpoint (6&#x02009;months), again with no known practice effects between time intervals. Furthermore, this cognitive testing method enables investigation into multiple areas of cognition including processing speed, attention, short-term memory, working memory, and executive function. The co-primary outcomes (one card learning and identification tests) measure visual short-term memory and attention, while the secondary outcomes (Groton Maze learning test, detection, and one back tests) measure executive functioning, processing speed, and working memory, respectively.</p><p id="Par79">The DASS is a 42-item self-report instrument designed to measure the three related negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. Participants who consistently score higher than the normal range for depression (0&#x02013;9), anxiety (0&#x02013;7), or stress (0&#x02013;14) (during baseline and midpoint sessions) will be advised to speak to their general practitioner. There is an expectation that participants will score higher in each of the three domains compared with a population without SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par80">The SHAI is a shortened (18-item) measure of participants&#x02019; anxiety pertaining to their health. The highest total score is 52, indicating the highest level of health anxiety. Participants will complete the SHAI at baseline, the midpoint, and the endpoint. A comparison from baseline to endpoint will be made between treatment groups (active and placebo) to determine if health anxiety has decreased with the use of Cognition Support Formula&#x000ae; or placebo.</p><p id="Par81">The FACIT-F is a self-report questionnaire utilised to determine a participant&#x02019;s level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past 7&#x02009;days. The FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire measuring the level of fatigue on a four-point Likert scale. The FACIT-F will be utilised to determine if fatigue and energy levels improve with the use of Cognition Support Formula&#x000ae;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>EEG protocol</title><p id="Par82">EEG is an objective and non-invasive method of measuring neuronal activity. Utilisation of EEG in the proposed study will complement the cognitive measures previously outlined. Potential changes in participants&#x02019; resting EEG and task-related EEG from baseline to endpoint will be investigated. These changes include short- and long-term episodic memory encoding and retrieval, arousal, response activation, inhibition, and discrimination. Additionally, differences in the above-mentioned EEG methods between the treatment and placebo groups will be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Statistical analyses and dissemination</title><p id="Par83">For each participant in each group and at each timepoint the following data from the primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed. For the CogState&#x000ae; detection, identification, one card learning, and one back tests, we will assess mean speed (ms), accuracy (%), and total number of hits, misses, and anticipations; for the Groton Maze test, we will assess the total number of errors; and for the mood (DASS-42, SHAI) and fatigue (FACIT-F) outcomes, we will assess subscale and composite scores. CogState&#x000ae; data that are not normally distributed will be transformed using logarithmic base 10 transformations. Generalised linear mixed models with a between-subject factor of group (treatment, placebo) and within-subject factor of time (baseline, midpoint, endpoint) will be conducted to assess differences in continuous co-primary and secondary outcome measures. Planned simple contrasts will be conducted to assess all timepoints (baseline vs. midpoint, midpoint vs. endpoint, and baseline vs. endpoint). To handle any missing data, analysis of last observation carried forward will be undertaken within the intention-to-treat analysis model. The premise of the intention-to-treat model includes all participants in the final analysis even if non-compliance, withdrawal, or deviation from the protocol occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Due to the nature of drop-outs in clinical trials, this analysis will be carried out on all five primary and secondary outcome measures of cognition and secondary outcomes of mood (DASS and SHAI) and fatigue (FACIT-F).</p><p id="Par84">All tests will be two-tailed, &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05.

Furthermore, the intervals (0, 3, 6&#x02009;months) will assist in better determining the effectiveness of intermediate and long-term use of the supplement. Additionally, these comparisons will also help to generalise our results to other studies that have used shorter trial periods (e.g. 12&#x02009;weeks).</p><p id="Par87">Each of the individual components of the formula has been found to increase cognition in older adults with cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].
