It is expressed in a wide variety of cells including as different types as neurons, platelets, cells of the immune system and muscle. The cell-specific expression of the A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor is controlled by at least three different upstream non-coding exons and their corresponding promotors. Compared to other G protein-coupled receptors the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor holds an unusually long intracellular carboxy terminus, which consists of 122 amino acids. This C-terminus turned out to be the docking site for other proteins. Using a yeast-2-hybrid screen we have previously identified proteins interacting with the C-terminus including ARNO/cytohesin-2, SAP102 and USP4.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>To verify these interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> and to identify new interacting proteins of the A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor we chose a two-step proteomics approach: we first expressed tagged receptors in HEK293 fibroblasts using various TAP (tandem affinity purification)-tag variants; the differently tagged receptors were analyzed for expression, localization and their pharmacological properties (ligand binding and cAMP accumulation) to identify tags suitable to further analyze the receptor&#x02019;s interactome. These tagged receptors were then used to optimize the purification and to make the first initial screens using 2D-nano-LC-MS/MS approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and conclusions</title><p>We could identify two tags suitable for further analysis of the A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor interactome. One of the tags kept the receptor to a large extent in the endoplasmatic reticulum, while the second tag allowed surface expression. Pharmacological properties of the receptors were comparable to untagged versions of the receptor. LC-MS/MS analysis of the purified ER trapped version of the receptor revealed proteins putatively involved in the folding of the receptor like heat shock proteins. The A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor expressed at the cell surface will be used in the <italic>in vivo</italic> approach. To perform this we generate a transgenic mouse expressing the TAP-tagged version of the A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor under the control of its endogenous promotors (homologous knock-in). This will allow us to examine tissue and developmental specific interaction partners of the A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor.</p></sec></body></article>
