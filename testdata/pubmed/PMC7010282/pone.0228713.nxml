A methodology has been established for the analysis of how Wikipedia editors regard science through their references to scientific papers. The method of co-citation has been adapted to this context in order to generate Pathfinder networks (PFNET) that highlight the most relevant scientific journals and categories, and their interactions in order to find out how scientific literature is consumed through this open encyclopaedia. In addition to this, their obsolescence has been studied through Price index. A total of 1 433 457 references available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Altmetric.com">Altmetric.com</ext-link> have been initially taken into account. After pre-processing and linking them to the data from Elsevier's CiteScore Metrics the sample was reduced to 847 512 references made by 193 802 Wikipedia articles to 598 746 scientific articles belonging to 14 149 journals indexed in Scopus. As highlighted results we found a significative presence of &#x0201c;Medicine&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology&#x0201d; papers and that the most important journals are multidisciplinary in nature, suggesting also that high-impact factor journals were more likely to be cited. Furthermore, only 13.44% of Wikipedia citations are to Open Access journals.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007406</institution-id><institution>Fundaci&#x000f3;n BBVA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Knowmetrics: knowledge evaluation in digital society</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Romero-Fr&#x000ed;as</surname><given-names>Esteban</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study has been possible thanks to financial support from &#x0201c;Knowmetrics: knowledge evaluation in digital society", a project funded by scientific research team grants from the BBVA Foundation, 2016, and the grant TIN2016-75850-R from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness with FEDER funds.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="20"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The data underlying the results presented in the study are available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Altmetric.com">Altmetric.com</ext-link> and Elsevier's CiteScore Metrics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data underlying the results presented in the study are available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Altmetric.com">Altmetric.com</ext-link> and Elsevier's CiteScore Metrics.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since its creation in 2001, Wikipedia has become the largest encyclopedic work human beings have ever created thanks to the collaborative, connected opportunities offered by the Web. Probably one of the most significant examples of Web 2.0 [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], Wikipedia represents a success story for collective intelligence [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With more than 170 editions, the English language version accounted for 5.5 million entries in January 2018 (approximately 11.7% of the entire encyclopedia). Given that worldwide Wikipedia is a top ten website in terms of traffic&#x02014;according to Alexa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.alexa.com/topsites">https://www.alexa.com/topsites</ext-link>, consulted on July 24, 2019)&#x02014;and is one of the preferred results provided by search engines, it has become an outstanding tool for the dissemination of knowledge within a model based on openness and collaboration.</p><p>Perhaps Wikipedia&#x02019;s most important achievement has been to challenge traditional epistemologies based on authorship and authority and move towards a more social, distributed epistemology [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Wikipedia is therefore the result of a negotiation process that provides us with a representation of knowledge in society, offering tremendous research opportunities. For instance, some authors have studied the discursive constructions of concepts such as globalization [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or historical landmarks like the 9/11 attacks [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The process of negotiation behind an article is often driven by the principles of verifiability and reliability in relation to the sources supporting the statements made. Specialized publications are among the preferred sources of reference (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources</ext-link>, consulted on July 24, 2019), mainly in the form of scholarly material and prioritizing academic and peer-reviewed publications, as well as scholarly monographs and textbooks.</p><p>Consequently, the social construction of knowledge on Wikipedia is explicitly and intentionally connected to scholarly research published under the peer-review model. This has offered us the opportunity to investigate how Science and Wikipedia interrelate. Although Wikipedia is not a primary source of information, some studies have examined citations of Wikipedia articles [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, numerous studies have analyzed how Wikipedia articles cite scholarly publications because contributors are strongly recommended to do so by the encyclopedia itself. Studies have focused on the analysis of reference and citation patterns in specific areas of knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], on exploring Wikipedia&#x02019;s value as a source when evaluating scientific activity [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], or on Wikipedia&#x02019;s role as a platform that promotes open access research [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, some studies undertaken within the last decade could be said to be framed within the Altmetric perspective because they have used indicators extracted from the social media to measure dimensions of academic impact [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Wikipedia references to scientific articles can provide highly valuable altmetric information given that the inclusion of references is not a trivial activity and is usually subject to community scrutiny. For instance, the Altmetric Attention Score&#x02014;an indicator created by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Altmetric.com">Altmetric.com</ext-link>&#x02014;gives this type of citation a high value (3) that is higher than mentions on Facebook (0.25) or Twitter (1), but lower than references to blogs (5) and news feeds (8).</p><p>Networks have also been used for knowledge representation in order to visualize differences between the Universal Decimal Classification category structure and that generated by Wikipedia itself [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], to generate automated taxonomies and visualizations of scientific fields [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and to show connections between articles [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; furthermore, studies based on the complex networks approach have also been reported [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One way to address knowledge representation from a bibliometric perspective is through the use of co-citations [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], an approach that uses references in common received from a third document as a proxy for similarity between two scientific documents. Co-citations have been used to observe similarities between words [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or areas of knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>From an Altmetric perspective, the concept of co-citation was transferred to the online world giving rise to co-link analysis [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], where documents are replaced by webpages or websites, and citations are replaced by links. Co-link analysis has successfully mapped scientific knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and analyzed fields such as universities [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], politics [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or business [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>These different concepts where recently combined and applied to Wikipedia by Torres-Salinas, Romero-Fr&#x000ed;as and Arroyo-Machado [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and tested in the field of the Humanities by mapping specialties and journals. The present study uses Wikipedia to draw a social representation of scientific knowledge and the areas into which it is divided. After collecting all the references in Wikipedia, we concluded that only 5.49% correspond to the Humanities (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228713.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Therefore, in the present study we take the same approach in investigating Science as a whole, including the Humanities. We seek to achieve the following objectives:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To apply co-citation analysis to all the articles referenced in Wikipedia in order to validate their usefulness in analyzing open knowledge platforms;</p></list-item><list-item><p>To offer a general portrait of the use of scientific literature published in journals through the analysis of references and their obsolescence. Thus, we hope to be able to describe the consumption of scientific information by the Wikipedia community and detect possible differences between fields; and lastly, as the nuclear objective of our paper</p></list-item><list-item><p>To discover the different visions offered by Wikipedia by using co-citation networks at different levels of aggregation: 1) journal co-citation maps 2) main field co-citation maps 3) field co-citation maps. Through these representations we intended to obtain a holistic view of how scientific articles in Wikipedia are used and consumed.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Information sources and data pre-processing</title><p>The main source of information in this study was <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Altmetric.com">Altmetric.com</ext-link>, one of the most important platforms gathering altmetric data about scientific papers. The total volume of references to scientific papers made by Wikipedia articles was downloaded on April 11, 2018. This amounted to 1 433 457 references published between October 15, 2004 and April 10, 2018, citing 960 017 discrete resources. Initially we pre-processed the data with R in order to clean it up. This involved correcting errors to facilitate links with other data sources, eliminating duplicate references, and deleting references lacking the data needed for our study, such as publication dates. As a result, the total number of references fell to 1 211 904 citing 857 087 individual resources. ISSNs corresponding to these resources were collected using the Altmetric API. A total of 36 090 ISSNs corresponding to 693 805 scientific articles were obtained. In addition, we used Elsevier's CiteScore Metrics (with data updated to February 6, 2018) to link each scientific article to its source through journal identifiers and thus obtain additional information. The references were linked to Elsevier&#x02019;s CiteScore Metrics&#x02019;s entire collection. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228713.g001">Fig 1</xref> summarizes this process.</p><fig id="pone.0228713.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0228713.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Methodological process of collecting the massive dataset of papers referenced in Wikipedia and assigning them to different scientific categories.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0228713.g001"/></fig><p>The Scopus ASJC (All Science Journal Classification) offered in the CiteScore Metrics collection has been used to attribute areas, main fields, and fields to the scientific articles being studied. To use Scopus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/12007/supporthub/scopus/">https://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/12007/supporthub/scopus/</ext-link>) terminology, we would say that the ASJC identifies four major areas each of which includes several <italic>Subject Area Classifications</italic> (termed <italic>main fields</italic> in our study). Given that <italic>multidisciplinarity</italic> is a common main field in each of the four areas, we have decided to include this category as a main area as well. As a result, there are 27 main fields (<italic>subject area classifications</italic> in Scopus terminology) and 330 fields (<italic>fields</italic>) within five main areas (<italic>subject areas</italic>): namely "Health Sciences", "Life Sciences", "Physical Sciences", "Social Sciences &#x00026; Humanities", and "Multidisciplinary". Hence, the final sample consists of 847 512 references included in 193 802 Wikipedia entries, citing 598 746 individual scientific articles from 14 149 journals. This process of attribution enabled us to identify references to scientific articles and, at a more aggregated level, references to journals, fields and main fields, giving rise to three different co-citation networks.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>As part of the descriptive statistics, the mean, median, standard deviation and interquartile range have been calculated for the number of references made by Wikipedia and the citations received by the scientific articles, as well as for the dates of citation and publication of the papers, at all the different levels under study. We would emphasize the fact that in our dataset all Wikipedia entries include at least one reference to scientific papers and all articles and journals included have been cited at least once by Wikipedia articles. Furthermore, the obsolescence of the scientific references has also been calculated using the Price index [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which has been applied to intervals of up to 5, 10, 15 and 20 years, the entire dataset, and by scientific fields. The Price index refers to the percentage of publications cited not older than a specific number of years and is a means of showing the level of immediacy of publications cited, which differs according to the scientific area [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similarly, the distributions of citations between Wikipedia and Scopus have been compared using the citation value recorded by Elsevier&#x02019;s CiteScore Metrics&#x02014;, which corresponds to the sum of citations in 2016 to articles published between 2013 and 2015&#x02014;, and by Wikipedia, and adjusted to allow for this limitation. Finally, the distribution of journal citations from Wikipedia has been analyzed, to determine whether it fits power law and log-normal distributions using the poweRlaw package [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Analysis of co-citation networks</title><p>Co-citation networks, bibliographic coupling and direct citations are some of the most significant bibliometric networks we can use to map citations from Wikipedia entries; of these, co-citation networks are the most popular in research [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. If we take into account other types of network such as co-author and co-word, the aforementioned three methods show a high degree of similarity [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Within the field of altmetrics, the concepts of co-citation and coupling have both been adapted [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but co-citations offer more varied alternatives [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Furthermore, they are of special interest as they have been identified as capable of enhancing transdisciplinarity [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Hence, we have generated co-citation maps at the level of journal, field and main field.</p><p>The Pathfinder algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] has been applied as a pruning method following a common configuration (r = &#x0221e;, q = n-1) that reduces the networks to a minimum covering tree. This algorithm&#x02014;successfully applied in the field of Library and Information Sciences [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228713.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]&#x02014;keeps only the strongest co-citation links between all pairs of nodes and offers a diaphanous view of large networks. Given the huge amount of co-citations, especially between journals, we use this technique to prune them in order to make the networks more explanatory. Since it is applied to values in relation to distances, the inverse value of the co-cites has been used in our analysis. Local measures of proximity, betweenness and eigenvector centrality have also been calculated. In the case of journals, the data has undergone a second pruning to eliminate those entries with a co-citation degree lower than 50.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec006"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec007"><title>General description</title><p>We have analyzed 847 512 references to scientific articles distributed across 193 802 Wikipedia entries. A total of 598 746 scientific articles published in 14 149 journals are cited. Each Wikipedia entry includes 4.373 (&#x000b1; 8.351) references to scientific articles, while they receive a mean of 1.415 (&#x000b1; 10.15) citations. Some 81.71% of the total number of scientific articles (489 235) receive only one citation and this corresponds to 57.73% of all references in the study sample.</p><p>This high standard deviation can be explained by looking at the top 1% of Wikipedia entries with more references, some 60.874 references (&#x000b1; 32.752), representing 13.92% of all references in the study. This top 1% of entries is related to listings&#x02014;highlights of scientific events in a discipline during a given year&#x02014;history, genes, common diseases or drugs and medicines. For instance, the highest number of references recorded for a single entry is 550 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_in_paleontology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_in_paleontology</ext-link>). Furthermore, the level of variation in the standard deviation is not unfamiliar in metrics of this type since the distribution studied here has an especially marked asymmetry because 81% of papers receive only one citation and 97% of the total only receive between one and three. Moreover, 20% of the most cited papers only receive 40% of the total number of citations.

Previous research [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] had experimented with this approach in the Humanities alone, presenting promising results in mapping Science from the Wikipedia perspective. However, it was necessary to validate this on a more ambitious scale, that is, the entire open online encyclopedia, in which the Humanities represent only 5.49% of all the references collected. The results presented above are indicative of how this this innovative approach allows us to depict a complete picture of Science.</p><p>Thus we can produce science maps that complement the traditional co-citation maps focused on scientific articles [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228713.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and provide a representation of knowledge that focuses on the vision and use of information in the scientific community. The methodology presented, which focuses on the co-citation of Wikipedia articles, offers holistic maps of the use of scientific information by Wikipedia users/editors who are not necessarily scientists. Therefore these maps represent the user's vision of scientific activity and in this sense they are close to other mapping methodologies that are not exclusively centered on citations but centered on the user&#x02014;maps such as those based on Clickstream Data [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], readership network maps using Mendeley [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] or maps based on Co-Tweet [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. By comparison with earlier research, the main novelties of the present study are that for the first time a source of information as important as Wikipedia has been used, several sources have been combined (Altmetrics, Scopus), and we have used Pathfinder, which is a much more efficient algorithm.</p><p>The Wikipedia references, unlike those collected in other social media, offer remarkable quality control and transparency. In relation to the problem of trolling, the encyclopedia is based on a solid quality management system of post-publication peer review in which, in the case of discrepancies, changes are resolved through consensus between editors. Wikipedia also has two manuals: for non-academic experts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikipedia_editing_for_non-academic_experts">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikipedia_editing_for_non-academic_experts</ext-link>) and for researchers, scholars, and academics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikipedia_editing_for_researchers,_scholars,_and_academics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikipedia_editing_for_researchers,_scholars,_and_academics</ext-link>) both specifying the importance of the use of citations under the principles of verifiability and notability. This substantially minimizes the likelihood that references in entries will be tampered with.</p><p>Wikipedia also offers a complete list of its bots (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ListUsers/bot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ListUsers/bot</ext-link>), including those such as the Citation bot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Citation_bot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Citation_bot</ext-link>), which in addition to adding missing identifiers to references, corrects and completes them, something for which the digital encyclopedia offers several tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Citation_tools">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Citation_tools</ext-link>). However, this does not prevent the appearance of publications with a high, anomalous number of citations [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

So, although the use of citations is not compromised, practices of this sort must be taken into account, for example, if their use is in an evaluative context. Given all of the aforementioned, we consider that in this context in which 193 802 Wikipedia entries and 847 512 article citations have been analyzed, it is very difficult to produce manipulations that could significantly alter the system and, consequently, the results achieved here.</p><sec id="sec012"><title>About the results</title><p>This study illustrates the use of scientific information from the Wikipedia perspective, which is the most important and largest encyclopedia available nowadays.

The most relevant fields are &#x0201c;Medicine&#x0201d; (32.58%), &#x0201c;Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology&#x0201d; (31.5%) and &#x0201c;Agricultural and Biological Sciences&#x0201d; (14.91%). In contrast, &#x0201c;Dentistry&#x0201d; (0.28%), &#x0201c;Energy&#x0201d; (0.43%), &#x0201c;Decision Sciences&#x0201d; (0.49%) and &#x0201c;Veterinary&#x0201d; (0.52%) are the main fields that globally receive fewer references. We would emphasize the fact that these areas need to strengthen the visibility of their work. In general, we find it remarkable that Science disciplines should dominate the Humanities and Social Sciences.</p><p>If we look at the maps at journal level, we find that the most important publications are multidisciplinary in nature and the main journals in terms of centrality are <italic>Science</italic>, <italic>Nature</italic>, <italic>PNAS</italic>, <italic>PLoS ONE</italic>, and <italic>The Lancet</italic>. However, after applying the Pathfinder algorithm to discard less relevant relationships, we note that <italic>PNAS</italic> rises to first position, limiting the centrality of journals like <italic>Science</italic> and <italic>PLoS ONE</italic>, which have more but weaker co-citation relations. Without a doubt, this places <italic>Science</italic> and <italic>PLoS ONE</italic> in an interesting centrality space and turns them into nodes that connect with a curiously wide variety of journals. Likewise, our proposed methodology has enabled us to detect the strongest links between the main journals and their scientific uniqueness; in this sense, it is worth highlighting <italic>Nature</italic>'s strong relationship with &#x0201c;Physics&#x0201d;, <italic>Science</italic><bold>&#x02019;</bold>s relationship with &#x0201c;Chemistry&#x0201d; and that of <italic>PNAS</italic> with &#x0201c;Life Sciences&#x0201d;.</p><p>Like other platforms, multidisciplinary journals are hubs and articulate the Wikipedia network. However, despite being a common global phenomenon, Wikipedia does have, and contains unique citation practices mentioning journals that are not cited or mentioned in a relevant way in other databases or platforms. This is evidenced in the scatter plot of Wikipedia and Scopus citations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228713.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p><p>This difference is also illustrated by a comparison of the journals most mentioned in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Altmetric.com">Altmetric.com</ext-link> with those most mentioned in Wikipedia. As we can see, Wikipedia has the major multidisciplinary journals in common, as does Scopus. However, some of the most frequently mentioned journals in Wikipedia are the <italic>Journal of Biological Chemistry</italic> or <italic>Zookeys</italic> which are located in JCR&#x02019;s Q2. Nonetheless, the <italic>Journal of Biological Chemistry</italic>, for example, is one of the most widely cited journals in the field of genetics receiving a large number of citations in various entries such as "Androgen receptor" (45 citations) or "Epidermal growth factor receptor" (25 citations). Therefore, Wikipedia points to another type of specialized journal in different fields (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228713.s008">S8 Table</xref>) that are not identified in other rankings. In addition, as we have indicated, this can hardly be due to trolling or a bot.</p><p>If we observe the map of main fields, "Medicine" and "Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", are the two main nodes. From this perspective, "General Medicine" is the most relevant node, accounting for the highest number of citations received. It acts as a highly important connector in the network. Moreover, this underlines the role of &#x0201c;Psychology&#x0201d; in connecting &#x0201c;Health Sciences&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;Social Sciences and the Humanities&#x0201d;.</p><p>Given the open nature of Wikipedia, the analysis of references to open access journals is particularly relevant. Firstly, it is remarkable that only 13.44% of citations are to Open Access journals, when Wikipedia explicitly supports free content. Furthermore, only two of the 20 most cited journals are open access resources (<italic>PLoS ONE</italic> and <italic>Nucleic Acids Research</italic>). Teplitskiy et al. [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] determined that the odds in favor of an Open Access journal being referenced in the encyclopedia were about 47% higher than that of closed access journals. They also suggested that high-impact factor journals were more likely to be cited, as we have also observed in our results. In relation to open access resources, the fact that many articles in closed journals can be accessed through their authors or third parties [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] may distort some of these considerations.</p><p><italic>PLoS ONE</italic> is the most relevant open access journal cited in Wikipedia. And it is the fourth in terms of centrality, just behind <italic>Science</italic>, <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>PNAS</italic>, all three of which operate under a non-open access model. When applying Pathfinder, <italic>PLoS ONE</italic><bold>&#x02019;</bold>s centrality is reduced. This is due to the fact that this method eliminates the weakest co-citation links, which are highly relevant to the journal because although is cataloged in "Health Sciences &#x00026; Life Sciences&#x0201d;, it occupies a central position in the network in relation to journals from vastly different areas.</p><p>Our study has also shown that certain fields have a stronger relative presence in Wikipedia references than in Scopus. This is the case of "Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology" (10.86% more), "Agricultural and Biological Sciences" (4.72% more) and &#x0201c;Multidisciplinary&#x0201d; (4.37% more), among others. This could indicate that from the Wikipedia perspective some fields receive more attention than from the scientific community as a whole. Finally, in relation to obsolescence we have observed significant differences between main fields. For instance, for the first five years, &#x0201c;Energy&#x0201d; has 55% of references, whereas the &#x0201c;Arts and Humanities&#x0201d; receives only 22.76%.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Comparison of Wikipedia and Scopus</title><p>Wikipedia's view of science differs from that of Scopus. While linear regression and generalized additive models have a correlation statistically significant, we do not establish causality due to the high presence of outliers that do not obey these patterns. Also, the focus of thematic attention provided by Wikipedia editors shows striking differences, an aspect that is clearly evident in Scopus and Wikipedia&#x02019;s differences of coverage and the presence in the latter of journals in very prominent positions that do not coincide with the views of other altmetrics sources. At the level of article citations the strong asymmetry in the distribution curve of Wikipedia citations is due to the fact that most receive only between one and three citations, showing a much more extreme phenomenon than Pareto's law. However, at the journal level, we can confirm the existence of a power-law distribution that shows a phenomenon similar to that observed in citations in Scopus [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This is why these differences allow us to appreciate that we are dealing with two phenomena that are not the same.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Limitations</title><p>As in our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], some limitations derive from the attribution of categories to journals since journals do not always belong to the category assigned by the database [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Latent co-citation can also arise [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] because some journals may be assigned to more than one field. We have resolved this issue by combining all of them under the same label.</p><p>It should be noted that the methodology used, which combines various sources (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Altmetric.com">Altmetric.com</ext-link>, Wikipedia and Journal Metrics by Elsevier), generates certain limitations. For example, we have only taken account of scientific articles since only resources with an ISSN and indexed by Scopus have been used; this excludes books or chapters of special relevance in the Humanities [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This is an issue present in the classical approaches that are limited to scientific journals [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Other problems derive from the sometimes inaccurate Altmetric description of their records. The dataset frequently presents duplicate records; errors in the year of publication, DOI and identifiers assigned to records; or records with many fields containing null values. For instance, the field presenting most problems has been that of the ISSN, which is sometimes incorrect in both Altmetric and CiteScore Metrics.</p><p>One of the most striking limitations detected with regard to the use of Wikipedia references as a measure of activity impact lies in their volatility because many references can be created or eliminated very quickly, making data collection and subsequent use difficult. In this respect <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Altmetric.com">Altmetric.com</ext-link>&#x02019;s Altmetric Attention Score can also mislead because given that it is a static measure, it only takes account of presence and makes no allowance for frequency. However, none of these limitations affects the overall results of our study because the large number of references and processed articles in our sample minimizes their impact.</p><p>Finally, we must point out that these types of map are an interesting complement to quantitative information offered by platforms such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Altmetric.com">Altmetric.com</ext-link> or PlumX. Thus, thanks to these contextual methodologies [<xref rid="pone.0228713.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] it is possible to elucidate more clearly the social impact (societal impact) of scientific articles in particular and of Science in general of platforms such as Wikipedia. In the future we will extrapolate co-citation studies to other documentary typologies and platforms included in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Altmetric.com">Altmetric.com</ext-link> such as news or policy reports in order to clearly establish the different representations of knowledge generated by different users and consumers of scientific information.</p></sec></sec><sec

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: The paper provides statistics and analysis about the citations and co-citations of academic publications on Wikipedia, one of the largest encyclopedia available to humans for free. It reveals the significant presence of "Medicine&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Biochemistry, Genetics, and Molecular Biology&#x0201d; papers, as well as the important role of multidisciplinary, high-impact factor journals. It also highlights that only 13.44% of the citations are Open Access.</p><p>The authors cleansed the dataset carefully, validating the citations on Wikipedia. This is critical as subsequent analysis all depends on the validation of the citations.</p><p>The results of this paper, despite its large amount, show little significance as findings and are sometimes misleading. The authors often abruptly stop their investigation after presenting some statistics, leaving the critical and interesting questions unanswered. Not only are the numbers hard to interpret correctly, but the paper also lacks a cohesive narrative. As a result, I have a difficult time answering the following question after reading this paper, "what have I learned from this paper"?</p><p>For example, the paper states that each Wikipedia entry includes on average 4.373 references. However, older and more popular entries may be better developed, and therefore includes more references. It is rather confusing what information or message this average delivers to the readers, especially when the standard error is so large as well (8.351). Since the distribution is likely skewed (judging from the large stderr and what's commonly observed in citation analysis), the averages may not representative statistics after all.</p><p>Is the distribution of references per entry/edit log-normal or power-law? On the per-entry level, how does this depend on the entry's age, birth year/month, popularity, topic, language, etc? On the per-edit level, how does this depend on the editors' experience, expertise area, edit year/month, language, etc? Can you show causality via matching? Are these relationships different when comparing editors on Wikipedia and researchers in academia? Stronger/weaker homophily in languages?</p><p>The authors compare Scopus citations with Wikipedia citations in mean absolute difference. The total number of citations is likely different in Scopus and Wikipedia. If Scopus has significantly more total citations in its system, it is rather unsurprising most paper has more citations in Scopus than in Wikipedia. The hypothesis here can be "are the distribution of citations for the papers in Scopus significantly different from that in Wikipedia?" If you can reject the hypothesis, that gives a motivation for investigating what factors drive the tested difference in the distribution.</p><p>Similarly, the finding that "General Medicine" and "Molecular Biology" stand out from other fields can be a result of the distribution of papers in each field. Imagine the editors are citing papers in random by throwing darts, trolling the system in some sense. If "General Medicine" and "Molecular Biology" produces significantly more papers, the random darts are more likely to land on papers in these two fields as well.</p><p>There needs to be more evidence to support the main findings of this paper, namely from the social perspective of Wikipedia, the authors find a significative presence of &#x0201c;Medicine&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Biochemistry, Genetics, and Molecular Biology&#x0201d; papers, and that the most important journals are multidisciplinary. One may find the same result from any perspectives, not exclusive to the social perspective of Wikipedia. There may not be anything particular about Wikipedia that associates with this observation. One way is to clarify this doubt is to analyze the co-citation network of both Wikipedia and Scopus, and test if there is a significant difference in the distribution of fields and the ranking of journal importance between Wikipedia and Scopus.</p><p>I believe the dataset at the hands of the authors can reveal much more than a set of descriptive findings. In particular, the author can focus more on what is special about Wikipedia and its social aspect that makes a part of the presented observations interesting, and follow up with more in-depth analysis targeting those observations. However, at the moment I deem the paper insufficient for publication.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This is an interesting study analyzing the relationship</p><p>between scientific papers and Wikipedia. While it is well writen</p><p>in most of its parts, the following issues should be addressed</p><p>before it can be accepted:</p><p>1) This is study is directed related to the topic of creating scientific</p><p>maps, a well-known research topic in the scientometric field. The authors should</p><p>improve the section of related works, mentioning similar works. See and mention e.g. doi: 10.1016/j.joi.2016.03.008; doi: 10.1007/s11192-012-0784-8; The analysis of knowledge in information networks has also been conisdered in recent works:</p><p>doi: 10.1016/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://j.ins.2017.08.091">j.ins.2017.08.091</ext-link></p><p>2) The authors should better explain why not using other types of networks to create the study. What is the effect of just using co-citation networks. Several options exists: citation networks, co-references, no use of references at all (e.g. text analysis). This possibility should be at least considered.</p><p>3) Why the authors used a dataset that has not been updated?</p><p>4) The authors should better explain the particular choice for a minimum covering tree and particular centrality measurements. The motivation for using such features of complex netowrks is not clear.</p><p>5) It is also not clear how interdisciplinarity (symmetry) is measured in graphs. It would be interesting</p><p>the authors to mention some of the possible approaches in the literature and how</p><p>such methods could obtain different results. See and mention e.g. the follwoing examples: entropic diversity (doi: 10.1209/0295-5075/110/68001); quantum walks (doi: 10.1103/PhysRevE.88.032806) and concentric rings.</p><p>Once the above major issues are addressed I will be able to recommend publication.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the in-depth review. Considering the criticism made, we have carried out an in-depth revision of the aspects indicated (writing, data analysis, etc.), particularly those indicated in his/her comments. Below we detail the changes made and the modifications introduced in the text for each of the criticisms made by the reviewer.</p><p>The comments are interesting and we have followed the main recommendations that the reviewer points out. But it should be considered that the analysis and in-depth citation patterns in Wikipedia are not the aim of the paper. Our main objective is to make a representation of its structure through co-citation. Also, the reviewer indicates questions that are far from this objective and that therefore cannot be answered at this point because we did not collect this type of information or fields (i.e. topics, popularity, editor, etc. ...). In addition, in line with our initial objectives, we opted to use Altmetric.com as our data source as it provides the sort of information that we needed and no other, i.e.: Mention Date (date of incorporation of the reference), Mention Title (title of the entry) and Mention URL (link to the revision of the entry in which the reference is introduced). Therefore many of the analyses indicated cannot be performed.</p><p>However, we do consider that the suggestions made by the reviewer can contribute to and improve the interpretation of the maps. That is why, first of all, we have conducted a more exacting statistical analysis in the following areas: 1) analysis of the annual evolution of citations by entry and of their accumulated value; 2) statistics concerning co-citations; and 3) a study of the multidisciplinarity of references.</p><p>In relation to averages and standard deviations, the reviewer is right and we expanded our explanation of this phenomenon. On the one hand, we have analyzed the Wikipedia entries that include more references, detecting, for example, those related to annual lists of scientific discoveries in a given discipline. On the other hand, we have also explained that this variation is not unknown in metrics of this type, since the distribution curve presents a particularly marked asymmetry as 81% of articles receive only one citation; those that receive between one and three citations account for 97% of the total. These are also seen in the fact that 20% of the most cited works constitute only 40% of the total number of citations. This phenomenon also occurs in almost all bibliometric indicators.</p><p>In this sense, following the reviewer's recommendations, we have carried out an analysis of the distribution of citations received by journals, which fits both log-normal and power-law. This explanation can be found, both in the results section and, in greater detail, in a new section that we have included in the discussion (Comparison of Wikipedia and Scopus).</p><p>This comparison was weakly explained in our first version of the paper and, therefore, we have edited it following the reviewers&#x02019; recommendation. Our aim was to determine whether the most cited works in Wikipedia coincided with those in Scopus. But obviously the work is not intended to analyze the citations or their distribution. However, we have followed the reviewer's advice and, as indicated in the previous reply, we have analyzed the distribution of citations in Wikipedia using the journals and comparing it with the results achieved in other works. </p><p>In addition to correcting this paragraph, we have exploited our data to improve the comparison between Wikipedia and Scopus citations at journal level in order to determine whether they offer different information. To do this we have used the number of citations included in the CiteScore Metrics (citations made in 2016 to articles published between 2013 and 2015) and adjusted those of Wikipedia to the same citation window. As we have commented in the text, the two statistical models generated offer an R2 of around 0.5 that we have not considered sufficient to demonstrate that there is strong relationship between both sets.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing to the subject of trolling, which is one of the great problems of most social media, and we have incorporated the following paragraphs:</p><p>&#x0201c;The Wikipedia references, unlike those collected in other social media, offer remarkable quality control and transparency. In relation to the problem of trolling, the encyclopedia is based on a solid quality management system of post-publication peer review in which, in the case of discrepancies, changes are resolved through consensus between editors. Wikipedia also has two manuals: for non-academic experts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikipedia_editing_for_non-academic_experts">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikipedia_editing_for_non-academic_experts</ext-link>) and for researchers, scholars, and academics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikipedia_editing_for_researchers,_scholars,_and_academics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikipedia_editing_for_researchers,_scholars,_and_academics</ext-link>) both specifying the importance of the use of citations under the principles of verifiability and notability. This substantially minimizes the likelihood that references in entries will be tampered with.</p><p>Wikipedia also offers a complete list of its bots (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ListUsers/bot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ListUsers/bot</ext-link>), including those such as the Citation bot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Citation_bot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Citation_bot</ext-link>), which in addition to adding missing identifiers to references, corrects and completes them, something for which the digital encyclopedia offers several tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Citation_tools">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Citation_tools</ext-link>). However, this does not prevent the appearance of publications with a high, anomalous number of citations [42]. For instance, we found a report (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/3171944">https://www.altmetric.com/details/3171944</ext-link>) cited in 1450 lunar crater entries, not attributable to a bot. So, although the use of citations is not compromised, practices of this sort must be taken into account, for example, if their use is in an evaluative context. Given all of the aforementioned, we consider that in this context in which 193 802 Wikipedia entries and 847 512 article citations have been analyzed, it is very difficult to produce manipulations that could significantly alter the system and, consequently, the results achieved here.&#x0201d;</p><p>We agree with the reviewer as long as, in principle, it may seem that there are similarities in the predominance of certain scientific areas (Medicine, ...) and certain types of journals (multidisciplinary). Although the reviewer indicates that the results are not exclusive to Wikipedia, we do consider that there are singular results in Wikipedia that are a direct consequence of the social practices of the platform. In this regard, we must indicate the specific case of "Biochemistry", which has a better representation&#x02014;more acute in Wikipedia than in Scopus. The same happens with other areas such as "Agricultural and Biological Science", as observed in Figure 8. However, we do agree with the reviewer that these have not been properly described in the text. We have therefore improved the results and the discussion. We have emphasized the singularities of Figure 8, written two new paragraphs in the discussion, and added a new table as complementary material, which clarifies this and helps to better interpret the co-citation maps. </p><p>&#x0201c;Like other platforms, multidisciplinary journals are hubs and articulate the Wikipedia network. However, despite being a common global phenomenon, Wikipedia does have, and contains unique citation practices mentioning journals that are not cited or mentioned in a relevant way in other databases or platforms. This is evidenced in the scatter plot of Wikipedia and Scopus citations (see Fig 5).</p><p>This difference is also illustrated by a comparison of the journals most mentioned in Altmetric.com with those most mentioned in Wikipedia. As we can see, Wikipedia has the major multidisciplinary journals in common, as does Scopus. However, some of the most frequently mentioned journals in Wikipedia are the Journal of Biological Chemistry or Zookeys which are located in JCR&#x02019;s Q2. Nonetheless, the Journal of Biological Chemistry, for example, is one of the most widely cited journals in the field of genetics receiving a large number of citations in various entries such as "Androgen receptor" (45 citations) or "Epidermal growth factor receptor" (25 citations). Therefore, Wikipedia points to another type of specialized journal in different fields (See Table S8) that are not identified in other rankings. In addition, as we have indicated, this can hardly be due to trolling or a bot.&#x0201d;</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestions.

If we take into account other types of network such as co-author and co-word, the aforementioned three methods show a high degree of similarity [31]. Within the field of altmetrics, the concepts of co-citation and coupling have both been adapted [32], but co-citations offer more varied alternatives [33]. Furthermore, they are of special interest as they have been identified as capable of enhancing transdisciplinarity [34]. Hence, we have generated co-citation maps at the level of journal, field and main field.&#x0201d;</p><p>In our case, apart from the fact that the data used is one year old, when we started working on this study the only dataset available with the information we needed to carry it out was the CiteScore Metrics.Furthermore, until then Elsevier had updated this set annually, but then stopped giving it continuity.</p><p>We have updated the methodology to better explain the choice of the Pathfinder algorithm and have included in the results a comparison between the network with and without Pathfinder, also introducing a new figure.</p><p>&#x0201c;The Pathfinder algorithm [35] has been applied as a pruning method following a common configuration (r=&#x0221e;, q=n-1) that reduces the networks to a minimum covering tree. This algorithm&#x02014;successfully applied in the field of Library and Information Sciences [26, 36]&#x02014;keeps only the strongest co-citation links between all pairs of nodes and offers a diaphanous view of large networks. Given the huge amount of co-citations, especially between journals, we use this technique to prune them in order to make the networks more explanatory.&#x0201d;</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion of the reviewer, but within the analysis of networks we have not analyzed the symmetry distribution. Our objective has been to map co-occurrences at different levels (journal, main field and field) established on the basis of citations from scientific articles. This is why we have decided to use the Pathfinder algorithm to highlight the strongest relationships.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0228713.s012"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0228713.s012.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0228713.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0228713.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lozano</surname><given-names>Sergi</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Sergi Lozano</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Sergi Lozano</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0228713" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: I appreciate the replies from the authors and their effort in enhancing the paper.</p><p>The paper, in my opinion, has mapped science through the lens of Wikipedia. The comparison between Wikipedia and Scopus then reveals how differently topics and journals represent among Wikipedia editors and among academic researchers. At the end the paper talks about specific findings.</p><p>With the additional statistical analysis, I believe the authors have done a good job mapping science on Wikipedia. However, I would like to suggest improvement about Table S1. Table S1 should include either mean/var of log-normal fit or exponent of power-law fit, with likelihood-ratio statistics of power-law model compared to log-normal model. Please be referred to</p><p>Clauset, Aaron, Cosma Rohilla Shalizi, and Mark EJ Newman. "Power-law distributions in empirical data." SIAM review 51.4 (2009): 661-703. pdf: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062">https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062</ext-link></p><p>for the rationales and methods for doing so. They also provide packages in R and Python.</p><p>This leads to suggestions about Figure 5. Since both distributions are skewed, R2 is not an appropriate. Pearson R assumes finite variances, which sometimes breaks down when variables are power-law distributed. While I believe the conclusion that the correlation is not large, it is important to use appropriate method to reach this conclusion in the paper. I suggest the following two approaches:</p><p>1. Use rank correlation, such as Spearman's Rho or Kendall's Tao.</p><p>2. Use QQ plot to support the finding of outliers. Quantiles (p-value) at each axis should be computed using the power-law/log-normal models fitted for Scopus citation distribution and Wikipedia citation distribution.</p><p>I believe suggestion 2 above can replace Figure 5, which is currently too disperse. But if Figure 5 needs to stay for any reason, it should be plotted in log-log scale. Be careful to not fit linear models in log-scale, because variances do not remain constant in log-scale. One should fit the models before log-transform, and then visualize the fitted lines in log-scale. Suggestion 2 avoids all these complications.</p><p>From suggestion 2, in fact, the authors can sort journals by the ratio of p-value of Wikipedia citation to that of Scopus under power-law models. The high-ratio journals are "over-cited" in Wikipedia, while the low-ratio journals are "under-cited", compared to Scopus as a baseline. I believe both the "over-cited" and "under-cited" ones worth some characterization and discussion. The authors may want to only look at journals with enough data to avoid noise in the ratio. Note that PLoS ONE and PNAS may not have the highest ratios, which suggests that the finding in the second paragraph of the result section may not be entirely correct.</p><p>This kind of comparison using ratio also applies in Figure 8. Looking at ratios, articles in the following fields gather more attentions in Wikipedia:</p><p>- Multidisciplinary</p><p>- Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology</p><p>- Agricultural and Biological Science</p><p>- Earth and Planetary Science</p><p>- Immunology and Microbiology</p><p>while the following fields are less popular in Wikipedia:</p><p>- Engineering</p><p>- Material Science</p><p>- Mathematics</p><p>- Chemistry</p><p>- Chemical Engineering</p><p>The less popular fields are all extremely hard, but steadily evolving sciences, which suggests that the limited ability of Wikipedia editors in comprehending articles in these fields restricted their ability to cite the articles. However, I have no empirical evidence nor reference to support this conjecture.</p><p>The field "Medicine" has roughly same percentages of attention in both Scopus and Wikipedia, despite the fact that it is the most popular field for both. This differs from the finding in the first paragraph of the result section.</p><p>As a side note, the authors also need to be careful when interpreting the correlation coefficients, which come with p-values. The size and significance of a correlation coefficient, while related, are not the same. The correlation can be small in size but statistically significant (e.g. huge sample and weak correlation), or large in size but not statistically significant (e.g. moderate correlation in a very small sample). For example, a correlation of 0.5, while statistically significant, means a sizable correlation. This correlation defines a pattern, then one can identify outlier points that do not obey this pattern.</p><p>Lastly, I would like to suggest the removal of the phrase "social perspective" throughout the paper. These is no analysis in this paper between the social aspect of Wikipedia editors and any of the finding. An example of such type of analysis can be the correlation of citation fields between editors who communicated in edit review, i.e. a social, communication network of editors. Merely co-edit of an entry does not imply any social interaction between the involved editors. While this paper is mapping science through the lens of Wikipedia, I have difficulty seeing how this mapping is done through social relations of editors.</p><p>After the first revision, I can see ithe structure of the paper and start to appreciate its contribution. Therefore I recommend a minor revision. After responding the comments above, I believe the paper is useful to other researchers and will make a significant impact in Wikipedia research.</p><p>Reviewer #2: All issues have been addressed, therefore I recommend acceptance for this particular manuscript. ====</p><p>**********</p><p>7.

</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s suggerence but we have not carried out our power-law analysis by fields as suggested to improve Table S1. We used journals&#x02019; citations to illustrate this phenomenon in Wikipedia without dividing them by areas or papers (each journal is one observation). However, the recommended R package is the same that we used in this analysis which now has been referenced.</p><p>29. Gillespie CS. Fitting Heavy Tailed Distributions: The poweRlaw Package. J Stat Softw [Internet]. 2015 Mar 20;64(2). Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v064.i02">http://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v064.i02</ext-link>
</p><p>Following the reviewer&#x02019;s recommendations about Figure 5 we have updated it with colors by the ratio of Wikipedia and Scopus citation percentiles, and also included Q-Q plot using the normal and log-normal models and Figure 5 in log-log scale as supplementary material. These two new figures have been obtained taking into account the reviewer&#x02019;s considerations. Furthermore, comments for both figures are included in results and discussion.</p><p>We appreciate the recommendation to analyse the ratio of Wikipedia and Scopus citations under log-normal/power-law models. For this reason the over-cited and under-cited journals have been determined. To calculate them we filtered the dataset to only journals with a minimum of 2 papers and 3 Wikipedia and Scopus cites to avoid noise and then we calculated the ratio using their citation percentiles. As result we have included:</p><p>&#x0201c;In this sense we have obtained the journals&#x02019; citation percentiles in Wikipedia and Scopus, using only journals with a minimum of three citations in both platforms and two articles cited to avoid noise, and then the ratio between these percentiles have been calculated. While the commented journals have the same attention (ratio=1), the over-cited ones in Wikipedia are Mammalian Species(3559), Art Journal (192.56), Northern History (126.92), European Journal of Taxonomy (83.92) and Art Bulletin (80.92), and the under-cited ones are Physical Review A - Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics, Dalton Transactions and Applied Surface Science (all of them with 0.00027).&#x0201d;</p><p>The reviewer is right, the ratio analysis is useful to study the Wikipedia attention by fields. In this sense, the ratio of Wikipedia and Scopus citations would complete the results related to Figure 8. However, we have the limitation of Scopus citations, that only cover some years and papers, so we can not compare these results to Figure 8 properly.</p><p>In relation with the correlation coefficient comments we have reviewed them. Furthermore, these explications have been completed with the comments included about outliers.</p><p>We have changed &#x0201c;social perspective&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Wikipedia perspective&#x0201d;.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0228713.s013"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0228713.s013.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0228713.r005" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0228713.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lozano</surname><given-names>Sergi</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Sergi Lozano</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Sergi Lozano</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj005" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0228713" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
