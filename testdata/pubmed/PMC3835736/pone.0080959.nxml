The development of tissue engineering techniques will bring new opportunities for bladder reconstruction <xref rid="pone.0080959-Atala1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. These techniques involve seeding biomaterial scaffolds with appropriate cells in the laboratory and implanting them in vivo to repair or regenerate damaged tissue <xref rid="pone.0080959-Atala2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Certain studies have reported that transplantation of biomaterial seeded with autologous urothelial and smooth muscle cells could allow for the regeneration of a functional bladder in several animal models <xref rid="pone.0080959-Oberpenning1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0080959-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the use of autologous cells from patients with invasive bladder cancer or neurogenic bladders may eventually result in the reoccurrence of a diseased bladder state and a decline in urodynamic function during treatment <xref rid="pone.0080959-Dozmorov1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, identifying a suitable cell source is a major challenge for cell therapy and tissue engineering. In addition to fulfilling the function of the reconstructed tissue, low immunogenicity is needed for clinical applications. Among the various types of cell sources, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have drawn attention because they are characterized as undifferentiated cells, they are able to self-renew with a high proliferative capacity, and they possess a mesodermal differentiation potential <xref rid="pone.0080959-Pittenger1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080959-Barry1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Currently, autologous adult MSCs, which can be easily harvested from various tissues such as bone marrow <xref rid="pone.0080959-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, adipose tissue <xref rid="pone.0080959-Zuk1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and muscle tissue <xref rid="pone.0080959-Yokoyama1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, have been the main source of MSCs. However, the use of autologous adult MSCs is not always acceptable due to the high degree of viral exposure and the significant decrease in the cell number and the proliferative/differentiation capacity with increasing age <xref rid="pone.0080959-Rubinstein1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080959-Fehrer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.Moreover, adult MSCs require painful invasive harvest; numbers are limited and their stem properties do not last for too long in vitro. Because of the disadvantages associated with autologous adult MSCs, it is essential to find an alternative source of MSCs.</p><p>In 2003, Mitchell et al. <xref rid="pone.0080959-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> reported the successful isolation of MSCs from porcine and human umbilical cord tissue by explant culture. Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) can also be differentiated into adipocytes, osteoblasts and smooth muscle cells <xref rid="pone.0080959-Karahuseyinoglu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0080959-Baksh1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Umbilical cords can be collected at a low cost and provide an inexhaustible source of stem cells. Substantial numbers of UMSCs can be harvested within several passages without the need for long-term culture and extensive expansion ex vivo <xref rid="pone.0080959-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Moreover, the harvesting procedure of UMSCs is not invasive or painful, there is no donor site morbidity, and there is no ethical controversy related to the harvest of the resident stem cells. More interestingly, preliminary studies have shown that UMSCs do not express MHC II molecules, and the expression of MHC I molecules is also low <xref rid="pone.0080959-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Furthermore, MSCs, which may have immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory effects, evoke only minimal immune reactivity <xref rid="pone.0080959-Nauta1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0080959-Yoo2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Clinically, the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs can be used to enhance engraftment and to reduce the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) after transplantation <xref rid="pone.0080959-Polchert1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore, UMSCs may become an ideal source of allogeneic cell transplantation.</p><p>The bladder acellular matrix grafts (BAMG) is collagen-based xenogenetic biomaterial <xref rid="pone.0080959-Merguerian1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. After a series of physical and chemical processes, the cells and antigens of the bladder can be eliminated, while their framework can be partly or completely retained. Therefore, BAMGs have good biocompatibility and reasonable mechanical strength, but they are associated with little or no immune rejection. Previous investigations have demonstrated the feasibility of using BAMGs for bladder reconstruction <xref rid="pone.0080959-Merguerian1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080959-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we isolated and cultured HUMSCs in vitro and seeded them onto BAMGs to repair bladder defects in a canine model.

In the sham group, the anterior aspect of the bladder was not resected. In the control group, the unseeded BAMG was sutured as a patch onto the dome of the bladder using running 5&#x02013;0 Vicryl sutures in 10 dogs.

In the experiment group, the HUMSCs-seeded BAMGs were sutured in the remaining 10 dogs using the same method and the cell-seeded side of scaffold faces to the bladder lumen during the surgery. The bladder was tested for leakage by instillation of saline solution. When anastomosis was satisfactory, the fascia, subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with absorbable sutures.

Orabi H et al. <xref rid="pone.0080959-Orabi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> reported that BAMGs combined with autologous cells resulted in the development of normal-appearing urethral tissue layers over time and can be used to repair long urethral defects, whereas scaffolds without cells lead to poor tissue development and strictures. These studies have shown the feasibility and effectiveness of using cell-seeded biodegradable materials to repair bladder defects in several animal models.</p><p>In the present study, HUMSCs were successfully isolated and cultivated. The isolated cells formed a morphologically homogeneous population of fibroblast-like cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the HUMSCs were positive for CD105 and CD44, but negative for CD34, CD31 and CD45, which is consistent with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0080959-Zhang3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080959-Batsali1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and suggests that these cells have a mesenchymal origin. We then tested the feasibility of using HUMSCs-seeded BAMGs to repair bladder defects in a canine model. A multilayered urothelium and well-developed smooth muscle were observed at 12 weeks in experiment group. In contrast, multilayered urothelial tissues were also observed at 12 weeks in control group, but well-developed smooth muscle bundles were observed. Therefore, our study showed that UMSC-seeded BAMGs provide better support for the formation of complete layers of urothelium as well as the regeneration of smooth muscle compared with unseeded BAMGs, indicating that HUMSCs can contribute to improving the regenerative capacity of tissue-engineered bladder.</p><p>Recently, a variety of synthetic and organic matrices used to reconstruct damaged bladders in animal models have been reported <xref rid="pone.0080959-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080959-Jack1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0080959-Salem1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In the present study, we selected BAMG as a biomaterial to reconstruct the bladder. BAMG is derived from bladder tissue, and as an acellular extracellular matrix, BAMG contains collagen, glycosamino-glycans, glycoproteins and many types of cytokines, such as FGF, TGF-&#x003b2;, BMP-4 and VEGF, that induce the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of cells and promote angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0080959-Chun1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Our previous studies indicated that BAMG consists mainly of collagen fibers, and it has good biocompatibility without cytotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0080959-Han1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. We therefore selected BAMG as a biomaterial for bladder reconstruction.</p><p>However, the mechanism of tissue-engineered bladder regeneration based on MSCs is unknown, and the role of HUMSCs in bladder regeneration has not been elucidated. The observed regeneration may be attributed to migration of the native bladder cells, or the implanted HUMSCs may differentiate into smooth muscle cells and urothelium in bladder microenvironment.</p><p>Our study only assessed the short-term effects of the use of a biomaterial scaffold. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the functional effects of the biomaterial scaffold for bladder reconstruction. Additionally, further research should be performed to explore whether HUMSCs are superior to the other MSCs for regeneration of the bladder.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our preliminary results demonstrate that HUMSCs-seeded BAMGs are superior to unseeded BAMGs to promote the regeneration of bladder defects. Our findings indicated that HUMSCs may be a potential cell source for bladder tissue engineering.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0080959-Duel1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
