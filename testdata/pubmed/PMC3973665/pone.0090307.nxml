This study aimed to quantitatively investigate the short- and long-range fibers, and their differential roles in the lower cognitive efficiency in aging and dementia. Three groups of healthy young, healthy older adults and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) participated in this combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study on prospective memory (PM). Short- and long-range fiber tracts within the PM task engaged brain networks were generated. The correlation between the fMRI signal change, PM performance and the DTI characters were calculated. FMRI results showed that the PM-specific frontal activations in three groups were distributed hierarchically along the rostrocaudal axis in the frontal lobe. In an overall PM condition generally activated brain network among the three groups, tractography was used to generate the short-range fibers, and they were found impaired in both healthy older adults and AD patients. However, the long-range fiber tracts were only impaired in AD. Additionally, the mean diffusivity (MD) of short-range but not long-range fibers was positively correlated with fMRI signal change and negatively correlated with the efficiency of PM performance. This study suggests that the disintegrity of short-range fibers may contribute more to the lower cognitive efficiency and higher compensatory brain activation in healthy older adults and more in AD patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by Stanley Ho Alumni Challenge Fund (20810027 &#x00026; 20731020) awarded to Professor R.T.F.

Numerous functional connectivity studies have found that the brain has both high local clustering coefficiency and optimal global integration, similar to a small-world network <xref rid="pone.0090307-Gallos1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Bassett1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Only a few studies have explored the relationships of structural connectivity and functional activity <xref rid="pone.0090307-Hagmann1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A developmental study found that white matter connectivity supports brain-wide coherence and synchrony <xref rid="pone.0090307-Hagmann1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Another study showed decoupling between functional and structural connectivity in Schizophrenia patients <xref rid="pone.0090307-Skudlarski1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These studies indicated that combining functional and structural neuroimaging studies can more comprehensively assess the altered brain connectivity in different clinical conditions <xref rid="pone.0090307-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Parallel with the division of clustering and global integration in functional connectivity study, the structural connectivity can further be divided into regional short-range fibers that specified for local connectivity and long-range fiber for more global connectivity <xref rid="pone.0090307-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090307-Shukla1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. For example, short-range fibers mainly include the local associative fibers (U-shaped) connecting intraterritorial connections and neighborhood association fibers connecting adjacent areas <xref rid="pone.0090307-Yeterian1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Given that the intrinsic functional connectivity is disrupted in dementia <xref rid="pone.0090307-Supekar1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, it is plausible that the impairment of short- and long-range fibers may play important roles in the lower cognitive efficiency in aging and dementia.</p><p>The structural and functional interaction between brain regions gives rise to cognition, and the quality of interaction change with normal and pathological aging <xref rid="pone.0090307-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The complexity of brain connectivity makes it susceptible to the effect of aging and diseases, such as the Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common dementia in clinics <xref rid="pone.0090307-Jagust1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Both structural connectivity and functional connectivity are impaired in advanced aging <xref rid="pone.0090307-Pfefferbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. For example, Voineskos et al. found that the microstructural integrity of major fasciculus continues to decline during the lifespan from the age 20 s to 80 s, and specific white matter degeneration may account for different age-related cognitive decline <xref rid="pone.0090307-Voineskos1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The impairments are more advanced in AD, which is regarded as a disconnection syndrome <xref rid="pone.0090307-Vallet1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Delbeuck1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. DTI may also help to assess the modifying effect of pharmacological interventions on AD <xref rid="pone.0090307-Kilimann1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Keihaninejad1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A multicenter DTI study reported that cingulate bundle is impaired in probable AD when compared to healthy controls, using automated tractography <xref rid="pone.0090307-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Nonetheless, few multi-modal neuroimaging studies have investigated the aging process, including both normal and pathological aging. The different roles of short- and long-range fibers in these aging processes were never explored. To solve the aforementioned problems, we chose to examine an important cognitive function, the prospective memory (PM). PM represents the ability to remember something to be executed in the future, e.g, to see a doctor or to take medicine before sleep <xref rid="pone.0090307-Duchek1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. There has been a surge of interest in PM research, since PM performance is related to executive function <xref rid="pone.0090307-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and critical to the independence in daily living <xref rid="pone.0090307-Graf1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, especially in the vulnerable populations including old adults and those with AD <xref rid="pone.0090307-Huppert1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Some studies have shown that PM is impaired in older adults <xref rid="pone.0090307-Huppert1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Uttl1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, whereas others found little age-related decline in PM <xref rid="pone.0090307-Einstein1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-McDaniel1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This inconsistence may be caused by different PM paradigms or different strategies adopted by the individuals <xref rid="pone.0090307-McDaniel1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. On the other hand, there is consistent evidence of PM deficit in AD patients, and PM could be more impaired than retrospective memory <xref rid="pone.0090307-Huppert1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-BlancoCampal1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>Previous neuroimaging studies on PM using only young subjects have shown that a network of brain regions is involved in PM task performance <xref rid="pone.0090307-Simons1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090307-Rusted1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, including the frontal-parietal regions, the precuneus, the supplementary motor area, etc. <xref rid="pone.0090307-Simons1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Although a number of behavioral studies have shown PM impairment in aging and AD <xref rid="pone.0090307-Farina1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090307-Delprado1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, neuroimaging study on the old adults and AD patients to explore the neural correlates of PM impairment is rare <xref rid="pone.0090307-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Farias1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, given the obvious difficulty for them to accomplish the task in the scanner. A better understanding on neural correlates in PM task may help to design appropriate neurorehabilitation strategies for the vulnerable population <xref rid="pone.0090307-White1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>This neuroimaging study aimed to investigate the brain regions supporting PM function with a broader range of population including healthy young adults, healthy older adults and AD patients as a continuum. This design would enable greater power to explore the correlation between structural connectivity with cognitive function. The hypothesis was that the integrity of structural connectivity among the PM activated brain regions may be impaired in older adults, and this impairment could be correlated with their lower efficiency in PM task performance. Inspired by the division of local clustering and global integrity, we would separately explore the integrity of short- and long-range fibers in structural connectivity analysis, as they might contribute differentially to lower cognitive efficiency in aging and AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>The research protocol was approved by Institutional Review Board in Queen Mary Hospital, and it was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Revisions were made so that the healthy older adults and AD patients could successfully perform the task inside the MRI scanner. The PM task had two conditions: an ongoing condition as the baseline, and a PM condition interpolated with PM trials. The ongoing condition was always performed first and contained only ongoing trials, which had a green dot in the center of the screen together with a black arrowhead below (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0090307-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The subjects were instructed to press the right index finger for a leftward arrow, and the right middle finger for a rightward arrow, as quickly and accurately as possible. In the separate PM condition, there were ongoing trails as well, but PM trials (22%) were interpolated with ongoing trials. In the PM trials, a red dot was in the center instead, and the subjects were instructed to only press the left index finger regardless of the arrowhead direction.

The normalized images were then spatially smoothed using a full-width half maximum (FWHM) three-dimensional Gaussian kernel of 10 mm. In first-level analysis, standard general linear model (GLM) was applied for modeling and inference of the statistical mapping to get contrasts between action and rest, i.e., between blocks of ongoing trials and rest in session 1, and between blocks of PM trials plus ongoing trials and rest in session 2.

Nonetheless, the positions were different and distributed along the rostrocaudal axis of the frontal lobe: The activation was at pars triangular region of the left inferior frontal lobe in AD patients, a more rostral region. In the healthy older and young adults, it was near the pars operculus regions and the dorsal part of premotor area, respectively. These are more caudal regions of the frontal lobe. This finding is extraordinary as PM-specific activation in the frontal lobe was found to vary only with different PM paradigms <xref rid="pone.0090307-Burgess2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, while in the present study, a same PM task induced different frontal activation in subjects with different cognitive capacity. When directly comparing the frontal activation among the groups, the AD patients still had high activation in the left frontal inferior orbitalis and pars triangular region than the healthy older adults. These activations were in more rostral part of the frontal lobe. This distribution of frontal activation in three groups is in line with the cognitive hierarchy in the frontal lobe <xref rid="pone.0090307-Badre1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0090307-Jeon1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.</p><p>According to this assumption, the conflicts induced by cognitive task performance may be processed and organized hierarchically in the frontal lobe, especially the prefrontal cortex <xref rid="pone.0090307-Badre1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Badre2" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. A more rostral region responses to a cognitive task which is more uncertain or abstractive, whereas a more caudal region responses to more concrete task. The rostrocaudal axis in the prefrontal cortex may represent a hierarchical system of cognitive control <xref rid="pone.0090307-Badre1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Fuster1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, which is important to PM task <xref rid="pone.0090307-Uretzky1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Thus, the rostral frontal activation of AD patients may imply that they could confront a more complex situation when reconfigurating the attention in PM task set, and the induced conflict may need a more abstractive strategy to deal with. On the other hand, more caudal frontal activations of the healthy young and older adults indicate that they had less uncertainty, and the performance might be more concrete for them and need less cognitive control during the PM task. This assumption can be partly examined by the behavioral data of increased PM interference effect on ongoing trial in AD patients. The interpolated PM trial made the subject constantly pay additional attention to them even when doing ongoing task and cause cognitive conflict <xref rid="pone.0090307-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The increased PM interference time in AD patient reflects their higher cognitive conflict than other groups when performing PM task. Together with fMRI data of hierarchical distribution of the frontal activation elicited, our results indicated that there were increasingly higher cognitive conflict and demand of better cognitive control of PM task in healthy older adults especially AD patients <xref rid="pone.0090307-Stern1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Case1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. The impaired PM task in AD may be attributed to their structural degeneration in key brain regions like the hippocampus, the frontal lobe, etc.. For example, PM impairment was found to correlate with stereotypical behaviors in frontotemporal dementia <xref rid="pone.0090307-Kamminga1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Structural connectivity in brain network supporting PM task</title><p>The function of the network interacting is based on the structural connectivity.

FMRI data showed that although the frontal lobe plays a vital role in cognitive control, other brain regions were also found to support the PM task, including the precuneus (BA 7), the left inferior parietal lobe (BA 40), the thalamus, the supplementary motor area, etc. This is largely in line with previous fMRI studies on PM <xref rid="pone.0090307-Uttl1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-McDaniel1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Simons1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

A unique finding in the present study was that only the short-range fibers were vulnerable to aging effect, whereas the long-range fibers were more resistant. The short-range fibers are less myelinated, whereas the long-range fibers have thicker myelination which better insulates and protects the neuron and axon <xref rid="pone.0090307-Catani1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Desai1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. In contrast, both short- and long-range fibers were impaired in AD patients. The pathological changes in AD could accelerate myelination degradation. Recent animal studies showed oligodendrocyte/myelin pathology in AD, and the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) may further disrupt the white matter connectivity <xref rid="pone.0090307-Desai1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. These pathological changes may affect not only the less myelinated fibers, also the long-range fibers with thick myelination. These findings of impaired short-range fibers and long-range fibers may support the functional connectivity studies which reported both lower local clustering <xref rid="pone.0090307-Supekar1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and impaired global integrity in AD <xref rid="pone.0090307-SanzArigita1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Correlations between structural connectivity, functional activation and cognitive efficiency</title><p>The overall reaction time in PM condition was positively correlated with the mean diffusivity of the short-range fibers instead of the long-range fibers. This indicated that the information-processing efficiency in PM may be more related to the integrity of short-range fibers. It has important implication on the effort of isolating a central bottleneck of information processing, i.e., the bottleneck may posit in the local information processing rather than more global information integration which needs long-range fibers <xref rid="pone.0090307-Dux1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Since phase synchronization and neuronal synchrony is essential for conscious and cognitive processing <xref rid="pone.0090307-Siegel1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, degradation of short-range fibers in aging and AD may lead to lower regional conduction velocity. This may delay the local high-frequency gamma band oscillation, and affect the information encoding efficiency <xref rid="pone.0090307-Donner1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>.</p><p>The brain activation was also found to be more associated with the integrity of short-range fibers instead of long-range fibers. The more impairment in short-range fibers, the greater fMRI activation. Recent studies have revealed the coupling between fMRI activation and local electronic oscillation <xref rid="pone.0090307-Donner1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090307-Maier1" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, and cognitive performance can increase the coupling in brain regions engaged by the task <xref rid="pone.0090307-Sepulcre1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. The impairment of local connectivity in the older adults and AD patients may contribute to lower processing efficiency and correspondently, higher compensative neuronal activity. Similarly, a previous fMRI study on cognitive efficiency found that the slow performers have more frontal activation than the fast performers <xref rid="pone.0090307-Rypma1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>.</p><p>One limitation in this study was that DTI measure at sites of crossing-fibers may not be accurate as the sites with paralleling fibers. Diffusion spectrum diffusion may resolve the problem, while it generally takes a long time to scan and AD patient may not endure. The present DTI data have only one B0 image, so it may be susceptible to noise, whereas diffusion kurtosis image can be more sensitive to neural degeneration <xref rid="pone.0090307-Kamagata1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Another limitation is that the number of subjects in each group could have been higher. This was partly due to the considerable difficulty to recruit AD patients to successfully perform the PM task during the MRI scanning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this combined fMRI and tractography study on aging and AD, we found that both healthy older adults and AD patients could perform the present PM paradigm successfully, but with lower cognitive efficiency and higher brain activations as compensation. Interestingly, the frontal activation of groups with different cognitive efficiency was arranged along the rostrocaudal-axis in the frontal lobe. This fMRI results together with increased PM interference in AD patients indicate that they may confront higher levels of conflict and need different strategies during PM task performance. Structural connectivity data demonstrated that the cognitive efficiency of the PM task performance among groups was more related to the disintegrity of short-range fibers. The latter was also correlated with the increased brain activation. It is suggested that the disintegrity of short-range fibers or local integrity may contribute to the lower cognitive efficiency and higher compensatory brain activation in healthy older adults and more in AD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0090307.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
