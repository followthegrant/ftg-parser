This transition requires evasion of the immune response and the ability to exploit different niches within the host. However, the disease mechanisms and the dominant immune mediators against infection are poorly understood. Previously it has been shown that the infecting <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> population goes through a population bottleneck, from which very few bacteria escape to establish the abscesses that are characteristic of many infections. Here we examine the host factors underlying the population bottleneck and subsequent clonal expansion in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection models, to identify underpinning principles of infection. The bottleneck is a common feature between models and is independent of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strain. Interestingly, the high doses of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> required for the widely used &#x0201c;survival&#x0201d; model results in a reduced population bottleneck, suggesting that host defences have been simply overloaded. This brings into question the applicability of the survival model. Depletion of immune mediators revealed key breakpoints and the dynamics of systemic infection. Loss of macrophages, including the liver Kupffer cells, led to increased sensitivity to infection as expected but also loss of the population bottleneck and the spread to other organs still occurred. Conversely, neutrophil depletion led to greater susceptibility to disease but with a concomitant maintenance of the bottleneck and lack of systemic spread. We also used a novel microscopy approach to examine abscess architecture and distribution within organs. From these observations we developed a conceptual model for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> disease from initial infection to mature abscess. This work highlights the need to understand the complexities of the infectious process to be able to assign functions for host and bacterial components, and why <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> disease requires a seemingly high infectious dose and how interventions such as a vaccine may be more rationally developed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a major human pathogen that causes a wide variety of infections. In animal infection models, high doses of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> are generally required to establish infections.

Here we have shown that this bottleneck is common to a range of different <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> types and infection models. The mouse survival model is commonly used for testing antistaphylococcal treatments. We show that the large infectious dose it requires diminishes the bacterial population bottleneck. This suggests the host immune system is simply overwhelmed and brings into question the applicability of such a model. We found that both macrophages and neutrophils are important for resistance to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection but these affect the population bottleneck differently. Macrophages in the liver mediate the initial population bottleneck whereas neutrophils enable the subsequent spread of bacteria to other organs.

The diversity of disease modalities has made an understanding of the underlying principles of infection challenging. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> primarily occurs as a human commensal, mostly in the nares from whence it is able to seed infection. Many <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections are iatrogenic, and these are commonly associated with the colonisation of indwelling medical devices [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Typically during an infection, after invasion, an immune reaction is initiated by macrophages and these release cytokines to summon neutrophils [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Fibrosis also occurs, as well as the death of many of the invading immune cells leading to the pus filled abscesses associated with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> can also regularly escape local infection sites and disseminate further. If it enters the bloodstream this can lead to sepsis as well as invasion of other organs whereby further local infections can occur. Thus <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection is a highly dynamic process with broad dissemination and repeated metastases.</p><p>Phagocytosis by professional phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils is the primary mode by which <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is controlled by the immune system. However, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> has multiple mechanisms to subvert the immune response [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], including the production of a variety of specific toxins, the ability to survive intracellularly within immune cells and the capacity to evade capture by phagocytes. As <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is effectively ubiquitous in the human environment, our immune systems are exposed to this organism as evidenced by the significant bloodstream titre of antibodies against a variety of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> antigens [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], however these do not necessarily afford protection against infection. It is therefore the subject of much debate as to what are the key immune factors that control <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> due to the variety of possible infections as well as the many immune components involved [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is of great translational importance as the correlates of protection against infection will determine crucial developments such as a vaccine to prevent disease [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In order to develop the knowledge base to underpin such an intervention it is necessary to first understand the correlates of disease, which in itself is dependent on mapping disease progression from initial infection to resolution in favour of the host or the pathogen.</p><p>To understand the factors that are important for disease progression it is first necessary to determine the population, spatial and temporal dynamics of the infectious agent within the host. This will highlight the immune breakpoints through which the pathogen must pass to achieve a productive infection. A key way to demonstrate this has been through the creation of multiple tagged variant strains of the pathogen of equivalent fitness and passaging them, at specific ratios, through the relevant host model of disease [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Subsequent analysis of overall pathogen numbers and the ratios of the tagged strains allows determination of the within host population dynamics. Coupling this with temporal and spatial (specific organ) analysis provides a map of the spread and proliferation of the infectious agent, and highlights the potential for population bottlenecks from which clonal expansion may occur. In model animal systems this can also be combined with the manipulation of the host and/or pathogen to determine the role of multiple factors in disease. This type of study has been very revealing for a range of pathogens such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We have used this approach with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> to demonstrate a population bottleneck during systemic infection in murine and zebrafish embryo models [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An initial discovery in the zebrafish model was used to inform the design of murine experiments. Using an intravenous administration of a mix of 3 antibiotic resistance marker tagged <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> Newman HG (NewHG) clones it was found that the bacteria are initially largely sequestered in the liver and spleen. Bacterial numbers subsequently slowly decreased in the liver with concomitant increasing numbers in the kidneys. In the liver and spleen the initial ratio of strains is apparent but surprisingly there is a significant alteration in strain ratio in the kidneys consistent with individual bacteria founding the characteristic abscesses [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This clonal expansion increases in all organs during infection but is most pronounced in the kidneys. These results show that a population bottleneck can occur in the mouse alluding to a metastatic spread of bacteria from a primary site of infection to the kidneys. In zebrafish, manipulation of professional phagocytes demonstrated the population bottleneck to be likely neutrophil mediated (with the involvement of macrophages)[<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since it is mediated by immune cells we would also define this population bottleneck as an immune bottleneck. This provides an initial framework onto which to map within host population dynamics and the influence of host immune defences.</p><p>The basis for key developments in our understanding of disease relies on the use of animal models, the aim of which is to reflect facets of human disease. There are a multiplicity of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection models available, ranging from insects (e.g. <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x00026; <italic>Galleria</italic>), to zebrafish and mammals (e.g. mice and rabbits) [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Mammalian models are considered the most apposite for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections as they share several important characteristics with humans, for instance body temperature, innate and adaptive immune systems and disease pathology. However mammalian models typically require a high initial inoculum to ensure disease initiation and many <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> virulence determinants are human specific [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consequently, it is difficult to equate animal model data with the human situation, particularly in the translational context where for instance, despite promising animal model data, vaccine trials have failed in the clinic [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Given these caveats, animal models are still important conduits for discovery of basic disease parameters. However it is important to evaluate the relative merits of the available models before relying on them to make useful conclusions.</p><p>In this study we have used 3 models of systemic disease: firstly the zebrafish model to provide initial data to inform murine studies and then the mouse sepsis and survival models (15, 18&#x02013;20). The sepsis model is well established and gives a clear progression of bacterial population dynamics [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The survival model has been standard for many studies and is fundamentally similar to the sepsis model in that bacteria are commonly injected in to the bloodstream. However the dose is relatively much higher to cause the subjects to succumb to infection rather than survive and resolve as in the sepsis model [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The survival, or lethal challenge model, has been in general use and is of regulatory importance [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Each marked variant was equally likely to predominate (group variation was not significantly different, Bartlett&#x02019;s test for equal variance USA300: p = 0.1252, Newman: p = 0.2364), demonstrating that there were no relative fitness costs associated with the individual antibiotic resistance markers which would undermine the analysis [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007112.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The proportion of the different strains was used to generate the species evenness index for the population [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which defines how evenly matched different populations of organisms are within an environment. A population evenness of 1 for a given population (whether it was a host or organ) means the strain variants are evenly distributed (1:1:1 ratio) whereas 0 means the entire population consists of one strain variant. We chose the population evenness metric as it is a commonly accepted in ecological studies [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Our samples inherently had these properties as the populations varied from evenly mixed to completely dominated by 1 variant.</p><p>We found that the variants which randomly came to predominate readily occurred in both the Newman and USA300 infected hosts, i.e. the population evenness of the injected population started at near 1 and became 0 over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007112.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

Between 2 and 18 hours there is a drop in the CFU and after this a great variation in liver colonisation became apparent (from clearance to 10<sup>8</sup>). Over time for all strains the liver showed a significant decrease in population evenness, unlike the kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007112.g003">Fig 3</xref>, linear regression, SH1000: p = 0.0076, F = 9.018, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.3338, NewHG: p = 0.0004, F = 18.82, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5254, Newman: P&#x0003c;0.0001, F = 73.82, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.8040 and USA300: p = 0.0001, F = 24.47, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5901).

However they are extremely variable both in terms of occurrence and CFU within treatment groups and between strains (lower levels of kidney infection are seen in SH1000 and Newman but greater coverage is seen in USA 300 and New HG). This indicates that the kidney is likely a key site for abscess development but the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> that initiated infection in this organ have metastasised from (an)other infection site(s). This occurs after the immune bottleneck, for such variation to occur. This is further intimated to by clonality in the kidneys sampled at the various time points during the experiments not fundamentally altering (unlike in the liver). The variation in how many kidneys are infected and also how frequently one kidney is infected but the other is not further points to the population bottleneck being elsewhere.

The lightsheet microscopy additionally showed (beyond the details revealed by histology) that within abscesses the solid aggregates in the kidneys were following the structure of kidney tubules in the cortex whilst the neutrophil infiltration sites were outside the tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007112.g005">Fig 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007112.s008">S1</xref> Video). This would not have been demonstrated by histology alone. Based on these observations it seems likely the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is trapped in the tubules, grows into solid aggregates and then some can subsequently escape into the regions between the tubules where neutrophils engage the bacteria. Even in infected organs that contain abscesses that overall are formed from more than one marked strain, there is a clear differential distribution of clones suggesting that pervasive abscesses which have multiple foci are seeded from a single bacterium which has divided and spread to form extended foci of infection in the surrounding tissue.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Population dynamics in the survival model</title><p>The mouse survival model has been used widely to test the efficacy of novel treatments, prophylaxis and the role of bacterial and host factors in disease [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is technically similar to the mouse sepsis model but primarily differs in that an increased dose is given leading to mortality as a primary output. Strains NewHG, Newman, SH1000 and USA300 were compared using the survival model. For all strains a high inoculum was used (around 1x10<sup>8</sup> CFU except USA300 which is similarly lethal at a lower dose of 3x10<sup>7</sup> CFU), made up of equal proportions of the 3 antibiotic resistant marked variants in each case (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007112.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007112.s003">S3</xref>). Infection became systemic in every subject, with bacteria across multiple organs, and typically resulted in mouse cull within 2&#x02013;3 days. Clonality (low population evenness) was much rarer at these high doses in all organs, in all subjects, and across all 4 bacterial strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007112.g006">Fig 6</xref>). It was also notable that the hearts, lungs and spleens now had high numbers of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. To determine whether the sepsis and survival model were ends of a spectrum or independent of each other, intermediate doses of the strains were administered to delay, and reduce, the number of subjects reaching the morbidity endpoint (for all strains around 3x10<sup>7</sup> CFU except USA300 which is similarly lethal at a lower dose of 1x10<sup>7</sup> CFU). This resulted in a lower rate of mortality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007112.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), with those subjects culled up to and including day 5 having more systemic infections, whereas after this time only the liver and kidneys had bacterial loads as the infection resolves. Lower dose survival treatments had much greater levels of clonality than the equivalent higher dose survival treatment. Both kidneys are more frequently concurrently infected as well.

There are multiple animal models of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection that all aim to recapitulate those events that shape the interaction between the pathogen and the human host. However, increasingly there is evidence that many of the virulence determinants are human specific and thus are not relevant to the widely used animal models. Also the route and mode of human infection is difficult to replicate in models. Murine models of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection are commonplace and have been one of the main tools in developing our understanding of the disease processes. Models of sepsis (bacteraemia) are well-established and are characterised by kidney abscesses as a primary outcome [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Establishment of sepsis requires a high inoculum as is apparent in other murine models. This has been suggested to be due to a bolus of bacteria being required to initiate disease [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recently we have shown that, in fact, there is a population bottleneck whereby likely single bacteria found kidney abscesses [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This therefore requires an explanation as to what the series of events that precedes abscess formation are, and the mechanism(s) involved. The individual bacteria that found lesions occur randomly from the population in that they do not have a genetic advantage [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus the initiation of abscesses is a stochastic event that is enhanced by a large inoculum. Here we aimed to investigate within-host population dynamics and determine the cellular basis of bottlenecks in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection models.</p><p>The temporal and spatial dynamics of sepsis in zebrafish and murine models have been determined using sets of marked strains in a range of backgrounds. This enabled a model for the dynamics of infection in the mouse to be established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007112.g008">Fig 8</xref>). We found for all strains that the liver was the key destination organ for the initial mixed population inoculum. Previously <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> has been shown to be phagocytosed by Kupffer cells in the liver and these form a primary immunological defence (2, 22). Subsequently expansion of individual clones occurs in the liver or the bacterial load is cleared. Kupffer cells are effective agents for the control of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> but if this immunological bottleneck fails then bacteria are able to grow to form abscesses. Depletion of Kupffer cells results in greatly increased host susceptibility to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection manifested by abscesses mostly in the livers, but also in the kidneys. Kidney abscesses develop during the infection but these organs are not an initial colonisation site. Interestingly kidneys do not have mixed populations that then become clonal but rather this happens at abscess initiation suggesting that they are founded by single organisms or that the founders were already clonal. Given the complex population dynamics in the liver we suggest that it is the transfer of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> from the liver that gives rise to kidney colonisation. But how therefore do the bacteria traffic between organs? A clue to this comes from the generation of neutropenia within the mouse. Interestingly loss of neutrophils results in no loss of clonality within the liver. Thus the neutrophils are not the primary bottleneck within the liver. However, subsequent abscess formation was abrogated within the kidneys. The importance of neutrophils for dissemination correlates with other research that shows that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> can live intracellularly within phagosomes and be transported by them in the blood, forming a mobile reservoir to infect other organs [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Also, treatment with antibiotics that do not penetrate the neutrophil phagosome do not prevent internal dissemination of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, conventionally neutrophils that mature and enter infected tissue do not re-enter the blood stream [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The most parsimonious explanation is that neutrophils that are already circulating in the blood (whose population greatly increases in response to infection) take up <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> that escape into the blood stream from the lesions in the liver. This could be due to abscesses/microlesions shedding <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> into the blood stream, as is known to occur in clinical infections [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><fig id="ppat.1007112.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007112.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>A model of the internal transmission of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>.</title><p>With a high inoculum the host is rapidly overwhelmed by a systemic infection.

However a few <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> survive and are able to form viable extracellular microlesions. Local neutrophils are recruited to aid in their control. As the abscess develops some <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> can likely escape into the blood. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> can then seed the kidneys that can then go on to form large clonal abscesses.

Liver CFU provides a useful adjunct to kidney numbers. It might seem surprising that a kidney with many apparent surface abscesses could in fact be seeded by an individual founder. It is also important to note that it is unlikely that apparently clonal organs are founded by multiple bacteria of the same type as left and right kidneys are often clonal but with different clones. In order to determine how a single organism could establish a disseminated abscess throughout a kidney we began to map the 3D architecture of the abscess. We developed two methods to address this conundrum. Serial organ sectioning revealed foci of infection with the characteristic abscess structure of infiltration of phagocytes but these extended throughout the kidney forming a seemingly linked series of lesions. Organ clearing is a new approach to study infecting organisms within host tissue and here it revealed a pervasive spread of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> as solid aggregates within cortex tubules and as diffuse groupings with infiltration of phagocytes outside these tubules [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>The scheme presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007112.g008">Fig 8</xref> suggests the presence of two immunological bottlenecks within the murine sepsis model. Firstly, at the level of Kupffer cells in the liver and then at the neutrophils when disseminating from the liver. Zebrafish embryos do not have Kupffer cells at the time of infection. In the zebrafish the population bottleneck occurs in the phagocytes but is mainly believed to be due to the neutrophils[<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our mouse models therefore apparently diverge from the zebrafish model on the relative importance of the two major classes of professional phagocytes. This study provides data that phagocytes present a key breakpoint during infection in that these cells are absolutely required for host resistance but also permit proliferation as &#x0201c;Trojan Horses&#x0201d; as has been previously proposed [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The question arises however as to whether this hypothesis translates into a human infection both in terms of the immune system and the occurrence of population bottlenecks. The murine sepsis model shares several characteristics that are known to occur within human infections such as how <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> can disseminate in the blood stream to different organs from an initial infection site and the formation of localised abscesses in separate organs.</p><p>It is known that professional phagocytes are key to controlling <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections but that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> can also hide intracellularly [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. What we have found correlates with human infections. In our model both neutrophils and macrophages are important for controlling <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection and the same is true in humans as shown by various genetic disorders in these can result in increased <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This is however more commonly associated with neutrophil disorders (which may reflect how macrophages are generally less dispensable as they are required for tissue development and homeostasis).</p><p>One particular point is that our model shows that the liver is the site of the primary bottleneck. Generally, in humans, the liver is not a site particularly associated with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection (compared to soft tissue infections or deep infections such as osteomyelitis) so it would seem unlikely it would have the same role in humans. However, patients with chronic granulomatous disease (lacking the respiratory burst part of phagocytosis) have a particularly high risk of staphylococcal liver abscesses [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This implies that in normal people <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> can be cleared from the liver as a normal process, which would be by the action of Kupffer cells, the resident professional phagocytes. Our results suggest that the killing activity of macrophages on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> should be worthy of further study but also the ability of neutrophils to transfer <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> between organs should also be of great interest as has been shown by other methods [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Genome studies have shown that there are repeated genetic population bottlenecks and that these occur both during transmission and the shift from colonisation to disease [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In human infections, population bottlenecks would be interacting with the inherent variation of the naturally colonising <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> population as infections tend to be derived from the previous resident <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The existence of stochastic niches and resource limitation (here access to host nutrients) according to ecological studies are intrinsically supposed to maintain increased population diversity particularly if they are better at competing for different resources [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Population bottlenecks, as the host is infected, would form stochastic niches and the exact site would exert different selection pressures. They could therefore work to maintain population diversity and increased strain divergence as the population bottleneck would randomly exclude different subpopulations upon each infection. This may be reflected in the diversity of virulence factors that different strains of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> possess and the maintenance of different clones of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Population bottlenecks would also favour variants that are better at getting through it rather than selecting for mutants fitter after subsequent diversification. This concurs with the diversity seen in Young during colonisation and the more limited subsequent diversification [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>A population bottleneck results in a notable distribution of the observable population. There are members of the administered dose that pass through and come to dominate the population and then there are those that are excluded, which ultimately means there tends to be two groups of data: mixed populations that have not yet passed through the bottleneck and populations that have become, or are rapidly becoming, clonal (as one strain is expanding relative to the others). This can be seen in our data as organs with a mixed population with all 3 strains present and organs with clonal populations. It is reasonable to make assessments based on the proportion of a population that was mixed or clonal as we have done but it would be much harder to assess if one population was becoming clonal more quickly than another (e.g. if one strain or another was better at expanding out of the macrophage bottleneck).</p><p>Population bottlenecks during infection represent key breakpoints for interventions. Despite apparent success in animal models, vaccine development for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> has not translated into successful human trials [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Active vaccination is by its nature prophylaxis and thus the target should be to prevent the ability of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> to pass through bottlenecks and proliferate. The knowledge that intracellular organisms form this nexus within phagocytes provides a key parameter from which to design future vaccine formulations. Recent evidence highlighting the targeting of intraphagocytic <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> supports such an approach [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This is consistent with what has been found previously, in that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> can survive within neutrophils; and treating mice with antibiotics that do not affect intracellular <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> does not prevent dissemination [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Our work, as well as highlighting the cellular locations of immunological bottlenecks also sheds light on the role of the infectious dose on the outcome of infection and the population dynamics therein. The survival challenge model is a standard in the field and has been used in many studies [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Measuring population dynamics within this model showed a clear diminution of population bottlenecks correlating with an increased infectious dose leading to host morbidity. High infectious doses result in systemic infections across all major organs. The relevance of this model is therefore bought into question as clearly those immunological processes that control the dynamics of infection have been overwhelmed. This observation is therefore of great importance for the design of intervention studies where one is modelling human infection and not uncontrolled bacteraemia. Using lower doses is more realistic as well as allowing population bottlenecks to occur as infectious doses of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> are likely to be inherently lower in humans compared to our mouse models. In Grice et al punch biopsies were used which gave total bacterial numbers of at least 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/cm<sup>2</sup>[<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In a study of vascular catheters, a range of bacteria were found with numbers up to 10<sup>7</sup> CFU [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In a given infection it is likely that only a fraction of these would be able to disseminate from the skin or implant. This is reflected in bacteraemia where the count is typically &#x0003c;10 CFU per ml [<xref rid="ppat.1007112.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The number of bacteria that can transfer to infect organs is much less than &#x0003e;5 x 10<sup>7</sup> CFU per ml murine blood if 10<sup>8</sup> CFU is injected (assuming 1.5 ml of blood per 25g mouse).</p><p>The threat of antimicrobial resistance to human healthcare is real and increasing.
