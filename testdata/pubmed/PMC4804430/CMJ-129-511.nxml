In the current study, longitudinal changes in multi-focal electroretinogram (mfERG) responses, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) were evaluated in eyes with large MHs managed by this technique.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>A prospective noncontrolled interventional study of eight patients (eight eyes) with large MHs (minimum diameter &#x0003e;400 &#x003bc;m) was conducted. All MHs were treated with pars plana vitrectomy and indocyanine green-assisted inverted ILM flap technique. SD-OCT images were used to assess the anatomical outcomes of surgery while BCVA and mfERG were used to evaluate the functional outcomes during a 3-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>All patients underwent successful intended manipulation and translocation of the ILM flap without flap dislocation and achieved complete anatomical closure. Partial microstructural reconstruction, demonstrated on SD-OCT as restoration of the external limiting membrane and the ellipsoid zone, was observed in all cases as early as 1 month after surgery. Functionally, as compared to baseline, all patients showed improvements in BCVA and all but one in mfERG response during follow-up. However, Pearson's test revealed no significant correlations between BCVA and mfERG responses of the fovea and of the macular area at each evaluation time point.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Inverted ILM flap technique appeares to be a safe and effective approach for the management of large idiopathic MHs with favorable short-term anatomical and functional results. Postoperative reconstruction of the microstructure generally shows good consistency with improvements in both BCVA and mfERG response, of which the latter might be a supplement for the former in postoperative functional follow-up.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Inverted Internal Limiting Membrane Flap Technique</kwd><kwd>Large Macular Hole</kwd><kwd>Multi-focal Electroretinogram</kwd><kwd>Spectral-domain Optical Coherence Tomography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>A macular hole (MH) is a full-thickness neuroretinal defect or break of the fovea, most of which are considered idiopathic. MH is sight-threatening and not uncommon; however, not until 1991 did Kelly and Wendel reported it to be treatable via internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling assisted pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), which was later established to be a standard surgical technique for this condition.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The second milestone of MH surgery was laid by Kadonosono <italic>et al</italic>. in 2000 when indocyanine green (ICG) was applied during surgery for staining of ILM before peeling,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] thus providing a way to better visualize, easier, and more completely remove the ILM.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Other dyes, such as trypan blue[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and brilliant blue G,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] were later introduced as alternatives for ILM staining.</p><p>Despite the above-mentioned advances in surgical techniques, however, quite a proportion of the MHs did not achieve complete closure but were so-called &#x0201c;flat-open&#x0201d; with bare retinal pigment epithelium and absence of foveal neurosensory retina, especially in cases with large MH (minimum diameter &#x0003e;400 &#x003bc;m) or high myopia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Although considered anatomically successful, flat-open closure of MH usually resulted in limited postoperative functional recovery.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>A continuing effort of refinements on vitreoretinal surgery led to another innovative technique established by Michalewska <italic>et al</italic>. in 2010, the &#x0201c;inverted ILM flap&#x0201d; technique, which was proved to be able to increase the rate of complete closure as well as the final visual outcome.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This technique was later used in patients with massive MH (minimum diameter &#x0003e;700 &#x003bc;m)[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or high myopia[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with satisfactory results except for high myopic patients complicated with retinal detachment.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>However, to the best of our knowledge, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was the only functional index used in the limited number of published studies applying the inverted ILM flap technique. In this study, multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG), which allows detailed topographical mapping of the retinal function in the central macula, was documented and compared before and after surgery in patients with large MHs (&#x0003e;400 &#x003bc;m) who underwent inverted ILM flap technique assisted PPV, trying to combine the mfERG results to the microstructural changes detected by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study is a prospective noncontrolled interventional study. It complied with the tenets of the <italic>Declaration of Helsinki</italic> (as revised in Brazil 2013) and was approved by Ethics Committee of our hospital. Patients who presented to our group with large (minimum diameter &#x0003e;400 &#x003bc;m) idiopathic stage III-IV (Gass classification) MHs from June to December 2014 were included. Informed consent was obtained before surgery in all patients. Exclusion criteria included: High myopia (&#x0003e;6 diopters), increased intraocular pressure (IOP, &#x0003e;21 mmHg) or glaucoma, moderate to severe cataract, severe systemic conditions that prevent surgery, and history of ocular trauma, intraocular inflammation, retinal vascular disease, or previous ocular surgery.</p><p>Each patient received a complete ophthalmological examination and the following clinical parameters were obtained at baseline and 2 weeks, 1&#x02013;3 months and ad-lib postoperatively: BCVA (recorded in decimals and was converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units for statistical analysis), IOP (Auto-tonometer TX-20, Canon, Tokyo, Japan), minimum and base MH diameter on SD-OCT (3D-OCT 1000, Topcon, Tokyo, Japan). mfERG (VERIS-EDI System, Califronia, USA) was not conducted until 1 month after surgery for the sake of avoiding infection and was monitored during the following visits. The ERG protocol complied with the standards published by the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>One-hundred and three hexagonal stimulus elements that scaled concentrically and covered the central 50&#x000b0; of the fundus were applied to each patient when examine mfERG. The central hexagon (representing foveal area) corresponded to approximately 2.8&#x000b0;, and the central seven hexagons (representing macula, including foveal and perifoveal areas) to approximately 5&#x000b0;. Three-dimensional plots and retinal response density ([RD], defined as amplitude per retinal area, nV/deg<sup>2</sup>) value plots were used to demonstrate the topographical retinal electrical activities.</p><p>A standard 3-port PPV (23-gauge) (Stellaris, Bausch and Lomb, New York, USA) with inverted ILM flap technique was performed in all patients by a single experienced surgeon. After a core vitrectomy, posterior vitreous detachment was created, followed by removal of the residual premacular posterior vitreous cortex. Then, ICG (0.125% solution) was slowly injected toward the ILM around the MH instead of directly toward it to minimize retinal toxicity, and let the ILM be stained for about 30 s. After that, the ILM along with any epiretinal membrane if present was grasped and peeled off in a circumferential pattern for about 1&#x02013;1.5 disk diameter around the MH using ILM forceps, leaving only the innermost narrow circle of ILM attached to the macular border by a pedicel. Then, this remnant of ILM was gently turned upside-down toward the bottom of the MH and was carefully flattened to make sure it was properly positioned rather than packed irregularly. The perfusion pressure was set at the lowest level (30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) that the vitrectomy machine allowed when covering the MH with the inverted ILM flap and during the air-fluid exchange to avoid the flimsy flap being washed away. At the end of surgery, 14% C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub> gas tamponade was applied to secure the position of the inverted ILM flap and the postoperative face-down position was instructed for at least 1 week.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 21.0 for windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Numerical variables were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). BCVAs and RD of the central hexagon and the central seven hexagons on mfERG at different time points (baseline, 1 and 3 months after surgery) were compared pairwisely by <italic>post-hoc</italic> tests after analysis of variance.

Encouragingly, the recent advent of the inverted ILM flap technique had increased the rate of complete closure to 98% in the original study for large idiopathic MHs,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and to 100% in a report for high myopic MHs.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In this study, with all MHs achieved complete closure, further supported the reliability of this technique for the management of large MHs. The inverted ILM flap technique, however, is not without limitations. In the original report, spontaneous detachment of the flap occurred in seven of fifty eyes during the air-fluid exchange.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] To address this, Shin <italic>et al</italic>. described a modified technique in which perfluoro-n-octane was used to assist the covering of the MH with a single sheet of ILM flap.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In our experience, we found that lowering the perfusion pressure when inverting the flap and during air-fluid exchange might help to avoid the flap from being washed away, and indeed no dislocation of the ILM flap occurred during surgery in the current study. Another notable modification of this technique reported recently by the original authors was to peel only the temporal side of the ILM instead of the whole area around the fovea, which was found to be associated with a reduction in the frequency of having a dissociated optic nerve fiber layer appearance.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The proposed mechanisms for tissue repair in the MHs following inverted ILM flap technique assisted PPV were as follows: The inverted ILM which contained M&#x000fc;ller cell fragments not only provoked gliosis via activating tissue necrosis growth factor-&#x003b1; but also served as a scaffold and basement membrane for tissue proliferation, thus providing an environment to instruct the photoreceptors to assume correct position during the reconstruction process and finally to improve the postoperative vision.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The microstructural recovery process of the MHs after surgery revealed by SD-OCT in our study was in line with the above-mentioned speculation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]: A membranous structure (which we believe was the inverted ILM) bridging over the macula defect was observed 2 weeks after surgery and seemed to serve as a scaffold for the repairing tissue because the subsequent repair appeared to proceed in an inner-to-outer manner. In addition, based on the observations in our study and as proposed previously,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] restoration of the ELM might be important for visual recovery as the leading edge of the reconstructing ELM was found to precede that of the EZ in all patients in our study. Unintended injury of the nerve fiber layer during ILM peeling, however, might compromise recovery of BCVA and mfERG [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].</p><p>Although both BCVA and mfERG responses improved incrementally after surgery [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>], they were not found to be statistically correlated at each evaluation time point of our short-term observation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>] as well as in previous longer term studies concerning conventional surgical technique (just ILM peeling but without inverting) in treatment of MHs.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The lack of correlation between BCVA and mfERG responses suggested that these two functional evaluation modalities could not adequately represent, but might be supplemental to, each other in the clinical setting of MHs, and might be explained by the following differences between them: BCVA is a subjective measurement and only measure the function of the fixation point under optimal condition, while mfERG is an objective measurement and provides a topographic electrophysiological mapping of the central retina. Further studies combining BCVA, OCT, mfERG, and subjective functional mapping of the central retina, such as microperimetry, might provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the patients with MHs.</p><p>This study is a prospective study in large idiopathic MHs treated with inverted ILM flap assisted PPV that combined the microstructural recovery process with changes of two aspects of functional evaluations (BCVA and mfERG response) and analyzed the association between BCVA and mfERG. The following major limitations of this study should be kept in mind when interpreting the results: (1) the absence of a control group, (2) the limited sample size, and (3) the limited length of follow-up. However, we would like to point out that, no control group was designed considering the rareness of large macular holes (minimum diameter &#x0003e;400 &#x003bc;m), and no other effective treating methods had been verified and reported in the literature by far. Further studies with more cases and longer term observations could be conducted, although it still would be very time consuming.</p><p>In conclusion, inverted ILM flap technique appeared to be a safe and successful approach for the management of large idiopathic MHs with promising short-term anatomical and functional results. Lowering perfusion pressure when inverting the ILM flap and during air-fluid exchange might help to avoid dislocation of the ILM flap during surgery. Postoperative reconstruction of the foveal microstructure generally showed good consistency with improvements in both BCVA and mfERG response. And although not significantly correlated, mfERG response might be a good supplement for BCVA to evaluate postoperative functional recovery.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="edited-by"><p><bold>Edited by:</bold> Peng Lyu</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Welly</surname><given-names>NE</given-names></name><name><surname>Wendel</surname><given-names>RT</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Vitreous surgery for idiopathic macular holes.
