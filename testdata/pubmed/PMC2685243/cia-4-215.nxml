Two phase II trials and one phase III have been published as full papers in the literature. In the dose-finding phase II studies an initial dose of 240 mg degarelix sc followed by a monthly injection of 80 mg or 160 mg degarelix sc was sufficient to keep testosterone levels &#x02264; 0.5 ng/ml. In a phase III trial it was demonstrated that degarelix was not inferior (in terms of testosterone suppression and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] decline) compared to standard hormonal therapy, ie, a GnRH agonist such as leuprolide. In fact, degarelix was associated with a faster testosterone suppression and PSA decline than leuprolide. Adverse events such as injection site reactions (40% vs &#x0003c;1%) and chills (4% vs 0%) were more commonly associated with degarelix. Also, degarelix is currently only available as one-month depot whereas in daily practice three-month depots (of GnRH agonists) are the preferred regimen. However, degarelix was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>hormonal therapy</kwd><kwd>GnRH antagonist</kwd><kwd>degarelix</kwd><kwd>testosterone</kwd><kwd>flare</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in the US and in western Europe with an estimated 186,320 newly diagnosed cases in 2008 in the US and 28,660 men who died of prostate cancer in the US (incidence-mortality ratio of 6.5).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-cia-4-215">1</xref></p><p>The therapeutic options available predominantly depend on cancer stage as well as patient age and co-morbidity. In organ-confined prostate cancer the treatment is radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy.

Without the receptor-mediated stimulus of androgens prostate cancer cells undergo apoptosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-cia-4-215">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cia-4-215">9</xref> Androgens are synthesized in the testes (95%) and in the adrenal glands (5%). The androgen synthesis underlies a hormonal regulation by the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;gonadal axis in a negative feedback manner.</p><p>Based on these findings, lowering testosterone levels either medically or surgically and/or blockade of the androgen receptor represents the principal mechanism of androgen deprivation therapy of prostate cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cia-4-215">10</xref> Surgical castration can be done by bilateral orchiectomy. This is an effective procedure and not associated with relevant complications. The disadvantages are the possible negative psychological effects and the fact that no intermittent androgen deprivation therapy can be applied.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-cia-4-215">11</xref></p><p>Similar effects can be achieved by suppression of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (eg, buserelin, goserelin, leuprolide, triptorelin) that desensitize the pituitary gland. This leads to a suppression of the LH synthesis and secretion followed by decreased stimulus for testosterone synthesis within the testicles. Another medical manipulation of this hormonal regulation can be achieved by blocking the androgen receptor with steroidal antiandrogens (eg, cyproterone acetate) or nonsteroidal antiandrogens (eg, bicalutamide, flutamide).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cia-4-215">10</xref> However, the effect from androgen receptor blockade is considered to be less effective compared to LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (at least in metastatic disease).</p><p>Blocking the GnRH receptor with an antagonist in the pituitary gland is obviously the most logical way to achieve a fast and reversible decrease of LH, FSH, and testosterone without any clinical flare. For a long time, however, GnRH antagonists showed relevant release of histamine from mast cells with acute systemic allergic reactions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-cia-4-215">12</xref> Another constriction for clinical usefulness was limited solubility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cia-4-215">13</xref></p><p>Degarelix (Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Kiel, Germany) is the second GnRH antagonist that has been tested in a phase III trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-4-215">14</xref> Degarelix has also proven its potential in achieving testosterone suppression without any evidence of clinical flare.

Patients with metastatic prostate cancer (31%), locally advanced prostate cancer (36%), and localized prostate cancer (26%) were included. Degarelix was administered sc at doses between 120 mg and 320 mg. The concentrations varied between 20 mg/ml and 60 mg/ml.

Therefore, 87/127 patients (69%) completed the study. Arm A comprised of 42 patients and arm B of 45 patients without differences with regard to demographics and baseline characteristics. Median PSA at baseline was 13.4 ng/ml (25th&#x02013;75th percentile: 6.8&#x02013;25.7 ng/ml). Median testosterone level at baseline was 4.13 ng/ml (25th&#x02013;75th percentile: 3.06&#x02013;5.11 ng/ml). Tumor stages were localized in 43%, locally advanced in 11%, metastatic in 19%, and not classifiable in 28% of patients.

After one month 88% of all patients had a testosterone &#x02264;0.5 ng/ml (93% of patients in arm A compared to 83% of patients in arm B p = 0.073). The authors concluded that the starting dose was too low to achieve the predefined efficacy success criterion of 95% of patients with a testosterone level &#x02264;0.5 ng/ml. This was the rationale to test 240 mg as a starting dose in subsequent trials. Only 86% of patients in arm A and 77% of patients in arm B remained with their testosterone &#x02264;0.5 ng/ml during the entire study period (p = not significant, exact p value not given in publication).

Results from the recently published randomized, open-label, three-arm phase III study showed that degarelix is not inferior to leuprolide at maintaining testosterone suppression over a one-year treatment period and degarelix was able to produce a faster testosterone suppression and PSA decline than leuprolide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-4-215">14</xref></p><p>In the last ten years, degarelix has run through various phase I and II trials and dose-finding was a major goal of these trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-cia-4-215">22</xref> As a result from these trials an initial dose of 240 mg seems to be the best dose to achieve a clinically relevant testosterone suppression in more than 90% of patients within three days and in more than 95% of patients after one month.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-4-215">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-cia-4-215">21</xref> A maintenance dose of 80 mg and 160 mg degarelix every four weeks resulted in a profound and sustained testosterone suppression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-4-215">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-cia-4-215">21</xref> In December 2008, degarelix at a dose of 240 mg sc followed by 80 mg sc every month has been approved for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and its approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has been recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-cia-4-215">23</xref> However, it is a clear disadvantage that degarelix is currently only available as a one-month formulation.</p><p>Degarelix has an immediate onset of action with no need for clinical flare protection with an antiandrogen as required in some patients treated with GnRH agonists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-cia-4-215">24</xref> This kind of action of degarelix might offer advantages especially in patients with advanced prostate cancer and a higher risk for symptoms associated with clinical flare. Testosterone surge begins two to three days after administration of GnRH agonists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-cia-4-215">24</xref> Theoretically, the median testosterone can increase by 100%. In the phase III trial it was demonstrated that median testosterone increased by 65%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-4-215">14</xref> This may be associated with exacerbation of symptoms from prostate cancer. The symptoms may include bone pain, spinal cord compression, bladder outlet obstruction, cardiovascular problems, and so forth. However, there are wide discrepancies in reports of the frequency and severity of acute clinical progression or clinical flare that might result from the testosterone surge. The use of GnRH agonists for patients with metastatic prostate cancer can be associated with clinical flare in approximately 10% of the patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-cia-4-215">24</xref> In contrast, patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer have very little risk for clinical flare. Antiandrogen therapy reduces, but does not totally eliminate, clinical flare in patients at high risk for this scenario.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-cia-4-215">24</xref> In the phase III trial it was voluntarily allowed to give bicalutamide for prevention of clinical flare. However, only 11% patients received bicalutamide and no patient of the entire leuprolide group had documented clinical flare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-4-215">14</xref></p><p>Abarelix (Plenaxis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Praecis Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA) was the first GnRH antagonist to be approved (in 2003) by the FDA for patients with advanced, symptomatic prostate cancer who cannot have or refuse other treatments for prostate cancer, such as other hormone treatments or surgery to remove the testicles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-cia-4-215">25</xref> The reason for this restriction was that the administration of abarelix could be associated with acute systemic allergic reaction. In 15/1397 (1.1%) patients treated with abarelix this symptom was evident. In 14/15 patients the symptoms occurred within eight minutes of injection. In 2005, Praecis Pharmaceuticals voluntarily discontinued promotional activities relating to abarelix in the US and the sale of abarelix for patients not currently on therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-cia-4-215">25</xref> However, in 2005 the drug was approved in Germany but not in other European countries. Since 2008, abarelix is available on the German market under the license of Speciality European Pharma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-cia-4-215">26</xref> A systemic allergic reaction was not reported in any of the degarelix studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-4-215">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-cia-4-215">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-cia-4-215">21</xref> Otherwise, in the randomized phase III trial 4% of the degarelix-treated patients reported chills versus none of the patients treated with leuprolide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-4-215">14</xref> These chills were neither discussed nor explained by the authors. Therefore, further reports on degarelix with long-term follow-up on efficacy and safety &#x02013; especially concerning the allergic potential &#x02013; are mandatory.</p><p>Also, it should be realized that 40% of patients experienced injection site reactions of degarelix compared to &#x0003c;1% at the im injection site of leuprolide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cia-4-215">14</xref> Why is the application of degarelix so painful? One explanation could be that the injected volume is rather high. In fact, 2 &#x000d7; 3 ml are injected to apply the initial dose of 240 mg degarelix.</p><p>If patients are diagnosed with prostate cancer the question today is: who needs androgen deprivation therapy? In a population-based cohort study of 19,271 patients older than 65 years (median age 77 years) having prostate cancer and treated with androgen deprivation therapy (7,867 patients) or conservative management (11,047 patients) were studied.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-cia-4-215">27</xref> Patients had a T1 disease in 49.8% (androgen deprivation group) compared to 64.2% (conservative management group) and the tumor was moderately and poorly differentiated in 65% and 34.2% (androgen deprivation group) compared to 83.7% and 14.2% (conservative management group). It was demonstrated that 10-year cancer-specific survival in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy was 80.1% compared to 82.6% (Hazard ratio [HR]: 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03&#x02013;1.33) in patients receiving conservative management (defined as not receiving operative therapy, radiotherapy or androgen deprivation therapy within 180 during the first days from diagnosis).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-cia-4-215">27</xref> Ten-year overall survival was 30.2% (androgen deprivation group) compared to 30.3% (conservative management group) and median overall survival was 82 months in both groups. However, in patients with poorly differentiated prostate cancer it was shown that cancer specific survival was better in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (59.8% vs 54.3%, HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.7&#x02013;1; p = 0.049). It is noteworthy that 75% of all patients received androgen deprivation therapy for a minimum of 18 months and 50% of patients for longer than 30 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-cia-4-215">27</xref></p><p>Not only the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy in terms of survival needs to be questioned but also possible adverse events. Androgen deprivation therapy itself is potentially associated with several adverse events. These include hot flashes, osteoporosis, loss of libido or impotence, psychological effects such as depression, memory difficulties or emotional lability, and others.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-cia-4-215">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-cia-4-215">32</xref></p><p>Diabetes and cardiovascular disease are especially unwanted adverse events among older patients. However, there is growing evidence that androgen deprivation therapy is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-cia-4-215">28</xref> In an observational study of a population-based cohort of 73,196 patients older than 65 years (mean age 74.2 years, standard deviation 5.8 years) having prostate cancer were investigated. The endpoints incident diabetes, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death occurred in 10.9%, 25.3%, 5.4%, and 4.5% of all cases. A total of 36.3% of patients received a GnRH agonist for a mean of 40% of time from diagnosis to censoring. This use of a GnRH agonist was associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes (adjusted HR: 1.44; P &#x0003c; 0.001), coronary heart disease (adjusted HR: 1.16; p &#x0003c; 0.001), myocardial infarction (adjusted HR: 1.11; p &#x0003c; 0.03), and sudden cardiac death (adjusted HR: 1.16; p &#x0003c; 0.003). In 6.9% of patients an orchiectomy was performed for androgen deprivation therapy. It is noteworthy that in these patients a greater risk for diabetes (adjusted HR: 1.34; p &#x0003c; 0.001) compared to no therapy was also found but this was not the case for coronary heart disease (adjusted HR 0.99; p = 0.74), myocardial infarction (adjusted HR: 0.94; p = 0.44), and sudden cardiac death (adjusted HR: 1.91; p = 0.85).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-cia-4-215">28</xref></p><p>In summary, degarelix is associated with a rapid, profound, and sustained suppression of testosterone in patients with prostate cancer. Antiandrogens to prevent testosterone surge and prevent clinical flare are not required. This may reduce costs and adverse events from the antiandrogen. Thus, a GnRH antagonist rather than a GnRH agonist may be used in patients with high tumor burden and/or acute problems such as spinal cord compression. In contrast to other GnRH antagonists degarelix was not associated with systemic allergy reaction. In the phase III trial, however, two adverse events occurred more often with degarelix compared to leurolide: injection  site reactions (40% vs &#x0003c;1%) and unexplained chills following the application degarelix (4% vs 0%). Beside adverse events there is currently no three-month formulation of degarelix available. A three-month interval for the application of GnRH agonists is convenient for the patient and currently the most often applied regimen. The phase III trial by Klotz and colleagues was not blinded and all patients &#x0201c;in whom androgen deprivation therapy was indicated&#x0201d; were included. What we don&#x02019;t have for degarelix is data on cancer-specific survival and overall survival as well as any data in patients undergoing intermittent androgen deprivation therapy and complete androgen blockade. Finally, the average monthly cost of degarelix treatment is probably comparable to other hormone treatments for prostate cancer; in other words, degarelix is not cheaper. Therefore, the potential role of degarelix within a discussion about the indication for androgen deprivation therapy with regard to efficacy, adverse events, and costs remains unclear and could be limited.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-cia-4-215"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jemal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Siegel</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Cancer statistics, 2008</article-title><source>CA Cancer J Clin</source><year>2008</year><volume>58</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>71</fpage><lpage>96</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18287387</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b2-cia-4-215"><label>2.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wilt</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>MacDonald</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Rutks</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Shamliyan</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>BC</given-names></name><name><surname>Kane</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Systematic review: comparative effectiveness and harms of treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer</article-title><source>Ann Intern Med</source><year>2008</year><volume>148</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>435</fpage><lpage>448</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18252677</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b3-cia-4-215"><label>3.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Klotz</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Active surveillance for prostate cancer: trials and tribulations</article-title><source>World J Urol</source><year>2008</year><volume>26</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>437</fpage><lpage>442</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18813934</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b4-cia-4-215"><label>4.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Antonarakis</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name><name><surname>Blackford</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name><name><surname>Garrett-Mayer</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Eisenberger</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Survival in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer treated with hormone therapy: a quantitative systematic review</article-title><source>J Clin Oncol</source><year>2007</year><volume>25</volume><issue>31</issue><fpage>4998</fpage><lpage>5008</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17971600</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b5-cia-4-215"><label>5.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Thrasher</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name><name><surname>Aus</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>AUA Prostate Cancer Clinical Guideline Update Panel.
