Since the mechanism of MCT mutability is poorly understood, the aim of this work was to provide a detailed morphological analysis of a typical mutable collagenous structure in its different mechanical states. The model studied was the compass depressor ligament (CDL) of a sea urchin (<italic>Paracentrotus lividus</italic>), which was characterized in different functional states mimicking MCT mutability. Transmission electron microscopy, histochemistry, cryo-scanning electron microscopy, focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy, and field emission gun-environmental scanning electron microscopy were used to visualize CDLs at the micro- and nano-scales. This investigation has revealed previously unreported differences in both extracellular and cellular constituents, expanding the current knowledge of the relationship between the organization of the CDL and its mechanical state. Scanning electron microscopies in particular provided a three-dimensional overview of CDL architecture at the micro- and nano-scales, and clarified the micro-organization of the ECM components that are involved in mutability. Further evidence that the juxtaligamental cells are the effectors of these changes in mechanical properties was provided by a correlation between their cytology and the tensile state of the CDLs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The &#x02018;mutable&#x02019; collagenous tissue (MCT) of echinoderms (starfish, sea-urchins and their relations) has the capacity to undergo reversible changes in mechanical properties (viscosity, tensile strength, and stiffness) within timescales of around 1 s that are under the control of the nervous system <xref rid="pone.0024822-Motokawa1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024822-Wilkie1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

We found that the mean interfibrillar distance of stiff CDLs was significantly lower than that of standard or compliant CDLs, and that there was no significant difference between those in the standard and compliant state. The denser fibril packing of the stiff CDLs obviously involves a reduction in interfibrillar space and displacement of materials previously occupying that space. This is probably a result of the stretching of the CDLs in acetylcholine-stimulated preparations and, by shortening the distance between adjacent fibrils, may facilitate the stiffening mechanism by making it easier for interfibrillar cohesion to be strengthened, for example by the attachment of crosslinking agents such as tensilin <xref rid="pone.0024822-Tipper1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Such facilitation of the stiffening mechanism may occur in other mutable collagenous structures that consist of parallel fibril arrays and undergo simultaneous stretch and stiffening, such as sea-urchin spine ligaments (&#x0201c;catch apparatus&#x0201d;) <xref rid="pone.0024822-DelCastillo1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, crinoid arm ligaments <xref rid="pone.0024822-Motokawa2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and ophiuroid arm ligaments <xref rid="pone.0024822-Wilkie5" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>Like all previously examined mutable collagenous structures, the CDL contains many juxtaligamental cell (JLC) bodies and their processes. These cells, characterized by their abundant intracellular granules, are probably the effector cells that directly bring about changes in the tensile properties of the extracellular matrix, because (1) they terminate within MCT, (2) they are in close contact with the motor nervous system, (3) immunological methods have demonstrated the presence in their granules of molecules that influence MCT tensility (such as tensilin and stiparin), and (4) there is no other candidate cell-type within or near MCT <xref rid="pone.0024822-Wilkie1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024822-Yamada1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024822-Koob1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024822-Heinzeller1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The electron density of the granules in the JLCs of the CDL is variable, as has been observed in all other MCTs, and for the purposes of this investigation the granules were categorized as being &#x02018;dark&#x02019; or &#x02018;light&#x02019;. We suspect that these represent only different stages in granule maturation, the dark being fully mature and the light various immature stages (because changes in only the dark granules could be correlated with mechanical state: see below). The size of the dark and light granules did not differ significantly between the three mechanical states, and there was no significant difference between the quantity of light granules. However, dark granules were much more numerous in standard than in compliant and stiff CDLs, implying that dark granules are involved in the standard&#x02192;compliant and standard&#x02192;stiff events. How can the dark granules have a role in both antagonistic processes? An unusual feature of the JLCs of the CDL is that only one cell-type has been identified <xref rid="pone.0024822-Carnevali1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Most other MCTs possess at least two JLC types distinguishable by the size and/or shape of their granules. It is believed that these are also functionally distinct, perhaps representing separate &#x02018;stiffener&#x02019; and &#x02018;de-stiffener&#x02019; cells <xref rid="pone.0024822-Wilkie1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>To explain these results we therefore hypothesize that:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>There are two populations of CDL granules (each comprising mature and immature stages), which are functionally distinct (one is involved in the standard&#x02192;stiff shift and the other in the standard&#x02192;compliant shift), but not morphologically distinct.

They do not, through a decrease in the electron density of their contents, become light granules, because there is no corresponding increase in the number of light granules. After examination of many electron micrographs, we have found no evidence that JLC granules undergo exocytosis and we can only surmise that the transport of their contents to the extracellular environment and the recycling of their membranes are achieved by particularly rapid and efficient processes.</p></list-item></list><p>Living systems in nature are frequently multifunctional and dynamic, providing a source of inspiration for the design and synthesis of new classes of materials that have potentially a wide range of medical and non-medical applications <xref rid="pone.0024822-Huebsch1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024822-Flammang1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. A priority in the biomedical field is the development of biomaterials that mimic ECM microenvironments and that allow a dynamic and two-way dialogue between the microenvironment and the cells, whilst also degrading at a rate similar to that at which the new tissue is being formed. The use of echinoderms as an animal model creates a unique opportunity to find new concepts for the development of a biomaterial that favours tissue regeneration, since their ECM, which closely resembles that of mammals, and particularly MCT, is present at anatomical sites at which there is a strong regenerative capacity <xref rid="pone.0024822-Wilkie6" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In the present work, the sea-urchin CDL was used as a model MCT that has the advantages of being easily accessible and having a typical MCT organization uncomplicated by the incorporation of skeletal components. Although the molecular mechanism of mutability is understood incompletely, the concept is sufficiently appealing to deserve further consideration by biomaterials scientists.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Professor M.
