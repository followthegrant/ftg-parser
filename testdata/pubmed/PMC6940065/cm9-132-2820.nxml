In the cup implantation simulation, the cup was placed at the initial preset position, with a V-HCC of 15&#x0200a;mm, and moved proximally by 3-mm increments.

According to the Crowe classification system, 25 were Crowe type I, 20 were Crowe type II, and 16 were Crowe type III.

By 3D morphologic analysis, our study also shown that acetabular bone stock correlates with the degree of hip dysplasia.</p><p>The present study had limitations. The first limitation is the small number of subjects in the Crowe type III group. Second, no normal hips were included. Patients with normal acetabula did not all undergo CT scans for THA; however, normal morphologic parameters were obtained from the literature. Third, in this simulation study, cup inclination, and anteversion were fixed, and all cups were fully medialized to make full use of the medial bone stock and prevent cup protrusion. This process minimized potential confounding factors related to bone coverage. However, in surgical situations, factors like medialization or varying inclinations may produce different results. Our results should be interpreted in light of this fact.</p><p>Sufficient host bone coverage is crucial for reliable cup fixation. Previously reported minimum bone coverage is 50% to 75%.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> This wide variation could be explained by discrepancies between 2D and 3D coverage and different surgery-related factors. Tikhilov <italic>et al</italic> showed that cup implantation with more than 75% bone coverage should theoretically achieve primary stability without screw fixation through the finite element method and mechanical experimentation.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Due to the highly sloped acetabular roof of the dysplastic hip, the surgeon may believe that inferior placement of the hip center may produce insufficient host bone coverage and compromised initial cup stability. High cup component placement was necessary for sufficient bone coverage. However, this surgical technique also introduces the possibility of over-elevation.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Our results showed that a V-HCC of 15&#x0200a;mm retained host BCC by 78% (75&#x02013;83%) in Crowe type I hips, 74% (66&#x02013;71%) in Crowe type II hips, and 61% (57&#x02013;68%) in Crowe type III hips. Even if the bone coverage was set to 80%, the V-HCC was 16.27 (15.00&#x02013;16.93) mm for Crowe type I hips, 18.19 (15.01&#x02013;21.53) mm for Crowe type II hips, and 24.13 (21.02&#x02013;28.70) mm for Crowe type III hips. Past studies indicated that a V-HCC &#x0003c;25&#x0200a;mm was associated with long-term implant survival, lower joint dislocation risk, early recovery of abductor muscle moment, and establishment of an impingement-free range of joint motion.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup></p><p>Recent clinical reports have shown excellent outcomes in dysplastic hips treated with slightly superiorly placed cementless and cemented cup components, especially when medialization is applied. Li <italic>et al</italic> reported no cases of aseptic loosening at a mean follow-up of 5 years in 52 patients with CDH, 47 of whom were Crowe type II or III hips, with a mean V-HCC of 21&#x0200a;mm, even though the 2D uncoverage ratio was between 30% and 50%.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> However, there was a significant discrepancy and a fair correlation between 2D and 3D coverage in patients with CDH. The 2D measurement underestimated 3D coverage by 13%.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Given this discrepancy, some cups with low 2D coverage had sufficient 3D coverage for cup fixation. In the current study, at a mean V-HCC of 21&#x0200a;mm, the 3D coverage could retain 87% (79&#x02013;92%) in Crowe type II hips and 74% (67&#x02013;79%) in Crowe type III hips, consistent with Zhu's study. Similarly, Nawabi <italic>et al</italic> also reported no cases of aseptic loosening at a mean follow-up of 12 years. The mean V-HCC was 17.3&#x0200a;mm in Crowe type I hips, 25.6&#x0200a;mm in Crowe type II hips, and 30.3&#x0200a;mm in Crowe type III hips.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Additionally, Kaneuji <italic>et al</italic> reported clinical outcomes following cementless THA in patients with Crowe types I to III hip dysplasia. The mean V-HCC was 21.8&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.3&#x0200a;mm in Crowe type I hips, 28.2&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;3.4&#x0200a;mm in Crowe type II hips, and 32.3&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;5.6&#x0200a;mm in Crowe type III hips. There were no acetabular failures at a minimum of 10 years.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> In these two clinical studies, the authors sought to achieve host bone coverage &#x0003e;75%, while the hip center heights were maintained within an acceptable range. However, among different Crowe groups, hip centers were placed about 5 to 10&#x0200a;mm higher than those in the current study. It is possible that the acetabular reaming may not be fully medialized or the surgeons may underestimate the actual bone coverage during the operation. Surgeons will naturally tend to upwardly file the acetabulum to obtain more sufficient bone coverage. Therefore, a 3D computer stimulation based on CT-scan images could provide accurate information pertaining to optimal cup component position and corresponding bone coverage. This could help surgeons evaluate acetabular bone stock distribution; make intraoperative decisions regarding cup size, hip center height, and additional screw fixation or bone grafts; and predict the survival of the cup component.</p><p>The bone stock of the medial acetabular wall determines the amount of cup medialization, while the bone stock of the acetabular doom determines the height at which the cup component achieves sufficient bony support. Many studies have investigated the morphology of young adults with hip dysplasia based on CT images, mostly focusing on the shape and orientation of bony defects.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> However, a few studies specifically quantified the acetabular bone stock in patients with late stage osteoarthritis and hip dysplasia secondary to CDH. Yang <italic>et al</italic> reported that there is more bone stock in the medial acetabular wall in Crowe type II or III hips, compared to Crowe type I hips.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> In the current study, we evaluated the bone stock distribution in the medial acetabular wall, from the bottom edge to the acetabular roof, in Crowe types I, II, and III hips. There were no significant between-group differences in maximum thickness of the acetabular roof; however, peak bone stock values were obtained at heights of 41.63&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;5.14&#x0200a;mm (Crowe type I), 47.58&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;4.10&#x0200a;mm (Crowe type II), and 56.55&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;3.56&#x0200a;mm (Crowe type III) above the ITL.</p><p>In summary, in patients undergoing THA secondary to CDH, the bone stock distribution of the acetabulum, which varies according to dysplasia severity, should be taken into account when reaming the socket during acetabular reconstruction, slightly superior placements, with V-HCC &#x0003c;25&#x0200a;mm, retained sufficient bone coverage.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Prof. Jin-Xin Zhang and Dr. Qi Ge for statistical consultation.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the Major Program of Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province (No. 2015B010125005, No. 2016B090916002, and No. 2017B020227005).</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Zheng LL, Lin YY, Zhang XY, Ling QH, Liao WM, Wu PH.
