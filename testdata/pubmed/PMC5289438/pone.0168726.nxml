Eligible studies were randomized trials comparing strategies to prevent CIAKI (alone or in combination) when added to saline versus each other, saline, placebo, or no treatment in patients undergoing cardiovascular invasive procedures with administration of iodinated contrast. Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including number of patients, duration of follow-up, and outcomes. Eighteen strategies aimed at CIAKI prevention were identified. The primary outcome was the occurrence of CIAKI. Secondary outcomes were mortality, myocardial infarction, dialysis and heart failure. The data were pooled using network meta-analysis. Treatment estimates were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% credible intervals (CrI). 147 RCTs involving 33,463 patients were eligible. Saline plus N-acetylcysteine (OR 0.72, 95%CrI 0.57&#x02013;0.88), ascorbic acid (0.59, 0.34&#x02013;0.95), sodium bicarbonate plus N-acetylcysteine (0.59, 0.36&#x02013;0.89), probucol (0.42, 0.15&#x02013;0.91), methylxanthines (0.39, 0.20&#x02013;0.66), statin (0.36, 0.21&#x02013;0.59), device-guided matched hydration (0.35, 0.12&#x02013;0.79), prostaglandins (0.26, 0.08&#x02013;0.62) and trimetazidine (0.26, 0.09&#x02013;0.59) were associated with lower odds of CIAKI compared to saline. Methylxanthines (0.12, 0.01&#x02013;0.94) or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure-guided hydration (0.09, 0.01&#x02013;0.59) were associated with lower mortality compared to saline.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Currently recommended treatment with saline as the only measure to prevent CIAKI during cardiovascular procedures may not represent the optimal strategy.

As CIAKI is associated with death, nonfatal cardiovascular events, and prolonged hospitalization[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the adoption of optimal therapeutic strategies to prevent this complication offers an opportunity to reduce patient morbidity and mortality. International guidelines advocate hydration as the standard therapeutic strategy to minimise CIAKI, with lower levels of recommendation assigned to other preventive strategies, given limited evidence from individual studies[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

We applied no restrictions on language or publication status during this assessment. We then reviewed in full text all citations that appeared relevant to determine inclusion in the systematic review. We included RCTs comparing strategies to prevent CIAKI (alone or in combination) when added to saline versus each other, saline, placebo, or no treatment in patients undergoing cardiovascular invasive procedures with administration of iodinated contrast. We excluded non-randomised studies, studies in the setting of computed tomography alone, studies in which the number of events for the clinical outcome of interest was not reported, studies in which the evidence on a treatment was limited to one RCT with fewer than 100 patients, studies testing early-stage investigational strategies, and studies comparing the same drug at different doses without other control groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Data extraction, synthesis and quality assessment</title><p>Data were independently abstracted by three investigators (TJ, MJ and VG) on prespecified forms.

If multiple definitions of CIAKI were reported, the trial&#x02019;s primary endpoint definition was applied.

We included mortality, myocardial infarction, need for dialysis, and heart failure as secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Network meta-analyses compare different treatments within a connected analytical network[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], integrating data from direct and indirect treatment comparisons whilst maintaining the randomisation design[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We used a Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model, which is the most conservative and accounts for differences among trials[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Comparative treatment estimates were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% credible intervals (CrI). Results for which the 95% CrI of the OR did not include unity were considered significant and are presented in bold in the outcome tables.</p><p>Model fit was assessed by comparing the posterior mean of the residual deviance to the number of data points[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We investigated the extent of heterogeneity in each network by examining the magnitude of the common heterogeneity variance &#x003c4;au<sup>2</sup> for the network[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We applied a standard 0.5 zero-cell correction when there were zero events in one arm of the trial. Studies in which all arms had zero events were excluded as not providing evidence of relative treatment effects.</p><p>The network meta-analysis approach assumes consistency, i.e., that one can learn about treatment A versus treatment B through a common comparator, treatment C. We assumed that, in principle, participants in studies fulfilling our inclusion criteria could be randomly allocated to any of the treatments being compared. We evaluated evidence of inconsistency in the network, defined as difference in treatment estimates derived from direct and indirect treatment comparisons, using the node splitting method and the corresponding Bayesian p- value, which determines the statistical agreement between direct and indirect evidence for each split node[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This was implemented using the gemtc R package[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>We also explored potential sources of statistical heterogeneity and inconsistency through subgroup analyses and univariate random-effects meta-regression[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To this end, we stratified studies according to baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as either 30&#x02013;59 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (moderate chronic kidney disease [CKD]), or &#x0003c;30 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (severe CKD) according to KDOQI stages of CKD[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We additionally performed meta-regression analyses, considering baseline mean age and diabetes as effect modifiers on estimates for CIAKI.</p><p>Calculation of the probability that each treatment is the best was performed by counting the proportion of iterations in the Monte Carlo simulation at which each treatment had the most favourable outcome. We also estimated the relative ranking probability of each treatment and obtained the treatment hierarchy of competing interventions using rankograms. To obtain the absolute probabilities of events for all treatments, a reference study[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was chosen to provide the probability of events for the reference treatment onto which the odds ratios were applied (on the log-odds scale) to obtain the absolute probabilities of events for all treatments[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These were then used to calculate the numbers needed to treat (NNT) or to harm (NNH) to prevent or cause one event for the compared treatments[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In additional prespecified sensitivity analyses we excluded studies in which &#x0003c;100 mL of contrast medium was administered for assumed low complexity of the procedure, or studies that did not define CIAKI as a &#x02265;25% relative or &#x02265;0.5 mg/dL (&#x02265;44 &#x003bc;mol/L) absolute increase in serum creatinine from baseline within 48&#x02013;72 hours after contrast exposure. We explored potential publication bias by constructing funnel plots for the clinical outcomes in which the standard error of the log of the OR was plotted against the OR[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) is a leading cause of hospital-acquired renal failure, associated in turn with a stepwise increase of mortality and a relevant impact on public health[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The present report is the largest database ever analysed on different treatments to prevent CIAKI in the setting of cardiovascular invasive procedures.</p><p>The main findings of this network meta-analysis, including 147 RCTs and 33,463 patients, are that methylxanthines, prostaglandins and trimetazidine resulted in the lowest odds of CIAKI as compared to saline or to saline plus N-acetylcysteine following cardiovascular invasive procedures requiring iodinated contrast. When compared to saline alone, methylxanthines, renal replacement therapy limited to severe kidney disease patients, and LVEDP-guided hydration were associated with lower odds of mortality, while LVEDP-guided hydration was also associated with reduced odds of myocardial infarction.</p><p>European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend hydration to prevent CIAKI in addition to limited contrast volume and to the use of iso- or low- osmolar contrast agents[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similarly, the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury recommends volume expansion with either isotonic sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate in patients at high risk of CIAKI[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To date, however, no robust conclusions on the comparative efficacy of all potential preventive measures against CIAKI could be drawn, given the small numbers of patients enrolled in the single studies and the limited treatment group comparisons. As a consequence, preventive measures other than saline have been discouraged by international guidelines. The limited available trial evidence is reflected by variations in routine clinical practice. Current practice indicates that prevention of CIAKI with saline or saline plus N-acetylcysteine provides only limited efficacy, leaving the physician ultimately challenged by the choice of other treatment options[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>A key finding of this network meta-analysis is the significantly lower odds of CIAKI with added-on vasodilator agents, namely methylxanthines, prostaglandins, and trimetazidine, compared to recommended standard treatments such as saline or saline plus N-acetylcysteine alone. This benefit persisted in the analyses stratified by baseline kidney function.</p><p>The pathophysiological basis for the present findings includes the reduction in renal perfusion and the toxic effect on tubular cells induced by contrast media that are generally recognised as important determinants of CIAKI[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This network meta-analysis challenges current international guidelines by demonstrating that effective prevention of CIAKI may not be optimally achieved with saline hydration alone. The addition of other agents, particularly vasodilators such as prostaglandins, methylxanthines and trimetazidine, has the potential to significantly reduce the occurrence of CIAKI and other patient-relevant endpoints, and warrants evaluation in large randomised trials. The complete biological mechanism underlying the effectiveness of vasodilator agents is not entirely clarified, and may include beneficial effects on cardiac function and haemodynamic performance.</p><p>In this network meta-analysis, the benefits of vasodilator agents assumed a particular distribution in patients with different baseline renal function. The protective effects of prostaglandins were evident in the main analysis and persisted in the sensitivity analyses of patients who had moderate CKD, studies in which a stringent CIAKI definition was used, and studies in which &#x0003e;100 mL contrast volume was administered. In response to ischaemia, the synthesis of prostaglandins is normally increased to modulate renal vascular resistance with a predominance of vasodilatory PGI2 and PGE2, in contrast to vasoconstricting PGF2 and thromboxane[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the presence of CKD, the release of eicosanoids, predominantly PGE2, is impaired[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, it is biologically plausible that the external administration of prostaglandins might abrogate renal hypoxia that is indeed increased in more advanced stages of kidney dysfunction. The association of methylxanthines with lower odds of CIAKI, observed in the main analysis, was present but less pronounced in moderate stages of CKD. These results might be explained by the fact that methylxanthines affect renal haemodynamics by blocking compensatory adenosine-mediated vasoconstriction in the early stages of CKD [<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This effect can be less pronounced in more advanced stages of renal dysfunction, owing to increased renal hypoxia and reduced synthesis of nitric oxide and adenosine.</p><p>Our findings that vasodilator agents can be beneficial are concordant with single pairwise meta-analyses showing that methylxanthines and trimetazidine reduce the incidence of CIAKI[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This large-scale network meta-analysis, however, substantially differs from the single pairwise meta-analyses by providing unified hierarchies of evidence for the several available treatments to prevent CIAKI. In this meta-analysis a significant benefit was observed with LVEDP-guided hydration on the clinical outcomes of death and myocardial infarction. Multiple reasons may explain this finding including plasma volume expansion, reduced renin activation, reduced loss of nitric oxide, reduced concentrations of reactive oxygen species, as well as higher dilution of contrast within the tubular lumen[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], although in our paper the magnitude of CIAKI reduction with this strategy was only numerical and not significant in comparison with other treatments, partly because the available evidence was limited to a single RCT.</p><p>Notably, in our network meta-analysis, renal replacement therapy exerted a possible GFR-dependent effect on CIAKI prevention compared to saline hydration, with signals of potential harm in patients with moderate CKD in contrast to lower odds of CIAKI among patients with severe CKD. The directionally opposite biological effects of renal replacement therapy in moderate and severe kidney dysfunction may have contributed at least in part to some heterogeneity in the network for the main CIAKI endpoint. The underlying mechanisms leading to harmful effects of renal replacement therapy are possibly multiple; hypotension and myocardial stunning may correlate with loss of residual renal function[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; blood contact with the dialysis membrane may promote a pro-inflammatory systemic response which may in itself lead to accelerated kidney injury; as a result, renal replacement therapy should be considered only in severe CKD patients[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], who are most predisposed to develop CIAKI, and in whom the benefits of renal replacement therapy would be expected to outnumber the risks. Our current findings on the favorable effects of vasodilator treatment strategies are in line with results observed in recent network meta-analysis[<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. At variance with the previous meta-analysis focused on drug treatments only and with no inference on other outcomes than CIAKI [<xref rid="pone.0168726.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we extended the analysis to both drug and invasive treatments to prevent CIAKI as LVDEP-guided hydration that in our present paper has been proven to improve significantly survival. Moreover, in the paper by Su et al statin therapy was divided in high and low doses based on a non declared statin type and dose classification strategy, an operation that prompts caution when interpreting results on high dose statin therapy referred as a potential best strategyOur network meta-analysis has limitations that need to be considered when interpreting its findings. The results were analysed on trial level data and not on individual patient data. Not all trials assessed or reported GFR or CIAKI by the same method or definition; however, sensitivity analyses for different stages of CKD and using a stringent definition of CIAKI indicated stable results. Moderate to significant heterogeneity was found in the networks for most endpoints. A certain degree of heterogeneity is inevitable when integrating the large body of available RCT evidence on CIAKI. We explored potential sources of heterogeneity and found no evidence in meta-regression analyses that prespecified study-level variables such as age and prevalence of diabetes impacted the results. We also noted no statistically significant differences in treatment estimates from direct and indirect drug treatment comparisons, indicating that the assumption of transitivity, necessary for network analyses, was appropriate. Although the power of consistency checks is limited when direct comparisons are few, the non-significant Bayesian p-values describing the probability that the direct and indirect evidence differ, corroborate the a priori assumptions of transitivity. Some heterogeneity for the main CIAKI endpoint is likely explained by the directionally opposite treatment effect of renal replacement therapy in moderate versus severe CKD patients; however, other sources of unexplained heterogeneity cannot be excluded. Several studies presented design limitations including the small sample size and the fact that some of them were single center RCTs; however the present network meta-analysis by design addresses the small sample size in single studies by providing a large-scale analysis and more precise estimates. this network although is the largest source of evidence does not include several treatment agents such as sodium/potassium citrate, allopurinol for which however exists large uncertainty as measures to prevent CIAKI; a stratified analysis based on different statin doses was not performed given the substantial variations in doses and types used across different trials. Caution should be exerted when referring to the LVEDP-guided hydration findings given the single trial available so far. Given the association of LVEDP-guided therapy with lower CIAKI and mortality, further studies are needed to assess the LVEDP-guided strategy. Clinical endpoints other than CIAKI were analysed in a minority of studies and individual RCTs were underpowered for the assessment of mortality. Thus, these endpoint data should be viewed as preliminary, requiring formal testing in large RCTs. The potential harms and costs for the considered treatments were not explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present network meta-analysis support the notion that treatment with saline during cardiovascular invasive procedures may not represent the optimal strategy to prevent CIAKI.
