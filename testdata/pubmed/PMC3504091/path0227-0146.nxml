Here, we integrated an unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screen for ccRCC survival regulators with an analysis of recurrently overexpressed genes in ccRCC to identify new therapeutic targets in this disease. One of the most potent survival regulators, the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 (SLC16A3), impaired ccRCC viability in all eight ccRCC lines tested and was the seventh most overexpressed gene in a meta-analysis of five ccRCC expression datasets. MCT4 silencing impaired secretion of lactate generated through glycolysis and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Silencing MCT4 resulted in intracellular acidosis, and reduction in intracellular ATP production together with partial reversion of the Warburg effect in ccRCC cell lines. Intra-tumoural heterogeneity in the intensity of MCT4 protein expression was observed in primary ccRCCs. MCT4 protein expression analysis based on the highest intensity of expression in primary ccRCCs was associated with poorer relapse-free survival, whereas modal intensity correlated with Fuhrman nuclear grade. Consistent with the potential selection of subclones enriched for MCT4 expression during disease progression, MCT4 expression was greater at sites of metastatic disease. These data suggest that MCT4 may serve as a novel metabolic target to reverse the Warburg effect and limit disease progression in ccRCC.</p><p>Copyright &#x000a9; 2012 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

These tumours are highly resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and until recently, systemic treatment options for advanced ccRCC were limited to cytokine-based therapies, such as interleukin-2 and interferon-&#x003b1;. Recently, anti-angiogenic drugs and mTOR inhibitors, all targeting the HIF&#x02013;VEGF axis which is activated in up to 91% of ccRCCs through loss of the VHL tumour suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, have been shown to be effective in metastatic ccRCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Although these drugs increase overall survival to more than 2 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, resistance invariably occurs, making the identification of new molecular targets a major clinical need to improve outcomes in patients with metastatic ccRCC.</p><p>In this study, we combined a genome-wide siRNA screen in a ccRCC cell line with analysis of a tumour versus normal tissue mRNA expression dataset to identify genes essential for, and strongly overexpressed in, ccRCC. We show that the lactate transporter MCT4/SLC16A3 is necessary for the survival of ccRCC cell lines and highly overexpressed in ccRCCs. MCT4 is required for lactate secretion, pH homoeostasis, and maintenance of the Warburg effect. The high level of MCT4 expression, particularly in metastatic and aggressive ccRCCs, together with a highly restricted expression pattern in normal tissues suggests the utility of MCT4 as a potential new drug target.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Genome-wide siRNA screen</title><p>RCC4 cells were transfected in 384 well plates and cell numbers determined with an Acumen Explorer (TTP Labtech, Melbourn, UK) after 4 days.

The difference in RFS was only apparent if tumours were categorized based on the highest observed MCT4 expression within the samples but not when categorized based on the modal staining intensity. This may indicate that a subset of ccRCC cells with high MCT4 expression has an increased ability to disseminate from a heterogeneous primary tumour. This was further supported by significantly higher <italic>MCT4</italic> mRNA expression levels in metastatic ccRCC lesions compared with primary tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>F), consistent with the colonization of metastatic sites by subclones with high MCT4 expression.

Taken together, these data suggest the potential of MCT4 targeting to limit ccRCC growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We integrated whole-genome siRNA screening, mRNA expression analysis, and metabolic assays to identify the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 as a potential novel therapeutic target in ccRCC. <italic>MCT4</italic> was the seventh most overexpressed gene in ccRCC and its overexpression was independent of VHL status. MCT4 abrogation reduced lactate secretion, intracellular pH and ATP levels, and led to G2/M arrest and apoptosis in ccRCC cell lines. High-level expression of MCT4 in primary tumours correlated with poor RFS, and metastatic lesions displayed higher MCT4 protein expression than primary tumours. Taken together, these data suggest the potential of MCT4 to serve as a novel therapeutic target in ccRCC. Importantly, the discovery of an MCT1/MCT2 isoform-specific inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> suggests that isoform-specific targeting of MCT4 may also be possible.</p><p>MCT4's main function is the secretion of lactate and protons from highly glycolytic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. High rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion are features of the WE that contribute to support ATP production and provide intermediates for biosynthesis in many tumours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene leads to the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1&#x003b1;), which induces the WE and up-regulates the direct HIF1&#x003b1; target MCT4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Aerobic glycolysis can also be induced by oncogene activation, such as <italic>MYC</italic> amplification, or loss of certain tumour suppressors such as PTEN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, both of which are known to occur in ccRCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. This may explain our observations that <italic>MCT4</italic> expression is independent of VHL status in ccRCC.</p><p><italic>MCT4</italic> knockdown, but not silencing of the related MCT1 transporter, impaired proliferation of all the ccRCC cell lines tested, indicating that ccRCCs depend strongly on MCT4 rather than MCT1 for survival. We have demonstrated through a series of metabolic assays that <italic>MCT4</italic> knockdown impairs the cell's ability to secrete the weak acid lactate, which consequently leads to a reduction in intracellular pH. A similar decrease in pH has been shown to increase caspase activation by two- to three-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, which is consistent with the induction of apoptosis that we observed after <italic>MCT4</italic> silencing. The reduction in ATP levels is also a potential consequence of this alteration in the acid&#x02013;base balance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Accumulation of intracellular lactate may also inhibit its conversion from pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, the main reaction regenerating NAD<sup>+</sup> in highly glycolytic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Silencing of <italic>MCT4</italic> also led to a G2/M cell cycle arrest, indicating that there may be additional links between metabolism and cell cycle progression apart from those described recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p><p><italic>MCT4</italic> silencing led to a concomitant loss in the expression of CD147, an ancillary protein necessary for MCT activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> that is required for <italic>in vivo</italic> growth of colon carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and pancreatic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> cancer cells. Although CD147 interacts with other proteins, it has been shown that its major pro-tumour role is to control MCT1/4 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. This is in agreement with our observation that high concentrations of lactate in the medium, which led to the accumulation of intracellular lactate, reduced cell viability and impaired cell cycle progression, phenocopying the consequences of <italic>MCT4</italic> silencing. Conversely, glucose withdrawal, which reduces lactate production, attenuated the effect of <italic>MCT4</italic> knockdown. Thus, it is likely that the accumulation of intracellular lactate is responsible for the impact on cell viability after <italic>MCT4</italic> silencing, rather than loss of another function attributable to CD147.</p><p>Silencing or pharmacological inhibition of MCT1 in colon cancer cells has been shown to be effective only in the absence of MCT4 expression, indicating functional redundancy of MCT1 and MCT4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In contrast, our results highlight an essential and non-redundant function of MCT4 in ccRCC. Higher expression of MCT4 in ccRCC cell lines compared with several other tumour types may be indicative of a higher dependence on aerobic glycolysis and thus on the MCT4 isoform, optimized for lactate secretion. A decisive advantage of an MCT4 isoform-specific inhibitor for ccRCC therapeutic use would be the highly restricted expression in normal body tissues in comparison to the ubiquitously expressed MCT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. High-level expression of MCT4 in muscle tissue could be a potential hurdle to therapeutic targeting.</p><p>The presence of ccRCC cells with high-level expression of MCT4 in tumour specimens correlated with relapse-free survival after surgery for early-stage cancers. This association with RFS was only observed when tumours were scored for the highest MCT4 expression rather than modal MCT4 expression, suggesting that intra-tumour heterogeneity may impact on phenotypic differences in metastatic potential. This is consistent with reports showing that high MCT4 expression and lactate secretion increase cell motility and invasive potential in <italic>in vitro</italic> models of breast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> cancer, and that MCT4 causes extracellular acidification in xenografts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, which may contribute to matrix degradation and invasion (reviewed in ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies demonstrated that aerobic glycolysis in tumour cells can be targeted through inhibition of the glucose transporter GLUT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, LDH-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> or PFKFB3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Our study shows that the inhibition of lactate elimination through MCT4 targeting may be a novel strategy to target tumour-specific metabolic alterations such as the WE. The development of inhibitors specific to the MCT4 isoform would be a prerequisite to examine this hypothesis in patients with ccRCC. Such developments might add a novel therapeutic class of agents, which target tumour metabolism, for the treatment of kidney cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>MG, CRS, PM, and CS are funded by the Medical Research Council UK.
