Gold has been given the status of the most precious metal, which was used to prepare sculptures of Gods, ornaments, coins, and so on all over the world. It is one of the most ancient metals even used for preventive and curative purposes. With regards to its early knowledge to Indians, an earliest reference is found during prehistoric period, mentioned as <italic>Hiranya</italic> (synonym with <italic>Swarna</italic>) in Vedic works.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p><italic>Manusmriti</italic>, the ancient Indian literature of rectitude, mentions that a <italic>Dwija</italic> (brahmin) has to undergo <italic>Samskara</italic> (purificatory rite) like <italic>Jatakarma</italic> (procedures at birth) and <italic>Chudakarana</italic> (ceremony of tonsure) to get rid of the impurities, which may be present in the <italic>Bija</italic> (sperm and ovum) and also due to the stay inside the womb as <italic>Garbha</italic> (fetus). Here, <italic>Jatakarma Samskara</italic> (newborn care) is told as a purification procedure, in which soon after cutting the umbilical cord the baby is made to lick the mixture of gold, honey, and ghee by chanting <italic>Mantra</italic> (spiritual hymns).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Ayurveda, has imbibed itself many such references of gold pertaining to its medicinal properties and uses at different contexts. Gold is explained as one among the <italic>Sapta Loha</italic>[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] (seven metals). It is categorized under <italic>Shuddha Loha</italic>[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (pure metal), which is said to be having both preventive and protective qualities. Gold is indicated for internal use even before conception due to its <italic>Rasayana</italic>[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (rejuvenator) and <italic>Vajikarana</italic>[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (aphrodisiac) properties so as to beget a healthy baby. After conception, it is used in <italic>Pumsavana Karma</italic>[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (procedure done to get the desired sex of the baby and for the proper intra-uterine growth and development of the fetus). After birth in <italic>Lehana</italic>[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] (supplementary feeds) and <italic>Jatakarma Samskara</italic>[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] gold has been said to have a major role to play. As the child grows, gold is also being recommended to be given alone or along with various herbal drugs for procuring better <italic>Agni</italic> (digestive power and metabolism), <italic>Bala</italic> (physical strength and immunity), <italic>Medha</italic> (intellect), <italic>Varna</italic> (color and complexion), <italic>Ayu</italic> (lifespan),[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] etc., Even on the death bed, when <italic>Arishta Lakshana</italic> (fatal signs) are observed, gold is indicated for its protective action.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Gold is such a noble metal, which is having substantial outcomes in the human body starting before conception until demise.</p><p>It is evidently mentioned in the texts of Ayurveda that any form of gold should be used internally only after proper purification failing to do, which may result in complications that may be even life-threatening.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The type of gold to be used, mode of administration of different forms, theirs benefits and therapeutic indications are also clearly explained.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>A methodical collection of data from classical texts of Ayurveda as well as related pharmaco-clinical research articles and dissertation works published in between May 1977 to November 2011 have been collected using PubMed and manual search of bibliographies as the sources.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Swarnaprashana</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>In Lehana</title><p><italic>Lehana</italic> depicts administration various herbal drugs, ghee preparations, and gold alone as supplementary feeds wherein precise indications are stated.

He describes <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic> in the context of <italic>Lehana</italic>. <italic>Lehana</italic> has been indicated for those children who are healthy, but have compromised breastfeeding and are having minor functional problems of metabolism. It is contraindicated in seriously ill children and also on daily basis.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p><italic>Swarnaprashana</italic> can be administered in all children as it acts at the level of nutrition, metabolism, growth and development, physical strength, and immunity. It is the only type of gold preparation described with its specific benefits according to the duration of administration. Even though <italic>Lehana</italic> is contraindicated on a daily basis, <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic> alone can be continued for a period of 1 or 6 months to get its specific benefits in children as stated by Acharya. Further research studies could reestablish the above said benefits of <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic> with respect to its duration.</p><p>In <italic>Lehadhyaya</italic> of Kashyapa Samhitha, the first mentioned formulation is <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic>. By considering the indication it can be said that <italic>Shaishava Avastha</italic> is the right period from which it can be commenced. The role of gold as a physiologically important element might have been understood by Acharya Kashyapa, thousands of years back, which made him to include gold as an important metal to be used in therapeutics. This precise mention may also be due to some specific action of gold in that age group of children, which is observed in the following studies. In a study, trace elements including gold were measured in human placenta and newborn liver at birth.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A trace elements like zinc, copper and gold were measured in the hair of newborn infants.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In a pharmco-clinical study on neonates <italic>Madhu-Ghrita-Swarna-Vacha</italic> combination showed a significant effect of humoral anti-body formation and it acted on immunological system, which was evident by triggering the response of immunological system by a rise in the total proteins and serum IgG levels.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Basically, childhood is the period of growth spurts, which is considered to be until 16 years of age, as per Ayurvedic classics. Acharya Charaka mentions a period &#x0201c;<italic>Vivardhamana Dhatu Avastha</italic>&#x0201d; from 16 to 30 years of age in which growth and development is observed. According to him, this period comes under <italic>Balyavastha</italic> (childhood).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Administration of gold is suggested in new born care (<italic>Jatakarma Samskara</italic>), up to one year of age and in <italic>Kumara</italic>. This wide range of age is suggested for administration of gold always arise queries regarding the cited benefits of <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic> in children. It can be said that the benefits of <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic> can be attained from infancy to adulthood with a wide range of actions influencing the growth and development of a child. The age at which it can be administered should be dependent upon the expected effect in the body. Considering all the above cited references it can be said that the action of this noble metal might be at multiple levels like as a general health promoter or in specific to enhancement of intelligence, metabolism, immunity, physical strength, fertility, complexion, etc.</p><p>As a general tonic, it can be administered in any age group. For the benefit as an immuno-modulator, it can be administered in children in early ages as this period until one year is considered to be the most vulnerable time for infections due to immature immune system. It can be even administered in case of immunodeficiency states provided that there is no serious illness associated with. The action of gold in the immune system can be justified from the following study reports. Pharmacological studies showed specific and nonspecific immune responses, which were modified in a positive manner in <italic>Swarna Bhasma</italic>-treated mice. It also had a stimulatory effect on peritoneal macrophages, which may be helpful to fight against infections.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In adolescence, there is the appearance of secondary sexual characters, which signify the development of the reproductive system. This could be the right period to get the benefit of <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic> as a fertility enhancer. In a study measuring trace elements in endometrium and decidua, looking for cyclic variations, including those during pregnancy, gold was found in human endometrium and decidua. The reported levels of gold were slightly lower around mid-cycle than at other stages of the cycle.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In male reproductive system, gold was measured in semen and reported that it is the richest source of gold reported in biological materials.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Another study suggests a significant stimulatory effect of gold chloride on female reproductive activity in immature rats.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>To get benefited as an enhancer of intelligence, <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic> can be given from birth and specifically for a period of 1 or 6 months continuously as mentioned in the classic. In a study colloidal gold was found to improve cognitive functioning, which was measured by IQ scores.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>As there are a number of forms of <italic>Swarna</italic> mentioned, picking the apt form is a major chore. Acharya Kashyapa has mentioned <italic>Kanaka</italic>[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] (a synonym of gold) triturated along with water, honey, and ghee. The idea behind this may be that as per the availability at that time in its pure form, gold could be administered directly and by rubbing on a stone micro particles of gold might be procured effortlessly. Later, other forms of <italic>Swarna</italic> were mentioned especially <italic>Bhasma</italic> which may be due to the advancement of pharmaceutical methods in Ayurveda like <italic>Rasasastra</italic> (metallurgy) as a separate branch of Ayurveda. Any form of gold, which is having better bioavailability should be the first choice for internal administration. The bioavailability of all the forms of gold is yet to be established. A few related study reports are cited below. <italic>Swarna Bhasma</italic> is said to have nanoparticles of gold which comprises gold-containing particles that are globular and have an average size of 56&#x02013;57 nm.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In blood compatibility study, it was found that <italic>Swarna Bhasma</italic> contained gold nanoparticles with crystallite size 28&#x02013;35 nm and was 90% pure gold.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Another study found that colloidal gold uptake in gastrointestinal tract is dependent on particle size that is, smaller particles cross the gastrointestinal tract more readily.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>It is very obvious in children that even slight negligence in the administered drug can cause serious adverse effects due to their highly sensitive body systems, which are still under rapid growth and development. Acharya had a very lucid idea regarding the significance of refinement of <italic>Swarna</italic> before internal administration. This is the reason that they have specifically pointed out the adverse effects of gold if administered without proper processing. Depending upon the form to be used, suitable processing should be adopted; that is, proper purification has to be performed if pure gold has to be administered and if <italic>Bhasma</italic> after proper purification and incineration. The particles of <italic>Swarna Bhasma</italic> were reported as non-cytotoxic.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In a study of chronic toxicity of <italic>Swarnabindu prashana</italic> no cytotoxicity was observed.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>There is no any specific day or time for administration of <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic>. <italic>Acharya</italic> Kashyapa mentions east direction to which one should face, while preparing <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic>. In the context of <italic>Rasayana</italic>[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and <italic>Pumsavana Karma</italic>,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] <italic>Acharya</italic> Susrutha and Charaka, respectively mention the usage of <italic>Swarna</italic> on <italic>Pushya Nakshatra</italic> (a star in Hindu calendar). The current popular practice of <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic> only on the day of <italic>Pushya Nakshatra</italic> may be due to the belief that it is an auspicious star to administer any medication due to its nourishing effect.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] However, such administration once in a month in every age group of children without proper dosage fixation may not yield any benefit as mentioned in classics. Scientific studies in this direction maybe helpful to make this practice unambiguous.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Swarnaprashana</italic> does not signify administration of any specific form of gold on a specific day or time. Rather it is the administration of pure gold alone or different forms of gold along with various herbs where this specific word solely means the administration of gold. The selection of the form of gold should be based upon the factors such as better bioavailability, no adverse reactions, easier in preparation, and administration, which should be standardized by scientific studies. Imprecise usage in terms of dose, duration, and condition will definitely generate adverse effects in the body, especially in children. The benefits of <italic>Swarnaprashana</italic> in children as told by <italic>Acharya</italic> Kashyapa and others are to be studied with the help of various experimental models and also at clinical levels so as to re-establish the unaccepted facts due to lack of scientific support.
