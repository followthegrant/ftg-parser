Walking to school, in particular, decreased from 41 to 13% between 1969 and 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with only 35% of children in grades K-8 living within one mile of school reporting usually walking/biking to school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This trend continues despite the fact that walking/biking to school contributes to healthy daily levels of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Safe Routes to School (SRTS)--a national program promoting safe options for walking/biking to school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]--has been shown to increase physical activity among school-aged children through supporting bicycle and pedestrian education, school wellness policies, and engineering improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. U.S. government initiation of SRTS began with two funded pilot projects in 2000, which quickly led to the growth of grassroots SRTS activities throughout the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The U.S. SRTS model is built on the &#x0201c;Five E&#x02019;s&#x0201d; concept: education, encouragement, evaluation, enforcement, and engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">A key though often challenging aspect of SRTS program adoption and sustainability is initial and ongoing engagement among residents and community stakeholders. For example, promoting collaborative community-research partnerships has been reported to be a key program adoption strategy related to successful SRTS program adoption in Canada and the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, in an educational climate of increasing fiscal constraints, finding efficient methods for building such collaborative partnerships can be difficult. This is despite reports that investments in programs and infrastructure that facilitate walking and biking to school have the potential for reducing transport expenditures for school districts and families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The first-generation investigations described in this article evaluated an evidence-based community citizen science approach, called <italic>Our Voice</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]<italic>,</italic> for increasing community member and stakeholder engagement and retention in a local public health department-sponsored SRTS program which was being initiated in Gilroy, California, USA. The <italic>Our Voice</italic> approach combines the active community engagement of community-based participatory research with the standardized resident-based data collection methods that are a hallmark of citizen science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The term &#x0201c;citizen science&#x0201d; refers to actively engaging local residents in gathering, analyzing, and utilizing data to improve community health and wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the <italic>Our Voice</italic> approach, residents learn to use the Discovery Tool (DT), a mobile environmental assessment app, to capture their walking route and take geo-coded photos and record audio-narratives of barriers and facilitators to health and wellbeing in their communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The DT (described below) is the first step in a multi-phase <italic>Our Voice</italic> citizen science process that includes data-driven community discussion and topic prioritization, and resident activation through advocacy with local stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

The major study question concerned whether SRTS + <italic>Our Voice</italic> was associated with increased school-wide SRTS engagement activities and greater changes in the number of students walking/biking to school relative to SRTS-Alone. SRTS program engagement activities continued to be tracked during the subsequent year to assess how well the activities begun in the initial SRTS year were maintained.</p><p id="Par12">Additionally, since school districts in the U.S. often include both elementary schools (kindergarten through grades 5 or 6) and intermediate or middle schools (grades 6 or 7 through grade 8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we explored the initial acceptability of including the citizen science engagement model in a SRTS program being initiated in a middle school in the same district (Investigation 2). The objective of Investigation 2 was to assess the initial feasibility and acceptability of the combined SRTS + <italic>Our Voice</italic> methods in a middle school setting when using middle school students themselves (rather than parents) as the citizen scientists.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study location</title><p id="Par13">Gilroy, California (total population&#x02009;=&#x02009;53,231 in 2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]&#x02014;a lower density region of Santa Clara County, California&#x02014;consists largely of farmland and suburban areas.

While, overall, many families living in the school district (54%) reported living within walking or biking distance from school, most families (69%) drove their children to school. Walking (19%), school buses (5%), carpools (4%), and biking (2%) were low. Reasons parents provided for not allowing their children to walk/bike to school included concerns about safety of intersections (54.8%), distance (54.5%), traffic speed (51.5%), violence/crime (51.4%), and traffic amount (48.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">In 2015, investigators from Stanford University partnered with the Santa Clara County Public Health Department (SCCPHD) to conduct an initial evaluation of the <italic>Our Voice</italic> citizen science approach as an addition to SCCPHD&#x02019;s SRTS program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Investigation 1: Comparison of elementary schools with and without Our Voice</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design and school site selection</title><p id="Par16">A prospective controlled comparison design was used. During September 2015, SCCPHD staff identified, with assistance from the Gilroy Unified School District, the next two Gilroy elementary schools that were ready to initiate SRTS for the first time. Given that the two schools were on somewhat different time tables for initiating SRTS activities, School A (which was ready to initiate SCCPHD&#x02019;s SRTS activities in late September 2015) was chosen to receive the SRTS + <italic>Our Voice</italic> program, while School B (which was ready to initiate SRTS activities in November 2015) received SRTS-Alone.</p><p id="Par17">At Elementary School A (SRTS + <italic>Our Voice)</italic>, six local adult &#x0201c;citizen scientists&#x0201d; were recruited through school parent-teacher groups and school staff meetings. At Elementary School B, standard SRTS data collection was conducted by SCCPHD staff with assistance from five parent and community volunteers. Human subject approvals were obtained from the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at Stanford University and SCCPHD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>SRTS program intervention activities</title><p id="Par18">The SRTS intervention program typically begins with a standard set of observational evaluations of the local environment. SRTS program walkability/bikeability observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], conducted in Fall 2015 by SCCPHD staff and several community members, included observational surveys of student pedestrian and bicycle helmet and safe riding behaviors, and environmental observation audits (i.e., evaluating features facilitating or hindering safe walking/biking). At both sites, the pedestrian/bicyclist observational surveys were conducted as part of standard SRTS practice in this locale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In contrast, collection of the SRTS environmental observation audit data differed between the two schools. At the SRTS + <italic>Our Voice</italic> site, the SRTS environmental observation audit tool was replaced with the DT mobile app. It was hypothesized that this app would allow community members to document relevant environmental barriers and facilitators in more depth by using photographs and personal narratives to contextualize resident observations.</p><p id="Par19">Six parents at School A were trained to conduct DT assessments (lasting 30&#x02013;45&#x02009;min each) on two mornings prior to school start during one week in September 2015. DT walking zones were selected by a team of SCCPHD staff and community members and focused on areas most frequently used by students traveling to school. Participants were given a prompt to capture aspects of their environment that made it easier or harder to walk/bike to school and were asked to take photos and accompanying audio narratives in their designated zones. DT training required less than 10&#x02009;min and was accomplished just prior to its use.</p><p id="Par20">At School B, the typical SRTS environmental audit tool was used instead of the DT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This audit tool includes 50 questions measuring the following eight factors on a scale of 1 to 7, with 7 classified as a serious problem: room to walk, ease of street crossing, room to bicycle, ease of bicycling, parent support, driver behaviors, safety, and pleasantness/aesthetics. Auditors check off and rate each item as they walk in their designated zones. Five adult community members (three parents and two after-school staff) participated in the assessments along with SCCPHD staff. Assessments lasted approximately 30&#x02013;45&#x02009;min and were conducted in the morning prior to school start on two days within the same week as School A. As with the selected DT zones, the environmental assessment zones for School B were selected by a team consisting of SCCPHD staff along with members of the school community and focused on areas most frequently used by students coming to school.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Community meetings to discuss the environmental audit information</title><p id="Par21">In School A, following DT use, standard <italic>Our Voice</italic> methods were deployed, including two community meetings where citizen scientists categorized data, prioritized issues, and advocated with stakeholders for realistic changes related to those identified issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The community meetings, facilitated by SCCPHD, were held 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;months after the DT walks. At the first meeting, each participant received a data packet with printed photographs and transcripts from their DT walks that had been transcribed by the research team. Citizen scientists thematically categorized their data within a theme, for example, traffic, crosswalks, stop signs, safety, and pathways. After thematically categorizing their data, participants ranked the themes based on importance and feasibility. Relevant local stakeholders were also identified for subsequent engagement (e.g., school administrators, public works engineers).</p><p id="Par22">At the second meeting with community stakeholders, the citizen scientists, with support from SCCPHD staff, visually presented the <italic>Our Voice</italic> methods and results to their stakeholders and brainstormed ideas for realistic local improvements.

For both schools, teachers were instructed to collect the Travel Tally forms at least twice during the Tuesday to Thursday period of the week of September 15&#x02013;17 (beginning of the school year) and during the Tuesday to Thursday period of the week of May 3&#x02013;5 (end of the school year), with the tally data averaged within each time period for each school. Because the travel tally weeks occurred at the same time for both schools, extraneous factors that could have potentially affected walking/biking to school (e.g., weather) were held constant. Teachers were responsible for surveying their students on whether they walked, biked, or rode in a vehicle to school on the above specified days during each travel tally week. SCCPHD staff retrieved the surveys and entered the information onto the SRTS National Data Center website, which is a secure online central database system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Exploring maintenance of program engagement activities during the following year</title><p id="Par26">As is common practice for SRTS, schools are encouraged to continue to work on SRTS action plans and activities developed during the initial program year.

Adding the <italic>Our Voice</italic> citizen science approach to the initial implementation of a SRTS elementary school program was associated with a significant increase in reported walking/biking to school relative to a comparison school which did not receive this additional intervention. The SRTS + <italic>Our Voice</italic> intervention was also generally associated with higher levels of engagement among elementary school parents across a 21-month period. Anecdotal observations by the SCCPHD staff members facilitating the SRTS programs suggested that the potential mechanisms that may have led to this increased engagement included an enhanced sense of ownership over local data, an increased interest in SRTS facilitated by directly capturing local barriers and facilitators with an innovative mobile app, and the community members&#x02019; role as co-presenters at stakeholder meetings. While it was beyond the scope of the current pilot investigation to capture such mechanisms in a more systematic way, <italic>Our Voice</italic> studies conducted in other community settings (e.g., neighborhoods) suggest that the civic engagement engendered by this type of citizen science approach may increase such mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">The size of the relative increase in reported walking/biking to school in the elementary school receiving SRTS + <italic>Our Voice</italic> (from 5.5 to 30%) was larger than what is typically reported in the SRTS literature (i.e., from 12.9 to 17.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is possible that some source of measurement error affected these data, although standard SRTS tally procedures were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and all students in each elementary school were included in these tallies. Given the preliminary nature of this investigation, it is important that the SRTS + <italic>Our Voice</italic> intervention procedures be replicated in other schools to better ascertain where the true impact of the additional <italic>Our Voice</italic> citizen science component may lie.</p><p id="Par55">Results from applying the SRTS + <italic>Our Voice</italic> approach in a middle school suggest that youth as well as adults can fully participate in this type of citizen science process. Incorporating students in the assessment process proved successful in achieving high initial engagement (26 participating students), compared to citizen science engagement in the elementary school (six participating parents). SCCPHD staff also reported that engaging youth in the stakeholder presentations yielded more compelling stories, with the students themselves advocating for the improvement of their school environment. However, the middle school setting also presented structural challenges in carrying out some aspects of SRTS (e.g., teachers had limited time to supervise group meetings). While the students were invited to present at a youth environmental sustainability conference, they were unable to attend due to liability concerns. Despite these institutional barriers, the middle school students have continued to engage with the SRTS program. The initial cohort of middle school citizen scientists, who have moved on to high school, passed on responsibilities to a new cohort of middle school students who continue to lead school-based SRTS activities.</p><p id="Par56">A large-scale study of 5-year SRTS program effects across 4&#x02009;U.S. regions indicated that engineering and related environmental changes were associated with an 18% relative increase in walking and biking to school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While the SRTS + <italic>Our Voice</italic> elementary school program resulted in at least one environmental change (i.e., additional bike racks), most activities involved new educational and motivational programs. The same large-scale study reported that such educational and encouragement programs have led to a 25% increase in walking and biking over a 5-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In contrast, the middle school included specific targeting of local built environments and policies aimed at safer walking/biking to school. These included proposed solutions to improve the school&#x02019;s traffic and drop-off policies. Unfortunately, with the departure of a key stakeholder in this area (the City&#x02019;s Public Works engineer), such solutions were unable to be pursued during the project period. While environmental and policy changes may take longer to implement, they could potentially translate into more enduring changes in SRTS behaviors over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par57">While the results of this first-generation investigation are promising, further investigation and replication of the effects of this combined approach in a larger and more diverse number of schools are needed. Among the limitations of the study design is the fact that the SRTS county health department initiated the SRTS program in School A approximately 6&#x02009;weeks earlier than School B. This somewhat longer time period could have conceivably influenced the differential results favoring School A, which received the additional <italic>Our Voice</italic> intervention. During this 6-week start period, School A SRTS activities consisted of one Santa Clara County Public Health Department-led SRTS media day occurring on October 7, 2015. The Public Health Department staff promoted walking and biking to the school on that day. While it is not possible, given the study design, to determine the specific impacts of this one-day event on the differential walk/bike tallies observed at the end of the school year, there is little evidence in the literature indicating that a one-day SRTS event at the beginning of the school year could have such a substantial effect nine months later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, we observed even stronger between-school differences in SRTS engagement activities during the follow-up year when there was no difference in the SRTS program start date.</p><p id="Par58">It is also possible that the larger proportions of lower income and racial/ethnic minorities in School A could have in some way resulted in the significant differences in walk/bike patterns shown across the school year in School A vs. B independent of the <italic>Our</italic> Voice intervention. However, prior SRTS research on U.S. schools that have larger proportions of Hispanic as well as lower-income students typically have found generally higher rates of walking/biking to school in those populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which was not the case at baseline in School A. This might have been due, at least in part, to the less urbanized nature of the school district under study relative to a number of other investigations, as well as the observation that lower-income Hispanic children living in western areas of the U.S. are more likely to live in less safe neighborhoods with poorer street environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These potential factors deserve further systematic investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similarly, while there could have been initial differences in parental and school-based readiness between the two elementary schools, pre-intervention parental survey data related to parental perceptions that their child&#x02019;s school encouraged walking/biking to and from school and that walking/biking to school was healthy for their child were similar. In addition, the significant increase in walking/biking to school in the SRTS + <italic>Our Voice</italic> school, which had significantly lower baseline walking/biking rates relative to the SRTS-Alone school, was substantially larger than what one might typically expect if simply a &#x0201c;regression to the mean&#x0201d; phenomenon was operating.</p><p id="Par59">Systematically tracking behavior change of this type across more extended time periods also presents challenges. The SRTS walking/biking travel mode tally required teachers to facilitate data collection, which can lead to teacher burden. Given the inevitable variability in school populations, policies, and resources that occur over time, SRTS programs may need to track walking/biking rates over much longer time spans (e.g., 5&#x02013;10&#x02009;years) using more rigorous experimental designs to accurately determine significant behavior changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An important goal of such programs is to ensure that the community does not disengage when change does not happen immediately.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par60">This first-generation study suggests that the addition of a technology-enabled citizen science process to a standard elementary school SRTS program was associated with higher levels of community engagement and reported walking/biking to school compared to SRTS alone. The results also indicate that this approach is feasible to employ in a middle school setting where students can participate as the &#x0201c;citizen scientists&#x0201d;. The findings suggest that further investigation of this citizen science approach in the elementary and middle school settings is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DT</term><def><p id="Par5">Discovery Tool</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCCPHD</term><def><p id="Par6">Santa Clara County Public Health Department</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SRTS</term><def><p id="Par7">Safe Routes to School</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was made possible thanks to a partnership between the <italic>Our Voice</italic> Initiative at Stanford University School of Medicine and the Santa Clara County Public Health Department.
