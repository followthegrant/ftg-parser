Molecular hydrogen has antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects and a preventive effect on oxidative stress-induced cell death. In the present study, we investigated solidified hydrogen-occluding-silica (H<sub>2</sub>-silica) that can release molecular hydrogen into cell culture medium because the use of hydrogen gas has strict handling limitations in hospital and medical facilities and laboratories, owing to its physicochemical characteristics. Human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (KYSE-70) cells and normal human esophageal epithelial cells (HEEpiCs) were used to investigate the effects of H<sub>2</sub>-silica on cell viability and proliferation. Cell migration was examined with wound healing and culture-insert migration assays. The intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species were evaluated with a nitroblue tetrazolium assay. To assess the apoptotic status of the cells, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and cleaved caspase-3 were analyzed by western blot. The results showed that KYSE-70 cells and HEEpiCs were generally inhibited by H<sub>2</sub>-silica administration, and there was a significant proliferation-inhibitory effect in an H<sub>2</sub>-silica concentration-dependent manner compared with the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in KYSE-70. Apoptosis-inducing effect on KYSE-70 cells was observed in 10, 300, 600, and 1,200 ppm H<sub>2</sub>-silica, and only 1,200 ppm H<sub>2</sub>-silica caused a 2.4-fold increase in apoptosis in HEEpiCs compared with the control group as the index of Bax/Bcl-2. H<sub>2</sub> silica inhibited cell migration in KYSE-70 cells, and high concentrations had a cytotoxic effect on normal cells. These findings should provide insights into the mechanism of inhibition of H<sub>2</sub>-silica on human cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>molecular hydrogen</kwd><kwd>hydrogen-occluding-silica</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>apoptosis-inducing effect</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>car-cinogenic cells</kwd><kwd>normal human culture cells</kwd><kwd>cytotoxic effect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>It is well known that hydrogen is the most abundant and simplest chemical element in the universe and in our living body, and molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is a colorless, odorless, nonmetallic, tasteless, and highly flammable diatomic gas.

Using the WST-8 assay, we found an inhibitory effect on KYSE-70 cell proliferation within 48 hours after H<sub>2</sub>-silica administration. The respective inhibitory effects on cell migration were also shown through the wound-healing assay, those reflect invasion and metastasis of cancer cells.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In addition, from the results of the ratios of activated caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 experiment, it was confirmed that H<sub>2</sub>-silica had the effect of inducing and enhancing cancer cell apoptosis.</p><p>In order to observe and compare the other adverse effects that occur in the surrounding normal cells during anticancer treatment, we also obtained experimental data from HEEpiCs. Although there was an inhibitory effect on KYSE-70 cells, only a high concentration (1,200 ppm) of H<sub>2</sub>-silica led to prominent apoptosis in HEEpiCs. These results suggest that H<sub>2</sub>-silica has an inhibitory effect on human cancer cells, but that only high concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>-silica result in cytotoxic effects on normal human cells. We previously observed that the autoclaved and dehydrogenated H<sub>2</sub>-silica scarcely showed the antioxidant and cytoprotective effects, assumedly through the mechanical inhibition due to contact between silica microparticles-cells, for human keratinocytes HaCaT, which, furthermore, suffered from a slight inhibition for cell proliferation above the definite dose of H<sub>2</sub>-silica which was seemed to be considerably different from one cell line to another cell line.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> On the other hand, we cannot exclude a possibility for the specific toxicity from silica itself or by the pH change of the medium due to addition of silica.</p><p>Much research has reported on hydrogen gas or hydrogen water since the breakthrough paper of Ohsawa et al.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> in 2007. However, studies in which cancer is the experimental target have been scarce.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> We noted with interest that the first paper about the possible biological effects of hydrogen gas on human skin cancer cells was reported in 1975.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Although this paper did not report positive results, the fact that the focus was on cancer cells is admirable. Recently, hydrogen water plus some kind of antioxidant was investigated in spite of rare papers that reported inhibitory effects on cancer cells with hydrogen water alone <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Saitoh et al.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> reported that platinum-nanocolloid-supplemented hydrogen water could inhibit either colony formation efficiencies or colony sizes of human tongue carcinoma cells. Nakashima-Kamimura et al.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> observed that inhalation of hydrogen gas improved mortality and body-weight loss caused by cisplatin, and alleviated nephrotoxicity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, hydrogen did not impair the antitumor activity of cisplatin against cancer cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> in tumor-bearing mice. They concluded that hydrogen has the potential to improve the quality of life of patients during chemotherapy by efficiently mitigating the side effects of cisplatin.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Asada et al.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> also reported that hydrogen water in combination with platinum nanocolloid decreased cell proliferation, shrinkage, pyknosis, and karyorrhexis of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Moreover, Runtuwene et al.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> investigated the anticancer effect of hydrogen water in combination with 5-fluorouracil. They found that hydrogen water administration enhanced cell apoptosis, resulting in a marked increase in the expression of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase, apoptosis-inducing factor, and caspase-3 in colon 26 cells. Additionally, high-concentration hydrogen water exhibited stronger antioxidative and anticancer activities than did low-concentration hydrogen water.</p><p>The KYSE-70 cells that were used in this study were malignant squamous epithelial cells derived from human esophageal carcinoma tissue.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> KYSE-70 cells belong to stage IIB, T1 or T2 (T1: tumor invades lamina propria or submucosa; T2: tumor invades muscularis propria) in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging systems.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Hence, we chose KYSE70 cells as our experimentally cultured cancer cell line.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In the present study, we observed the cell migration of KYSE-70 cells.</p><p>Cell migration plays a central role in a wide variety of biological phenomena.<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> As shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref></bold>, H<sub>2</sub>-silica has a certain antiproliferative effect on KYSE-70 cells, particularly during the initial 48 hours after treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In addition, the inhibitory effect of H<sub>2</sub>-silica on cancer cell migration lasted beyond 48 hours. Compared with the control at 72 hours, a clear difference was not observed. Furthermore, inhibition of filopodia formation and closure of a scratch wound were observed in comparison with the control group. By microscopic observation, it was seen that H<sub>2</sub>-silica inhibited hypertrophy and other cellular processes of cancer cells.</p><p>The H<sub>2</sub>-silica that was used in the present study is a hydride-based compound with H-ions interstitially embedded in a matrix of caged silica. Synthesis is simple and efficient with consistent results of about 17% w/w hydride content. A paper reported the ORP, pH, relative hydrogen score, and <sup>1</sup>H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra for H<sub>2</sub>-silica, and indicated that it had a significant reduction potential of -750 mV.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> However, silica is a health-beneficial, biologically friendly compound with the capacity to scavenge and reduce ROS. Silica in the state of silicon, as well as fine silicon dioxide, is used in food additives and cosmetics and is currently approved for use by The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ffcr.or.jp/zaidan/MHWinfo.nsf">http://www.ffcr.or.jp/zaidan/MHWinfo.nsf</ext-link>). It should be emphasized that the H<sub>2</sub>-silica used for this experiment is a different substance to crystalline silica, which belongs to group 1 as defined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> By definition, group 1 materials can be carcinogenic to humans through dust inhalation, especially for the erionite that is a fibrous component of some natural zeolite deposits.</p><p>Kato et al.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> investigated the anti-melanogenic efficacy of H<sub>2</sub>-silica in human melanin-generating pigment cells (HMV-II) that were subjected to oxidative stress by ultraviolet A (UVA) light exposure. After UVA irradiation, HMV-II cells were stimulated to produce melanin 2.72-fold more abundantly than the untreated control cells. When HMV-II cells were treated with H<sub>2</sub>-silica at a low concentration of 20 ppm pre- and post-UVA irradiation, the amount of melanin was repressed to 12.20% compared with that of the control cells. The investigators found that cell viability and apoptosis events were unchanged even at high-level concentrations of 100&#x02013;1,000 ppm. Our results are consistent with those from the report by Kato et al.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>According to our results showing that H<sub>2</sub>-silica can inhibit proliferation, promote apoptosis, and prevent cell migration in KYSE-70 cells, H<sub>2</sub>-silica may be a potential therapeutic agent in cancer prevention and inhibition of metastasis through its anti-ROS effects.</p><p>Piskounova et al.<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> reported that oxidative stress could limit distant metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. This could explain the phenomenon in our experiment that the migration of KYSE-70 cells showed a remarkable inhibitory tendency depending on an increased concentration of H<sub>2</sub>-silica (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref></bold>).</p><p>Malignant cells are often maintained in a high metabolic state, so their ROS levels are higher than those of normal cells. In order to maintain this rapid growth state, malignant cells must keep growth factor pathways activated. This can cause tumor cells to absorb more nutrients, and enhance cell division signals. Hence, this state will inevitably lead to mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase producing more and more ROS. Scientists have found that ROS promote cancer mainly through signal conditioning rather than through the destruction of chromosome structure.</p><p>The results obtained from our experiments seem to indicate that potent antioxidants can cause sensitization if they are used on tumor cells that maintain high levels of ROS. In contrast, H<sub>2</sub>-silica may produce toxic effects in normal cells that maintain low levels of ROS.</p><p>As shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref></bold>, H<sub>2</sub>-silica at a low concentration has a gentle promotive effect on the migration of HEEpiCs. This suggests that many growth factor signaling pathways act through phosphorylation to begin with and end through dephosphorylation, and maintain a state of being ready to start by stopping dephosphorylation. ROS play an important role in the regulation of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. First, growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor and epithelial growth factor can quickly enhance the generation of ROS, mainly through the NADPH oxidase pathway. Second, ROS are important for the autophosphorylation of growth factor-induced tyrosine residues.</p><p>H<sub>2</sub>-silica exhibited anticancer activity in KYSE-70 cells by affecting antioxidant enzymes, possibly leading to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, cell cycle arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase, and apoptotic cell death <italic>via</italic> the death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.</p><p>After H<sub>2</sub>-silica administration, differences were seen between the two cell types in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. H<sub>2</sub>-silica administration in the cancer cells showed an inhibitory effect and induced apoptosis at a high concentration (1,200 ppm). However, there were no obvious changes in cell viability or apoptotic events even at concentrations of 100, 300, or 600 ppm. In contrast, the normal cells responded differently to H<sub>2</sub>-silica. It was found that administering H<sub>2</sub>-silica at low or moderate concentrations (&#x02264; 300 ppm) did not damage normal cells.</p><p>Administration to normal cells at a high concentration (1,200 ppm) caused a decrease in the viability of the cells, an increase in induction of apoptosis, and cytotoxicity. It is well known that induction of unwanted apoptosis is harmful to the growth and proliferation of normal cells. A too powerful antioxidant may be good to eliminate the cancer cells, but it will produce an adverse consequence such as a cytotoxic effect on the surrounding normal cells through mechanisms such as cell apoptosis or necrosis.</p><p>The results obtained from the present study suggested that administration of H<sub>2</sub>-silica to either KYSE-70 cells would promote cell apoptosis; however for HEEpiCs the effect was not so drastic. In view of the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratios after H<sub>2</sub>-silica administration, it is possible that apoptosis had been induced in cancer cell lines selectively especially in the pathway of Bax and Bcl-2.<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> It suggests that H<sub>2</sub>-silica may sometimes trigger cell death <italic>via</italic> the non-caspase pathway or the initiator-caspase-skipping route rather than the typical effector caspase-3 mediated pathway, or it is possible that activated caspase-3 would be degraded by other proteases. This result suggests the same mechanism as revealed by our previous studies.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>We believe that there are several limitations to this study that warrant further research. The first is the negative results from the NBT assay. Ohsawa et al.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> found that the inhalation of H<sub>2</sub> gas selectively reduced hydroxyl radicals, and concluded that H<sub>2</sub> may effectively protect cells <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>. In general, the hydroxyl radical is thought to be the most cytotoxic of the ROS. The reasons for the negative results in our study were clear, but we will focus on different methods of administrating H<sub>2</sub> and intend to use another ROS detection method in the future.</p><p>We also intend to obtain some data to explain the relationship between the cytoskeleton and cell apoptosis in future research. In addition, we were not able to not confirm whether H<sub>2</sub>-silica 300 ppm produces a proliferative effect in HEEpiCs between 0 and 96 hours, or after 96 hours (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). We will therefore analyze the time course and other concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>-silica than 300 ppm to perform a similar study on human fibroblasts.</p><p>Finally, it is clear that H<sub>2</sub>-silica particle is not only portable and easy to store but also safer than H<sub>2</sub> generating apparatus which is expensive, difficult to manipulate, and has the potential to explode. H<sub>2</sub>-silica delivers hydrogen gas in a certain way; therefore, it will be used in our future studies for observing wound repair in human normal skin cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI No.
