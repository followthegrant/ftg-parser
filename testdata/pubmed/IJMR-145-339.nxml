This study was conducted to determine the relationship between the actual weight and weight determined by Broselow tape in the Indian children and to derive an equation for determination of weight based on height in the Indian children.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, India. The participants&#x02019; weights were divided into three groups &#x0003c;10 kg, 10-18 kg and &#x0003e;18 kg with a total sample size estimated to be 210 (70 in each group). Using the tape, the measured weight was compared to Broselow-predicted weight and percentage weight was calculated. Accuracy was defined as agreement on Broselow colour-coded zones, as well as agreement within 10 per cent between the measured and Broselow-predicted weights. The resulting data were compared with weights estimated by advanced paediatric life support (APLS) and updated APLS formulae using Pearson's correlation coefficient.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The mean percentage differences were &#x02212;11.78, &#x02212;17.09 and &#x02212;14.27 per cent for &#x0003c;10, 10-18 and &#x0003e;18 kg weight-based groups, respectively. The Broselow colour-coded zone agreement was 33.3 per cent in children weighing &#x0003c;10 kg, but only 7.4 per cent in the 10-18 kg group and 33.9 per cent in the &#x0003e;18 kg group. Agreement within 10 per cent was 53.13 per cent for the &#x0003c;10 kg group, but only 21.08 per cent for the 10-18 kg group and 33.9 per cent for the &#x0003e;18 kg group. Application of 10 per cent weight correction factor improved the percentages to 79.2 per cent for the &#x0003c;10 kg category, to 55.70 per cent for the 10-18 kg group and to 61.0 per cent for the &#x0003e;18 kg group. The correlation coefficient between actual weight and weights estimated by Broselow tape (r=0.89) was higher than that between actual weight and weight estimated by APLS method or updated APLS formulae (r=0.68) in 12-60 months age group as well as in &#x0003e;60 months age group (r=0.76).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Interpretation &#x00026; conclusions:</title><p>Broselow weight overestimated weight by &#x0003e;10 per cent in majority of Indian children. The weight overestimation was greater in children belonging to over 18 and 10-18 kg weight groups. Applying 10 per cent weight correction factor to the Broselow-predicted weight may provide a more accurate estimation of actual weight in children attending public hospital. Weights estimated using Broselow tape correlated better with actual weights than those calculated using APLS and updated APLS formulae.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anthropometry/instrumentation</kwd><kwd>body weight</kwd><kwd>medication errors/prevention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>In contrast to adults, drugs are administered to infants and children on the basis of actual weight or surface area. When children present in a critical state, the caregivers are expected to provide instant care and administer drugs immediately. There is hardly any time to determine weight or height and calculate dosages of emergency drugs. In addition, when children present with shock or respiratory arrest or circulatory collapse, it may be necessary to carry out endotracheal intubation straight away. In such situations, various methods are used to determine the drug dosages and sizes of equipment: &#x02018;guesstimates&#x02019; based on the child's apparent size or stature<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, predicting it on the basis of length<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, foot length<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, age<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> or a combination of above<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.

The Indian Academy of Pediatrics supported Paediatric Advanced Life Support Programme recommends that Broselow tape is used in such circumstances<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. The Broselow tape recommends dosages of emergency drugs and preferred equipment sizes, on the basis of predicted weight, which, in turn, is estimated on the basis of actual height (height-weight correlation). Although the Broselow tape has been validated in both ambulatory<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and simulated emergency situations<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> in the United States and is believed to reduce complications arising from inaccurate drug dosing and equipment sizing, but given the prevalence of malnutrition and consequent aberration in growth in Indian children it may overestimate the weight of these children.</p><p>Hence, this study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of weight measured by Broselow tape and compare it with the actual weight of Indian children. The findings of Broselow tape were compared with those obtained using APLS and updated APLS formulae.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p>This cross-sectional study was carried out at the Paediatric Outpatient and Inpatient departments of BYL Nair ChariTable Hospital, a tertiary care public hospital attached to TN Medical College in Mumbai, India, over a period of 18 months from April 2012. The study was initiated after obtaining ethical approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee and children aged 12-144 months were enrolled in the study after obtaining written informed consent from parents. If the prospective research participant was over seven years of age, his/her assent was also obtained before enrolment. Children were excluded from the study if they required immediate or emergency management or weighed over 35 kg or had height exceeding 145 cm.</p><p>Demographic data were collected from the parents or guardians. Age was determined based on documentary evidence or on the basis of birth date, birth year or age stated by the care-giver. The weight of children was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using an electronic weighing scale (IPA Devices Pvt. Ltd). The Broselow tape<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Armstrong Medical Industries, Lincolnshire, IL, USA) used for the estimation of weight based on the length has colour-coded segments depending on the weight estimated on the basis of length: grey (3-5 kg), pink (6-7 kg), red (8-9 kg), purple (10-11 kg), yellow (12-14 kg), white (15-18 kg), blue (19-22 kg), orange (24-28 kg) and green (30-36 kg). Each colour zone has dosages of emergency and premedication drugs, paralytic and induction agents and defibrillation written for children of corresponding estimated weights. For each child, the tape's colour code system was noted and compared. The data were recorded in a pre-designed proforma. Using the age provided by the caregiver, the child's weight was calculated using the APLS and updated APLS formulae<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p><italic>Usage of Broselow tape</italic>: To use the Broselow tape effectively, the child was made to lie down. While maintaining the position of the hand on the red portion at the top of the child's head, the free hand was used to run the tape down the length of the child's body until it was even with the child's heels. The tape that is level with the child's heels provided the child's approximate weight (kg) and the colour zone<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p><italic>Sample size</italic>: The sample size calculations were based on the study conducted by Ramarajan <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. This study showed a consistent overestimate of the weight by the Broselow tape with a 10 per cent or more overestimation in children with &#x0003e;10 kg with an overall line of regression y=1.076x+0.27. At 5 per cent significance, 80 per cent power and assuming an <italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup> or effect size measure of 10 per cent, of weights between the two methods, and a single predictor variable, a sample size of 70 was calculated using an online regression calculator<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis</italic>: Pearson's correlation was used for determining the association between predicted weights and actual weight and was followed by Bland-Altman plots<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> to determine the mean bias and standard deviations (SDs) for the Broselow tape. The percentage difference between the Broselow-predicted weight and the measured weight was calculated as a measure of tape bias [100 &#x000d7; (measured weight - Broselow-predicted weight/measured weight)]. As per the null hypothesis the Broselow-predicted weight was equivalent to the measured weight if the 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) for the mean percentage difference included &#x000b1;5 per cent. The SD of the percentage difference was also calculated to estimate tape precision.</p><p>To maintain consistency with previous literature on the Broselow tape, a Bland-Altman analysis was performed. This method combines bias and precision to determine upper and lower &#x02018;limits of agreement&#x02019; by which the two methods differ. Accuracy of the tape was analyzed with respect to colour-coded zone prediction and weight prediction. First, percentage agreement on the same colour-coded zone by the Broselow tape and the measured weight, as well as percentage overestimation by one or two colour-coded zones, was calculated. Second, the number and proportion of times the Broselow-predicted weight was within 10 per cent of the measured weight was also determined<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Finally, a correction factor for the Broselow-predicted weight was derived by serially testing corrections until the accuracy within 10 per cent for each weight group was maximized. The correction factor was then tested by cross-validation against a random half of the sample as well as by linear regression. This correction factor was applied to the original Broselow-predicted weights, and the new corrected accuracies were obtained.</p><p>The Pearson's correlation coefficient was determined between the actual weight and the weights estimated using APLS and updated APLS formulae. For each of the above methods (weights estimated using APLS, updated APLS formulae and Broselow tape with or without 10% correction), the mean difference (the mean of differences between the actual weight and estimated weight and 95% CI) was computed using paired sample <italic>t</italic> test. The analysis was conducted using SPSS 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, 356 children (age range: 12-138 month) were enrolled in the three groups (&#x0003c;10, 10-18, &#x0003e;18 kg).

Although our study had similar results, the accuracy determined in our study was lower. This marginal difference could be due to different population characteristics.

As proposed by House <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, this could be attributed to greater frequency of childhood malnutrition in general and of severe malnutrition, in particular, in the Indian population.</p><p>Based on the findings of this study, it appears that use of Broselow tape without any modifications to Indian children would lead to administration of excessive doses. If the tape is to be used, modifications such as application of a correction factor or development of an indigenous tape based on local data would be helpful.</p><p>The findings of this study are applicable to children attending public hospitals in India. However, this can be confirmed by undertaking similar studies in other public hospitals in India with a similar patient profile. The data may not be applicable to children belonging to higher socio-economic groups, and those attending private healthcare facilities, as they have been shown to have growth patterns similar to those of children from the West<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Lack of reliable age data of participants forced us to undertake analysis based on weight groups rather than age groups.</p><p>While comparing the estimation of Broselow as against the APLS formulae, the Broselow tape estimations were met with better accuracy as against the APLS formulae. Our study results are similar to those reported by Varghese <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. However, Graves <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> demonstrated that APLS formula was the most accurate method for age-based weight estimation in infants and found that in children over one year of age, the Best Guess formulae should be used. While Luscombe <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> demonstrated that a single weight estimation (weight=3&#x000d7;age+7) was better at estimating weights, Ali <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> opined that the APLS formula should be continued to be used as method of weight estimation.</p><p>Based on the study findings, it can be recommended that the Broselow tape cannot be used without modifications in Indian children attending public hospitals. As the application of 10 per cent correction factor to the Broselow-estimated weight increases the accuracy of the tape to over 60 per cent, this can be made use of in appropriate settings after these
