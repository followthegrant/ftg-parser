Available treatments of NIU, such as the use of topical corticosteroids, are non-specific and have serious side effects which limits them to short-term use; however, NIU requires long-term treatment to prevent vision loss. Therefore, a single dose therapeutic that mediates long-term immunosuppression with minimal side effects is desirable. In order to develop an effective long-term therapy for NIU, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy approach was used to exploit a natural immune tolerance mechanism induced by the human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G). To mimic the prevention of NIU, na&#x000ef;ve Lewis rats received a single intravitreal injection of AAV particles harboring codon-optimized cDNAs encoding HLA-G1 and HLA-G5 isoforms one week prior to the induction of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). AAV-mediated expression of the HLA-G-1 and -5 transgenes in the targeted ocular tissues following a single intravitreal injection of AAV-HLA-G1/5 significantly decreased clinical and histopathological inflammation scores compared to untreated EAU eyes (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.04). Thus, localized ocular gene delivery of AAV-HLA-G1/5 may reduce the off-target risks and establish a long-term immunosuppressive effect that would serve as an effective and novel therapeutic strategy for NIU, with the potential for applications to additional ocular immune-mediated diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Diseases</kwd><kwd>Eye diseases</kwd><kwd>Uveal diseases</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005562</institution-id><institution>North Carolina Biotechnology Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011485</institution-id><institution>North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>550KR211915</award-id><award-id>550KR211915</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirsch</surname><given-names>Matthew L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gilger</surname><given-names>Brian C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1AI072176-06A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirsch</surname><given-names>Matthew L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Uveitis is an inflammation of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid associated with both infectious and non-infectious causes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is a painful disease that causes blindness in approximately 300,000 people annually in the United States and an estimated 25% of all equines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Normally, the blood ocular barrier limits the immune response to intraocular antigens. Any disruption of this barrier, either from systemic disease, trauma or inflammation, can cause this barrier to become leaky and allow blood products and inflammatory cells to enter the eye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The disrupted barrier also enables various host immune responses to react to ocular self-antigens that are not normally recognized by the immune system. Clinical NIU is a lifelong disease process that often develops spontaneous recurrent bouts of inflammation, likely from T cells recognizing additional autoantigens in the ocular tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Conventional treatment of NIU is non- specific, including frequent use of topical and/or systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents; none of which are effective in preventing uveitis relapses. Long-term systemic corticosteroids and other immunomodulating drugs can be used to prevent uveitis flares, but are often inadequate, and are not preferred due to adverse effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, such as glaucoma, cataract, hypertension, infection, and diabetes, all of which may contribute to development of blindness and systemic illness, even death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) animal models have been useful in the study of NIU. EAU is mediated predominantly by CD4+&#x02009;T-lymphocytes, and proinflammatory cytokines, which is very similar to the inflammatory profile in clinical NIU in humans and horses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, blocking proinflammatory T cell cytokines and enhancing anti-inflammatory T cell cytokines is an appealing target for uveitis treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">One approach to immunomodulation, is to target the auto-pathogenic T-cells and inflammatory cytokines that orchestrate and exacerbate the disease process. The human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) is an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory molecule that was first described to play a role in fetal protection against the maternal immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. HLA-G has multiple isoforms that exert multimodal strategies for specific or general immune suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. HLA-G inhibits the function of several types of immune cells, including directly inducing apoptosis of activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Additionally, HLA-G induces tolerogenic dendritic cells, and can promote the expansion of an immunosuppressive T cell subset by upregulating T regulatory cells (including CD4+&#x02009;HLA-G+&#x02009;T<sub>reg</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Non-infectious uveitis (NIH), which is the most common type of uveitis in the United States (prevalence of 121 cases in 100,000 adults, and 129 cases in 100,000 juveniles), is recurrent in its nature and can result in secondary complications such as cataracts, corneal opacities, glaucoma, and blindness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

Such treatments however, are non-specific and have serious side effects which limits them to short term use, and therefore are ineffective as a preventative for recurrent bouts of inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Gene therapy is a promising treatment for NIU. Following a single, localized treatment, AAV-HLA-G would reduce or eliminate the need for long-term corticosteroids while moderating ocular inflammation and preventing secondary tissue destruction in NIU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. AAV vectors, in particular, offer a potentially powerful approach for the treatment of recurrent inflammation, by introducing long term sustained intraocular delivery of therapeutic proteins like HLA-G1/5 at the ciliary body and iris, the targeted sites of the blood ocular barrier breakdown in uveitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par14">In the present study, we observed that intravitreal injection of AAV8-HLA-G1/5 resulted in a significant decrease in ocular inflammation in the EAU rat model. These results were correlated to robust expression of HLA-G1/5 cDNA at the cornea, ciliary body/iris and retina (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). HLA-G&#x02019;s induction of immune tolerance is exerted directly via HLA-G1&#x02019;s inhibitory interactions with nearly all immune cells and indirectly by inhibiting vascularization via the soluble HLA-G5 isoform, the combination of which is hypothesized to prevent self-antigen recognition and immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Previous studies in autoimmunity have found that HLA-G expression reduced the incidence of acute and chronic heart transplant rejection in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and that a single injection of endogenously produced HLA-G could be used as a tolerogenic molecule in skin transplants in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These studies demonstrated that HLA-G inhibits T cell functions and may attenuate clinical rejection by influencing a shift in cytokine expression profiles toward Th2 and production of TNFA, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-10, endogenous immunomodulatory cytokines with potent immunosuppressive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Additionally, the combination of HLA-G1 and HLA-G5 was demonstrated to provide long-term immunosuppressive in corneal inflammation and vascularization of rabbits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In agreement with these studies, our data of scAAV8-HLA-G1/5 treated EAU rats had significantly reduced clinical and histological inflammatory scores following a single intravitreal injection. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge this is the first report to demonstrate the use of HLA-G1/5 as an intraocular immunosuppressive therapeutic.</p><p id="Par15">This study also evaluated topical corticosteroids, a commonly-used therapeutic in the clinic, as a treatment control to compare anti-inflammatory efficacy to intravitreal scAAV8-HLA-G1/5 in EAU rats. The data demonstrated that both treatment groups were able to significantly ameliorate signs of EAU, including a significant difference of clinical and histologic inflammatory scores between EAU with no treatment and both treatment groups (topical corticosteroids and scAAV8-HLA-G1/5) as well as a significant difference between clinical scores between healthy rats with no treatment and both treatment groups. Although clinical and histological inflammatory scores of rats treated with topical corticosteroids were significantly lower than the scAAV8-HLA-G1/5 treated eyes, it is of note that the topical ocular corticosteroids were being dosed four times a day, while the scAAV8-HLA-G1/5 was a single intravitreal injection 1 week prior to the induction of EAU. Additionally, rats treated with topical corticosteroids demonstrated adverse systemic effects, including weight loss (mean of approximately 65&#x02009;g less than other groups) and death, thought to be associated with systemic absorption of the corticosteroid and possibly stress associated with repeated handling required for dosing. Progressive weight loss of&#x02009;&#x0003e;60&#x02009;g has also been documented previously in normal rats after 1 week of topical ocular 0.1% dexamethasone which continued to over 100&#x02009;g weight loss after 4 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This weight loss was accompanied by increased cholesterol and liver enzymes (alanine transaminase [ALT]), therefore systemic absorption of the dexamethasone was considered causative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Though systemic absorption of topical ocular drugs in larger animals and humans may have less of an impact than in rodents, it is an important reminder of the side effects of topical corticosteroid treatment. The dose, volume and environment (healthy vs inflamed eye) in which the scAAV8-HLA-G1/5 is injected intravitreally will need to be explored in future studies to optimize its therapeutic effects.</p><p id="Par16">AAV8 intravitreal injections have been well characterized in animal models and also have been used in humans for the treatment of X-linked retinoschisis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The data herein demonstrate in rats that intravitreal injections of AAV8 prior to the induction of EAU, resulted in significant transduction of the iris/ciliary body with signal also detected in other ocular tissue by qPCR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This finding is consistent with a previous report using very high dose AAV8 intravitreal injections in WT mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. However, results from the sensitive HLA-G expression analysis using RT-PCR demonstrated near equal amounts of cDNA produced among the uvea, cornea, and retina following intravitreal injection of scAAV8-HLA-G1/5, perhaps highlighting the less sensitive nature of immunofluorescence compared to RT-PCR. Given this result, along with concerns regarding the overexpression of HLA-G in some neoplasms, future experimentation is intended to compare the therapeutic effects observed herein to new constructs using ubiquitous and ciliary body-restricted promoters. However, it is noteworthy that HLA-G expression is naturally found in the human retina and cornea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, decreasing concerns of adverse effects from transducing ocular tissues other than the uveal tract.</p><p id="Par17">Despite the promising results described above, our study has some limitations. First, although the safety of AAV-mediated gene therapy of ocular diseases has been established in clinical trials and we did not observe any adverse effects in our study, it is unknown whether long-term ocular HLA-G1/5 expression would result in ocular or systemic adverse effects or promote development of neoplasia. Although it is possible that any immunosuppression may increase susceptibility of ocular infections, because HLA-G is a naturally a component of ocular immune privilege, it is likely that AAV-HLA-G therapy helps to restore the natural ocular immune privilege, not overtly increase risk of infections, at a level less than the use of standard of care topical corticosteroids. Hence, a long-term safety study of local HLA-G is needed, perhaps using a uveal-restricted promoter, prior to clinical use.</p><p id="Par18">Secondly, the therapeutic control group of rats were treated with topical ocular corticosteroids, instead of systemic corticosteroids. In many patients, systemic corticosteroids are avoided due to non-specific immune suppression and other dangerous side effects. Although topical ocular corticosteroid therapy is commonly used to treat NIU, it isn&#x02019;t used as frequently as systemic corticosteroids because frequent topical ocular administration is limited by poor patient compliance. Therefore, it would have been interesting to compare systemic corticosteroid use to intravitreal scAAV8-HLA-G1/5 in rat EAU model.</p><p id="Par19">In summary, we have demonstrated that intravitreal delivery of a single dose of scAAV8-HLA-G1/5 suppressed ocular inflammation in EAU rats. &#x0feff; In contrast to systemic and topical immune suppression, localized gene delivery of HLA-G may significantly reduce the off-target risks and establish a long-term anti-inflammatory effect that would be an effective, novel therapeutic strategy for refractory and recurrent uveitis as well as other ocular autoimmune inflammatory diseases in both human and veterinary patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Vector production and purification</title><p id="Par20">The codon optimized HLA-G1 and HLA-G5 cDNAs were described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Non-specific staining was blocked by using PBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 0.025% Triton X-100, and 1% BSA before overnight incubation with primary antibody. The GFP primary antibody (1:500 dilution, AVES Labs, GFP-1010) and goat anti-chicken secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488, 1:1000, Abcam, A11039) were used to locate GFP expression. After the staining, slides were mounted and counter-stained with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI &#x0feff;(p36971, Invitrogen) and observed with an Olympus IX83 Fluorescence Microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) or Zeiss LSM 780 inverted confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>AAV neutralizing antibody assay</title><p id="Par31">To determine if intravitreal injection of AAV vectors results in an antibody response to the injected capsid, neutralizing antibody assays were performed on HEK 293 cells using a previously reported method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In short, cells were seeded in a 48-well plate at 25,000 cells/well in duplicate on the day prior to vector transduction. The next day, the pre- and post-injection serum was used 1:1 and then serially diluted 1:2 to 1:512 in DPBS to a final volume of 13 ul and incubated with AAV8 CMV-Firefly Luciferase titered to 8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> total viral genomes per replicate in 13 ul DPBS for 2&#x02009;hours at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

Results were plotted to find the point at which the serum dilution suppressed transduction to less than 50% of pre-injection serum levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistics</title><p id="Par32">Group numbers of rats were estimated using power statistics described by Lenth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Comparisons of clinical and histologic scores from the experiments in this study were analyzed initially using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test to evaluate clinical and histologic scores, i.e., to determine if at least one sample dominated. If there was a significant difference, then pairwise Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) tests were performed to evaluate for group differences using JMP version 14.0 (SAS Institute Cary, NC). QPCR data generated from the experiments in this study were analyzed with GraphPad Prism, version 8.0, using the Mann-Whitney test.
