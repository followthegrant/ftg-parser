However, there are indications that cetaceans may learn to associate exposures from distant sound sources with lower perceived risk. To investigate the roles of source distance and received level in an area without frequent sonar activity, we conducted multi-scale controlled exposure experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 3) with 12 northern bottlenose whales near Jan Mayen, Norway. Animals were tagged with high-resolution archival tags (<italic>n</italic> = 1 per experiment) or medium-resolution satellite tags (<italic>n</italic> = 9 in total) and subsequently exposed to sonar. We also deployed bottom-moored recorders to acoustically monitor for whales in the exposed area. Tagged whales initiated avoidance of the sound source over a wide range of distances (0.8&#x02013;28 km), with responses characteristic of beaked whales. Both onset and intensity of response were better predicted by received sound pressure level (SPL) than by source distance. Avoidance threshold SPLs estimated for each whale ranged from 117&#x02013;126 dB re 1 &#x000b5;Pa, comparable to those of other tagged beaked whales. In this pristine underwater acoustic environment, we found no indication that the source distances tested in our experiments modulated the behavioural effects of sonar, as has been suggested for locations where whales are frequently exposed to sonar.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Hyperoodon ampullatus</italic></kwd><kwd>military sonar</kwd><kwd>cetacean</kwd><kwd>marine mammal</kwd><kwd>disturbance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RC-2337</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00014-15-1-2553</award-id><award-id>N00014-16-1-3059</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>March 27, 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Marine mammals rely on sound for their survival and may therefore be affected by anthropogenic noise in their environment. Negative impacts of noise may include hearing loss [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], auditory masking [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], displacement [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and disruption of important behaviours such as foraging and resting [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with potential cumulative long-term population-level effects [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent studies on effects of anthropogenic noise within the marine environment have focused on the vulnerability of mammals to various disturbance sources, including naval sonar [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Several atypical mass strandings of predominantly beaked whales have occurred in close spatio-temporal proximity to sonar exercises [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Though the exact causal pathway remains unclear, the dominant hypothesis is that behavioural change was pivotal [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20182592C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Observational studies using bottom-mounted hydrophone arrays on naval training ranges in the Bahamas [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Hawaii [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported reductions in detections of echolocation clicks indicating that Blainville's beaked whales (<italic>Mesoplodon densirostris</italic>) move away from multi-ship sonar exercises. Experimental studies found that two Blainville's beaked whales [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], two Cuvier's beaked whales (<italic>Ziphius cavirostris</italic> [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) and an individual northern bottlenose whale (<italic>Hyperoodon ampullatus</italic> [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) carrying archival tags called DTAGs exhibited strong responses, including cessation of feeding and avoidance, when experimentally exposed to sonar. The response of a tagged Baird's beaked whale (<italic>Berardius bairdii</italic>) was similar to that of the other three species, but abated more quickly [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These six tagged beaked whales were all close (less than 8 km) to the sound source during the experimental exposures, whereas reactions at longer distances were reported by an observational study involving 16 satellite-tagged Cuvier's beaked whales. That study found that dive behaviour, including deep-dive interval, tended to change during sonar exercises [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Effects were reported to be mediated by source distance and the type of sonar system used, with stronger responses to helicopter-dipping sonars having less predictable movement patterns compared to hull-mounted sonars [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Most of these studies on beaked whales were conducted on or near naval training ranges, where animals are regularly exposed to distant sonars. Animals are more likely to perceive infrequent and unpredictable sounds as a threat [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and previous experience with the stimulus can influence the potential severity of the impact [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that beaked whales on naval training ranges may have learned to associate distant, predictable sonars with a lower perceived risk, thereby altering their responsiveness to distant exposures. By contrast, beaked whales, and other cetaceans, in more pristine acoustic underwater environments may not have made this association.</p><p>We conducted controlled exposures of sonar signals to northern bottlenose whales to investigate the effects of source distance and received level on the onset and magnitude of behavioural responses in an area without frequent sonar activity. Our experimental design aimed to expose individuals to the specific range of received levels that has been associated with behavioural responses in beaked whales, but at radically different distances to the focal whale in contrasting close and distant exposure treatments. We conducted a limited number of &#x02018;multi-scale&#x02019; controlled exposure experiments on this elusive species, each with one focal animal (always carrying a DTAG). To record behaviour across wider spatial and longer temporal scales in each experiment, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) devices and satellite tags were used to observe non-focal animals at greater source distances.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>(a)</label><title>Study area and subject animals</title><p>Fieldwork was conducted in June 2015 and 2016 in waters north of Iceland, near the remote island of Jan Mayen (Norway, 71&#x000b0; N&#x02013;7&#x000b0; W) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182592F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>a</italic>,<italic>b</italic>).

We deployed two types of tags: short-term, high-resolution archival DTAGs [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (<italic>n</italic> = 1 per experiment) that attached to a focal whale with suction cups, or medium-term, lower-resolution position and depth-transmitting satellite tags (experiment 2015-1: <italic>n</italic> = 0, 2015-2: <italic>n</italic> = 3, 2016-1: <italic>n</italic> = 6; electronic supplementary material, table S1). Satellite tags were programmed to continuously collect dive summaries and depth every 2.5 min for 1 day every 7 days. Dive summary profiles consisted of the start time and duration, maximum depth and shape (U, V or square) of each dive.</p><p>The base of operations was a 32 m motorized sailing vessel. A bottom-moored acoustic recorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182592F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>b</italic>) was deployed approximately 100 m above the seafloor to monitor for whale presence before, during and after exposure. For sound propagation modelling, we collected conductivity temperature depth (CTD) or expendable bathythermograph (XBT) measurements at locations between the source and tagged whale and near the mooring.</p><p>Each experimental cycle consisted of five phases: (i) searching, (ii) DTAG deployment, (iii) baseline pre-exposure, (iv) controlled exposure, and (v) post-exposure and DTAG recovery. We tried to satellite tag other groups in the study area throughout the fieldwork period, except during phases (iv) and (v). Once a DTAG was attached to a whale, this became the focal whale, which was tracked by observers visually and with a radio direction finder until the tag released from the animal. (Visual contact was temporarily lost during the distant experiment.) We attempted to satellite tag other individuals in the group for a maximum of 1 h after the DTAG was attached. Controlled exposure started after 4 h of baseline DTAG data were collected.</p><p>Each focal whale (with DTAG) was subjected to either a close or a distant exposure treatment. The source distance at the start of the exposure was less than 1 km (close) or 17 km (distant). In both treatments, we transmitted from the drifting sailing vessel a sequence of simulated sonar pulses that was representative of active sonars used by navies; however, the acoustic source and details of navigation protocol (e.g. positioning of the source, source depth) and transmission protocol (e.g. frequency band, signal type, ramp-up and exposure duration) differed between the treatments (<xref rid="RSPB20182592TB1" ref-type="table">table&#x000a0;1</xref>). These differences resulted predominantly from the two different source systems that were available to the study. Such minor differences in protocol were assumed to be negligible based upon the results from previous sonar behavioural response studies on beaked whales [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20182592C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSPB20182592C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which had comparable differences in source parameters but reported very similar response types and thresholds across studies.

There was more support for a sonar effect that only depended upon SPLmax than for one that only depended upon source distance (&#x00394;AIC 10.6). These results were relatively robust against reduction in the dataset to account for potential non-independence of individuals (electronic supplementary material, table S5). However, ID161593 was particularly influential, and exclusion of this tag together with ID161588 reduced &#x00394;AICs to less than 2. Predictions from the selected model indicated that the satellite-tagged whales' movements were less likely to remain tortuous and more likely to transition from tortuous to high-speed directional at the time of the exposure, compared to baseline (electronic supplementary material, figure S5).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title><p>This study aimed to describe factors affecting responses of beaked whales to sonar in a remote area with little naval sonar activity; an area that can be considered acoustically pristine when compared with locations where similar studies have been conducted. During our experiments, the tagged whales exhibited behaviours that are characteristic for this species [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and other Ziphiids (e.g. [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20182592C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20182592C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]), including sustained avoidance and cessation of feeding, at low received levels. Our results are based on a limited number of experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 3; <italic>n</italic> = 4 for the response intensity analysis), and thus, few exposure contexts and a limited total number of tagged individuals exposed to sonar. Nevertheless, the consistency in the thresholds and types of behavioural responses gives us confidence that these limited data provide novel information crucial to understanding effects of anthropogenic noise on beaked whales.</p><p>The estimated avoidance threshold SPLs (117&#x02013;126 dB re 1 &#x000b5;Pa) we identified for northern bottlenose whales were comparable to those previously measured for one conspecific (130 dB re 1 &#x000b5;Pa [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) and five other beaked whales (98&#x02013;138 dB re 1 &#x000b5;Pa [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20182592C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20182592C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]), but they were greater than 20 dB below the SPL associated with a 0.5 probability of response for Blainville's beaked whales during a multi-ship sonar exercise (150 dB re 1 &#x000b5;Pa (SPLmax over 30 min windows) [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Due to the data resolution of the satellite tags and the lack of a ramp-up protocol during close experiments, the avoidance threshold SPLs of the six satellite-tagged whales and one whale carrying a DTAG (ha15_179b) represent an upper bound of the onset threshold SPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182592F4">figure&#x000a0;4</xref>). The step function for behavioural disturbance in beaked whales, used by the US Navy for environmental compliance [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], already reflects, to some degree, the heightened vulnerability of beaked whales to disturbance by noise from naval activities. However, our results indicate that a 140 dB re 1 &#x000b5;Pa step function still underestimates behavioural disturbance to northern bottlenose whales in the off-sonar range context.</p><p>Tagging studies with Cuvier's beaked whales on or near a naval training range have reported that source distance may affect behavioural responses independent of received level. One Cuvier's beaked whale did not respond to incidental exposures from a distant (approx. 118 km) sonar at a received SPLmax of 106 dB re 1 &#x000b5;Pa [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This SPL was 20 dB below the animal's onset threshold SPL measured during a close experimental exposure but exceeded that of a second animal [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Experimental exposure to high-power sonar from a distant (approx. 70 km) operational navy vessel also did not induce obvious behavioural reactions in another individual at received SPLs of 100&#x02013;120 dB re 1 &#x000b5;Pa [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Satellite tag deployments have also provided indications that source distance may mediate responsiveness. Changes in dive behaviour intensified with source proximity and were more pronounced in response to mid-power helicopter-deployed sonar exposure than in response to high-power ship-deployed sonar exposure at comparable distances within approximately 50 km, despite the lower SL of the mid-power sonar [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Beaked whales near naval training ranges may thus have learned to modulate their responsiveness based upon the perceived level of risk they associate with different source distances, SLs and/or source movements (i.e. the predictability of the exposures).</p><p>Here, source distance (to the 28 km tested) did not appear to influence responses. If the whales in our study associated more distant sources with lower perceived risk, then fewer responses with higher onset threshold SPLs would have been expected at greater distances. Those tagged whales that exhibited behavioural responses at longer distances were all part of the same experiment and in proximity to each other, suggesting that the behaviour of each whale may have influenced others in the experiment to some degree. Indeed, three whales were in the same social group when they were tagged, and the behaviour of these and two other whales around the time of the exposure was sometimes not independent of each other. However, the wide spacing of the tagged animals during exposure and the change in whale presence near the far-removed bottom-moored recorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182592F1">figure&#x000a0;1</xref><italic>c</italic>) suggests that most groups responded independently (unless there was some unknown mechanism). The 2013 experiment off Jan Mayen also may have caused large-scale and sustained area avoidance in northern bottlenose whales [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The tagged whale's displacement in response to that experiment was greater than 33&#x02013;36 km and coincided with a strong decline in acoustic and visual detection densities within a radius of approximately 10 km from the source (beyond which there was no recording effort). Data for northern bottlenose whales therefore do not support the hypothesis that distance modulates beaked whale responsiveness to sonar independent of received level. If bottlenose whales are not inherently more sensitive to disturbance by sonar than other beaked whales, the unpredictability of the exposures (due to the relatively pristine underwater acoustic habitat) could be the reason for the apparent contrast with beaked whale responses to ship-based sonar in areas with frequent sonar activity.</p><p>Cetaceans, and animals in general, might be more behaviourally responsive to anthropogenic noise in relatively pristine areas than in more industrialized areas. Belugas (<italic>Delphinapterus leucas</italic>) in the Canadian Arctic initiated avoidance responses to ice-breaking ships when the vessel noise was estimated to be barely audible to them, at 35&#x02013;50 km [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20182592C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This contrasts with belugas in an area with heavier shipping traffic, where the animals appear adapted to noisy vessels [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Other Arctic cetacean species have also been observed responding to anthropogenic noise at substantial distances from the source [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20182592C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="RSPB20182592C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. An important driver of the responses observed in this study may therefore have been the novelty of the stimulus in this environment, and not the type of stimulus <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p>Most tagged northern bottlenose whales that responded to sonar conducted a deep dive as a response, although some appeared to modify a shallow dive. The satellite-tagged whale (ID161590) that was closest to the source during experiment 2016-1 dove for a duration of 130 min, to a maximum depth that was close to the seafloor (figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182592F1">1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182592F2"/> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20182592F3">3</xref>). This dive duration may be a species record and is certainly feasible, since whalers have reported harpooned northern bottlenose whales diving for over 2 h [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and since Cuvier's beaked whales exposed to sonar can dive for 163 min [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>An important context of this study is that the underwater soundscape near Jan Mayen is largely pristine. A manual inspection of long-term averaged spectrograms of acoustic recordings over a 2-year period during, between and after the two field seasons confirmed that active sonar use is very uncommon in this area, with no naval sonar-like (1&#x02013;10 kHz) signals identified in approximately 1500 h of recordings (S.P.v.IJ. 2018, unpublished data; electronic supplementary material). Some northern bottlenose whales migrate southwards through areas with more frequent sonar activity (e.g. the shelf edge region west of Scotland and Ireland [<xref rid="RSPB20182592C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]) and might hear sonar more regularly. We speculate that the whales might perceive the context of those sonar exposures as different due to the mismatch in time and space with the exposures near Jan Mayen.</p><p>Our approach of monitoring behaviour with complementary observational tools at different spatio-temporal scales during the same experiment was designed to maximize the amount of information per exposure. The approach limited the number of non-tagged individuals exposed in this pristine environment, and it allowed us to observe larger scale responses. The current multi-scale experimental design also has some important caveats, such as the reduced number of contexts in which animals are exposed, potential for non-independence of responses, difficulties in the identification of onset thresholds from lower-resolution data and a current lack of analysis methods to quantitatively integrate results from the different multi-scale sensors. Future studies using multi-scale study designs will require careful consideration of these issues. Here, the experimental design also included a transmission protocol which somewhat limited the interpretation of the data (e.g. close experiments were likely to produce left-censored response onset SPL thresholds). The preliminary evidence provided here should therefore be corroborated by information from additional experiments on northern bottlenose or other beaked whales in areas without frequent sonar activity. Such experiments should preferably expose individuals to received SPLs of 120&#x02013;130 dB re 1 &#x000b5;Pa at source distances greater than the maximum distance of 28 km that was tested here, to understand the full extent of habitat disruption that might be caused by operational naval sonars. This could probably only be achieved by using full-scale sonar sources (i.e. naval ships) during experimental studies, or as observational studies during actual naval exercises. To maximize the outcome and to minimize the number of exposures needed, we recommend the multi-scale approach demonstrated here, combining tags of different resolutions with other sensors such as moored or autonomous passive acoustic sensors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary text, figures and tables</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="rspb20182592supp1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1463" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank everyone involved in the Jan Mayen fieldwork, including Captain Christian Harboe-Hansen and the rest of the ship's crew and science crew, Miguel Neves dos Reis, Eilidh Siegal, Eva Hartvig, Mike Williamson, Naomi Boon, Joanna Kershaw, Hannah Wood, Dave Moretti and Ron Morrissey.
