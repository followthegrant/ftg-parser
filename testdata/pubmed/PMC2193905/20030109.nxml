T lymphocyte immunity, in particular the CD4<sup>+</sup> Th 1 cells, is considered the main defense against these pathogens, and their absence is associated with increased susceptibility. It would seem illogical then to propose vaccinating these vulnerable patients against fungal infections. We report here that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are dispensable for vaccine-induced resistance against experimental fungal pulmonary infections with two agents, <italic>Blastomyces dermatitidis</italic> an extracellular pathogen, and <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> a facultative intracellular pathogen. In the absence of T helper cells, exogenous fungal antigens activated memory CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in a major histocompatibility complex class I&#x02013;restricted manner and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell&#x02013;derived cytokines tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;, interferon &#x003b3;, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor&#x02013;mediated durable vaccine immunity. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells could also rely on alternate mechanisms for robust vaccine immunity, in the absence of some of these factors. Our results demonstrate an unexpected plasticity of immunity in compromised hosts at both the cellular and molecular level and point to the feasibility of developing vaccines against invasive fungal infections in patients with severe immune deficiencies, including those with few or no CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>immunity</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>CD4 help</kwd><kwd>fungi</kwd><kwd>AIDS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Opportunistic fungal infections have become increasingly common, especially in AIDS patients. Infections with <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, <italic>Pneumocystis carinii</italic>, <italic>Coccidioides immitis</italic>, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and <italic>Blastomyces dermatitidis</italic> are collectively a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Treatment of these infections with amphotericin-B must be given for an extended duration, causes frequent and toxic side effects, and generally has to be followed by life-long suppressive therapy with antifungal azoles (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). No vaccines are available against fungi.</p><p>Cellular immunity mediated by T lymphocytes, and in particular CD4<sup>+</sup> Th 1 cells, is considered the main defense against pathogenic fungi (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The fact that AIDS patients with decreased CD4 T cells are predisposed to opportunistic fungal infections supports this premise (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Furthermore, without CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, patients with disseminated cryptococcosis, even with the best available anti-fungal therapy, cannot clear the fungus and sterilize their tissues (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells would appear to be crucial both for acquisition of protective immunity and combat against established opportunistic fungal infections.</p><p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells play a pivotal role in immune responses against many viruses and tumors, and may also contribute to immunity to fungi (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). There are multiple paths for activating native CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Most models have pointed to and clarified the requirement of CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells for activation of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, antiviral CTL have been induced with little or no requirement for CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have been shown to provide self-help in inducing antiviral peptide responses when the cells were present at a sufficiently high precursor frequency (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we tested, in immune-suppressed mice lacking CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, whether we could induce vaccine resistance against experimental infection with two of the principal systemic fungi <italic>B. dermatitidis</italic> and <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>, which cause disease in both immune-competent and immune-deficient hosts, with the latter being more susceptible. We report that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are dispensable for induction of vaccine immunity against both fungal pathogens. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compensate in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. Hence, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells alone, without CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help, can mediate efficient antifungal vaccine immunity. Vaccine resistance by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was restricted by MHC class I and mediated by the production of TNF-&#x003b1;, and to a lesser extent, IFN-&#x003b3; and GM-CSF. Although regulatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; contributed significantly to the expression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity in wild-type mice, each of them also was shown to be dispensable for vaccine immunity in TNF-&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>Our results underscore the plasticity of immune responses in the immune-compromised, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell&#x02013;deficient host. Our findings demonstrate that residual elements of a compromised immune system can be recruited effectively against opportunistic and invasive fungal infections. Our study has general implications for immunologists and others trying to develop vaccine strategies for people with compromised immunity, including AIDS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Fungi.</title><p>Strains used were American Type Culture Collection 26199 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), the isogenic, attenuated mutant lacking BAD1, designated strain #55 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), and <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> strain G217B.

An aliquot of isolated cells was stained for surface CD4 and CD8 using anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 CyChrome mAbs (clone H129.19 and clone 53&#x02013;6.7; BD Biosciences) to determine the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells per lung were derived by multiplying the percentage of cells by the total number of lung cells isolated. The rest of the cells were stimulated for 4 h with anti-CD3 (clone 145&#x02013;2C11; 0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51; 1 &#x003bc;g/ml) in the presence of 2 &#x003bc;M monensin (Sigma-Aldrich) to halt egress of cytokines from the cells. After cells were washed and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, they were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide. Permeabilized cells were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated mAbs and isotype controls (BD Biosciences) for IFN-&#x003b3; (clone XMG1.2), TNF-&#x003b1; (clone MP6-XT22), and GM-CSF (clone MP1&#x02013;22E9) in 20% mouse serum for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C, washed, and analyzed by FACS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Lung cells were harvested serially during infection and stained intracellularly for cytokines. Lymphocytes were gated on CD4 and CD8 and cytokine expression within each gate analyzed. The number of cytokine producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells per lung was calculated by generating the product of percent cytokine producing cells and the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in the lung. Density of cytokine producing T cells in the lung was calculated by dividing the total number of type 1 cytokine producing T cells by the total number of lung hematopoietic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Vaccination and Experimental Infection with B. dermatitidis.</title><p>Mice were vaccinated as described (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) twice, 2 wk apart, each time receiving a subcutaneous injection of 10<sup>5</sup> #55 yeast at each of two sites, dorsally and at the base of the tail, unless otherwise stated. To generate immune CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for adoptive transfer, mice were depleted of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with mAb during vaccination to evoke CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity. These mice were immunized subcutaneously with strain #55 yeast as above, but three times, 2 wk apart. 2 wk after the final vaccination, mice received 200 &#x003bc;g of soluble yeast cytosol extract (YCE)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) or soluble hen egg lysozyme (HEL) as a control antigen emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. 12 d later, draining lymph node cells and splenocytes were harvested and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells purified using &#x003b1;CD8-coated immuno-magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec).

In comparison, 100% of vaccinated, non-T cell&#x02013;depleted mice survived the lethal challenge and cleared the infection. Thus, in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, vaccination greatly prolonged survival and a significant proportion of those animals survived and acquired sterilizing immunity.</p><p>Vaccine immunity evoked in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was durable and persisted for at least 8 wk after vaccination. CD4-depleted mice that were rested for 8 wk after vaccination (but maintained CD4 deficient) remained highly resistant to lethal infection. 6 out of 10 CD4-depleted mice acquired sterilizing immunity and the remaining four mice had 20&#x02013;200 lung CFU 25 d after infection. In contrast, unvaccinated mice appeared moribund with a lung burden of 5.2 &#x000b1; 2.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> CFU at this time point. All vaccinated wild-type mice had cleared the infection. Thus, resting of vaccinated CD4-depleted mice indicated durable immunity and even greater resistance to infection.</p></sec><sec><title>CD4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Mice Acquire Robust Vaccine Immunity.</title><p>Because depletion of CD4 T cells might not be complete, and residual cells could provide sufficient help for other effector cells, we investigated vaccine immunity in CD4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Remarkably, all vaccinated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-knockout mice survived an extended period after infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B); 9 out of 11 had in fact acquired sterilizing immunity, and the other two had low numbers of CFU in their lungs (200 and 280 CFU). Survival data generated with class II-knockout mice were similar to those reported for CD4-depleted wild-type mice.

The architecture and cellular composition of the granulomas in vaccinated mice was unaffected by absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (data not depicted).

Vaccinated wild-type mice and vaccinated, CD4-depleted mice reached their highest densities of effector cells as early as day 4 and maintained them over the period investigated. Despite the significant increase in number of cytokine producing cells after day 8 postinfection, unvaccinated mice never reached the same levels of effector cell density. This was largely a consequence of the increasing number of hematopoietic cells migrating into the lungs (from one million at day 0 up to 20 million cells at day 12), presumably the result of increasing CFU over time in unvaccinated mice. In contrast, in both vaccinated groups of mice, total lung hematopoietic cells increased rapidly to three million cells and remained at that level over the period investigated. Lung CFU fell reciprocally in proportion to the high density of lung effector cells (data not depicted). Thus, vaccine-induced, protective CD8<sup>+</sup> cells likely mediate their effect(s) via production of TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, and GM-CSF.</p></sec><sec><title>CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cells Show Plasticity in Cytokine Repertoire for Vaccine Immunity.</title><p>To ascertain the absolute requirements for IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell vaccine immunity, we vaccinated transgenic mice deficient in these cytokines in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Remarkably, in both transgenic mouse strains, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compensated for the absence of either cytokine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). We analyzed the compensatory mechanisms. In CD4-depleted IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, neutralization of TNF-&#x003b1; or GM-CSF, or depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, during vaccine expression increased lung CFU 980-fold, 206-fold, and 1385-fold, respectively, compared with the rat IgG control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). Hence, TNF-&#x003b1;, and to a lesser extent GM-CSF, regulate expression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;.

Other lines of evidence indicate that resistance against such microbes including fungi is largely mediated by protective CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Thus, it would seem impossible to vaccinate this growing population of immune-compromised patients against opportunistic fungi. To test this premise, we explored whether in immune-deficient mice lacking CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells we could harness residual cellular and molecular elements in vaccine immunity to fungi.</p><p>Herein, we provide evidence that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are dispensable in vaccine immunity against experimental pulmonary blastomycosis and histoplasmosis. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells alone, in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, could induce and mediate vaccine resistance against lethal infections with these pathogenic fungi. We used multiple independent approaches to support our findings. First, we depleted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in wild-type mice during vaccination and throughout infection. Both survival and burden of infection outcomes indicated that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are dispensable for vaccine immunity. Vaccine resistance in CD4-depleted wild-type mice was durable and persisted at least 8 wk after vaccination. Second, vaccination of CD4- or class II-knockout mice genetically deficient in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells confirmed our findings in CD4-depleted wild-type mice. Vaccinated CD4 knockout mice were as resistant as vaccinated wild-type mice and survived a lethal infection. Furthermore, vaccinated CD4-deficient mice mounted a granulomatous inflammatory response in lungs that was comparable to that in wild-type mice. Although granuloma formation is considered a form of delayed-type hypersensitivity requiring principally MHC class II&#x02013;restricted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, other cells and antibodies can replace them. During <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection, granuloma formation in CD4-deficient mice was delayed by about one week vs. wild-type mice, but at later times, the numbers of granulomas in lung and liver sections were comparable (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Third, elimination of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vaccinated CD4-deficient mice during vaccine expression largely abolished resistance, indicating that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are responsible for the resistance. Fourth, resistance by immune CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells could be adoptively transferred to naive mice.</p><p>We saw a subtle difference in the amount of lung inflammation of vaccinated CD4-knockout or -depleted mice versus vaccinated wild-type mice. The former groups had slightly more lung inflammation, but the lung tissue of both immune-deficient groups was still largely devoid of inflammatory cells (93 and 96%, respectively). Pathogenesis and tissue injury is the net result of microbial growth versus the host response to pathogen and collateral tissue damage (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Though vaccine induces protection in CD4-deficient hosts, increased inflammatory response could reflect loss of subsets of T cells important in regulating inflammation.</p><p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have been reported to mediate secondary immunity or vaccine immunity in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells; for example, in secondary immunity to <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and vaccine immunity to <italic>Leishmania major</italic> (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In those studies, experimental animals had an intact immune system upon initial infection or vaccination, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were shown to play a prominent role in protection after rechallenge during the expression phase of immunity. By contrast, in our study, animals congenitally lacked CD4 T cells or had them depleted before they were vaccinated. Hence, they were immune-deficient hosts lacking CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during the induction phase of vaccine immunity (and also during the expression phase). Nevertheless, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells alone were sufficient both for the induction and expression of immunity, and robust resistance was demonstrable against both extracellular and intracellular fungal pathogens.</p><p>According to dogma, induction of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against exogenously processed antigens requires CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). T helper cell&#x02013;induced stimulation of CD40 on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) is a commonly described mechanism that leads to up-regulation of costimulatory molecules and induction of cytokines, such as IL-12, to &#x0201c;condition&#x0201d; an APC to stimulate naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Recent reports provide evidence of some flexibility for the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell requirement. Harty and colleagues (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) reported that during <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection bacterial antigens that did not have access to endogenous MHC class I processing pathways were able to overcome the requirement for CD40L in exogenous antigen presentation to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Bachmann and colleagues (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) showed that DC maturation occurred in vivo after infection with LCMV and vesicular stomatitis virus in the absence of CD40 and T helper cells. This maturation did not require viral infection of DCs but was mediated by peptide-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Wang and colleagues (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) showed that, in the absence of preactivated APCs or of inflammatory signals that substitute for help during bacterial and viral infections (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can help for other responding CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, when present in sufficient numbers. Besides CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, possibly other cells (e.g., NK cells) too can substitute for CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells under appropriate conditions.</p><p>Recently, CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells have been generated by DNA or protein/CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) vaccines in a CD4- and CD40L-independent manner. For example, an immunostimulatory DNA-based vaccine induced CTL to the model antigen OVA through a T helper&#x02013;independent mechanism (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Vaccine-induced CTLs were also able to suppress in vivo growth of the E.G7 cell line transfected with OVA. This study offered early evidence that, in the absence of T cell help, cross priming of CD8 cells by an ODN vaccine induces CTL that lyse &#x0201c;tumor&#x0201d; targets and suppress their growth when they express the model antigen OVA.</p><p>The authors above speculated on whether ODN-based vaccines and cross priming might allow vaccination of immune-deficient hosts. Here, we provide unequivocal experimental evidence of T helper&#x02013;independent vaccination of immune-deficient hosts against infectious diseases, and prove this principle in two separate models of systemic fungal diseases that can commonly afflict AIDS patients. The profile of CD8 immunity raised in our study differed from that where ODN was used. Cho et al. (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) failed to detect type 1 cytokine and Horner et al. (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) detected weak responses using ODN vaccines without T cell help. In our study, CD4-independent, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells generated IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and GM-CSF, which were linked with and essential in vaccine resistance. Maintenance of type 1-cytokine responses may be crucial for control of fungal and other eukaryotic intracellular infections, but dispensable in CTL control of tumor or viral processes.</p><p>An enigma is how CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells become activated during infections with <italic>B. dermatitidis</italic>, a predominantly extracellular pathogen, and with <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>, an intracellular pathogen that resides in the phagolysosome with no demonstrated access to the cytosol. To elucidate how CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are activated, we explored the requirements for MHC class I. An unconventional mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity to <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. neoformans</italic> has been proposed involving direct binding of T cells to the fungi in the absence of MHC and accessory cells. Direct in vitro antimicrobial activity of T cells has been described with <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and against parasites <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>. While the above examples show that T cells can directly inhibit or kill various pathogens in vitro, the circumstances by which direct T cell&#x02013;mediated antimicrobial activity contributes to host defenses in vivo remain unclear. In our study, adoptively transferred CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells protected wild-type mice, but not class I&#x02013;deficient mice, suggesting that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity against <italic>B. dermatitidis</italic> requires MHC class I for antigen presentation and protection.</p><p>Although cross-presentation of exogenous antigens to MHC class I molecules is observed in various infections, the route of uptake and processing, and the compartment where peptides combine with MHC class I may differ. Our recent experiments have shown that protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recognize exogenous fungal antigens largely in a TAP-independent manner (unpublished observations), suggesting a nonclassical pathway for antigen presentation. It will be important to investigate the pathway(s) used for cross-presentation of <italic>B. dermatitidis</italic> and <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> antigens on MHC class I. Their understanding is relevant for the development of vaccines meant to induce protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity to benefit immune-compromised patients.</p><p>Vaccine resistance mediated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells required the production of type 1 cytokines. Independent and combined neutralization of TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, and GM-CSF during the expression phase of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity greatly impaired resistance. TNF-&#x003b1; neutralization reduced vaccine immunity 5-fold or 30-fold more than IFN-&#x003b3; or GM-CSF neutralization, respectively, indicating the hierarchical contribution of these cytokines. On analysis by real time PCR and intracellular staining, lung CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells demonstrated significantly enhanced expression of these type 1 cytokines between 2 to 4 d after infection in vaccinated mice compared with unvaccinated mice. This rapid increase of cytokine expression by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in CD4-depleted mice (and by both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in vaccinated wild-type mice) early after infection coincided with a sharp reduction in lung CFU. Although CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are one important source of these products, we cannot exclude other cellular sources. Even though quantification of cytokine producing T cells in lung revealed significant differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated mice, more refined analysis of the lung microenvironment by laser capture micro-dissection could magnify these differences or demonstrate other cells and products that contribute to vaccine immunity (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p><p>As IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; were key regulators of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated resistance, it was surprising that robust vaccine immunity could be induced and expressed in both IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and TNF-&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Either reciprocal cytokine or alternatively GM-CSF could compensate, illustrating that CD8<sup>+</sup> cells show plasticity similar to CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in their capacity to regulate vaccine immunity (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Hence, IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; are independently regulated and dispensable in vaccine immunity to <italic>B. dermatitidis</italic> infection in a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell&#x02013;deficient host.</p><p>In conclusion, we offer firm evidence, in two independent experimental animal model systems, that fungal vaccines can protect hosts that are immune-compromised at both the cellular and molecular level. Vaccinated animals acquired potent and durable cellular immunity in the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and cytokines critically important for resistance in a normal host. Immune-deficient hosts relied on alternative mechanisms for vaccine immunity. Our findings provide encouragement that vaccines can be designed that will protect even immune-deficient hosts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
