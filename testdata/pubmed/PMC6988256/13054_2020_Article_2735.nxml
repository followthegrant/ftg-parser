They found the Edi during ECCO<sub>2</sub>R weaning was the best predictor of tolerance to removing ECCO<sub>2</sub>R. Interestingly, based on their study, a stepwise weaning protocol for extremely severe COPD is worth being proposed. Their first step was rapid weaning from invasive&#x000a0;mechanical&#x000a0;ventilation (IMV) by correcting respiratory acidosis with ECCO<sub>2</sub>R. Then they used NIV-NAVA to give patients partial respiratory support after extubation. The final step was further weaning from ECCO<sub>2</sub>R guided by Edi prediction. And they used this strategy to get successful early extubation in 20 patients, 12 early weaning from ECCO<sub>2</sub>R, and 19 patients (95%) were finally weaned from ECCO<sub>2</sub>R and discharged home. However, some details in the use of ECCO<sub>2</sub>R and NIV-NAVA are needed to be further clarified.</p><p id="Par3">First, in Karagiannidis&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the investigators applied an average ECCO<sub>2</sub>R blood flow (BF) of 2.1&#x02009;L/min in the initial phase, which is higher than what is typically applied in COPD exacerbations. This may suggest that they actually used a mini-ECMO for both oxygenation support and CO<sub>2</sub> removal in getting an early stabilization and weaning from IMV, rather than the classic ECCO<sub>2</sub>R with low BF of 1&#x02009;L/min or less reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. And the occurrence of progressive hypoxemia has been reported in COPD patients treated by ECCO<sub>2</sub>R, which may need extra oxygenation support with a high BF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, it is still unclear which level of BF and its counterpart extracorporeal support system (ECCO<sub>2</sub>R or mini-ECMO) is more suitable for early weaning in extremely severe COPD.</p><p id="Par4">Second, five major bleeding events occurred during ECCO<sub>2</sub>R in Karagiannidis&#x02019;s report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which prolonged ICU length of stay but had no impact on mortality. Therefore, although rapid extubation with ECCO<sub>2</sub>R would be preferred, such a strategy has to be weighed against the potentially severe complications of ECCO<sub>2</sub>R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Third, the features of the ECCO<sub>2</sub>R circuit are also of crucial importance in determining treatment success. The dual-lumen cannula access facilitated early rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, Karagiannidis and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] did not use a dual-lumen cannula for ECCO<sub>2</sub>R to get an early ambulation. Therefore, dual-lumen cannula may be a factor which may help in avoiding delayed recovery and weaning failure.</p><p id="Par6">Finally, ineffective triggering during NIV is commonly seen in severe COPD patients with high intrinsic PEEP and could lead to NIV failure. NAVA is especially helpful in avoiding ineffective triggering and unloading the patients with good synchronization. Thus, Edi by NIV-NAVA is not only a predictive factor for ECCO<sub>2</sub>R weaning, but also provided better respiratory support during and after ECCO<sub>2</sub>R weaning.</p><p id="Par7">Overall, for investigating the stepwise early weaning strategy of extremely severe COPD from IMV, it will be important to define details about the right requirement of BF and selection of cannula for ECCO<sub>2</sub>R and using NIV-NAVA both for better NIV synchronization and prediction of ECCO<sub>2</sub>R weaning.</p></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>This comment refers to the article available at 10.1186/s13054-019-2404-y.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>HW and HH are responsible for study design, writing, and this manuscript is approved by HH.
