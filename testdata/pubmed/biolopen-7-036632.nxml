Polarity is manifested by the subdivision of the plasma membrane into an apical and a basal side, separated by cell junctions, which define the so-called outer limiting membrane (OLM) (<xref rid="BIO036632C52" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2012</xref>). The basal side comprises the synaptic terminals of the PRCs, which transmit the light-induced visual signals to the post-synaptic retinal network (<xref rid="BIO036632C37" ref-type="bibr">Regus-Leidig and Brandst&#x000e4;tter, 2012</xref>). The apical portion of PRCs is subdivided into two distinct compartments, the inner segment (IS) and the outer segment (OS) (<xref rid="BIO036632C38" ref-type="bibr">Roepman and Wolfrum, 2007</xref>). The OS is a modified primary cilium characterised by stacks of membranous discs containing the visual pigment, which is responsible for absorption of photons (<xref rid="BIO036632C43" ref-type="bibr">Steinberg et al., 1980</xref>). The visual pigment is composed of opsin, a seven-transmembrane domain protein of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, and a covalently bound chromophore, retinal (<xref rid="BIO036632C39" ref-type="bibr">Samardzija et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C44" ref-type="bibr">Suliman and Novales Flamarique, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C50" ref-type="bibr">Yokoyama, 2000</xref>). The IS contains the organelles necessary for protein and lipid biosynthesis and energy production of the cell and can be divided into two different regions in adult PRCs. The most apical area, called the ellipsoid, is characterised by clustered mitochondria. The region between the mitochondria and the nucleus is called the myoid, which contains the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref rid="BIO036632C31" ref-type="bibr">Papermaster et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C46" ref-type="bibr">Tarboush et al., 2014</xref>). The IS can further be distinguished from the outer segment by the localisation of several polarity proteins, such as Crb2a, Crb2b or the atypical protein kinase C proteins, PrkCi and PrkCz (<xref rid="BIO036632C24" ref-type="bibr">Krock and Perkins, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C30" ref-type="bibr">Omori and Malicki, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C52" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2012</xref>). These proteins are also essential for the establishment and maintenance of apico-basal polarity of PRCs. Knockdown or overexpression studies revealed their importance for specification of the apical membrane, epithelial tissue integrity and proper lamination of the retina (<xref rid="BIO036632C9" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C24" ref-type="bibr">Krock and Perkins, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C28" ref-type="bibr">Malicki and Driever, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C30" ref-type="bibr">Omori and Malicki, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Vertebrate PRCs are classified into two major subtypes: rods, which are more sensitive to light and important for dim light vision, and cones, essential for day light and colour vision. Cone PRCs in the zebrafish retina are further subdivided into four classes, based on the expression of different opsin proteins: SWS (short wave or blue-sensitive) cones, LWS (long wave or red-sensitive) cones, MWS (middle wave or green-sensitive) cones and UVS (ultraviolet-sensitive) cones (<xref rid="BIO036632C6" ref-type="bibr">Chinen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C47" ref-type="bibr">Vihtelic et al., 1999</xref>). Based on their morphology, cone PRCs can additionally be divided into two categories: single (UVS or SWS cones) and double cones (MWS, LWS cones) (<xref rid="BIO036632C5" ref-type="bibr">Branchek and Bremiller, 1984</xref>).</p><p>The zebrafish retina develops in a wave-like manner from a simple, undifferentiated epithelium into a complex sensory organ, which is organised into well-defined layers (<xref rid="BIO036632C2" ref-type="bibr">Almeida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C29" ref-type="bibr">Neumann, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C41" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>). The PRC layer first appears in the ventral patch at about 50&#x02005;h post fertilisation (hpf). Although functionally mature PRCs have a complex morphology as described above, they arise from relatively simple columnar precursors (<xref rid="BIO036632C48" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 2014</xref>). Previous transmission electron microscopy studies on the zebrafish retina first detected OSs on the ventral patch at 55&#x02005;hpf (<xref rid="BIO036632C22" ref-type="bibr">Kljavin, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C36" ref-type="bibr">Raymond et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C41" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>). At the same time, the positioning the different organelles allow a clear distinction between the ellipsoid and myoid regions of the IS (<xref rid="BIO036632C41" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>). At 96&#x02005;hpf, two different types of cone PRCs can be distinguished, based on cellular morphology and position within the PRC layer. One cell-type resembles the adult single cone PRCs (UVS or SWS cones), whereas the other resembles the adult double cone PRCs (LWS and MWS cones). By 12&#x02005;days post fertilisation (dpf), all PRC subtypes can be identified. Cone PRCs achieve their full adult dimensions at 15&#x02005;dpf, in comparison to rod PRCs, which are fully matured at 20&#x02005;dpf (<xref rid="BIO036632C5" ref-type="bibr">Branchek and Bremiller, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C14" ref-type="bibr">Hitchcock and Raymond, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C36" ref-type="bibr">Raymond et al., 1995</xref>). In the mature zebrafish retina, UVS cones are the shortest PRCs, while SWS cones are of intermediate size, and double cones, comprised of two non-identical cones adhered together (MWS and LWS cones), are the longest (<xref rid="BIO036632C5" ref-type="bibr">Branchek and Bremiller, 1984</xref>).</p><p>In the past, several studies on PRC polarity establishment, differentiation and maturation have been performed in the zebrafish retina, which provided a more global view of the processes taking place along the whole retina (<xref rid="BIO036632C12" ref-type="bibr">Hamaoka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C24" ref-type="bibr">Krock and Perkins, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C30" ref-type="bibr">Omori and Malicki, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C36" ref-type="bibr">Raymond et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C41" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>). However, a detailed characterisation of the maturation of the different PRCs subtypes, including subtype-specific differentiation of the apical membrane into a photosensitive structure, cellular growth, or organelle distribution is missing. This information would be particularly useful to unravel in more detail the genetic or environmental influences on specific PRC subtypes, and thus could ultimately also contribute to our understanding of the origin of retinal diseases.</p><p>In this study, we characterised the maturation stages of PRC subtypes in the zebrafish retina from 51&#x02005;hpf to 120&#x02005;hpf. The analysis included quantification of growth of the different PRC compartments, localisation of polarity proteins and distribution of different organelles. The results obtained not only allow us to identify subtype-specific features from very early stages onwards, but also provide novel features to determine maturation stages of PRCs development, independent of the age of the developing embryo. The latter is crucial, since the zebrafish retina develops in a wave-like manner (<xref rid="BIO036632C2" ref-type="bibr">Almeida et al., 2014</xref>), where different regions of the retina contain PRCs at different maturation stages, and most zebrafish mutant lines exhibit delayed and/or defective development, which precludes precise staging by embryonic age. We finally applied this knowledge to show that light negatively affects the growth of the IS and OS of LWS cones at late stages of maturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Different compartments of photoreceptor cells show a dynamic growth pattern</title><p>Photoreceptor cells (PRCs) arise from polarised columnar epithelial cell precursors. During development cells grow, and in particular in the apical plasma, which becomes further subdivided into the inner and outer segment (IS and OS). To monitor changes in cell morphology and compartment growth during PRC maturation, we used the transgenic line Tg(Ola.Actb:Hsa.HRAS-EGFP)<sup>vu119</sup> (<xref rid="BIO036632C7" ref-type="bibr">Cooper et al., 2005</xref>), in which the plasma membrane of all cells is labelled with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A). This transgenic will be referred to as Tg(rasGFP) from now on. This line is suitable to distinguish various membrane compartments, such as the adherens junctions, which show co-localisation of transgene-encoded GFP and ZO-1 or actin (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Fig. S1</uri>B). In later stages, this region is defined as the outer limiting membrane (OLM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A, dotted line; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>C). At 72&#x02005;hpf (hours post fertilisation), transgene-encoded GFP additionally marks the OS, as revealed by co-localisation with opsin (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>D). Therefore, the use of Tg(rasGFP) allows us to distinguish the various cellular compartments, i e. the IS, OS and basal membrane, and thus enables the quantification of the growth of the different compartments.

On average, 70 cells from a total of 4&#x02013;6 independent embryos were quantified per timepoint. Statistical significance was calculated by a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. The significance is as follows: ns (non-significant)=<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05, *=<italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05, **=<italic>P</italic>&#x02264; 0.01, ***=<italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.001, ****=<italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.0001.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="biolopen-7-036632-g1"/></fig></p><p>To do so, a time-course was established, starting at 51&#x02005;hpf with the emergence of committed PRC precursors, and finishing at 120&#x02005;hpf. For this time-course, samples were taken at 4&#x02005;h intervals between 51 and 72&#x02005;hpf, when the majority of cells become post-mitotic (<xref rid="BIO036632C13" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2012</xref>), and at 1&#x000a0;d intervals from 72&#x02005;hpf onwards (51&#x02005;hpf, 55&#x02005;hpf, 59&#x02005;hpf, 63&#x02005;hpf, 67&#x02005;hpf, 72&#x02005;hpf, 96&#x02005;hpf and 120&#x02005;hpf). We focused on timepoints up to 120&#x02005;hpf, because by 120&#x02005;hpf all PRCs show their characteristic compartmentalisation (<xref rid="BIO036632C5" ref-type="bibr">Branchek and Bremiller, 1984</xref>). In addition, accurate measurements of PRC OSs are no longer possible at later timepoints due to the growth of the retinal pigmented epithelium. In order to compare different timepoints, all images were taken from an area between the optic nerve and the ventral patch (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>A). This is essential because the retina differentiates in a wave, and different stages of PRC developmental can be observed within the same retina (<xref rid="BIO036632C2" ref-type="bibr">Almeida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C41" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>).</p><p>At 51&#x02005;hpf, the region of interest (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>A) consists of columnar epithelial cells, with the adherens junctions localised apically, separating the apical and basolateral membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>B). Some cells show a round morphology, characteristic of cells in mitosis (arrow in <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>B). Since in fixed tissue it is not possible to define whether a cell has exited the cell cycle, all columnar cells present in the PRC layer exhibiting a simple epithelial structure, i.e. without any obvious subdivision of the apical membrane, will be referred to as PRC precursors. The cell body of PRC precursors varies in size from 8.1&#x02005;&#x000b5;m to 11.1&#x02005;&#x000b5;m at about 51&#x02005;hpf, with an average size of 9.7&#x02005;&#x000b5;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B). Cell body length was measured from the mid-point of the basal membrane to the midpoint of the apical membrane in PRCs with no OS, and from the midpoint of the basal membrane to the midpoint of the base of the OS in cells showing an OS. From 51&#x02005;hpf to 55&#x02005;hpf, no significant change in cell body length was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B).</p><p>Between 55 and 59&#x02005;hpf, IS length and cell body length increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B,D). However, no growth of the basal side occurred during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>C). From this we conclude that the overall increase in cell body length is mostly due to IS growth. No significant difference was observed in IS and cell body length between 59 and 63&#x02005;hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B,D). At these stages, processes extending from the IS were observed both in confocal images and electron micrographs (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</uri>), the nature and importance of which are not understood. For the remaining timepoints, no increase in the average cell body length was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B), while the IS length increased gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D).</p><p>OSs were evident by immunohistochemistry in some cells at 63&#x02005;hpf and in all cells by 67&#x02005;hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A, arrow head). Since no obvious differences in cell morphology were observed between 63&#x02005;hpf and 67&#x02005;hpf, all quantifications of growth were done at 63&#x02005;hpf only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). From 63&#x02005;hpf to 96&#x02005;hpf, a decrease in the basal side was observed. From 72&#x02005;hpf onwards OS size continuously increased in a more linear way while ISs average length only shows a small increase up to 96&#x02005;hpf. However, for both ISs and OSs the variability increased dramatically, as well as the maximum values obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D,E). Surprisingly, the minimum values of IS length by 120&#x02005;hpf show a small decrease when compared to 96&#x02005;hpf, indicating a decrease of IS length in a subset of PRCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D). The high variability in values in both IS and OS length is most likely due to differential growth in the different PRC subtypes. By 120&#x02005;hpf, ISs and OSs reached an average length of 4.8 and 10.2&#x02005;&#x000b5;m, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D,E).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Different PRC subtypes show differential compartment growth</title><p>In order to investigate the growth of the different PRC subtypes we used Tg(rasGFP) retinal sections stained with different opsin antibodies (rhodopsin, UV, red and blue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A), and measured compartments length at the timepoints when the largest variability in values was previously observed, namely 72&#x02005;hpf, 96&#x02005;hpf and 120&#x02005;hpf. Unfortunately, MWS cones could not be identified, since an antibody against green opsin was not available.

Obvious differences were detected at 96&#x02005;hpf and increased over time between UVS cones and other PRCs. However, no significant difference was found among the other PRC subtypes in terms of IS length. Between 72 and 120&#x02005;hpf rods and LWS cones showed significant cell body increase, with an average increase of 25% and 21%, respectively (<xref rid="BIO036632TB1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). In contrast, UVS cones showed an average decrease of approximately 25% (<xref rid="BIO036632TB1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Similarly, the average length of the IS of UVS showed a decrease of 13%, and all other PRC subtypes showed an increase of 134&#x02013;187%. At 120&#x02005;hpf UVS cones showed the smallest cell body and IS, followed by the SWS cones, LWS cones and finally rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B). These data suggest that, with the exception of UVS cones, PRC subtypes show a comparable IS and cell body increase over time.<table-wrap id="BIO036632TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p><bold>Increase in length (%) of different segments of PRC subtypes from 72&#x02005;hpf to 120&#x02005;hpf</bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="biolopen-7-036632-i1"/></table-wrap></p><p>Contrary to the cell body and the IS length, PRC subtypes showed obvious differences in OS height and width already at 72&#x02005;hpf.

At this stage, OS width of cone PRC subtypes showed no significant differences (1.2&#x02013;1.3&#x02005;&#x000b5;m). Rods, on the other hand, showed the greatest width, with an average of 1.6&#x02005;&#x000b5;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B), which will further increase over time.</p><p>From 72&#x02005;hpf to 120&#x02005;hpf, the OS is the cell compartment with the highest increase in length in all PRC subtypes (140&#x02013;392% in OS height and 33&#x02013;77% in OS width) (<xref rid="BIO036632TB1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Additionally, by 120&#x02005;hpf significant differences in OS height and width can be observed among all different types of PRCs. By 120&#x02005;hpf, LWS cones showed the lowest height (5.9&#x02005;&#x000b5;m), followed by SWS cones (7.7&#x02005;&#x000b5;m), rods (8.3&#x02005;&#x000b5;m) and finally UVS cones (12.7&#x02005;&#x000b5;m) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B). By 120&#x02005;hpf rod PRCs are the widest at 2.7&#x02005;&#x000b5;m, followed by UVS cones at 2.3&#x02005;&#x000b5;m, SWS cones at 2.0&#x02005;&#x000b5;m, and finally LWS cones at 1.6&#x02005;&#x000b5;m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B).</p><p>To summarise, cone PRCs with larger OS height also show larger OS width. In addition, differences in OS size exist not only between rod and cone PRCs, but also among cone PRC subtypes. Surprisingly, smaller IS length correlated with larger OS length. These data highlight the importance to carefully distinguish PRC subtypes when analysing PRC growth for timepoints later than 72&#x02005;hpf.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Polarity proteins show differential localisation at early stages of PRC maturation</title><p>In zebrafish, the polarity gene <italic>crb2a</italic> (<italic>oko meduzy, ome</italic>) and <italic>crb2b</italic> were shown to have an impact on apical growth of PRCs (<xref rid="BIO036632C17" ref-type="bibr">Hsu and Jensen, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C30" ref-type="bibr">Omori and Malicki, 2006</xref>). Localisation of these two proteins during the initial stages of PRC maturation has not yet been investigated. Therefore, we stained retinal sections of Tg(rasGFP) embryos with antibodies specific for Crb2a and Crb2b. In addition, we used an antibody against both PrkCi and PrkCz, another apical marker, to better follow the development of polarity during early stages of PRC maturation (between 51 and 63&#x02005;hpf). From now on we will refer simply to PrkC when referring to the combination of both PrkCi and PrkCz.</p><p>At 51&#x02005;hpf, both Crb2a and PrkC are localised to the entire apical membrane of PRC precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A). With the formation of the IS at 55&#x02005;hpf, Crb2a becomes restricted to the lateral membrane of the IS, defining the SAR (subapical region), and was undetectable in the most apical membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>B). In contrast, PrkC was detected both at the free apical membrane and the SAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>B). Unlike Crb2a and PrkC, Crb2b could not be detected when the IS first emerged (55&#x02013;59&#x02005;hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>C).

Based on the literature (<xref rid="BIO036632C52" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2012</xref>), we trust these PRCs to be LWS, SWS and MWS cones. These data point to a dynamic expression and localisation of polarity proteins in the initial stages of PRC maturation, suggesting specific functions for each of them. Additionally, this difference in localisation could be used as a marker for more precise staging of maturing PRCs.

At 55&#x02005;hpf, before OS can be detected by TEM, mitochondria are localised to the apical region of PRCs, however, no distinction between myoid and ellipsoid regions is yet possible at this timepoint (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</uri>). Additionally, we used Tg(mito:GFP), a transgenic line that tags mitochondria with GFP, to follow mitochondrial localisation during later stages of PRC maturation. At 72&#x02005;hpf, the mitochondrial clusters in all cells are aligned in a single row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>C).

These changes are due to the different positioning of the IS of distinct PRC subtypes within the PRC layer.</p><p>Another potential marker for PRC maturation is positioning of PRC nuclei. The nuclei of PRC subtypes were reported to localise at different levels in the outer nuclear layer from early stages of development onwards (<xref rid="BIO036632C10" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C22" ref-type="bibr">Kljavin, 1987</xref>). To better understand changes in nuclear positioning during PRC maturation, we used confocal microscopy to visualise nuclei stained with DAPI, and TEM. Nuclei of zebrafish embryos up to 63&#x02005;hpf showed a rectangular shape and no differences could be observed among different PRC subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>D). However, from 72&#x02005;hpf onwards, nuclei start to occupy different levels. At 96&#x02005;hpf, two independent layers of nuclei were obvious, which became more pronounced in PRCs at 120&#x02005;hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>D).</p><p>When studying nuclei positioning by TEM, we noticed changes in chromatin organisation in a subset of PRCs at later stages of development. In some vertebrates, such as mouse, rods were shown to have differences in chromatin organisation, which could be essential for PRC function (<xref rid="BIO036632C42" ref-type="bibr">Solovei et al., 2009</xref>). In order to understand if the differences in chromatin organisation observed in zebrafish are PRC subtype-specific, we studied the retina of embryos at 72&#x02005;hpf, 96&#x02005;hpf and 120&#x02005;hpf by TEM. Up to 96&#x02005;hpf, all nuclei showed a similar distribution of chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>A), with dark staining enriched at the nuclear envelope and in irregular clusters, probably representing heterochromatin, and lighter staining in the nuclear interior between heterochromatin compartments, probably representing euchromatin. Surprisingly, by 120&#x02005;hpf a subset of cells showed a more homogeneous distribution of chromatin (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>B). Based on cell morphology and mitochondria positioning, cells with modified chromatin organisation are likely to be UVS cones.</p><p>To corroborate this assumption, we performed antibody stainings for H3K4me3, a marker for euchromatin, in the [Tg(-5.5opn1sw1:EGFP) transgenic line (<xref rid="BIO036632C45" ref-type="bibr">Takechi et al., 2003</xref>)], which marks the cytosol of UVS cones with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>C). At about 96&#x02005;hpf, all nuclei have a similar distribution of euchromatin. However, at 120&#x02005;hpf, no antibody staining for H3K4me3 could be detected in nuclei (stained by DAPI) of GFP positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>C), which is in accordance with the TEM data described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>A,B). Our results are the first to show a change in chromatin organisation in nuclei of the zebrafish retina, and that these changes seem to be specific for UVS cones.</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that organelle distribution and chromatin organisation can be used as a novel and more precise way to stage PRC maturation and to help distinguishing the different subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Apical expansion of PRC during maturation is dependent on light exposure</title><p>The differential growth behaviour of individual PRC compartments, combined with the tools that allow to more precisely determine the developmental stage and subtype of maturing PRCs presented above, puts us into a much better position to study the impact of the genetic background and environmental influences on PRC maturation. Here, we concentrated on the role of light on the growth behaviour of PRCs. It has been shown that light exposure results in a decrease of OS size of human PRCs (<xref rid="BIO036632C1" ref-type="bibr">Abr&#x000e0;moff et al., 2013</xref>), and in changes of the positioning of the myoid in adult zebrafish PRCs (<xref rid="BIO036632C15" ref-type="bibr">Hodel et al., 2006</xref>). However, no data exist so far that show any influence of light on PRC growth during embryonic zebrafish retinal development. Therefore, we compared OS volumes and IS lengths of embryos raised either in the dark, in a dark/light cycle (10&#x02005;h dark/14&#x02005;h light), or in constant light at 72&#x02005;hpf and 120&#x02005;hpf. To avoid variability due to the different developmental stages present in the retina, we focused on cells at the ventral and dorsal side of the optic nerve, with the exception of the ventral patch. Additionally, we used positioning of nuclei and ER as described above as markers for PRC maturation. No changes in these parameters were observed under the different light conditions (data not shown), showing that there was no overall delay in retinal development and apical differentiation. Due to the size variability observed when globally measuring all PRCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>), we focused the analysis on LWS cones, one of the most abundant PRC subtypes in the zebrafish retina. Additionally, this cone subtype is the only one for which a transgenic line, expressing mKate-tagged opsin and thus marking the OS, is available [TgBac(opn1lw1:opn1lw1-mNeonGreen/opn1lw2:opn1lw2-mKate, referred to as Tg(LWS)] (<xref rid="BIO036632C8" ref-type="bibr">Crespo et al., 2018</xref>). This transgenic line, in combination with phalloidin staining, allowed for clear visualisation and quantification of IS and OS size of LWS cones. The IS was defined as the region between the junction, marked by phalloidin, and the base of the OS, marked by mKate2. The clear signal of mKate-opsin allowed for reliable segmentation and volume quantification of OS. At 72&#x02005;hpf, no significant differences were observed in OS volume and IS length at the different light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F6">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>A). By 120&#x02005;hpf, ISs of LWS cones showed a significant increase in length under all light conditions. However, the degree of increase was dependent on light. While in constant darkness IS length increased by an average of 81%, IS length of PRCs exposed to light/dark cycles or constant light only increased in length by an average of 77% and 60%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F6">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>A). A similar influence of light was observed with respect to OS volume. For embryos exposed to constant light, no obvious OS increase was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F6">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>A). In contrast, for embryos raised either in constant darkness or in light/dark cycles, an increase in OS volume was observed. While OSs of embryos raised in constant darkness showed an average increase in volume of 296%, those exposed to light/dark cycles only increased by 104%. This suggests that light exposure could significantly delay apical membrane growth during PRC maturation. Alternatively, this could be also due to changes in OS discs shedding.

To this end, we quantified the size of individual cellular compartments, the localisation of polarity proteins and the positioning of organelles during early stages of PRC maturation, i.e. from about 51&#x02005;hpf to 120&#x02005;hpf. One of the observations of this study was the anisotropic and subtype-specific growth of PRC compartments (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Table&#x000a0;S1</uri>). After the emergence of the OS, the ISs show an overall growth over-time in all PRC subtypes, with the exception of the UVS cones, in which the IS length decreases. This is in contrast to the basal sides, which shows an obvious decrease in all PRCs by 96&#x02005;hpf. One may speculate that this reduction could be the result of the folding of the membrane on the basal side during synapse development (<xref rid="BIO036632C41" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>). The OS of all PRC subtypes is the compartment with the highest growth rate over time. Interestingly, the smallest ISs were found in those cones that had the largest OSs. This inverse correlation could be important for the OS to reach the retinal pigment epithelium, which is essential for PRC function and maintenance.</p><p>The other important finding of this work was the identification of cellular features, which can be used to distinguish PRC subtypes from early stages on. In addition, the data led us to define phenotypic criteria allowing a more precise retinal staging, which is necessary when the developmental age of zebrafish embryos cannot be used, e.g. in certain mutants. In the following paragraphs, we will elaborate on these two features during maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F7">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Table&#x000a0;S1</uri>).

No subdivision of the apical membrane is obvious. Maturation during this period is characterised by an expansion of the apical side only, while no significant changes are observed in the basal side of the cells. Interestingly, the initially rapid growth of the IS slows down at the time when OS are first detected by immunohistochemistry. The discrepancy in the timepoint of OS appearance described here (63&#x02005;hpf) and in an earlier study (55&#x02005;hpf) (<xref rid="BIO036632C41" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>) could be explained by differences in the sensitivity of both techniques and minor differences in positioning the region of interest, which thus would contain PRCs at slightly different maturation stages due to the wave-like differentiation of the retina.</p><p>As early as 72&#x02005;hpf, rods are the first PRCs that can be distinguished from the other PRCs by the transient accumulation of rough ER in the ellipsoid, a region that becomes distinct from the myoid area around the same time when the OSs appear (<xref rid="BIO036632C20" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). The transient accumulation of ER in rods is not only a suitable tool to identify this particular PRC subtype at this stage, but its transient nature can also be used for determining the maturation stage. The temporal coincidence of the onset of OS formation and ER accumulation in the ellipsoid of rods let us to speculate that this may be due to meet the increased demand of protein and lipid biosynthesis required for OS membrane formation of rods, one of the PRC subtypes with the largest growth.</p><p>Nuclei and mitochondria positioning provides useful criteria for defining maturation stages after 72&#x02005;hpf. Up to 72&#x02005;hpf, all nuclei occupy a central position in each cell, thus forming a single row of nuclei in the retina. From 96&#x02005;hpf onwards, two separate nuclear rows are visible, which is more pronounced at 120&#x02005;hpf. Similarly, two independent rows of mitochondria are observed by 96&#x02005;hpf, which resolve into three rows at 120&#x02005;hpf. This is in accordance with previous studies, which described mitochondria in different positions from 96&#x02005;hpf onwards (<xref rid="BIO036632C46" ref-type="bibr">Tarboush et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, Tarboush&#x02019;s study reported differences in mitochondria size between rods (small mitochondria) and cone PRCs (megamitchondria) from 96&#x02005;hpf, which can also be used as a marker for rod PRCs (<xref rid="BIO036632C46" ref-type="bibr">Tarboush et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>At 120&#x02005;hpf, all four PRC subtypes can be distinguished. UVS cones can be defined at this stage by having more homogenously dispersed heterochromatin. This is comparable to the inverted chromatin organisation observed in mouse rods (<xref rid="BIO036632C42" ref-type="bibr">Solovei et al., 2009</xref>). In biological tissues, the degree of light scattering depends on the wavelength of the light; the lower the wavelength, the more light scattering occurs (<xref rid="BIO036632C19" ref-type="bibr">Jacques, 2013</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesise that changes in chromatin organisation of UVS cone nuclei could help to reduce light scattering during development by acting as a lens that channels light in the UVS OS, a function similar to that suggested for the inverted chromatin shown in mouse rods (<xref rid="BIO036632C42" ref-type="bibr">Solovei et al., 2009</xref>). At 120&#x02005;hpf the different PRC subtypes can additionally be distinguished by differences in IS and OS size. UVS cones show the shortest IS length, PRCs showing the largest width of the OS could be defined as rods, and UVS cones have the longest OS, followed by rods, SWS and LWS cones.</p><p>Based on our data, we would suggest to define six stages of PRC maturation, from precursors to 120&#x02005;hpf, namely PRC precursor stage and maturation stage (MS) 1&#x02013;5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO036632F7">Fig.&#x000a0;7</xref>; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.036632.supplemental">Table&#x000a0;S1</uri>). The first three stages of PRC maturation (PRC precursor, MS1 and MS2) were categorised based on cell morphology. The PRC precursor stage is characterised by cells with a columnar morphology and the absence of an obvious subdivision of the apical side. MS1 begins with the growth of the apical side and the appearance of the sub apical region (SAR) defined by the presence of Crb2a. This stage is mainly characterised by the growth of the presumptive inner segment (IS). MS2 is characterised by the onset of outer segment (OS) growth and expression of Crb2b. In these initial three stages (PRC precursor, MS1 and MS2) no morphological differences are observed among different subtypes of PRCs. MS3, MS4 and MS5 were defined as independent maturation stages based on a combination of morphological and cellular traits (e.g. growth rates of different cell compartments, morphological differences among different subtypes of PRCs, and distribution of cell organelles). These stages are of particular interest because they have been widely investigated in previous studies of zebrafish retinal development (<xref rid="BIO036632C24" ref-type="bibr">Krock and Perkins, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C34" ref-type="bibr">Raghupathy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C46" ref-type="bibr">Tarboush et al., 2014</xref>). At MS3, nuclei show small changes in their shape and positioning; mitochondria of all PRC subtypes are perfectly aligned in the PRC layer, forming a single row, and rods show an accumulation of ER. At MS4, two rows of mitochondria and nuclei become visible in the PRC layer. Moreover, changes in OS length, a decrease in the IS of UVS cones, and a striking decrease of the basal side of PRCs occur. By MS5, mitochondria localised in the ellipsoid of all PRCs appear in three rows. Taking together the average of IS length of the different PRCs and previous reports on the zebrafish retina (<xref rid="BIO036632C5" ref-type="bibr">Branchek and Bremiller, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C10" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C41" ref-type="bibr">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>), we hypothesise that the upper mitochondrial row corresponds to LWS cones together with rods, the second to SWS cones and the third to UVS cones. Additionally, UVS cones show alterations in chromatin organisation, and striking differences in OS and IS length are observed in PRC subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Effect of prolonged exposure to light on PRC maturation</title><p>The zebrafish is ideally suited to study retinal development and has turned out as a useful model to unravel the cellular and molecular basis of human retinal diseases (<xref rid="BIO036632C11" ref-type="bibr">Gestri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C26" ref-type="bibr">Link and Collery, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C33" ref-type="bibr">Raghupathy et al., 2013</xref>). However, genetic and environmental perturbations often also affect the developmental rate. For example, retinoic acid results in a delay of cone maturation (<xref rid="BIO036632C18" ref-type="bibr">Hyatt et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, a staging scheme is required, which allows embryos to be staged according to their maturation age, independent of the time elapsed since fertilisation. Having established a detailed timeline for PRC maturation in wild-type zebrafish embryos, we applied this knowledge to analyse the influence of light on the maturation of LWS cones. Previous reports already demonstrated light-dependent effects on IS and OS size in different vertebrates and even flies (<xref rid="BIO036632C1" ref-type="bibr">Abr&#x000e0;moff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C15" ref-type="bibr">Hodel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C32" ref-type="bibr">Pocha et al., 2011</xref>). At about 72&#x02005;hpf, no significant changes were observed in IS and OS length of embryos exposed to different light conditions (constant light, light/dark cycle and constant dark). However, when embryos were grown under light/dark cycles for 120&#x02005;hpf, IS and OS length had a lower increase compared to their siblings raised in constant darkness. This phenotype was even more pronounced when embryos were raised in constant light. The changes in IS length could be the result of changes in the myoid elongation. On the other hand, changes in OS growth of embryos exposed to constant light could be explained by the mislocalisation of a substantial portion of opsin in cell bodies of LWS cones, which was very rarely detected under the other two light conditions. Previous findings demonstrated that zebrafish embryos exposed to constant light show a decrease in red opsin mRNA expression (<xref rid="BIO036632C25" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2005</xref>). So we cannot exclude the possibility that a decrease in red opsin protein due to decreased red opsin mRNA may contribute to decreased OS growth under constant light. Alternatively, the changes in OS volume could be due to changes in discs shedding, which is influenced by light/dark cycles (<xref rid="BIO036632C3" ref-type="bibr">Basinger and Hollyfield, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C4" ref-type="bibr">Besharse and Hollyfield, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C23" ref-type="bibr">Kocaoglu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C51" ref-type="bibr">Young, 1967</xref>).</p><p>Mislocalisation of opsin has been linked to retinal degeneration, both in vertebrates and flies (<xref rid="BIO036632C16" ref-type="bibr">Hollingsworth and Gross, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C27" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C32" ref-type="bibr">Pocha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C35" ref-type="bibr">Raghupathy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="BIO036632C49" ref-type="bibr">Xu and Wang, 2016</xref>). However, the fact that the IS still grows under constant light conditions suggests that PRCs are still maturing.</p><p>To conclude, the extensive characterisation of PRC subtype maturation in the zebrafish retina provides a platform for further studies of retinal development and disease. In addition, our work highlights the importance of carefully controlling light conditions under which the fish are raised, and thoroughly paying attention to identify PRC subtypes when performing quantitative analyses of PRC maturation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Adult zebrafish were maintained at 28&#x000b0;C under standard conditions in a 14&#x02005;h on/10&#x02005;h off, light/dark cycle.
