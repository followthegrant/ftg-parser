This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of LMWH on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice, in which acute colitis progresses to chronic colitis, and to explore the potential mechanism involved in this process. C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into control, DSS, and DSS plus LMWH groups (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;18). Disease activity was scored by a disease activity index (DAI). Histological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The mRNA levels of syndecan-1, interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, and IL-10 were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression of syndecan-1 was detected by immunohistochemistry. The serum syndecan-1 level was examined by a dot immunobinding assay. LMWH ameliorated the disease activity of colitis induced by DSS administration in mice. Colon destruction with the appearance of crypt damage, goblet cell loss, and a larger ulcer was found on day 12 after DSS administration, which was greatly relieved by the treatment of LMWH. LMWH upregulated syndecan-1 expression in the intestinal mucosa and reduced the serum syndecan-1 level on days 12 and 20 after DSS administration (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 vs. DSS group). In addition, LMWH significantly decreased the expression of both IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-10 mRNA on days 12 and 20 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 vs. DSS group). LMWH has therapeutic effects on colitis by downregulating inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting syndecan-1 shedding in the intestinal mucosa.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (YC, 81070291), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (YC, China, NCET-10-0091), the Medical Research Fund of Guangdong Province (XJ, A2010364), and the Ministry of Education and Guangdong province University-industry cooperation projects (SDL 2011B090400018).

Syndecan-1 plays an important role in promoting wound repair, maintaining cell morphogenesis, and mediating inflammatory responses <xref rid="pone.0066397-Gotte1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition, syndecan-1 participates in the composition of tight junctions and maintains mucosal barrier function <xref rid="pone.0066397-Alexopoulou1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that syndecan-1 is shed and released into the blood and that syndecan-1 shedding is an important mechanism by which neutrophilic inflammation is relieved by aiding the clearance of proinflammatory chemokines in a heparan sulfate-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0066397-Hayashida1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066397-Fitzgerald1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066397-Andrian1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

In this study, we fed C57BL/6 mice with 3% DSS solution for 5 days, followed by distilled water for 2 weeks, and established an ideal colitis model in which clinical and pathological changes were similar to those of human colitis. Acute clinical symptoms (diarrhea, guaiac-positivity, and/or grossly bloody stool) appeared within five days after DSS treatment, which were associated with crypt damage, goblet cell loss, ulcers, neutrophil infiltration of the epithelium and lamina propria, and elevated DAI values. Animals treated with DSS for 5 days, followed by 14 days of water, developed chronic colitis with the following features: loose stools, crypt and goblet cell regeneration, gland repair, and lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration of the mucosa and submucosa. These results suggested that DSS could induce acute and chronic colitis accompanied with inflammatory responses in the mice.</p><p>We found that DAI, histological score, and mRNA levels of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-10 in the DSS and the DSS plus LMWH groups were greater than those in the control group.

In this study, we found that LMWH downregulated the levels of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-10 in colitis mucosa, reduced the shedding of syndecan-1, and ameliorated colitis induced by DSS. The exact anti-inflammatory mechanisms of LMWH remain unclear. We presumed that LMWH may inhibit inflammation via the following routes.</p><p>LMWH may act on upstream cytokine pathways, reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-10) and thus alleviate the inflammation reactions in DSS-induced colitis. The reduced expression of IL-1&#x003b2; might lead to the upregulation of syndecan-1 in the intestinal mucosa through reducing the synthesis of matrixmetalloproteinase-7 <xref rid="pone.0066397-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>LMWH may inhibit syndecan-1 shedding via the inhibition of heparanase. Heparanase is an endo-beta-D-glucuronidase capable of cleaving heparan sulfate (HS) side chains, yielding soluble syndecan-1. The colonic epithelium is the major heparanase producer under chronic inflammatory conditions. In inflammation processes, heparanase is also activated and further promotes syndecan-1 shedding and weakens its functions <xref rid="pone.0066397-Waterman1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. LMWH has been shown to be efficacious in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients by inhibiting the activity of heparanase <xref rid="pone.0066397-Prajapati1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>LMWH is a structural and functional analogue of the syndecan-1 heparan sulfate chains and possesses ligand binding properties similar to syndecan-1 <xref rid="pone.0066397-Bernfield1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066397-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066397-Yip1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. For example, LMWH can be a coreceptor of FGF in epithelial cell lines <xref rid="pone.0066397-Day2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0066397-Nikolova1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. It has been proposed that heparan sulfate might be secreted by epithelial cells to maintain an intact intestinal barrier after the shedding of dead epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0066397-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Deficiency in syndecan-1 contributes to the increased severity of DSS colitis, which promotes delayed wound repair and re-epithelialization, and the function of syndecan-1 could be restored with heparin treatment <xref rid="pone.0066397-Floer1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Consistent with previous results <xref rid="pone.0066397-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, we found that the mRNA and protein expression of syndecan-1 in the colonic mucosa of DSS-induced colitis was greatly decreased, while the syndecan-1 level in serum was much greater. Furthermore, in the DSS plus LMWH group, LMWH greatly increased syndecan-1 expression after DSS administration and reduced the serum syndecan-1 level, compared with the DSS group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). These results indicate the involvement of syndecan-1 in DSS-induced colitis and suggest that LMWH, as a substitute of the free syndecan-1 ectodomain, might prevent or relieve colitis inflammation by inhibiting syndecan-1 shedding in the colonic mucosa. Further investigation of the role of syndecan-1 shedding in the pathogenesis of colitis is needed.</p><p>In summary, our present study provides valuable insights into the anti-inflammatory role of LMWH in the treatment of colitis. Future studies will be necessary to explore the mechanism of LMWH-mediated inhibition of syndecan-1 shedding in this process. These studies will provide evidence to support the promising application of LMWH in the treatment of colitis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Pyong Woo Park (Children's Hospital of Harvard University) for monoclonal rat anti-mouse antibody of syndecan-1.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0066397-Wolf1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
