Cities are the territories that concentrate higher health inequalities and ageing and gender are axes of inequality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Lastly, there is a worldwide demographic shift towards a more aged society and towards urbanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, older people living in socio-economic deprived urban areas should be a specific focus for health inequality policies since they&#x000a0;especially suffer its effects.</p><p id="Par10">Despite the growing attention on health inequalities since 1980s, and the progress made in the last years in the development of policies and interventions to reduce them, strategies to reduce health inequalities are heterogeneously implemented and the group of older people has been insufficiently targeted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Current evidence is strong in&#x000a0;explaining the contribution of specific factors to health inequalities but not on the effectiveness of policies and interventions to reduce them, since it does not often fulfil the highest scientific standards. Consequently, more rigorous evidence-based approaches are needed to inform policymaking in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this respect, the emerging methodologies that address complex interventions could be valuable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">It has been raised that focusing on intermediate effects of interventions that target indicators such as the prevalence of health determinants can be useful to reach the WHO goal of reducing health inequalities by 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this vein, self-perceived health could be a useful indicator since it correlates with general health status, mortality and morbidity, as well as health inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Likewise, health promotion and salutogenesis emphasize the need to improve the perception of health, along with wellbeing and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">It is acknowledged that the reduction of socioeconomic inequalities in health requires comprehensive strategies with sustained actions addressing social determinants of health instead of isolated&#x000a0;actions. Innovative strategies have been identified as effective in five policy areas: policy steering mechanisms, labour market and working conditions, territorial approaches, consumption and health-related behaviour and health care. Hence, two main strategies have been defined: addressing upstream factors with actions related to income, employment and education, and addressing downstream factors with health-related actions targeting health-related behaviours such as food consumption, smoking, and physical exercise. Healthy lifestyles can be promoted by universal and targeted approaches. Targeted approaches can be part of more general strategies and can be directed towards specific groups in terms of age, sex and other socio-demographic characteristics&#x000a0;such as living in lower socioeconomic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Promoting <bold>self-care habits</bold> to increase healthy nutrition and physical activity among socioeconomically disadvantaged older people should contribute to reducing their increased risk of morbidity, mortality and disability related with health inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Likewise, adopting measures to improve personal and community health has been linked with the level of knowledge, personal skills and confidence. Accordingly, <bold>health literacy</bold> has been defined as the cognitive and social skills that determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access, understand and use information in ways that promote and maintain good health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Low health literacy is related with poor participation in preventive and health promotion activities, worse chronic disease self-management, an increase of hospital stays, and higher mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, specific interventions to increase health literacy could contribute to self-care habits.</p><p id="Par15">Accordingly, despite social determinants of health are mainly outside the health care system, health-related actions such as <bold>interventions promoted by local primary health care agents</bold> may be of special interest to influence intermediate determinants of health inequalities that are potentially modifiable such as health-related behaviours, i.e., self-care habits and health literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Additionally, <bold>social capital</bold> is considered a social determinant of health, cross-cutting the structural and intermediary determinants, with features linked to both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, strengthening social capital has been also included in comprehensive packages of policies and interventions to reduce inequalities in health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, there are controversies on the definition of social capital and its implications on health inequalities. In this study, <bold>social capital</bold> follows Putnam&#x02019;s approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and is defined according to the conceptual model developed by Islam and adapted to ageing by Nyqvist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] as an umbrella concept that includes individual (family and friends) and collective (community) social resources, as well as structural (social networks, contacts and participation) and subjective (social support and sense of belonging) aspects. Several observational studies have shown social capital components as consistent protective health factors regarding a variety of outcomes such as mortality and self-perceived health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Whereas the evidence from randomized controlled trials assessing health effects of social capital interventions is still uncertain but promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, social capital could be part of a multi-component strategy to address health inequalities.</p><p id="Par17">Finally, <bold>social capital components, self-care and health literacy</bold> could reinforce each other reaching synergistic effects on health outcomes, e.g., social support increases self-care while health literacy is associated with healthier habits and higher social participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Accordingly, after an initial intervention design based on these three pillars, a pilot study was conducted to explore the feasibility of the intervention, the recruitment strategy and evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale of the study</title><p id="Par18">There is a need to build new intervention strategies based on modifiable intermediate factors to reduce health inequalities. The design of these strategies should consider the synergistic effects of self-care, social capital and health literacy. The effectiveness of these interventions should be robustly assessed considering their complexity to build an evidence-base for public health policy and practice.</p><p id="Par19">Therefore, we aim to <bold>develop and assess the effectiveness of an intervention</bold> designed to promote self-management, health literacy and social capital targeting older people from urban socioeconomically disadvantaged areas who perceived their health as fair or poor in improving their self-perceived health as indicator of reducing health inequalities.</p><p id="Par20">Secondarily, we will assess the effectiveness of the intervention in the improvement of self-management, health literacy and social capital (i.e., social support and social participation), health-related quality of life, loneliness, depressive symptoms and psychological well-being. In addition, the effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed on specific subgroups: women, oldest people, and people with lowest educational and socioeconomic levels. Finally, we aim to identify profiles of participants according to their patterns of health behaviours, health literacy&#x000a0;and social capital, considering gender, educational and socioeconomic level and contextual factors, and we will explore whether and how these profiles respond to the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par21">To achieve these objectives, a pragmatic multicentre, parallel, randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be carried out. The study protocol adheres to the SPIRIT recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The trial will be implemented in 16 primary health care centres (PCC) from six urban areas. We have prioritized neighbourhoods with low-socioeconomic levels with established community programmes to reduce health inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par22">Participants are eligible if: they are community-dwelling aged 60&#x000a0;years or above and perceive their health as fair or poor. Screening on self-rated health will be performed through the first item of the&#x000a0;SF-36 questionnaire: &#x0201c;In general, would you say your health is: (1) Excellent, (2) Very Good, (3) Good, (4) Fair or (5) Poor&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par23">Participants will be excluded if: they need help to go to the PCC; have cognitive impairment or diagnosed dementia; have a medical condition that contraindicates physical activity; have any severe mental health problem that hinders participation in a group dynamic; have an end-of-life situation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par24">PCC of the prioritized neighbourhoods are contacted to offer their involvement in the programme. The research team will inform the whole team about the background, the aims of the study, eligibility criteria and the recruitment strategy.</p><p id="Par25">Professionals from PCC will be selected on a voluntary basis to collaborate as outcome assessors or observers of the intervention. Each PCC is committed to recruit 30 participants. Professionals can identify potential participants in routine visits or actively calling known patients that might fulfil eligibility criteria. As additional recruitment strategies, posters and videos are&#x000a0;displayed in the PCC advertising the study. A professional from the PCC will explain the trial to interested patients and screen for the eligibility criteria. Those participants who fulfil the criteria and agree to participate will be given the information sheet about the study and the informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p id="Par26">Participants who sign the informed consent will be scheduled for the baseline assessment. Once the participant has been included in the study, assigned an identification code, and has completed the study baseline assessment, the participant will be randomised to one of the two study groups: intervention and control group (fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Concealed randomisation will be conducted centrally at FSiE-UAB, using a computer-based random-block randomisation scheme, stratified by PCC. In each PCC, one experimental group and one control group will be set up. Participants and professionals conducting the group-based intervention will remain unblinded, likewise participants can easily reveal their group allocation and thus blinding outcome assessors would be hard to sustain.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial Consort flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2018_5219_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Experimental group</title><p id="Par27">The intervention is a community program with multiple components, thus a complex intervention.

Using photos of daily activities related to self-care, participants share judgements, views and ideas about self-care. Participants are invited to bring a personal object from home in the next session to introduce themselves. At the end of each session, participants create cooperatively a board with paintings, handcrafts, small writings and thoughts, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Physical activity</td><td>Participants explain briefly to the group the personal object brought from home. Participants set and share a specific goal related with their daily life to be fulfilled during the week. Using local maps, participants identify and share physical activity assets, discuss about benefits and limitations of doing physical activity and agree on&#x000a0;a group walk in the neighbourhood for the next session.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>First local trip</td><td>The group does a round walk starting and ending at the primary care centre visiting interesting places where to do physical activity, e.g., parks or outdoor gyms.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Emotional health</td><td>Participants share the fulfilment of their personal goal. If they do not succeed, the instructor carries out a problem solving technique (each session until the end of the programme, excepting the local trips). The group discusses and shares strategies to cope with emotions and feelings. A relaxation technique practice is carried out.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Healthy eating habits</td><td>Participants share their nutritional habits and tips to eat cheaper and healthier. The group shares and discusses about the places in the neighbourhood where they normally buy. Participants agree upon the market or the supermarket to visit in the next session.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Second local trip</td><td>The group visits a local market or supermarket. During the visit, participants share and discuss about their habits and preferences when buying. The instructor and the observers give advice about nutritional facts and reading labels.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Loneliness and social relationships</td><td>Using a variety of photos, participants share their thoughts and perceptions about loneliness and social relationships.

The conceptual framework of the intervention is described in fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Conceptual framework of the intervention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2018_5219_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par29">The intervention methodology will be participatory with the purpose to promote the empowerment among participants. Group dynamics are designed to promote mutual knowledge and support, trust among participants, exchange of personal experiences among peers and the acquisition of new knowledge related to health literacy and self-management in order&#x000a0;to lead to behavioural changes in their daily life that are meaningful for them and that positively affect their health and wellbeing. Health and social care professionals (five nurses, two social workers and two general practitioners) with experience working in the PCC will be previously trained as group facilitators by the research team during a two-day workshop. The training is based on how to apply the intervention guide.</p><p id="Par30">The intervention consists in 12 sessions that are held weekly for 2 h and facilitated in groups of 12 to-15 people. The programme will be delivered in publicly funded PCC and in different locations of the neighbourhood. Specifically, nine of the 12 sessions will be delivered in the centre, and three sessions consist on local trips and are delivered in: a public space where to practice physical activity (park or pedestrian paths), a supermarket or a market and a community asset that offers social activities that can be of interest to the participants.</p><p id="Par31">The intervention guide sets up a frame for the facilitators to conduct the group dynamics following common principles&#x000a0;specified in a decalogue and an homogenous structure, while considering participants&#x02019; experiences, values and expectations. For example, several activities conducted as a group are highly personalized such as goal setting to change a daily habit to feel better, bringing personal belongings to introduce themselves and making an imaginary gift to another participant. Within the participatory approach, the locations of the three local trips are chosen and agreed by the group based on previous sign posting and mapping of local community assets, thus allowing a tailoring to specific interests and preferences of each group, as well as&#x000a0;to the local context.</p><p id="Par32">One or two health or social care professionals from the PCC will be observers of the intervention. They will complete an observation log including quantitative and qualitative measures of implementation such as fidelity and adherence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Control group</title><p id="Par33">During the study, the participants from the waiting-list control group will receive the usual publicly funded universal healthcare services available to all population.

Qualitative procedures will comprise: participant observation of a variety of sessions, focus groups with the participants of all intervention groups at the end of the programme, interviews with a purposeful sample of participants with different profiles and follow-up and closing meetings with each team of professionals in charge of facilitate and observe the sessions.

The study protocol is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> with the reference number: NCT02733523. Participation is voluntary and all participants will be asked to sign informed consent before the start of the study. At the end of the study, control group participants will be offered the intervention.</p><p id="Par50">One of the tangible products of the study is the intervention guide that facilitates the replication and design of similar interventions, and it can be adapted to different contexts. Each centre can use the data subset from its own centre in order to make secondary analysis. Once the main outcomes of the study are published, data access will be open to other researchers who may be interested.</p><p id="Par51">The AEQUALIS study considers dimensions of participation, public involvement, ethics, gender equality, scientific education and open access included in the framework of Responsible Research and Innovation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The research team will work in collaboration with an advisory committee integrated by three older women with expertise in primary care, adult education and ageing. This committee will be involved in the development of the intervention guide as well as the participant observation of its implementation. As an inequality axis, gender will be considered through all the implementation steps of the research. Although the intervention will be implemented to secure the participation of men -as they are frequently less involved in health promotion and group activities-, a major participation of women will help us to respond to the challenge of the high prevalence of older women living alone -often widows- with a poor self-perceived health and feelings of loneliness and having few opportunities to establish support ties and social networks. Data analysis will be done with men and women subgroups in order to identify possible gender differences in impacts. The research team will contact secondary education schools with the aim of making project disclosure, sensitize about health inequalities, facilitate intergenerational relationships and promote scientific education on ageing research. All publications of the project will be open access.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par52">This study provides a protocol for a multicentre pragmatic randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of an intervention designed to promote self-management, health literacy and social capital in order to improve self-perceived health in older adults living in urban disadvantaged areas.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><p id="Par54">To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the few randomized clinical trials conducted in European cities to tackle health inequalities under a community approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It is based on a complex intervention focused on three pillars (health literacy, self-management and social capital) as potential modifiers of the influence of social determinants on health. It will test its effectiveness on increasing self-rated health in a pragmatic trial, i.e., close to the everyday practice.</p><p id="Par55">Participants and professionals conducting the group-based intervention remain unblinded, likewise blinding outcome assessors is hard to sustain due to the type of intervention. The intervention protocol is standardised in detail, including how to tailor the activities and make them participatory. In addition, the study includes a rigorous facilitator training and mentoring, which enhance the internal validity of the AEQUALIS trial.</p><p id="Par56">This trial includes a process evaluation framed within the MRC guidance to assess how implementation, context and mechanisms of impact affect the outcomes. Accordingly, findings are likely to inform specific health care practices to reduce intermediate factors towards health inequalities, and thus results might&#x000a0;be relevant clinically and from a public health perspective and useful for primary health care.</p><p id="Par57">The study will provide evidence on how to implement an intervention tailored to needs and local contexts of older people living in vulnerable situations. The high capacity of tailoring the intervention to the participants and to the local context should allow the programme to be transferred to other contexts. Furthermore, qualitative methodology will help to explore how individual health and social trajectories are linked with inequalities and will provide a better understanding of values, attitudes and personal expectations on self-management, as well as health behaviours of older people in a context of social vulnerability.</p><p id="Par58">The project will promote the implementation of evidence-based intervention procedures in future health policy strategies targeting older people while considering the social aspects of inequality. Indeed, at regional level, the project is aligned with the aim set out in the Catalan Health Plan 2016&#x02013;2020 on reducing social inequalities measured as an increase of self-perceived health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The results will provide an evidence base to set recommendations addressed to the older population, primary health care professionals and policy makers.</p><p id="Par60">Finally, this project can be used as a model for its biopsychosocial perspective of health with an emphasis on salutogenesis, as a source of wellbeing and good health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par61">The initial phases of this project started in March 2015.
