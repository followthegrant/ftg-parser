As physical activity is an important component in weight control and also associated with other major health benefits,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] its role in youth health is fundamental. Studies have shown a significant correlation between high physical fitness and a low body fat.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] Physical activity measured as number of steps per day was inversely correlated to percentage body fat as well as to Body Mass Index (BMI) in adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] However in children, no such correlation was observed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] It is therefore difficult to know whether inactivity causes obesity or obesity leads to inactivity. Guidelines for physical activity levels in children and adolescents recommend at least 60 minutes of accumulated moderate to vigorous physical activity per day.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] There are several difficulties to measure the total daily accumulate physical activity in the field studies for each subject. Many other factors besides individual level of daily physical activity for a healthy lifestyle are cultural, social, and personal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] Physical activity intervention had no effect on BMI in children.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] Data on the inter-relationship between BMI and physical activity are limited. A clear understanding of the effect of physical activity on BMI is lacking. The present study was undertaken to assess the influence of physical activity on maintaining normal grades of BMI and body fat percent among North Indian population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>Health camp for monitoring of body composition was organized for public by our institution. One thousand two hundred and thirty six urban male visitors volunteered for the study. We have categorized the volunteers participated in the study into two groups: (a) volunteers performing any one form of physical activity and (b) volunteers not doing any physical activity.</p><p>Inclusion criteria for volunteers doing physical activity: volunteers should perform yoga exercises or weight-reduction exercises or walking during morning or evening at least three days a week in addition to daily physical activities. Exclusion criteria of volunteers: volunteers with major health complaints like cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, etc. Control population was screened on the basis of not doing any physical activity or exercise (inclusion criteria) other than daily physical activities with no major health problems.</p><p>A questionnaire was developed for the study based on International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ - English version) which has undergone reliability and validity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] A pilot study was conducted on 50 volunteers with age group, sex, and occupation similar to study group. This was done to gather data for the reliability and validity of the questions in the questionnaire. The pilot study was able to find out which version of the question resulted in more reliable results. The pilot study also enabled to solicit reactions from respondents on the questionnaire length and parts of questionnaire which respondents felt difficulties in. Substantial revisions were made in the questionnaire based on the pilot study. The questionnaire was filled by the investigator. The selection of volunteers with or without physical activity was determined based on the questionnaire.</p><p>Out of total volunteers participated in body composition monitoring, 469 visitors were performing any one form of physical activity and 767 (controls) were not doing any physical activity with similar age group and socioeconomic status. The measurements (height, weight, body fat percent) were taken before lunch and about two hours after light breakfast to avoid diurnal variation of water content in the body. The experimental work of the study was approved by institutional human ethical committee.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sampling methods</title><p>We used stratified random sampling method for the selection of subjects in three strata among volunteers &#x02013; school teachers, employees from public sector undertakings, and employees from private sector undertakings. The sample size was calculated considering the overweight prevalence of approximately 10%with precision of 0.025 and 95% confidence limit. It was doubled to minimize the sampling design affect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessments</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Body mass index</title><p>Height and weight were recorded for each participant to determine their BMI. Height was measured on a tape attached to a wall and rounded down to nearest centimeter. Weight was measured on a body fat monitor HBF 352 (Omron Co., Ltd, Japan) and rounded up to nearest kilogram. Cut-off points according to WHO[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] were used to define the prevalence of overweight.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Body fat percent</title><p>Body fat was analyzed with Bioelectric Impedance (BI) method. An Omron HBF 352 body fat monitor (Omron Co., Ltd, Japan) was used. BI method was considered reliable and valid to measure resistance in biological tissue.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] A weak electric current is passed between two electrodes placed on different parts of the body and measures the level of resistance in different segments of the body. Body fat percentage was calculated based on the height, age, gender, bodyweight, and electric resistance of the body. Volunteer should stand upright with stretched arms parallel to the floor and the hands gripped for contact to the instruments measuring area. Body fat in percent was calculated using the manufacturers&#x02019; equation and digital display was recorded by the investigator on the proforma. Grading of body fat percentage was done based on the earlier reference.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Definitions</title><p>According to WHO classification (2004), BMI standard were as follows: &#x0003c; 18.5 is underweight, 18.5&#x02013;24.9 Kg/m<sup>2</sup> is normal, and 25&#x02013;29.9 Kg/m<sup>2</sup> is overweight. Grading of body fat percentage was as follows: &#x0003c; 10% as low, 10&#x02013;25% as normal (20&#x02013;25% being border line group was also accommodated as normal for statistical convenience), and 25&#x02013;30% as high.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance of mean values of physical characteristics (age, height, and weight), in two categories was analyzed using student&#x02019;s &#x02018;<italic>t</italic>&#x02019; test for each parameter separately.

A high prevalence of overweight (44.7%) and high body fat percent (48.7%) was observed in nonphysical activity performers compared to physical activity performers in the study. Twenty three point four percent of volunteers had &#x0003c;10% body fat among physical activity performers compared to nonphysical activity performers. Also, the relative risk of overweight and high body fat percent was lower among volunteers doing physical activity than nonphysical activity performers. These observations suggest that physical activity alone cannot maintain BMI and body fat percent, but it can reduce the risk of overweight and high body fat percent in the population. Our study supports the World Health Organization[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] report on preventing and managing the global epidemic of obesity and National Institute of health (NIH) report on the identification, evaluation, and treatment of overweight and obesity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>] Earlier study by our group has shown that socio-economic status affect body mass index in North Indian adult population[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref>] These reports show that increased physical activity is important in efforts to lose weight because it increases energy expenditure and plays an integral role in weight maintenance. In addition, increased physical activity may help to reduce body fat and prevent the risk of heart disease.</p><p>The variation in duration and frequency of physical activity performance among volunteers was a major limitation of the study. Smoking in 16.8% and alcohol consumption in 15.1% of physical activity performers in the study may have attributed for their overweight and high body fat percent. Overall, the trends in the study show that physical activity alone cannot maintain BMI and body fat percent.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="CIT1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Welk</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Blair</surname><given-names>SN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Physical activity protects against the health risk of obesity</article-title><source>PCPFS Res Dig</source><year>2000</year><volume>312</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>9</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.
